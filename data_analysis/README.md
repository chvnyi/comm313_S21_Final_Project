## Data analysis notebooks for COMM313 Final Project

* This folder contains a series of Jupyter notebooks created to do the data analysis.

* `LN_data_exploration1` - contains initial data exploration: word frequency lists and contains the list of words of interest for further analysis

* `LN_data_exploration2` - contains the KWIC analyses for a select portion of the words from `LN_data_exploration1`: bartiromo, china, government, control, freedom, communist, but, influence, concerns, huawei, vs

* `LN_data_exploration2(1)` - contains the second half/additional KWIC analyses of words I wanted to explore: tiktok, beijing, propaganda, orwellian, reality, regime 

**NOTE**: KWIC analyses are ran on random samples, so simply rerunning the kernel has changed the exact sentences displayed for each word, so certain observations that quote direct sentences may not be shown in the cell output. However, I guarantee that they exist within the dataset(s).

* `LN_data_exploration3` - contains the collocations for a select few: china, government, control, communist, regime, influence, concerns, freedom, huawei, apple, tiktok

* `LN_data_exploration4` - contains the keyness analyses for 2017 + 2018 vs 2020 + 2021 and 2017 vs 2020

* `LN_data_exploration999` - contains the code for bigram and trigram frequencies; however, the kernel keeps crashing, so I haven't been able to successfully run the entire notebook

* `LN_cleaning` - contains the steps for cleaning and organizing all of my Lexis Nexis data

* `functions` - contains additional functions to aid with analyses
