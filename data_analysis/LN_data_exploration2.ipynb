However, this is not unexpected since this one of my most common and broader terms within the dataset (there are 61,399 instances of 'china').

    "    * Additional samples also display clear mentions of China's government as \"weak\", \"stringent\", and \"communist\" also appear. \n",
    "* Based on my first analysis, it was noted that there didn't seem to be any outward feelings of negativity towards Chinese people, but it's much easier for news media to criticize the Chinese government instead. For starters, this seems to be a better alternative and not harmful. Yet, the jump from criticizing the government to the people isn't very far; even if it isn't a conscious connection, negative assumptions about the government will lead to negative assumptions about the people. In history, there are several examples of this broad categorization with the most relevant one in ASAM history being the reason America established internment camps for Japanese Americans."

    "* Unlike the rest of the words in this analysis, the context for 'control' is more obviously negative. Whether it's criticizing government practices (\"a wider government move to tighten control over freedom of expression said human\", \"pathology of the chinese government to control the narratives of the country both\", \"a wider government move to tighten control over freedom of expression said human\") or internet policies (\"theres no doubt about it their control over the internet is going to\", \"over the domestic internet and closely control what information may be accessed by\", \"heralding a new era of state control over the mobile web starting on\"), the random sample seems to serve the main purpose of inciting fear and perpetuating the image of a tight/restrictive communist regime. \n",
    "* While seemingly innocent, stories of \"controlling\" governments and instances of a \"lack of freedom\" especially resonate with American readers who are very sensitive to and passionate about protecting their rights. The choice to use \"freedom\" is deliberate and intentional. This directly fuels the belief that the West is \"superior\" to the \"inferior, less progressive\" East who needs the help of the West to liberate them with the knowledge of the \"real news\" instead of the communist propaganda the Chinese government has been feeding them. But every country provides propaganda. It just happens to be that this narrative of China as a \"threat\" is more widespread (even outside of the States) and constantly in our faces that people accept it as fact. After all, everyone is saying the same thing, so shouldn't the information be true?"
