CHINA 'FIRES' EDITORS OVER CRITICISM OF MAO, DETAINS LEFTIST ACTIVISTStates News ServiceDecember 28, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 942 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Chinese authorities have reportedly imposed punishments on two journalists in recent days who questioned Mao Zedong's officially sanctioned reputation on social media, while detaining an outspoken leftist intellectual who thought Mao's vision for a communist utopia should never have been abandoned.Xiao Peng, a former journalist for the Beijing News, had his professional license taken away after he posted to his WeChat friends circle questioning the late supreme leader's "greatness," according to a leftist academic."How can we call him great? He was personally responsible for wreaking havoc and causing countless deaths," Xiao wrote. "When he died, everyone in China was finally able to get enough to eat.""This is your great man? A violent, evil dictator. It's kind of scary how many Mao fans I am seeing in my friends group," he wrote.Xiao's comments were quickly picked up by Wu Danhong, a leftist scholar who uses the pen-name Wu Fatian, who announced on the Twitter-like platform Sina Weibo that Xiao's license to practice journalism had been taken away, and that he is now "being dealt with by his work unit, which is investigating."Xiao's website "Beijing Time," a joint venture with the Beijing municipal state broadcast, the Beijing New Media Corp and Qihoo 360, made no mention of the sanction against him, however.Calls to Beijing Time's parent company rang unanswered during office hours on Wednesday.The sanctions against Xiao come as China's rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC), is considering criminalizing anyone deemed to have smeared the "reputation and honor" of the ruling Chinese Communist Party's canon of heroes and martyrs.The Communist Party already retaliates harshly against anyone abusing late supreme leader Mao Zedong or his image, as this is held to represent an attack on the founding supreme leader of the People's Republic.It also recently passed laws banning the "desecration or insults" to the national flag and other symbols of the Chinese state.Three protestersYu Dongyue, Yu Zhijian, and Lu Dechengwho helped splatter Mao's portrait with red paint during the 1989 Tiananmen pro-democracy movement all served lengthy prison sentences during which they were subjected to torture and ill treatment.In August 2015, Bi Fujian, a popular TV host for China's state-run broadcaster CCTV lost his job after a private joke at the expense of late supreme leader Mao Zedong that was leaked online.The ousted former editor of Baixing magazine, Huang Liangtian, said the reports that Xiao has had his license revoked are in keeping with the treatment meted out to Bi."If this is confirmed, that he gets fired or something similar ... then the party leaders in his company will likely also get punished," Huang said. "But if he is a genuine freelance, then they'll just get rid of him; it won't be a question of formally firing him."Microblog tweetMeanwhile, authorities in the central province of Henan are probing an officially backed microblog account run by the provincial party committee's civilization office after it posted an "on this day in history" tweet marking the beginning of the end of the former Soviet Union in 1991."This may seem trivial to some, but the collapse of a large, utopian empire is worthy of remembrance," the tweet said.An official microblog account for the European edition of Communist Party mouthpiece the People's Daily hit out at the tweet, saying: "Where'd that come from?"The Henan account deleted the tweet and issued an apology on the same day, saying that the incident had been "harshly dealt with by the provincial party propaganda department," and that the duty editor for the microblog account had been fired.Beijing-based constitutional scholar Chen Yongmiao said plenty of people still criticize Mao Zedong online, but high-profile, officially sanctioned opinion-makers aren't supposed to join in."Officials are basically not allowed to comment on Mao or the collapse of the former Soviet Union," Chen said."A lot of people insult Mao, a huge number, while those who praise him are in a very small minority," he said. "But they are more marginalized.""There is no way that the authorities are going to tolerate criticism coming from within the system, from civil servants," he said.Symbol of resistanceHowever, the government is also wary of anyone using Mao as a potential symbol of resistance against the current administration.Authorities in the southern province of Guangdong last month detained an outspoken intellectual, Zhang Yunfan, on charges of "organizing mass gatherings that disturbed social order," prompting a petition from fellow academics for his release.Zhang was detained after running a group discussion at a local university on the authorities' response to leftist speech.U.S.-based China scholar Xie Xuanjun said the administration of President Xi Jinping is just as intolerant of dissent from the left as from other quarters."This is because there are signs of social instability in the lowest echelons of society, for example, unrest among China's low-income population," Xie said, in a reference to low-income migrant workers who have recently been evicted en masse from rented accommodation in Beijing."The Chinese government is trying to deal with this 'low-end population,' so now anyone on the left is potentially dangerous, because the low-income population has the potential to be a rallying point [for political opposition]," he said.Reported by Hai Nan for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Xi Wang for the Mandarin Service.

Google is opening an artificial intelligence center in ChinaCNNMoney.comDecember 12, 2017 Tuesday 6:11 AM ESTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHNOLOGYLength: 441 wordsByline: Sherisse PhamBodyDespite many of its services being blocked in China, Google has chosen Beijing as the location for its first artificial intelligence research center in Asia."The science of AI has no borders, neither do its benefits," Fei-Fei Li, chief scientist at Google's AI business, said in a blog post Wednesday announcing the new center.But China's internet borders are fortified by the so-called Great Firewall, and most of Google's biggest products -- its search engine, YouTube and Gmail -- have been blocked by the country's vast censorship apparatus for years.Google effectively left China in 2010, but the country's 730 million internet users make it too large a market to ignore. The company has made no secret of its desire to find ways to rebuild its presence there.Its artificial intelligence unit DeepMind teamed up with Chinese authorities to hold a five-day festival in the country earlier this year. The event focused on a human-versus-computer showdown in the ancient game of Go.Opening a high profile AI research center in China is the latest move in Google's charm offensive.It comes just months after Beijing set out its ambitions for the rapidly developing technology, announcing plans to build a domestic artificial intelligence industry worth nearly $150 billion in the coming years.China wants to become a superpower in an industry that's expected to significantly shape the future of the human race.Russian President Vladimir Putin predicted in September that whoever becomes the leader in artificial intelligence "will become the ruler of the world."Google's new center will help China pursue its aim to become the global leader. The facility will employ a team of researchers who will be supported by engineers the company already has in China."Besides publishing its own work, the Google AI China Center will also support the AI research community by funding and sponsoring AI conferences and workshops, and working closely with the vibrant Chinese AI research community," Li said.But Google could find itself in tricky situations.The Chinese government is aggressively using artificial intelligence for surveillance of its citizens, raising concerns among human rights groups.China has also been accused by the U.S. government, business groups and think tanks of trying to take short cuts in the development of its domestic industries by forcing foreign companies to hand over their intellectual property.Beijing has disputed the allegations.Google said it already had people in China working on some of its top global products, and that it wouldn't be adding new research capacity in the country if it were worried about IP theft.Load-Date: December 14, 2017End of Document

DOJ Charges Three Chinese Nationals In Hacking Targeting CorporationsThe FrontrunnerNovember 28, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 352 wordsBodyThe AP (11/27) reports that a Federal indictment unsealed Monday in Pittsburgh accused three Chinese national of "operating a cybersecurity firm that used phishing scams and malware to steal data from international corporations." The indictment "says the trio's targets included Siemens AG, Moody's Analytics in New York and Trimble Inc. in Sunnyvale, California." The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (11/27, Ove, 374K) reports that an investigation "by a team of agents led by the Pittsburgh FBI revealed that starting in 2011, the Chinese conspirators and others exploited vulnerabilities in computer systems or used malware to hack into corporate computers."CNN (11/27, Perez, 34.45M) reports that the three are "presumed to live in China and are either employed or associated with Guangzhou Bo Yu Information Technology Co., known as Boyusec, court documents say. US intelligence and private cybersecurity experts say Boyusec works as a contractor for the Chinese ministry of state security, that nation's version of the National Security Agency." However, the Administration "is stopping short of publicly confronting the Chinese government about its role in the breach."Reuters (11/27, Keppler, Freifeld, Walcott) reports that Soo C. Song, the acting US attorney for Western Pennsylvania, "said arrest warrants had been issued for the three men, but the case was not being prosecuted as state-sponsored hacking." However, Reuters adds that the DOJ's National Security Division "participated in the case, according to the indictment." McClatchy (11/27, Johnson, 59K) reports that the DOJ "may want to avoid provoking China with a direct accusation, said Priscilla Moriuchi, director of strategic threat development for the Somerville, Mass., company and a veteran of the US intelligence community."The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review (11/27, Aupperlee, 243K) reports that Song said, "Prosecutions and indictments are powerful tools in our arsenal to stop conduct. Whether a defendant is in China, Russia, Nigeria, we follow the evidence. We identify the actor behind the computer screen, and we bring the criminal charge."Load-Date: November 28, 2017End of Document

US Sets Import Duty On Chinese Aluminum FoilThe FrontrunnerAugust 9, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 207 wordsBodyThe Washington Times (8/8, Miller, 458K) reports the US, after determining that China has been "dumping" aluminum foil, set a duty of 16.56 percent to 80.97 percent on the product. Commerce Secretary Wilbur L. Ross Jr., in announcing the duty, said, "The Trump administration will not stand idly by as harmful trade practices from foreign nations attempt to take advantage of our essential industries, workers and businesses." Heidi Brock, president and CEO of The Aluminum Association, praised the decision, saying, "This is an important step to begin restoring a level playing field for U.S. aluminum foil production."US Tech Companies Accept Chinese Terms For Operating In China.The Wall Street Journal (8/8, Browne, Subscription Publication, 6.99M) reports that while the Trump Administration and Congress is upset about China's efforts to compel technology transfer from US companies, those very companies seem not to be upset or unwilling to say so. The Journal identifies Apple, Qualcomm, Intel, and AMD as all contributing to Chinese efforts to surpass the US technologically. It also says that Google and Facebook are seeking to enter the Chinese market, and if they are allowed in, they will have to accept Chinese government censorship.Load-Date: August 9, 2017End of Document

CHINA: THE NEW LEADING VOICE ON CLIMATE CHANGE?States News ServiceAugust 17, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 916 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF):By: Scott Wood and Xixi Chen This is the first of a three-part blog series covering corporate sustainability in China. Experts from EDF Climate Corps examine how businesses are shifting the ways they approach energy management in response to increasing climate commitments.This past June, 197 countries reaffirmed their commitments to reduce GHG emissions in an effort to curb global climate change. The U.S. was not one of them. This decision, a major backpedal for America, made room for a new frontrunner to take the reins on global climate leadership. And that's exactly what has happened.After President Trump backed away, China, the largest GHG emitter and coal consumer, recommitted to forge ahead with the Paris agreement. The nation recognizes climate change as a major challenge faced by all mankind and a threat to national security, which is why Beijing has deemed the Paris agreement its "highest political commitment". China's participation in any international agreement on climate is not only critical, it's an opportunity to dominate the clean energy sector and inspire others to take action.Manager, EDF Climate CorpsHere are three ways China is positioning itself to meet its targets (America, take note):1. Enforce goals at every policy level.China has set aggressive targets aimed at reducing the nation's greenhouse gases that are supported and enforced by climate policies at the international, national and local level. This alignment allows for greater consistency and cooperation between the private and public sectors, enabling greater efficiency in working towards these common goals.At the international level, China reaffirmed its promise to meet the commitments (working closely alongside the EU) outlined in the Paris agreement, including peaking CO2 emissions by 2030. Domestically, China has both short-and long-term plans to help ensure their energy goals are met. The Strategic National Energy Plan was completed this past April and China is on track to achieve its energy goals outlined in the 13th Five-year plan.At the local level, cities have their own carbon-cutting plans. Shenzhen, one of China's manufacturing hubs, aims to peak the city's carbon emissions by 2022eight years ahead of the national target. Companies, too, are ramping up their efforts. For the past two years, EDF Climate Corps has placed four fellows in IKEA's Shenzhen offices to help meet these targets by focusing on increasing the sustainability of the company's supply chain (Stay tuned for more on this kind of corporate engagement in the next post of this series).2. Invest in clean energy.China continues to expand its dominance in renewable energy. Recently, they committed to investing $360 billion in clean energy development. According to China's National Energy Administration, renewable energy already employs 3.5 million people in China (compared with less than a million in the US) and this new investment is expected to create 13 million more jobs in the renewable energy sector by 2020. That's enormous growth.The private sector is tapping into this market as well. Chinese companies already dominate among the most profitable clean energy companies in the world with 35% of the top 200 publicly traded corporations earning significant revenue from renewable energy being Chinese. Simply put, in China, clean energy is viewed as smart business and smart economics.China takes the lead on climate change action w/ plans to invest $360bil in clean energy development. Where's theClick To TweetPowered By CoScheduleManager, EDF+Business3. Use a multi-faceted approach:China is coming at climate change from all angles. In addition to the policy mechanisms and promotion of clean energy mentioned above, China is securing long-term investment and sustained financing to encourage innovation and the adoption of new technologies. For example, this year China launched five pilot zones to promote "Green Finance", a vehicle aimed at raising funds for pollution clean-up.Also this year, President Xi Jinping pledged to launch the world's largest national carbon market; a decision EDF played an important role in by providing the Chinese government with critical technical support and consultation. The market will hasten the transition to a low-carbon economy and send a message to the world that China is serious about finding solutions. Additionally, this presents an enormous opportunity for the private sector to curb emissions. Companies are incentivized to innovate and reduce their emissions, selling excess allowances and opening up new revenue streams.The road forward for ChinaThe momentum we're seeing in China is in sharp contrast to Trump's America. It's this strong leadership and creativity that is needed to address GHG emissions within China. And it sets an example for others to follow. Delivering on its many commitments and aspirations won't be easy, but for China to declare them as necessary is a big step in the right directionone that has the potential to create massive positive change.In our next blog post, we'll take a closer look into how companies are already making and delivering on plans to do their part in helping China achieve its climate commitments.Follow Scott and Xixi on Twitter, @ scottwood_, @Talk2XixiStay on top of the latest facts, information and resources aimed at the intersection of business and the environment.

Japan is preparing for evacuations out of South Korea.Checking the global market action this morning, tensions are rising and the markets are dropping. The Dow Industrials now at the lows of the morning expected to open down about 70 points on the Dow, about 13 points lower on the Nasdaq, S&P 50 down a third of a percent right now.In Europe stocks are really around the flat line. They had been higher earlier in the morning but the weakness on Wall Street is causing declines to accelerate in Europe. The DAX index is positive. It's up almost one- half of 1 percent right now.And in Asia overnight, mixed performances to report, take a look. Worst performer was Japan, Nikkei average down two-thirds of 1 percent.And now Hurricane Irma bearing down on the Caribbean and likely heading to Florida this morning. We have the very latest as the storm's path continues this morning.Helping Harvey victims meanwhile, Congress has a new item on the agenda -- passing legislation to fund Harvey relief. The vote set for tomorrow and we've got the latest.Plus a major security change at one U.S. airport. People without tickets will now be able to go past security. That's the first that that's happened in the post 9/11 eras. The details on why, coming up.And career change for Super Mario, the video game icon, no longer a plumber. What he's doing now and why it's causing such debate -- coming up.All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to talk all about it political analyst Kirsten Haglund is here; the "Wall Street Journal's" global economics editor, Jon Hilsenrath is here; and the King's College of Manhattan business program chairman Brian Brenberg joins us. Great to see you.JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, "WALL STREET JOURNAL": Good morning. Good to be here.BARTIROMO: Good to see everybody back after the summer. And now we've got a lot on the agenda. Just a couple of days left, Jon Hilsenrath, for the House and Senate to get some serious legislation.HILSENRATH: Right, one of the things that I'm going to be looking for is whether this Harvey relief bill that's coming up could be coming up as soon as tomorrow has a debt dealing extension attached to it. Because that will defuse a lot of anxiety in the markets if they can get these worries about the debt ceiling out of the way.BARTIROMO: Right. Because then the worry about a government shutdown goes away, at least until -- until December?KIRSTEN HAGLUND, POLITICAL ANALYST: Right.HILSENRATH: Well, it depends on how far they extend it.BARTIROMO: Yes.HILSENRATH: Yes. But there's a lot of talk about them attaching some of this to Harvey and then getting that stuff out of the way and then moving on to the heavy-lifting of doing tax reform.BARTIROMO: And then there's North Korea.We've got a lot to talk about this morning when House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy joins. Join me for that special interview coming up.Also joining the conversation this morning, the former president of Shell Oil, John Hofmeister is here. Plus the chairman and CEO of Allstate -- the Allstate Corporation Tom Wilson is going to take us to the insurance end of this. A lot to come -- big show ahead. So don't miss a moment of it.And we kick it off right now with our top story this hour. And that is North Korea reportedly moving an intercontinental ballistic missile towards the west coast. This coming just two days after the country conducted its sixth nuclear weapon's test to date, this time reportedly a hydrogen bomb.Secretary of Defense James Mattis says the U.S. is prepared to deal with the Hermit Kingdom entirely. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAMES MATTIS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: We have the ability to defend ourselves and our allies, South Korea and Japan from any attack and our commitments among the allies are ironclad. We are not looking to the total annihilation of the country namely North Korea. But as I said, we have many options to do so.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me now is the Acton Institute director of programs and former foreign policy adviser under President George W. Bush, Paul Bonicelli. Paul -- good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.PAUL BONICELLI, DIRECTOR OF PROGRAMS, ACTON INSTITUTE: Good morning.BARTIROMO: What do you make of this aggression from North Korea? You just heard what Secretary Mattis said -- we are not looking for the total annihilation of North Korea but we can do it -- basically is what he said. Is this not getting communicated to Kim Jong-Un?BONICELLI: I think it is. But right now Kim Jong-Un knows that the Chinese are not prepared to do anything to change his behavior. And that is the age-old problem of diplomacy. You have two countries, the United States and China, our interests are not in line and it's the job of this President to make China change its interest or understand that its pursuit of an interest where North Korea remains tormenting the United States is ultimately not going to be in their interest.Whether that means a huge trade war, whether that means just the pressure of Japan and South Korea becoming nuclear states themselves, but it really is crunch time.I appreciate what Nikki Haley does, but whatever the United Nations does is not going to change anything. This is between China and the United States and the United States getting China to understand it is not in their interest to continue what the past 30 years have been.HAGLUND: Paul -- Kirsten Haglund, here. Of course, we have seen dialogue come out both the President and others in the administration recently about a potential -- what would effectively be a trade embargo on anyone who does business with North Korea.You mentioned that we need to make China see that this is in their best interest for something to happen with North Korea, something to change. What's your view on these twitterings of potential embargoes? Is that the kind of strength that we need to actually make some change?BONICELLI: I think that what the Chinese government should understand is that the President of the United States is willing to hurt them seriously economically, which of course, there's pain for us as well but there's always much greater pain for a country like China not just economically but politically.Xi Jinping is trying to establish himself as Mao Tse-Tung. He's trying to be the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao. And he's on the way to do that. He doesn't want any disruptions.So now is the time for the President of the United States, and the window is short, to make it as painful as possible about what the future will be if he doesn't help us change the direction of the North Korean regime.And I think the United States is able to withstand the threat of trade war and in fact the actual beginnings of one if the President of the United States insists upon that. Because it's either that or we face nuclear blackmail for good.And I would add one other thing. China should not think that North Korea with nuclear weapons is never a threat to China. A dictator like Kim Jong- Un will see the benefit of being a threat to every one in the region if he has nuclear weapons he can use at will.BRIAN BRENBERG, BUSINESS PROGRAM CHAIRMAN, KING'S COLLEGE OF MANHATTAN: Paul -- we are talking about getting much tougher with China, stay on enterprises with banks. But obviously the reason we haven't done this before -- this isn't a new issue, the reason we haven't done it before is because there is a cost for the U.S. Can you talk a little bit about what Americans should be prepared for if indeed we get as tough economically with China as we are talking about here?BONICELLI: I think a reason we haven't done it before though, Brian, is that we've had feckless diplomacy. We've had naive people in power that convinced presidents who should have known otherwise that we could manage this with pure diplomacy not backed up by force.As to the pain -- yes, I think that if you tell Americans the iPhone will be delayed, it'll take longer, it'll cost more, a lot of that is going to be painful but the polls are clear. Americans are very concerned about Kim Jong-Un having nuclear weapons.And the Chinese have even more reason to be worried about harm to their economy. China is not a stable country. I think you had Gordon Chang on earlier. He has been talking about this for years. China is not in a position to weather a lot of economic hardships. And our government needs to make that clear.Jim Mattis is making that clear on the military side. I hope privately Secretary Tillerson and others are making that clear to the Chinese government.HILSENRATH: You talk about feckless diplomacy. This problem is now in the hands of Donald Trump to deal with. He's going to get the credit or the blame for how this plays out.But isn't this really on previous U.S. Presidents -- President Clinton, frankly President Bush himself, and also President Obama -- for not being tough enough on this regime and not taking hard actions earlier before we got to this point.BONICELLI: I think that's exactly right. I worked for one of those -- George W. Bush whom I honor greatly. But I think he made the same mistake that the other presidents and I think President Obama made it much worse because of the timing to assume that a guy like Kim Jong-Un, before that his father, had any interest in not having the nuclear weapons that he needs to protect himself from everybody around him.Not his own people, he doesn't need nuclear weapons for that, but all those regimes around him. He's the problem. We should not forget. This is a regime that is the problem.BARTIROMO: Yes.BONICELLI: -- and it has always been a problem. And China played a game and now they have a rabid dog that they can't control very well. So it's crunch time.BARTIROMO: Paul -- you make a lot of important points. Stay with us. We want to keep talking about this. And I want to get your take on what happens next.But South Korea as we speak is conducting a second live-fire exercise as Japan is also preparing for evacuations from that country.Fox News senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot is in Seoul this morning with the very latest. Greg -- what can you tell us? Good morning to you.GREG PALKOT, FOX NEWS SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Hi -- Maria.Yes, we have been to Seoul, South Korea numerous times on occasions like this. And frankly, it's a little bit edgier than we've seen in the past. For example a North Korean official just saying that there could be more, quote, "gift packages" coming the way of the United States.One of those gift packages possibly, what reports are saying in the last two days, they've been seeing yet another intercontinental ballistic missile possible being moved to the east coast of North Korea, possibly for yet another launch.No confirmation of that. This as, yes, the South Korean military has been out doing a little bit of saber-rattling. Yesterday we saw ground action; today, at sea, the navy in operations, including a guided missile vessel.All of this, of course, in response to this past weekend's test of a nuclear device by the North Korean regime, by Kim Jong-Un. I talked to one of my closest experts on this, his words, alarming, significant especially if you match that thing to an intercontinental ballistic missile and point it towards the United States. He calls it a city buster.No wonder, again as you have noticed, folks are making plans to get out of this country just in case. Japan reports saying they are going to look at getting their 60,000 citizens out if there are provocations. There's something like 200,000 Americans here including 28,000 U.S. troops. They have practiced that as well.Again, we have been here numerous times, there is a difference this time and one of the big differences, the folks here don't know exactly how the Trump administration will respond to what Kim Jong-Un has been saying and doing.Back to you.BARTIROMO: Yes, Greg -- that's certainly the thing to watch. What will the Trump administration do?Greg -- thank you. Greg Palkot is live this morning in Seoul.Paul Bonicelli is still with us. Your reaction to South Korea this morning -- Paul.BONICELLI: I think South Korea is getting ready and Japan is as well for the day when North Korea stays nuclear. We've not done what we need to do. China has not cooperated. And the United States is going to remove our nonmilitary personnel. We are going to be prepared for whatever comes next.And nuclear weapons will come back to South Korea. And they will come to Japan. There won't be any options for those countries if they face a North Korean regime that's now not going to be curbed in any way.And I wouldn't call it a withdraw of the United States. This is a president, President Trump who's going to say that the United States will not be perpetually on the hook. We will be prepared to defend ourselves but you countries are going to have to do a whole lot more.And this is the message to drive home to China, the very thing you want the least in this world is for Japan and South Korea to have the means to take you out as well. And they will do that if there's not a curbing of North Korea.This is what the crunch time is all about. It is convincing China that the worst thing will happen to them if they don't help us now. The window may be closed already. It may be too late.BARTIROMO: What do you think about --BONICELLI: But I hope the administration is going to try.BARTIROMO: What do you think about Gordon Chang's idea? Gordon Chang, the columnist, was with us earlier this morning. And he said look, the U.S. needs to propose sanctions that will threaten China's banks like the Bank of China?BONICELLI: Absolutely. That is what crunch time means. I know I keep saying that. But either we do these things now, the most dramatic things that will make every body clutch their (inaudible) and say Trump is a warmonger. He needs to ignore all of that because it's either now or never. And if he does those things I believe the Chinese do not want to face those risks.HILSENRATH: Meanwhile, Paul -- the Trump administration is talking about pulling out of the U.S.-South Korea trade deal. Is that a good idea with a key ally in a time of crisis?BONICELLI: I wouldn't do it. I would make it clear that I would deal with this -- I'm a free trader and I never thought that you get free trade with a bunch of bureaucrats writing documents much less if legislators touch them.But that is a minor issue now considering what we are facing and it's never been that big of a trade problem. I mean, I know there's a deficit but it's not big like Mexico or something like that in the past.BARTIROMO: Right.BONICELLI: So I would not do anything other than make that a political statement but worry about it later.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Paul -- great to get your insights this morning. Thanks so much. Paul Bonicelli joining us there.BONICELLI: My pleasure.BARTIROMO: Stick with us. I will talk with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy coming up about North Korea, Harvey funding and tax reform. All coming up this morning at 8:00 a.m. Eastern. So join us for that special interview.Coming up next though, preparing for Irma -- Puerto Rico and Florida have declared states of emergency this morning as the Category 4 hurricane heads for the regions. The latest weather report, next.Then Pittsburgh becomes the first U.S. airport to allow the public past security without a plane ticket. More details on this TSA pilot program, next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.And now, Hurricane Irma now a category 4 storm; it's barreling toward the northwest Caribbean today.Cheryl Casone with all the details now -- Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: And Janice telling you, Maria -- Irma might get to a 5. Puerto Rico and Florida have already declared a state of emergency. Irma has got maximum sustained winds of 150 miles an hour.Officials in the Caribbean have now canceled flights. They have closed schools. And they're urging people to get ready with Irma moving toward land later today.Florida residents heading to the stores to get food, water and building supplies, of course, to protect themselves and their homes.Well, in other headlines this morning, today is the deadline for insurance companies to file their 2018 prices if they're still going to be in the Obamacare exchanges.At the same time regulators are struggling make decisions about how to handle pricing and coverage. All of this because of the uncertainty over federal policy with regards to health care. Usually there's a regimented process to review the insurance companies' offerings but then it goes on sale to consumers November 1st. They'll still go on sale but there's a lot of confusion right now.Well Novartis CEO Joe Jimenez is going to step down on February 1st. The 57-year-old has been at the helm of that company since 2010. Now, he has focused on more profitable prescription medicines particularly when it comes to cancer but sales have been hit as some of their major drugs have lost patent protection. Jimenez is going to be succeeded by the company's drug development chief Vasant Narasimhan. Shares of Novartis up about 15 percent so far this year.And then finally this -- this is interesting -- Pittsburgh International Airport is going to open up the boarding terminals to non-flyers. They're starting it today. The airport becomes the first airport since 9/11 to let non-flyers come through security, see after loved ones, hang out, go shopping, grab food -- anyway.You have to go through all the same screening, of course, as those that are catching flights. You have to have your ID. You will be vetted against any no fly-list, obviously. So security is going to be the same but airports have so much stuff now -- Maria. I think my friend should come to the airport with me and see me out.BARTIROMO: I see. So you're just going to be able to get behind security and say good-bye to your friends --CASONE: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- apparently as they get on the plane.CASONE: Or hang out.BARTIROMO: Thanks -- Cheryl.HILSENRATH: This just annoys me.BARTIROMO: Me too. I'm like why? Why? Why are they making this change? Who cares?HILSENRATH: Why do I have to stand in line behind even more people now when I --BARTIROMO: To say goodbye before security.HAGLUND: And there's a lot of airports too.BARTIROMO: It bothers me. I don't know why.HAGLUND: No. No, it does me, too.BARTIROMO: It's something that doesn't need to be done. I don't even understand why they're doing it.HAGLUND: And this is the change that we are going the make, right. I mean if we are going make changes to TSA let's do something else, right. Let's be able to carry our laptops. Let's be able to keep our shoes on through security.BARTIROMO: And definitely don't miss the guns.HAGLUND: Those things that make more sense.BARTIROMO: Don't miss the guns.(CROSSTALK)HILSENRATH: You can go to the airport --(CROSSTALK)HILSENRATH: You can go with no shoes and no ticket and still get to the gate.HAGLUND: Yes. And sometimes it's really nice to be able to say goodbye to people and like have your alone time before your flight, you know, check in. And I don't always need people coming back to the gate with me.BARTIROMO: I don't understand the reason for this. Brian -- do you have any idea why this has happened?BRENBERG: Well, the TSA should do two things. They should keep us safe and they should get us through the line as fast as possible. This has nothing to do with those two things, therefore it's a bad idea.HILSENRATH: All right.BARTIROMO: All right. Stirred up Cheryl -- ok.HILSENRATH: Stay out of Pittsburgh.BARTIROMO: Coming up, cracking down on violence in Chicago. After 42 people are shot just during the Labor Day weekend -- 42 shootings. How police are responding, straight ahead.Then Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is weighing in on tying federal support fro Harvey to the debt limit bill.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES TREASURY SECRETARY: Without raising the debt limit, I'm not comfortable that we will get the money that we need this month to Texas to rebuild.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: More on those comments, coming up next.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Well, Congress is back at work today returning after the summer holiday with a tight timeline to deal with the debt limit, the debt ceiling and pass aid for Harvey victims.Tracee Carrasco is on Capitol Hill this week. She's got the latest on the congressional agenda. Tracee -- good morning to you.TRACEE CARRASCO, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning -- Maria.Yes, Congress will need to hit the ground running if they want to get everything done. Late last night President Trump tweeted, "Big week coming up."Now the first order of business is going to be passing that Hurricane Harvey recovery. The Trump administration is asking for the approval of $7.85 billion.And on "FOX NEWS SUNDAY", Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin proposed attaching the recovery aid to legislation that would raise the nation's debt ceiling. Here is what he had to say.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MNUCHIN: The President and I believe that it should be tied to the Harvey funding. If Congress appropriates the money but I don't have the ability to borrow more money and pay for it, we're not going to be able to get that money to the state. So we need to put politics aside --(END VIDEO CLIP)CARRASCO: Meanwhile Republican Study Committee chairman, Mark Walker said he would oppose Mnuchin's proposal to tie the two together. Here is what he said in a statement, quote, "Congress is united behind this effort but I worry about jeopardizing an agreement with such legislative games.Our obligation is to assist those impacted by this great flood but it's past time the swamp waters in D.C. begin receding as well. That starts with being both compassionate and fiscally responsible. These two principles are not at odds."Now, Congress also must keep the government up and running after current funding expires on October 1st as well as raise the U.S. borrowing limit or risk defaulting on the nation's debt.And, you know, what about tax reform. Well, the big six, that's the key players in the GOP tax reform effort. They're scheduled to meet with the President today at the White House. That list includes Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, Senate Finance Committee chairman Orrin Hatch, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House National Economic Council director Gary Cohn.Maria -- meanwhile all of this, all of the House and Senate are in session at the same time for just 12 days in the month of September. A lot to get done.BARTIROMO: All right. Tracee -- thank you. Tracee Carrasco.Jon Hilsenrath is with us this morning. Can Congress come together on this? I mean to hear, you know, Mark Walker say we've got to be compassionate as well as fiscally responsible, opposing any attachment of the debt ceiling --HILSENRATH: Right.BARTIROMO: -- situation to Harvey aid.HILSENRATH: Well, I mean I think this actually might be a case where you actually have Republicans and Democrats working together because Democrats you saw argue during the Obama era that they we wanted to raise the debt ceiling cleanly without a lot of conditions. And I think they're willing to go along with this. They're willing to go along with Harvey funding.And we just heard Treasury Secretary Mnuchin say that he and the President wanted to do this too. So I think this might be one of those unusual cases where is there's actually bipartisanship.BRENBERG: These are always the games that Congress is playing. And look Mnuchin has one thing on his mind. He wants to get tax reform done.BARTIROMO: Yes.BRENBERG: He's saying if this is the path to get there, this is the path we need to take. It's not gamesmanship, it's just the compromise process you always have to go through.HAGLUND: Yes. It's not the time. It's not the time for Walker and other who are, you know, deficit hawks like that to be making this argument.HILSENRATH: I mean the bottom line is if you don't do the debt ceiling there's going to be a lot of mayhem in the financial markets and that's really not what anybody needs right now.BARTIROMO: Exactly.We'll take a break. When we come back, weathering the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. We will speak with residents in Houston about their recovery efforts, next.Then a look at gasoline prices after flooding in Texas. I'll breakdown expectations with former Shell Oil president, John Hofmeister straight ahead.Back in a moment.MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, September 5th. Your top stories right now 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.Assessing the devastation.

Parts of Houston beginning to dry out this morning, but Texans are now facing new flooding threats.Fox News correspondent Griff Jenkins is live in Houston this morning, where residents are being asked not to shower.Griff, good morning to you.GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Maria, good morning.That's right. Two west Houston water treatment plants under eight feet of water as of 7:00 p.m. last night, asking residents in the surrounding area to flush their toilet less, to shower less, to not run their dishwasher or laundry because they don't want these sewers to back up any more. So that's the situation.But most of Houston, 95 percent of, according to the mayor, is dried out as residents dragged their debris out to the street, just a massive undertaking thousands of homes.But here in the west Houston area, where the flooding continues because of the reservoirs, would put a drone up. You see there the homes still flooded some 4000 of them as the reservoirs will have to release water for the next 10 to 14 days.We asked one of the residents in this area who had been evacuated how she felt about it. Amy Eikel. Here's what she had to say.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)AMY EIKEL, HOUSTON RESIDENT: All I wanted to do is put like DampRid and seal things up in plastic bins so it can last for a month. We're looking to let these swampy waters sit for a month in my house and it will contaminate everything upstairs, too.I'm incensed that they're not letting us in to take care of our homes when we had no warning.(END VIDEO CLIP)JENKINS: The water is going to continue to be a problem for Amy and thousands of others, well, a few thousand residents, at least, here in this area, in west Houston.As the story plays out, Maria, certainly the legacy of this story is going to be water, not wind.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll be watching. Griff, thank you. Griff Jenkins on the ground this morning in Texas once again.Meanwhile oil pipelines and refineries are starting to resume operations in Texas. This comes after an evacuation zone was lifted for residents living by a chemical plant. That plant was damaged by Harvey.Joining me right now is former Shell Oil president, John Hofmeister. John, thanks so much for joining us this morning.JOHN HOFMEISTER, FORMER PRESIDENT, SHELL OIL: Good morning.BARTIROMO: What's your sense of this? How long will it take to fully recover in terms of the pipelines?HOFMEISTER: I think the absence of bad news is actually good news. We would have learned about damage by now if some of the refineries were seriously harmed by this storm and by the water.So that means once that once the water is removed or is manageable, then they can start the process of getting back up and running, which I think should be encouraging to everyone especially in the face of outages of gasoline and local retail stations.BARTIROMO: You make a good point with these gas shortages. I mean, gas prices are in focus, obviously. We're looking at gasoline prices moving higher across the country. Colonial Pipeline Company is the biggest U.S. fuel system, said it has restarted the fuel line shut because of Harvey and another line is close as say that to restart today.Why are gasoline prices higher across the country on this news -- even though we know the broader picture includes a whole bunch of supply that was not the case in the U.S. years ago? And a lot of people say oil prices ultimately would go lower.HOFMEISTER: Well, I think they will drift back down in time if the system gets back up and running.Price setting is really a process where traders move the product and people will pay whatever they're willing to pay if the price goes up, they'll pay. As the price comes down, they'll pay less.But the traders are the ones who moved the product around. They provided an invaluable service of getting molecules from where they are to where they're needed and that's how they get remunerated is off the trading process.But it's a psychological factor in terms of prices going up and there's an expression in the industry, up like a rocket, down like a feather. So you get a price rise at any inconvenience or any obstacle and it takes a while for rational practical behavior to fit back in and then prices decline.BARTIROMO: So, when does that rational behavior do you think set in? Do you believe that the supply story has changed so much in the U.S. that ultimately the days of 100-dollar oil are gone?HOFMEISTER: Well, we don't know what might happen two or three years from now, as the whole equilibrium of oil supply versus demand shifts because of the deferral of capital spending on oil searching an exploration of production.But having said that, I think when we hear the refineries are starting backup as trackers have more access to more distribution point, let's say in the affected area of east Texas and stations get reloaded.I think we'll see a settling down of what it takes. People will trust that when they go to the gas station, there will be fuel there.But when they don't trust it, then they all -- they create the shortage by everybody topping up when the system is not designed for topping up tanks.BARTIROMO: Hurricane Harvey, obviously has created incredible devastation for so many in Texas and beyond. You've seen hurricanes before. Characterize the -- this hurricane versus what you've seen before in terms of damage.HOFMEISTER: Well, we've known for a long time that water is the enemy of the whole distribution system, the entire refinery system. When does the enemy of offshore production? Not so much water.So when we had the combination of wind and massive amounts of water, everyone knew that there would be consequences because of the tremendous amount of water that showed up.Refineries are designed to keep water out. Well, that means if water comes from the sky, water comes in and there's no way to stop it. You don't put a roof over a refinery.So you have this accumulation on the ground plus workers homes were deeply affected. When you have this combination of water in the ground and you can't see what's going on inside the refinery and you have workers who can't get to work because they're at home taking care of their families, you have a precautionary shutdown requirement. You just can't keep operating.But once you shut down, it's like organizing a rocket launch. You have so many bits and pieces to organize when you're trying to start back up. You have to have staff.If the staff is not there, you can't start back up. Nobody's going to tell their employees you've got to ignore your family and come to work. It doesn't work that way. You treat your employees with respect.So you need to organize people onsite. Everybody knows what their job is. You follow a process that's all mapped out. People are watching to make sure there are no false starts or there are no complications and gradually over a period of several days, you get the refinery back up and running. We know how to do it. We've done it many times before.The good news here and the reason we're not hearing about more damage is after Hurricanes Rita, Katrina and others a decade ago, all the refineries hardened their infrastructure. They moved electronics and electrical up above flood level so they wouldn't have to repair and replace them in the future and that seems to have worked very well.So we are seeing no reports of major damage and I think that's a very good sign to everybody that we can manage these problems. It just takes time.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll be watching.John, great to have your insights. Thanks so much.HOFMEISTER: Thank you.BARTIROMO: John Hofmeister there. Stay with us.In about 20 minutes, I'll be talking with house majority leader Kevin McCarthy about Harvey funding, tax reform and the legislative agenda, coming up.First though, Honda owners could receive $500 in compensation following the Takata airbag recall. Details on that lawsuit, coming up.Plus, video game icon Mario changes his job description. Why the internet went wild over it after Nintendo announced the mascot has left the plumbing profession. Back in a moment.(MUSIC)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.A man studying to be a pastor tells police he may have killed his wife in his sleep.Cheryl Casone with the story. Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: OK. So, Maria, Matthew Phelps of North Carolina is using the bad dream defense. Telling a 911 operator that he woke up to find his wife stabbed to death and drenched in blood.Reports of the 28-year-old Phelps told the operator he took too much cold medicine and may have accidentally killed his wife in his sleep. Police quickly arrived and discovered his wife of less than a year, Lauren Phelps with multiple stab wounds.Matthew Phelps was arrested Friday, he's been charged with murder and is being held without bail.Well, at least 42 people were shot in Chicago over the Labor Day weekend. Five of them killed as a result in a city that is known for gun violence. There's been at least 435 deaths by gun shots so far this year.Labor Day weekend had two fewer shooting death in the weekend prior, we should add. But get this, Independence Day, Memorial Day, Father's Day, holiday weekends, each this year have seen more than 50 shootings in Chicago.Well, millions of Honda and Acura owners could receive $500 as part of a class-action settlement over defective Takata airbags. That settlement still must be approved by a federal judge. But it covers more than 16 million vehicles.The airbag scandal, of course, led to a massive recall and force Takata to file for bankruptcy protection.At least 60 people died when these faulty airbags exploded. Shares of Honda are down more than three percent so far this year. Stock to watch today.Pretty strong reactions on social media to tell you about, after Nintendo updated the profile of Super Mario.Nintendo's Japanese Web site that Mario seems to have work as a plumber, it was a long time ago, they say. They say we've always known that Mario is a man of many talents, but to say that he's not a plumber, that's just denying the root.Another tweet says, look, it's simple. Mario is an Italian plumber. He fights evil turtles and mushrooms ruled by a dog turtle dino dragon who kidnapped the princess.Shares of Nintendo up about 60 percent so far this year.Don't mess with like the classic characters. You can't do that.BARTIROMO: It's funny that people care that much about it. Cheryl, you're right. The plastic characters. Your kids care.BRIAN BRENBERG, CHAIR OF BUSINESS AND FINANCE, THE KING'S COLLEGE: I think they look at Mario as a plumber. But the truth is actually Mario has been a doctor, Mario has been racecar driver. He's so flexible. His brand is so powerful, but I do have a soft spot for Mario the plumber. That's where it started.BARTIROMO: So your kids will care about him returning --BRENBERG: I don't think kids today will care about that so much. I think it's our generation.JON HILSENRATH, CHIEF ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: What is he then? If he's not a plumber anymore, what is he?BRENBERG: He's a renaissance man.BARTIROMO: Did they say what he is, Cheryl? OK. Nothing.BRENBERG: Like I said, a renaissance man.BARTIROMO: He's a renaissance man.KIRSTEN HAGLUND, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I don't know. Identity politics, right? He's a plumber. He is an Italian man.BARTIROMO: Should we talk real quick about the guy who said he had to kill his wife because God told him to in his sleep?HAGLUND: It's awful. It's horrible. It's horrible.HILSENRATH: it's just sad and inexplicable. I don't know what to make a something like that.BRENBERG: I mean, it's deranged. What are you going to say? It's deranged.BARTIROMO: It is. Coming up, life after Harvey.I'll speak with Ramsey Solutions financial expert, Chris Hogan. He's in the studio this morning about managing your finances following extreme weather disasters. Stay with us.(MUSIC)BARTRIOMO: If Mother Nature destroys your home, will disasters beat you to the bank? Florida and Puerto Rico are now under states of emergency as they brace for Hurricane Irma. While Texans are reeling from the property damage caused by Hurricane Harvey which could stretch up to $40 billion, according to estimates from CoreLogic.Seventy percent of home damages caused by Harvey's flooding will not be covered by insurance, meanwhile.Joining us right now is Ramsey Solutions financial expert and author of "Retire Inspired," Chris Hogan.Chris, it is good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT, RAMSEY SOLUTIONS: Well, thank you very much.BARTIROMO: We're happy to have you in studio, because we always talk to you when you're someone else. This is an important story.How can people financially prepared for a national -- or a natural disaster?HOGAN: Well, I think the first thing, Maria, is you got to plan and by planning, I mean, make sure you have the right kinds of insurances in place and coverages and understanding what those coverages are going to do.For example, homeowners insurance will only cover wind damage. It doesn't cover the flood. And so you really need to be aware of what do we need to have in place to protect our family.BARTIROMO: That's a really good point.HAGLUND: We just heard earlier in the show that 85 percent of those -- that had been affected by Hurricane Harvey didn't have flood insurance.So what do they do now? The federal government flood insurance program, we're hoping that that gets re-up here. Is that where they lean -- is that what they lean on? What do they do?HOGAN: The first step for them is really going to be to reach out for their mortgage company or their mortgage server certifying out, as well as their insurance company.If they didn't have coverage, now, it's going to become one of those major loss type things where they going to have to walk through their paperwork to figure out what is the government going to be able to do to help, but more importantly, what are they going to have to do for do for themselves.HILSENRATH: For a lot of the people, property insurance is so expensive, if you're living in a hurricane prone area North Carolina coast or Florida coast.And a lot of people say, I'm just going to take my chances because I can't pay the thousands and thousands of dollars that it cost to insure this place.What's someone to do when those coverages are so expensive?HOGAN: Well, I think the big thing you do is reach out and make sure you get with an insurance professional. If you're talking about thousands of dollars in coverage, you're talking about hundreds of thousands for your home.It's really that lost mitigation type mentality where we got to have risk management and that's really what insurance is. You get coverage in exchange for a payment.BRENBERG: Chris, what about if you're a small business owner, that's when personal life and commercial life get intermingled. A lot of people down in Houston right now are in that position and they're dealing with some big business disruption losses.How do you think about that?HOGAN: Well, I think on the business side, you obviously want to go back and look again at the coverage you have. But I think it also goes to the emergency fund.In business, you need retained earnings. You need money set aside in case of a 'rainy day fund."On the personal side, you need that in your life as well. Three to six months of expenses, set aside. So when life does happen, you're able to take this emergency and turn it in to an inconvenience.BARTIROMO: I want to get your take on preparing for this. We want to point out that Hurricane Irma has now been upgraded to a category five storm. So this is accelerating and worsening right now, Hurricane Irma now at a category five.Employees are wasting time at work worrying about money, Chris, and then their employers are paying for it. We've got this alarming new study from Mercer showing that workers spend roughly 150 hours annually worrying about finances at work, which costs companies up $250 billion in lost wages last year. Your reaction.HOGAN: That's a lot of money. I mean, if you start to think about that -- I mean, 250 billion? This is people concerned about money, so they're not focused on their job.Imagine that this is a health care professional for someone that's going to doing surgery. This is alarming.So it's one of those things where I think as employers, we need to make sure our employees understand, hey, you've got to have a plan for money.A lot of people think they need more money but, Maria, the reality is that they're outliving their money. It's lifestyle. Things that they can pull back that they have control over that would really relieve some of that pressure getting out of debt, having an emergency fund and budgeting.BARTIROMO: How many people outlive their money? Majority of people outlive their money?HOGAN: Oh, yes. I mean, 70 percent of people live in paycheck to paycheck. But check doesn't show up. They have now a life problem.HAGLUND: But also this probably has a lot to do with wages stagnating, basically. I mean, we -- it's been years since we've seen really -- a real significant uptick in wages and then obviously -- but the economy is doing great. So people want to live their lives. They want to get out and spend. That fuels economic growth.So, where's the balance? What would you suggest be the first that a family looking at their budget starts to cut back on?HOGAN: Well, I think it's understanding the difference between a want and a need. That's an adult type thing, right? Because people get those confuse all the time. I think if you --HILSENRATH: What's a want and what's a need? We have some millennial out there.HOGAN: Sure. A need is your housing, transportation, food and clothing. We call that the four walls. Those are things that you need.BARTIROMO: So we want so much more.HOGAN: We do, Maria. There's nothing wrong with getting some stuff, just don't let stuff have you. What I mean by that is don't get it using debt where you're making a payment.BRENBERG: So, Chris, I have these millennials in my classroom and I'm looking at them and their ability to manage their money. It seems to me that young people today are not getting an education in financial planning at the high school level, at the collegiate level.Do you see that as a big problem?HOGAN: I think it's a really big problem. Just because also with the cashless society. They're not used to using cash. They have all these apps and all this -- so money is not real. It's the material thing.So you can't manage something you're not aware of. So I think it's really important for them to get that education from their parents, first and foremost, right? But also in schools to be able to give them a life skill that they're going to need for the rest of their lives.HILSENRATH: Didn't a lot of them learn some hard lessons about debt and money because they were the ones who lived through the financial crisis? They worked up all this debt and then had to go into this really difficult job market.It seems like there's a lot of millennials out there who were kind of like my grandmother's generation through the depression and they're like, I'm not going to get myself in debt.HOGAN: I would hope and I'd love to see more. But the problem is, is we tend to get amnesia, right? We forget things. We forget the tough times and those lessons and that's why we're doomed to repeat them.So that credit card debt is dangerous. It's one of those things that will choke you out.HAGLUND: I think what's interesting with the millennials trend, they are the biggest savers of cash generationally, as you look at this. And also, they're not so tied to pursuing a job just for wealth accumulation, it's more about pursuing jobs for meaning, which I think bodes well for their ability to discern between those wants and needs.BRENBERG: They're also the generation that's been asking for debt forgiveness for college loans. They want an easy way out. That's what bothers --BARTIROMO: They think free college is attainable.HILSENRATH: -- for them, 50,000, $60,000 a year for college is not something a lot of us had to experience.BARTIROMO: But they think it should be free.HAGLUND: That's another story, completely.HOGAN: That's another segment.HAGLUND: We don't have Bernie Sanders part of this show.HILSENRATH: And $50,000, a quarter million dollars a year just to get yourself through college.BARTIROMO: Right.HOGAN: Unbelievable. You think about that. You start to think they're really -- college isn't something you have to do. College is something you get to do. But there's so many ways you can do it without taking on 50,000 or 60,000 in debt.BARTIROMO: Chris, great to have you.HOGAN: Thank you for having me.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Good to see you.HOGAN: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Chris Hogan there.Still ahead, I will speak with house majority leader, Kevin McCarthy about the meeting with those affected by Harvey, plans for tax reform. A lot more on the legislative agenda. That's next hour, "Mornings with Maria," right here Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Happy Tuesday, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.

Trump ratchets up pressure on China with rare trade actionPolitico.comNovember 28, 2017 Tuesday 9:52 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 784 wordsByline: DPalmer@politico.com,  (Doug Palmer)BodyThe Trump administration fired a trade salvo at China on Tuesday by launching a pair of investigations that could lead to steep duties on imports of aluminum sheet valued at more than $600 million.The move was the first time a U.S. administration has "self-initiated" an anti-dumping or countervailing duty case in at least 25 years and marked an escalation of the Trump administration's antagonistic trade relationship with Beijing.Most trade remedy cases begin with a petition, whether it be filed by an industry group, a collection of companies, or even an individual firm. Such petitions generally accuse foreign producers of selling products in the U.S. at unfairly low - or "dumped" - prices, or they take issue with a foreign company receiving government subsidies that give them an unfair advantage.But in this case, the Trump administration took action in the absence of a petition as it continues to drive a hard line against China for what the White House views as Beijing's unfair trade practices and government support of industry.The Commerce Department has had the authority to self-initiate anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations since 1980, but has used it sparingly. The last self-initiated countervailing duty investigation was against imports of Canadian softwood lumber in 1991, and the last self-initiated anti-dumping case was against imports of Japanese semiconductors in 1985.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, in a conference call with aluminum industry executives on Tuesday, welcomed the fact that industry-driven anti-dumping and countervailing duty cases are up markedly in the first year of the Trump administration - and said he wants to receive more of them."While we stand ready to self-initiate investigations where warranted, I once again encourage those with knowledge of unfair trade practices to come forward so that Commerce can defend against such inequities," Ross said.Commerce worked with the Aluminum Association, an industry group, to help develop the case, but took the step of initiating the two investigations on its own, Ross said during the call. Both the anti-dumping and the countervailing duty probes could take up to a year to complete.For the duties to be imposed, the U.S. International Trade Commission must make both a preliminary and a final determination that U.S. producers have been materially injured or threatened with material injury by the Chinese imports."In this case, available evidence indicates that Chinese producers are selling aluminum sheet in the United States at prices that are less than fair value and that the Chinese government is providing unfair subsidies to producers of aluminum sheet," Ross said. "Available evidence also indicates that U.S. producers of aluminum sheet are suffering injury caused by these imports."Commerce's decision to self-initiate the two investigations "sends a strong signal to China that the United States will aggressively enforce its trade laws," Aluminum Association CEO Heidi Brock said during the call with Ross.Common alloy aluminum sheet has a variety of uses in building and construction, transportation, basic electrical applications and home appliances. It is "a key product segment for the U.S. aluminum industry," Brock said, noting that U.S. producers supply about 2 billion pounds of sheet each year out of the total U.S. market of about 26 billion pounds.The two investigations will cover about $603.6 million worth of common alloy aluminum sheet imports from China. Ross said the probes are separate from other trade cases involving aluminum that the department is now handling. Those include an active investigation into aluminum foil imports from China as well as a much broader probe, under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which could lead to duties being imposed on aluminum imports from a variety of countries to protect manufacturing interests that are critical to U.S. national security.Despite the administration's decision to opt for a unilateral move absent a petition, Commerce officials said the two probes would be conducted the same as any other anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigation. According to that process, the ITC will make preliminary injury determinations on or before January 16. If the two cases clear that hurdle, Commerce will announce preliminary countervailing duties in February and preliminary anti-dumping duties in April.President Donald Trump "made a promise to American businesses, workers and farmers that he would vigorously enforce our trade laws and be more enforcement-minded than our predecessors," Ross said. "Today's action shows that we intend to make good on that promise to the American people."Load-Date: November 29, 2017End of Document

Rising cultural industry boosts Guangdong's soft powerPR NewswireOctober 17, 2017 Tuesday 4:17 PM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1220 wordsDateline: GUANGZHOU, China, Oct. 17, 2017 BodyAccording to the Information Office of the People's Government of Guangdong Province, with its main economic indexes ranking top in China for 28 consecutive years, Guangdong has witnessed its cultural industry embarking on a fast-track of growth and having become an impetus for the province's economic development.And the latest statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics of China show that, in 2016, the added value of cultural industry and related industries in Guangdong hit 425.66 billion yuan, a year-on-year growth of 16.67%, the highest growth rate in the past five years. The sector accounted for 5.26% of the province's GDP and 1/7 of the total amount of the nation's cultural industry, making it a pillar industry in the province.Further supply-side structural reform to spur cultural industry's development"China's cultural industry has grown prosperously, which makes us more confident. We have strong feelings about China's strong soft power," said an official from the Publicity Department of CPC Guangdong Committee.The concept of cultural confidence was first put forward by the Chinese government, and special attention has been paid to cultural soft power. Guangdong has made great efforts to develop the creative industry and other industries with higher value-added in the core layer. The structure of its cultural industry was optimized and the core competence of Guangdong's cultural industry has been greatly improved. In 2016, Guangdong focused on "Culture Plus" and "Internet Plus". For example, China's first omnimedia giant, Southern Finance Omnimedia Corporation (S.F.C.) was established in Guangzhou, developing three core businesses, namely media, data and trading. Multiple cultural innovation projects were set up by media, such as "China Free Trade Zone Info Port". All these led to the deep integration of traditional media and new media as well as to the expansion of the cultural industry. "The accelerated development of Guangdong's cultural industry has resulted from our efforts in supply-side structural reform of the industry." said Yang Pengfei, Director of the Development and Reform Office of the Publicity Department of CPC Guangdong Committee. Guangdong's high value-added cultural industry has been developing rapidly and accounted for 53% of the cultural industry in 2016, a 10% increase over 2013. That is a success of the industry's supply-side structural reform.In the meantime, the layout of Guangdong's cultural industry saw improvement. Guangzhou and Shenzhen, as core cities, have been playing leading roles and developing clusters of creative cultural industries. Other cities in the Pearl River Delta focus on developed industries in the regions, such as printing and other cultural equipment. In the less developed areas such as east, west and north Guangdong, some tour itineraries with strong local charms were developed.Internet cultural industry with international competitivenessThe top three most popular apps in China are WeChat, QQ and KuGou, as well as many popular mobile games are from Guangdong. Guangdong's internet cultural industry has become a pillar sector of cultural industry in the province. In 2016, the province saw an explosive growth of for-profit Internet cultural units with the largest number of subjects in China.As Guangzhou and Shenzhen accelerated the construction of the national demonstration bases for culture and technology integration, the province saw leading cultural enterprises mushroom and new cultural industries take shape in the country.In 2016, the output value of Guangdong's digital publishing industry reached 180 billion Yuan, ranking first in China; the animation industry, 40 billion Yuan, accounting for over one third of the national total. The province's industrial output value of online music accounted for almost 50% of the national total; and its revenue of game industry amounted to 134.5 billion Yuan, making up for 73.4% of the nation's total and 37.5% of the Asia-Pacific's total; the output value of game and entertainment equipment accounted for 80% of the nation's total.According to the Department of Commerce of Guangdong, currently the province has a variety of leading export enterprises and brands in cultural industry such as publishing, animation game, creative design and cultural equipment manufacturing, and their products have been exported to over 160 countries and regions. In particular, the export volume of games has reached 17.6 billion Yuan and they are sold to over 100 countries and regions.  In 2016, the import and export volume of Guangdong's cultural products reached 43.79 billion USD with the export volume amounted to 41.81 billion USD, ranking first in all provinces of the country with a trade surplus of 39.83 billion USD.Integrated development of cultural and financial industriesEarly in 2017, the newly established S.F.C. signed a strategic cooperation agreement with China Construction Bank (CCB) to jointly launch a fund of 10 billon yuan for Guangdong's media and cultural industry. With the help of the Publicity Department of CPC Guangdong Committee, Guangdong has launched within two years three 10-billion-Yuan funds for the cultural industry in the provincial publicity system.Last year in November, the Publicity Department of CPC Guangdong Committee signed the "Culture+Finance" Strategic Cooperation Agreement with SPD Bank to discover a new model for integrated development of cultural and financial industries. SPD Bank will provide Guangdong's cultural enterprises as well as cultural industry groups with no less than 50-billon-yuan intentional investment and financing quotas. In the past two years, the Publicity Department of CPC Guangdong Committee has facilitated over 200-billon-yuan credits granted to the province's cultural enterprises, injecting enormous energy into the transformation and development of the cultural industry.The effect of "culture + finance" is expanding obviously as a large number of cultural investment funds have been rapidly established. Zhujiang Film Group and Yuexiu Group jointly established a 5-billon-yuan investment fund. And with 5 billion yuan investment, the "Gollywood", a film and television base located in Foshan, Guangdong, has attracted over 130 film and television teams around the world within one year.In addition, cities of Guangdong customize related loan guarantee programs, and encourage innovation and entrepreneurship in the cultural industry. A batch of cultural industrial parks in the province, such as Dongguan Creative Industry Center Park and Shunde Idea, introduce small loan companies in order to timely release loans to the small and micro cultural enterprises.The integration between culture, finance and technology inject innovative element to the industrial structure and boost the development of Guangdong's cultural industry. Officials of the Publicity Department of CPC Guangdong Committee said Guangdong will build a development model for the cultural industry driven by innovation, continuously develop the industry and show the cultural confidence in global competition. View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rising-cultural-industry-boosts-guangdongs-soft-power-300538361.htmlSOURCE Information Office of Guangdong Provincial Government of ChinaLoad-Date: October 18, 2017End of Document

Trump administration pursues antidumping case against ChinaAssociated Press InternationalNovember 29, 2017 Wednesday 12:21 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 267 wordsByline: By PAUL WISEMAN, AP Economics WriterDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - The Trump administration is launching an investigation into Chinese imports, deploying trade-policy tools the United States hasn't used for more than a quarter century in a move likely to raise tensions with Beijing.The Commerce Department said Tuesday that it has begun investigating whether Chinese aluminum sheeting is selling in the United States at illegally low prices. It is the first anti-dumping case the U.S. government has initiated on its own - not in response to complaints from U.S. companies - since Washington went after Japanese semiconductor imports in 1985."President Trump made it clear from Day One that unfair trade practices will not be tolerated," Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said. "We are self-initiating the first trade case in over a quarter century, showing once again that we stand in constant vigilance in support of free, fair, and reciprocal trade."The department is also starting an investigation into whether China unfairly subsidizes aluminum sheeting, imports of which came to $603 million in the U.S. last year. It is the first such case the U.S. government has begun on its own since it launched an investigation into Canadian softwood lumber imports in 1991.The announcement comes three weeks after Trump traveled to Beijing and met with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Although the Trump-Xi summit was cordial, the U.S. president has been widely expected to increase pressure on the Chinese government to reduce America's huge trade deficit.Last year, the U.S. trade gap in goods with China was $347 billion, by far the biggest with any country.Load-Date: November 29, 2017End of Document

Ceremonial Opening of Ballard's China Stack Joint Venture Production FacilityPR NewswireSeptember 6, 2017 Wednesday 1:15 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1235 wordsDateline: VANCOUVER, BC and YUNFU, China, Sept. 6, 2017 BodyBallard Power Systems (NASDAQ: BLDP; TSX: BLDP) announced that a ceremonial opening event was held today at the company's FCvelocity®-9SSL fuel cell stack joint venture operation in the City of Yunfu, in China's Guangdong Province. Ballard has a 10% interest in the joint venture - called Guangdong Synergy Ballard Hydrogen Power Co., Ltd. ("JVCo") - together with partner Guangdong Nation Synergy Hydrogen Power Technology Co. Ltd. ("Synergy"). The fuel cell stacks manufactured by JVCo are expected to be used primarily in fuel cell engines assembled in China to provide propulsion power for zero-emission fuel cell electric buses and commercial vehicles in China.Today's event was attended by the Party Secretary of China's Guangdong Province, Mr. Hu Chunhua, Mayor of Yunfu, Mr. Wang Sheng, and Vice-Mayor of Foshan/Yunfu, Mr. Xu Guo, together with other Chinese government officials."This landmark opening of our stack joint venture operation represents a critical part of our localization strategy to profitably service the unprecedented level of market interest for Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles, or FCEVs, in Heavy Duty Motive applications in China - the largest market in the world," said Randy MacEwen, Ballard's President and CEO, while attending the opening ceremony. "Our strategy is to enable Ballard's Chinese partners to rapidly achieve scale and significantly drive down product costs while also satisfying local content objectives for locally manufactured stacks and modules."Mr. MacEwen continued, "With Ballard's brand strength, technology leadership and field experience, we believe the Company is uniquely positioned to address the fast-growing market for FCEVs in Heavy Duty Motive applications in China and around the globe."David Whyte, Ballard Vice President - Operations added, "This impressive stack production operation already has over 90 employees and has begun producing qualified product. Work is also underway to achieve certification to ISO9001:2015 and IATF16949:2016 quality standards."The JVCo operation is currently ramping to an annualized production capacity of 6,000 fuel cell stacks by late 2017 and is designed to achieve an annualized production capacity of 20,000 fuel cell stacks, based on 3 shifts running 5-days per week. The operation has implemented certain advanced automation techniques.The joint venture transaction, which closed in October 2016, has a contemplated minimum value to Ballard of $170 million over 5-years, comprised of:$20 million in Technology Solutions revenue for technology transfer services, production equipment specification and procurement services, training and commissioning support in relation to the establishment of a production facility for the manufacture and assembly of FCvelocity®-9SSL fuel cell stacks, with most of this revenue expected to be recognized in 2017;andBallard's exclusive supply of membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs), a key component of every fuel cell, for each fuel cell stack manufactured by the joint venture, with minimum annual MEA volume commitments on a "take or pay" value of at least $150 million over the initial 5-year term from 2017 to 2021.Mr. Whyte continued, "Our business model in China is risk adjusted, capital light and IP protected, while offering near-, mid- and long-term cash flow streams at various points in the value chain. Our $150 million long-term MEA supply contract provides forward visibility on baseload MEA production volumes. We also expect Ballard to realize value at the stack level from our participation in JVCo. Finally, at the module level, we expect to receive technology transfer fees as well as recurring royalty payments from modules assembled by local partners, while driving demand for stacks from the JVCo production line."JVCo has an exclusive right to manufacture and sell FCvelocity®-9SSL stacks in China. Exclusivity is subject to certain performance criteria of the joint venture, including compliance with: a code of ethics; Ballard's quality policies and branding practices; payment terms; and certain intellectual property covenants; as well as achievement of the minimum annual "take or pay" MEA volumes.

EGYPTIAN AUTHORITIES FORCIBLY DISAPPEAR 16 UYGHUR STUDENTS FROM NOTORIOUS PRISONStates News ServiceSeptember 25, 2017 MondayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 1089 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Egyptian authorities have released up to 25 of more than 100 Uyghur students from northwestern China's Xinjiang region who were detained earlier this year in the country's notorious Tora Prison, though armed police put black hoods on 16 others and took them away, three recently released Uyghurs said.The three students, who were released in early September, told RFA's Uyghur Service that they do not know why the 16 were whisked away or whether they were deported to China, though prison guards told them the students were "in trouble."One of them was 17 years old, they said.Egypt's secret police began detaining Uyghur and ethnic minority Kazakh Muslims from China en masse on July 4, in an operation activists said was requested by Beijing, sources told RFA at the time.The 200 students, many of them religious students at Cairo's Islamic Al-Azhar University, were rounded up in restaurants or at their homes, with others seized at airports as they tried to flee to safer countries, the sources said.The Egyptian government has not disclosed the charges, the number of detentions, the whereabouts of the detainees, or whether any were sent back to China.Ethnic minority Kazakh Muslims from China were among some 200 ethnic minority holders of Chinese passports targeted in July by Egypt's secret policeThe three Uyghur students who were later released said that the detainees were first interrogated by Egyptian security officials, and later by Chinese security officials.The Egyptian officials gave every Uyghur student a form in Arabic to fill out, though many could not fully comprehend the questions because of their poor Arabic skills and responded "yes" to all items out of fear, they said.The students were then divided into three categories in prison red, yellow, and green according to their interrogation results, answers on the forms, and the contents of their mobile phones, they said.The ones placed in the green category are those who had legal status in Egypt and were enrolled in Al-Azhar or other Egyptian universities.The ones in the yellow category had either status issues or were not enrolled in a university, and those in the red category had cell phones with content that Chinese security officials deemed problematic. It was unclear what kind of content was found on their mobile devices.Prior to the mass detentions, the majority of Uyghur students in Egypt used the Chinese instant messaging service WeChat to communicate with family and friends at home and abroad.WeChat is an app developed by China's internet company Tencent, which shares all private user data with the Chinese government.Many Uyghurs in Xinjiang have gotten in trouble with the Chinese authorities in recent years because of the content on their mobile phones, including the sharing of political and religious content on WeChat.Police frequently check the mobile phones of Uyghurs in Xinjiang and detain them for possessing unapproved content.Divided up into jail cellsOne recently released Uyghur student in Egypt who spoke on condition of anonymity said that more than 100 Uyghur students were divided into two huge jail cells after they were detained on Aug. 31 and their mobile phones were confiscated."We were first interrogated by the Egyptian police, but not tortured or mistreated," he said. "After the interrogations, they told us that they had detained us because of a Chinese government request that we were 'terrorists.'"The police said they could not find any evidence of terrorism after the interrogations and would soon release the students, noting that "this is politics between two countries," he said."In our jail cell, there were 54 students, including me," he said. "Suddenly fully armed police came in that day and told us in Arabic to face the wall."The police handcuffed some of the students and took them away, he said."We saw altogether 16 were taken from both cells," the Uyghur student said. "Later when we asked prison guards where they had been taken, they simply said that they were 'in trouble.' These 16 Uyghurs belonged to the red category."Another Uyghur student from Al-Azhar University who spoke on condition of anonymity said he was placed into the green category because authorities could not accuse him of any criminal conduct.The 25 students who were released were all placed into the green category, he said, adding that some in the yellow category may have been released as well."This place is no longer safe for any of us now," he said. "But what worries me most is the fate of 16 who belonged to the red category. There is no sign of them. They simply vanished."A third Uyghur student who fled to Turkey soon after his release from prison said that he and others who were detained by Egyptian police on July 4 were divided into two jails cells at Tora Prison, a detention complex for criminal and political detainees on the southern outskirts of the capital Cairo."We were not tortured, but we were terrified of being possibly deported to China," said the student who spoke to RFA on condition of anonymity."The Arab [Egyptian] police didn't treat us badly, but the Chinese security officials put black hoods on our heads and repeatedly interrogated us, asking questions like, 'Why did you come to Egypt?' [and] 'Which organizations did you participate in?'""In the end, I was released after the Eid [al-Adha] holiday [on Aug. 31], so I guess some of those who belonged to the yellow category may have also been released," he said.Sent back home?Both released Uyghur students and Uyghurs in hiding in Egypt said they fear that the 16 others who have vanished may have been sent back home in light of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi's visit to China to attend the BRICS Summit in early September and strengthen economic ties with Beijing.Chinese President Xi Jinping invited Sisi to participate in the summit as "a reaffirmation of Egypt's position and its economic, political and commercial status that qualifies it to become a member of the BRICS," according to the Egyptian government's information service.During Sisi's visit on Sept. 3-5, some major trade deals were signed between Egypt and China, including a memorandum of understanding for Beijing to finance a U.S. $739 million rail link that will connect a new, yet-to-be-named capital the North African country is building to an industrial zone.Reported by Gulchehra Hoja for RFA's Uyghur Service.

CHINA'S 'FALLEN' OFFICIALS LEAVE GAPS, SILENCED VOICES IN COMMUNIST PARTY RANKSStates News ServiceSeptember 20, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 829 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:As the ruling Chinese Communist Party gears up for a crucial, five-yearly congress next month, President Xi Jinping is taking far-reaching steps to ensure that no critical voices are raised against him, analysts said.A popular chat show on the Hong Kong-based satellite station Phoenix TV, known for its pro-Beijing stance, was pulled off air this week, less than a month before the 19th Party Congress on Oct. 18, with scant explanation."Behind the Headlines" is off air temporarily, due to "adjustments to network programming," Phoenix said via its official account on Chinese social media, while searches for the show's title were blocked on the Twitter-like service Sina Weibo.Journalism professor To Yiu-ming, of Hong Kong's Baptist University, said the move appears to be part of an overall clampdown on any media that isn't directly produced under the aegis of the ruling party."There really is little room for public speech now, if they are even going after Phoenix," To said. "From the point of view of the Chinese government, Phoenix is pretty much like [Communist Party-backed newspaper] the Wen Wei Po; the acceptable face of the Hong Kong media.""From Hong Kong's point of view, it is the more relaxed face of the mainland Chinese media," he said.To said Xi's administration is busy stamping out even the slightest traces of dissent ahead of the party congress."They aren't messing about; they want everyone present and correct, and to minimize noise," he said. "Perhaps we will see dissenting voices within party ranks being amplified in the overseas media instead."Former ideologue detainedIn the southwestern Chinese province, a former party ideologue is being held under criminal detention following a recent call for direct elections to choose the next generation of Chinese leaders.Zi Su was taken away from his home in Sichuan's provincial capital Chengdu on April 28 after he posted an open letter online calling on Xi to step down as head of the party in favor of Hu Deping, son of late ousted premier Hu Yaobang, whose death in 1989 sparked the Tiananmen Square democracy movement."Xi Jinping was elected general secretary ... in 2012 and has served for five years," Zi's letter said. "His achievements ... have been to punish a number of corrupt officials, but his faults have been to imitate [late supreme leader] Mao Zedong with a personality cult around him and a focus on centralization of power."The letter also called for "direct elections" to choose the next head of the Communist Party.The outspoken professor had previously told RFA as the party celebrated its 95th birthday on July 1, 2016, that Xi was using "controls and political struggle of the kind used by Mao Zedong."Zi's defense attorney Li Guisheng said his client had been detained for breaching the terms of a previous bail.Party boss investigatedIn July, President Xi Jinping ordered an investigation into Sun Zhengcai, party boss of the southwestern megacity of Chongqing, former political fiefdom of Bo Xilai, who is currently serving a life sentence for corruption and abuse of power.Like his doomed predecessor, Sun was a charismatic politician and Politburo member widely tipped for entry into the highest echelons of the party leadership at the next reshuffle of top jobs at the congress, which opens in Beijing on Oct. 18.Many under his political patronage, or implicated in the investigation into his activities were also held, leaving a significant gap in the city's elite, according to political commentator and former Xinhua news agency reporter Jiang Weiping, who fled to Canada after being accused of endangering national security."In a few days, Chongqing will have to choose its delegates to the 19th Party Congress, but the number of gaps requiring by-elections is unprecedented," Jiang wrote in a recent commentary for RFA's Mandarin Service."In the past year, large numbers of the high-ranking officials in a single city have been detained," he said. "This is really unusual, and the impact will be ... far-reaching."Jiang said Xi's anticorruption campaign, waged since he took power in 2012, can only be selective, because of the endemic nature of graft in China's body politic."Everyone is tainted," Jiang wrote. "There is no doubt that what we have here is the rule of man, not the rule of law,""Under the current system, ordinary people have no choice, and it matters little which particular ideology politicians are motivated by; what is most important are the results, whether or not they are able to promote social progress," he wrote."If there are no political reforms and no judicial independence, then it hardly matters who is reshuffled, or who wins the power struggles; China won't progress, and its people will have no way of averting disaster," he wrote.Reported by Lam Kwok-lap and Hai Nan for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by the Mandarin Service.

China activist admits to using Twitter to incite subversionAssociated Press InternationalAugust 22, 2017 Tuesday 9:17 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 845 wordsByline: By LOUISE WATT, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - A prominent Chinese human rights campaigner pleaded guilty to inciting subversion of state power on Tuesday, saying he had used social media to inspire distrust in the Chinese government, in the latest trial in a sweeping crackdown on independent lawyers and rights activists.Parts of the trial of Jiang Tianyong were broadcast on the social media account of Changsha Intermediate People's Court in the central province of Hunan, an unusual move for such a politically sensitive case. Prosecutors said he had used social media platforms to denigrate the government and judicial authorities and incited others to subvert state power, including fabricating claims that a lawyer had been tortured in custody. Rights groups said the trial was a sham.Jiang was filmed saying he had used Twitter and Sina Weibo and interviews with overseas media to spread anti-government messages among the public."I wanted to ... mislead internet users into hating our country's current social system and into sharing my own sense of dissatisfaction with society, in order to inculcate hopes of changing the current social order with the goal of subverting our country's current social order," Jiang said in the footage. He wore a short-sleeved white shirt and sat alone in the middle of the court.Jiang is one of the last lawyers and activists detained in relation to a crackdown that began in July 2015 to go on trial. Critics say the campaign is aimed at snuffing out any potential opposition to the ruling Communist Party.In remarks available to watch on video on the court's Sina Weibo microblog account, Jiang said he felt remorse for his "criminal behavior" and that he deserved "whatever punishment I get.""I also hope that those so-called human rights activists and lawyers who hold the same ideas as I used to can learn lessons from my case and from today's trial," he said. "Don't do things like this; these kinds of things do cause serious damage to our country, our society and hurt our families."Frances Eve, a Hong Kong-based researcher at the Network of Chinese Human Rights Defenders, called Tuesday's hearing "a pre-written piece of theater" and said that "as expected under the circumstances, Jiang confessed at the end.""He was held in a secret location for six months and never given access to the lawyers hired by his family. Any confession under these circumstances wouldn't hold up in a truly independent court," Eve said.Courts in China are controlled by the Communist Party and convictions are virtually assured. Human rights groups and victims say the extraction of coerced confessions, sometimes through the use of physical and psychological torture, is common, despite being banned by Chinese law.Jiang was taken away by state security agents in November and in March purportedly gave an interview to a state newspaper and was shown on state TV saying that he had made up a story about a lawyer, Xie Yang, being tortured. Jiang's wife and rights groups said the supposed confessions were false, and his legal team questioned how reporters were able to meet with Jiang when his relatives and lawyers were not.Xie was released in May after pleading guilty to charges of incitement to subversion and disturbing legal proceedings, and telling the same court he hadn't been tortured or forced into giving a confession. Xie's wife, who fled to the U.S., called the trial a sham and the U.S. State Department said Xie's confession "appeared to be given under duress."Jiang was a lawyer who took on politically sensitive cases, and defended blind activist Chen Guangcheng and followers of the outlawed Falun Gong spiritual group. He was disbarred in 2009, and became an activist and helped publicize the plight of lawyers arrested in the crackdown that began in July 2015.Jiang was initially charged with subversion of state power, but it was downgraded to the lesser charge of incitement, which is often punished with time served while under investigation. A sentence will be announced at a later, unspecified date.Vaguely defined subversion-related charges are frequently leveled against rights activists and perceived political foes of the Communist Party.Jiang's friend, former lawyer Liu Xiaoyuan, said that Jiang's case was being dealt with much faster than that of other lawyers, such as Wang Quanzhang, who has been detained since 2015.Liu said the unusual broadcasting of clips of the case on Sina Weibo meant there was an expectation Jiang would admit guilt.Despite it being billed as an "open" trial by the court, Liu said a lawyer had applied to attend the hearing but was refused, and that authorities had blocked off the roads surrounding the court.Diplomats from the embassies of the U.K., Canada, Switzerland, the Netherlands, the U.S. and Germany had sought to attend Jiang's trial, but were prevented from getting even close to the courthouse because of the sealed-off roads, a Western diplomat said on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the case.___AP writer Gillian Wong and news assistant Fu Ting contributed to this report.Load-Date: August 23, 2017End of Document

China blocks access to 'sacred' mountain near North KoreaUPISeptember 14, 2017 Thursday 11:13 AM ESTCopyright 2017 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 323 wordsByline: ELIZABETH SHIMDateline: Sept. 14 BodyPublic access to the Changbaishan National Nature Reserve in China, also known as Mount Paektu in North Korea, has been partly blocked out of safety concerns, according to a South Korean newspaper.Donga Ilbo reported Thursday that Chinese authorities have temporarily closed parts of the national park in northeastern Jilin Province amid rising fears in the region about radioactive contamination, following North Korea's sixth nuclear test on Sept. 3.The area that is no longer accessible to the public is located about 70 miles from Punggye-ri, the North Korean nuclear site where Pyongyang recently detonated a bomb that may have released as much as 250 kilotons of energy, according to U.S. experts.The announcement on the shutdown was posted to Weibo -- the Chinese social network that most closely resembles Twitter -- on Thursday."For the safety and convenience of travelers, we have temporarily closed the southern tourist zone of Changbai Mountain," authorities said. "Officials are thoroughly investigating the safety of the tourist area."Chinese authorities also said the area will remain closed until "the potential risks disappear."Falling rocks have been causing problems but the northern and western zones of the national park are to remain open, they added.Chinese commenters said online they fear the worst, following the test.China had been repairing facilities around Changbai Mountain for four years, and commenters said it is unfortunate the park must close because of North Korea's provocation.Speculation is rising in China whether falling rocks at the mountain are the result of the test, according to the Donga.Commenters said the Chinese government was blocking reply messages to the announcement.The Changbaishan National Nature Reserve is considered the official birthplace of former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il.The mountain sits on the border between North Korea and China and is accessible from both sides.Load-Date: August 27, 2020End of Document

China Thriving In Technology Sector Despite Strict Internet Censorship PoliciesThe FrontrunnerOctober 17, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 400 wordsBodyThe New York Times (10/16, Myers, Wee, Subscription Publication, 13.56M) reports the US and other nations have long viewed Beijing's "heavy-handed censorship as a sign of China's weakness and a barrier to its development," but as other nations similarly "begin to discuss potential internet restrictions and pressure technology companies to do more in the wake of Russian interference, some in China instead see it as a powerful affirmation of the country's vision for the internet." Despite China's aggressive enforcement of "stringent limits on online content," it "has prospered" technologically. In fact, "China is now embarking on an ambitious project to dominate fields like artificial intelligence, and some say China could be at an advantage." To other nations, the Times says, "China may offer an enticing top-down model that suggests technology can thrive even under the government's thumb."Communist Party Congress Expected To Reveal Extent Of Xi's Power.The Los Angeles Times (10/16, Meyers, 4.49M) says the elders in China's Communist Party selected Xi Jinping to lead "largely because" they believed "they could control him," but Xi is instead "solidifying his role as the most authoritarian leader since Mao Tse-tung." In the five years since he took office, "Xi has driven out rivals, installed himself as head of key committees, overhauled the military, launched an aggressive foreign policy and silenced activists." The Times says the beginning of the party congress on Wednesday will not only launch Xi's second five-year term, but also "indicate the breadth of his command" and "determine whether Xi's concepts are enshrined in party orthodoxy." Furthermore, if the congress fails to "anoint the country's next leader, who will take control in five years," then it opens "the possibility that Xi will find a way to stay on past a decade."WSJournal: Central Control Over Chinese Economy Expanding Under Xi.Citing Chinese government officials, advisers, business leaders, and economists, the Wall Street Journal (10/16, Wei, Subscription Publication, 6.45M) says at China's Communist Party congress this week, Xi is expected to gain even more authority to pursue state control over the economy. Economists cautioned that increased state intervention and decreased pro-market economic policies, coupled with Xi's commitment to ideological purity, threaten to slow China's economic growth.Load-Date: October 17, 2017End of Document

China's bitcoin crackdown forces exchanges to close. The price is crashingCNNMoney.comSeptember 15, 2017 Friday 9:05 AM ESTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHNOLOGYLength: 376 wordsByline: Rishi IyengarBodyChina's bitcoin crackdown is wreaking havoc on the virtual currency.Two of the country's most prominent bitcoin exchanges, BTC China and Via BTC, said they will halt trading this month. BTC China has also stopped registering new users, it said in a statement posted on social media.Both exchanges said the decision to cease trading was triggered by an announcement by Chinese authorities last week banning initial coin offerings (ICOs), in which companies issue "digital" tokens similar to shares in exchange for bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.There have also been reports that China is preparing a wider crackdown on bitcoin trading amid concerns that it is being used for money laundering.The increased scrutiny has caused the value of bitcoin to crash. It was down 7% on Friday and has fallen more than 20% in a week after rising above $4,000 in August.All Chinese bitcoin exchanges have been told to announce by midnight Friday when they will shut down, according to prominent Chinese business publication Caixin.Bitcoin's perceived anonymity has been an important part of its growing appeal but also exposes the currency to claims that it is linked to the drug trade and other illegal activities.Earlier this year, officials from China's finance ministry conducted spot checks on various exchanges to ensure they were following local regulations.Analysts say operators may now be bracing for tougher action."The Chinese government might have felt that their softly-softly approach earlier in the year was too light touched and might be looking to make a sterner reproach this time," said Charles Hayter, CEO of CryptoCompare, a digital currency comparison website. "Heads could roll in this one."China's central bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.China isn't alone in sounding the alarm about bitcoin. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, the country's top regulator, warned this week that investors in the virtual currency should be "prepared to lose your entire stake."That sentiment was echoed by one of the top names in finance: JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon labelled bitcoin "stupid" and "far too dangerous" in a speech Tuesday."It won't end well," he added. "It's a fraud."-- Serenitie Wang contributed to this reportLoad-Date: September 16, 2017End of Document

It was down 7% on Friday and has fallen more than 20% in a week after rising above $4,000 in August.All Chinese bitcoin exchanges have been told to announce by midnight Friday when they will shut down, according to prominent Chinese business publication Caixin.Bitcoin's perceived anonymity has been an important part of its growing appeal but also exposes the currency to claims that it is linked to the drug trade and other illegal activities. Earlier this year, officials from China's finance ministry conducted spot checks on various exchanges to ensure they were following local regulations. Analysts say operators may now be bracing for tougher action. "The Chinese government might have felt that their softly-softly approach earlier in the year was too light touched and might be looking to make a sterner reproach this time," said Charles Hayter, CEO of CryptoCompare, a digital currency comparison website. "Heads could roll in this one." China's central bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.China isn't alone in sounding the alarm about bitcoin. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, the country's top regulator, warned this week that investors in the virtual currency should be "prepared to lose your entire stake." That sentiment was echoed by one of the top names in finance: JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon labelled bitcoin "stupid" and "far too dangerous" in a speech Tuesday. "It won't end well," he added. "It's a fraud." -- Serenitie Wang contributed to this report TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.Load-Date: September 16, 2017End of Document

Trump Blocks China-funded Acquisition Of US Firm Over Security RisksLive Briefs PRO Global MarketsSeptember 14, 2017 Thursday 9:46 AM ESTCopyright 2017 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 314 wordsBody President Donald Trump has blocked the proposed acquisition of a US semiconductor company by a US-based and China-funded private equity firm, citing national security concerns.White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that the President issued an order prohibiting the acquisition of Lattice Semiconductor Corp by, among others, China Venture Capital Fund Corp Ltd.CVCF is a Chinese corporation owned by Chinese state-owned entities that manages industrial investments and venture capital.Canyon Bridge Capital Partners had announced in November last year the USD1.3 billion acquisition plan of Lattice using the fund of CVCF. It was later agreed to by the shareholders of the Oregon-based semiconductor maker.Canyon Bridge said in the statement announcing the acquisition that it gets its capital from limited partners in China. That includes a firm called Yitai Capital, a Hong Kong company whose parent is China Venture Capital Fund, according to the White House order.The Purchasers and Lattice have been directed to provide a certification of termination of the proposed transaction to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US.The White House said Trump reached this decision after considering relevant factors and reviewing a recommendation from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US.Trump issued this order under the Defense Production Act, which authorizes the President to prohibit acquisitions of an American business by a foreign entity if there is credible evidence that it threatens the country's national security.The national security risk posed by the transaction relates to the potential transfer of intellectual property to the foreign acquirer, the Chinese government's role in supporting this transaction, the importance of semiconductor supply chain integrity to the US Government, and the use of Lattice products by the US, Sanders said.Load-Date: October 18, 2017End of Document

The solution provides a unified framework to integrate private and public clouds into an open-sourced platform. Cloud providers in Western Europe leverage this solution to drive city administration innovation and meet government customers' service needs. When connected to an Internet of Things (IoT) network, the solution effectively improves city operation, administration, and maintenance (OAM). With the support of Big Data technology, the solution enables real-time command, allows intelligent traffic management, and proactively prevents public safety incidents.Huawei's Government Cloud Solution exchanges information between government departments and offers public services to residents. Huawei utilizes its unique advantages in cloud operating system kernel and hardware to provide solution performance and reliability that open-sourced versions can never have. In addition, the solution decouples applications from data, permitting multiple departments to share updated data in real time. This laid a foundation for smart government applications, such as unified planning, proactive protection, real-time command, precise operation, and collaborative administration innovation.At present, Huawei's Government Cloud Solution ranks top in China's market according to an IDC MarketScape evaluation report on Chinese Government cloud market and vendors. Outside China, Huawei is serving more than 100 government customers across over 80 countries. The innovative Cloud Service Platform Huawei launched this time helps governments and government cloud service providers to develop cloud applications, migrate services to clouds, improve cloud operation, and enhance customer abilities.

In that same post, Xu claimed, "feminism is what ugly women and stupid women use to repress beautiful women and traditional women." Facing criticism for these remarks, Professor Feng refused to apologize--"not even in ten lives," he said--and millionaire Xu doubled down, calling feminists "dogs."Given that members of China's intellectual and business elites feel comfortable expressing views like this in public, it is no surprise to hear that the country is lagging behind in gender equality. According to a report by World Economic Forum, China now ranks 100th out of 144 countries for gender parity, falling for nine consecutive years since 2008, when it ranked 57th. The country also ranked 105th in terms of female representation among legislators, senior officials and managers. The Party Congress, just concluded, was marked by a striking absence of females in top political posts.Biased views such as those expressed by Feng and Xu--that women are less intellectually capable than men or that women's place is in the home--contribute to the lack of women in top jobs. These views hinder women's professional advancement even before they enter the workforce. A 2014 survey of 66 top universities in China by the Beijing-based NGO Media Monitor Network for Women showed that 59 percent of the schools' admission processes were discriminatory on a gender basis. Some had set gender ratio restrictions favoring male students. A 2015 survey of 1600 employees at academic institutions showed that the views that women are "weak in research ability, thinking and vision" and "lack ambition and passion" are widely shared in academia. Discrimination continued after graduation: Another 2014 study by the All-China Women's Federation showed that 87 percent of female college graduates reported that they had suffered discrimination on the basis of gender while looking for work, including through job advertisements excluding women or stating a preference for male applicants.China's constitution guarantees equal rights between men and women, and Chinese law prohibits gender discrimination--but these laws are rarely enforced. It is time that the Chinese government takes gender equality seriously.

Left with us we wouldn't have taken out these apps." Tim Cook said."Although, like in some other state we normally comply with rules every-time we engage in business."Mr Cook said, comparing this to their decision to refuse to open a terrorist's iPhone was different.He said. "This quite different.""Like the proceeding in the US, authority in the US backed us. I was much open. In the condition of China, the rule is very much open here as well. Like we would if the US altered the rules here, then we have to comply with them in both matters."To run a VPN service in the territory, firms must be given permission by the Chinese government.We are disappointed - ExpressVPNFirm without authorization, like ExpressVPN, would be taken removed from Apple's App Store.The ExpressVPN said in a blog post. "We're saddened by this incident, as it shows an extreme critical measure the Chinese authority has taken to prevent the usage of VPNs until present time.""In this exact matter, we are optimistic that with time the restriction we're facing will be removed because advancement needs freedom to connect and co-function."Load-Date: August 7, 2017End of Document

Walter B. Jones:Congressman Walter B. Jones (NC-3) is thanking President Donald Trump for blocking the sale of Lattice Semiconductor Corporation to, among others, China Venture Capital Fund Corporation Limited (CVCF). Lattice Semiconductor is an American company that makes programmable logic chips. These chips are critical to American military applications, and are also used in industrial settings. CVCF is a Chinese corporation owned by Chinese state-owned entities that manages industrial investments and venture capital. In blocking the acquisition, President Trump found that the proposed deal posed a national security risk related to "the potential transfer of intellectual property to the foreign acquirer, the Chinese government's role in supporting this transaction, the importance of semiconductor supply chain integrity to the United States Government, and the use of Lattice products by the United States Government.""I would like to thank the president and his administration for standing up for our national security," said Congressman Jones. "The American people do not want to see important domestic capabilities, particularly those that are vital to our military, sold into the hands of countries like China."After the proposed acquisition was first announced in November, 2016, Congressman Jones and 21 of his House colleagues urged the Obama administration to initiate a formal federal review of the transaction, and to consider blocking it due to the risks it posed to national security. That review, conducted under the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) process outlined in section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, culminated in the President Trump's September 13th announcement blocking the deal.

Chinese developers file complaint against Apple for 4.3 design spam guidelinePR NewswireSeptember 18, 2017 Monday 8:00 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 558 wordsDateline: CUPERTINO, CA, Sept. 18, 2017 BodyFair-In law firm filed a new complaint against Apple's unreasonable App Store review guidelines on behalf of 31 local developers in China.On August 8th, Daxiao,a Chinese law firm, lodged a complaint with the Chinese government about Apple removing apps from its App Storewithout a detailed explanation of its unreasonable 4.3 Review Guideline.Things are getting much more serious. There are more than 31 developers complaining about Apple's unreasonable4.3 App Store review guideline. Xu Yun, a lawyer from Chinese Fair-In law firm, said: "We have formally filed this complaint with China's State Administration for Industry and Commerce and hope it can be resolved soon."According to the lawyer, this guideline is vague and subjective depending on how each Apple reviewer feels. The application of this guideline is also erratic and random.While reviewers remove many apps with similar design for different markets, they leave many untouched. The lawyer said: "If you search "Toyota dealer", you will find many apps using the same design as Toyota's app, like Ford, Honda, Hyundai, GM, Chrysler, etc. This also happens to apps like Days Inn. They are all the same but none of them get removed. This is a clear violation of Apple's 4.3 spam policy and obviously it is unfair to other developers. ""If Apple looks into these 31 developers carefully, they will easily find that all these apps target different people and each one has its own database. Also these apps were approved before but got removed suddenly without giving any detailed reason. Our developers have tried many times to communicate with Apple but still don't know the reason. If Apple wants others to obey their rules, maybe they should follow their policy first," Xu Yun said.A developer also pointed out that, "We believe that the 4.3 rule is really confusing and unreasonable. After getting removed, we changed the app design according to Apple's 4.3 reviewing rule and submitted to Apple but the status is still waiting for review for over 3 weeks without any explanation. Apple just ignores its developers even if they are doing their best to satisfy Apple now? Apple also requests developers to put their 2 or 3 apps into one container even though those apps target different groups of users. Putting them into one container only confuses all users with very bad user experiences!"Steve Jobs had been relentless in trying hard to provide users around the world with the best product and best user experiences - not just unique design. In fact, he failed many times early in his career when he tried to be just unique. We don't think Steve would agree with the current Apple practice of sacrificing product quality and user experiences in exchange for having different looking products.  In fact, many of the removed apps provide much better product quality and user experiences than the untouched apps. The traffic and user-retention rates for them are much higher. The market decides the winners, not Apple's unique-design-crazy reviewers.Mobile platforms iOS, Android and Windows are fighting over developers. Apple is driving away tons of developers due to its misleading policy of focusing on the look, instead of the product quality and user-experiences. It is time for Apple to make the "right" decision now before being deserted by more and more developers.SOURCE Xu YunCONTACT: Media Xu Yun, phone number: +86 15982147765, email address: 347926303@qq.comLoad-Date: September 19, 2017End of Document

SECRETARY OF STATE DENNIS RICHARDSON'S FIRST INTERNATIONAL TRADE MISSIONStates News ServiceSeptember 27, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 706 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: SALEM, OR BodyThe following information was released by the Oregon Secretary of State:At the invitation of Tianjin, China, I will lead an Oregon trade delegation to China. The delegation will depart from Portland on November 8, 2017 and return on November 20. Tianjin (population 15.5 million), is Oregon's sister-state/city and is located 35 minutes southeast of Beijing by bullet train.Although this will be my 12th delegation to China, it will be my first international delegation as Oregon's Secretary of State. The delegation has two primary purposes:1. Oregon small, medium, and large businesses have been offered an opportunity to display "Oregon's Finest" products in China-Tianjin International Sister City Pavilion. This eCommerce platform is the result of years of hard work by Jin Lan, President of Oregon-China Sister State Relations Council (OCSSRC), to increase Oregon exports to Chinese consumers via the internet. Jin Lan is also the delegation organizer. For more information, visit the OCSSRC website. The Pavilion will give Oregon businesses the opportunity to reach millions of Chinese consumers without the expense and uncertainty of warehousing huge stocks of inventory in China.2. Oregon Business Promotion - While in China, Oregon business leaders traveling with the delegation will meet with consumers, distributors, and Chinese government officials. Relationships are important in Chinese culture, and having the opportunity to meet face-to-face with their Chinese counterparts will be an invaluable networking and business development opportunity.Henry Lawrence, a young Oregon entrepreneur, will be a part of the delegation. Henry graduated from the University of Oregon last year with a major in Chinese language and Finance. Using his website (henryforest.net), language skills, and social media, he markets to Chinese tourists who are interested in "destination vacations" that focus on attending major US sporting events.Like Henry, if you have an interest in marketing your business products or services to Chinese consumers and would like to join the delegation, check out OCSSRC's website.OCSSRC is an Oregon non-profit 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization dedicated to promoting the mutual interests of Oregon and China. I helped organize the OCSSRC in 2004 and remain the Registered Agent. Although I haven't had much involvement since 2012, OCSSRC graciously offered to pay my transportation expenses to and from China, but to avoid any appearance of undue-influence, I will be paying for the round-trip economy fare from the Secretary of State travel budget. Since I have Type 1 Diabetes and blood circulation health considerations, I will be upgrading my seat on the 12-hour flight using my own funds. Once in China, as part of their international outreach budgets the local Chinese government organizations cover the costs of American officials. Thus, other than the cost of the airfare ($523) for an economy seat, my expenses for this delegation will not be paid from Oregon public funds.For the record, I have received no financial benefit from any of the 11 previous delegations to China, and I will receive none from this trip. I own no interest in any company attending any of these delegations and I have never received any compensation from OCSSRC. My payment is the personal satisfaction I get from helping Oregon businesses grow their markets and from inviting Chinese investors, tourists, and officials to discover Oregon's culture and beauty.When I lead delegations to China, I often conclude our meetings with this friendly, light-hearted invitation:"Come to Oregon! When you come to Oregon, you will experience real American adventures; meet real Americans, and buy your souvenirs duty-freeairports may have a duty-free store, but Oregon is a duty-free state."Are these international delegations worthwhile? Since my first delegation to China in 2002, China has become Oregon's #1 export destination, up from #15. Chinese tourists have become Oregon's #1 source of international visitors. I take no credit for such successes, but if my efforts contributed even a small part, that would make them worthwhile to Oregon businesses and to me.Expect a full report about the trip in December.Dennis RichardsonLoad-Date: October 26, 2017End of Document

East to West - The Chinese Model gains traction in the global manufacturing industryPR NewswireDecember 24, 2017 Sunday 10:50 PM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 861 wordsDateline: QINGDAO, China, Dec. 24, 2017 Body The New York-based Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) announced a proposal to develop an international mass customization standard led by Chinese electronics manufacturer Haier at the National Engineering and Scientific Commission (Nescom) Conference held on December 6, local time. It is the first international standard created by IEEE based on the model and to serve as its technical framework since the organization was launched over 50 years ago. It is also the first time the development of an international standard was led by a Chinese company. This is yet another opportunity for China to showcase the Chinese Model, a third component of the redefining of the term "Made in China", in addition to Chinese Product and Chinese Brand.Currently, governments are focusing on and supporting the fast-growing digital-enabled industrial production and investment sectors. The world's manufacturing industry is looking for the best path to the next stage of its transformation, with IEEE providing a universal and scalable approach for upgrading manufacturing processes worldwide. The aim is to accelerate the progress of the new industrial revolution.Why is China being the one to provide what becomes the selected standard? When it comes to the topic of the new industrial revolution, China, Germany and the USA are the countries coming up with their ideas. However, the ideas that end up getting the most traction, and becoming the trendsetter, these days, are practices developed in China.In 2016, Dr. Winfried Felser, deputy managing director of the management and application center for logistics business at Germany-based Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, said in his article published in The Huffington Post that "In the Industry 4.0 era, our efforts relied heavily on linear thinking, automation and the "efficiency trap"..., however, it will take both human-centric solutions and digitalization to help Germany win and strengthen its leadership position in the world." Industry 4.0 critic Prof. Andreas Syska pointed out that "the human-centric Society 4.0 is bound to replace the technology-focused Industry 4.0."American freelance writer Chris Neiger said in the3 Reasons Trump Should Worry IoT Investorspublished in The Motley Fool, a leading US-based financial information website for investors, in January 2017, that there is "pressure on manufacturing companies to keep people employed in jobs that could instead be automated with IoT tech.... If the Trump administration backs away from IoT investments, expect China's lead on the U.S. to widen even further."  By contrast, Haier, an iconic Chinese company, incorporates the user of the product into the industrial system and considers him or her as the core, the major player and the driver in the industrial transformation process. In addition, the company empowers the user to be a part of every step throughout the creation process with the aim of moving from Zero to One and transforming from mass manufacturing to mass customization.It should be noted that the definition of mass customization is different from the concept of customization. Mass customization does not refer to the low production efficiency at a manual workshop and goes beyond providing the end user with module options. Instead, it allows the user to participate in the innovation process and the result of that process as well as benefit from the value generated throughout the life cycle.  In fact, the concept, originally called the Prosumer concept, originated in the USA. As early as 1970, American futurologist Alvin Toffler presented the idea of mass customization in his bookFuture Shock. Later, the idea took root and began to mature in China.As for the reasons behind the trend, an industry watcher noted that "Industry 4.0 is not the reindustrialization of industry. It represents the socialization of industry and especially, the mass socialization. The trend is fully embodied in Haier's practices."In 2005, Haier announced therendanheyibusiness model, which transforms users to lifelong users and reshapes employees as creators. In addition, the model creates a long-term cooperation, co-creation and win-win relationship among users, employees and the brand rather than the one-time buyer-seller relationship.The management change creates an ideal structural and cultural environment for mass customization. However, it is not likely to gain acceptance in European and American companies that rely heavily on linear management. The creation of therendanheyimodel by Haier paves the way for the development of the mass customization model, which gives users an opportunity to engage in every step of the process on Haier's platform.Nowadays, technology reduces the distance between point A and point B anywhere on this planet. The One Belt, One Road initiative creates favorable conditions for the East to meet the West. "Made in China" is accelerating the transformation from Chinese Product, Chinese Brand to Chinese Model. View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/east-to-west---the-chinese-model-gains-traction-in-the-global-manufacturing-industry-300575215.htmlSOURCE HaierCONTACT: Yunjie Li, +86-18561509919, 3040437593@qq.comLoad-Date: December 25, 2017End of Document

Tongji University establishes the Research Center of Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Venture Financing; - The center to soon release the world's first index reflecting the status of innovation, entrepreneurship and venture finance in ChinaPR NewswireNovember 24, 2017 Friday 2:22 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 567 wordsDateline: SHANGHAI, Nov. 24, 2017 BodyTwo institutes at Tongji University, The School of Economics and Management (Tongji SEM) and the Advanced Institute of Business Research (AIBR), in concert with Shenzhen CDF-Capital, a private equity and venture capital firm, have established the Research Center of Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Venture Financing at Tongji University. In May 2018, the world's first Index of Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Venture Financing will make its worldwide debut, concurrent with the staging of the International Exhibition of Innovation and Entrepreneurship.The index is compiled based on multi-dimensional data resources and an algorithmic model designed to examine the efforts of the Chinese government in this domain in combination with macroeconomic fundamentals, the number of resources available for technological innovation and the relative strength of the resources, the level of maturity and activity across both the Chinese economy as a whole, as well as across the country's financial markets and its venture financing sector, in addition to analyzing the social environment, providing policymakers, practitioners, academics and educators with information about the multi-dimensional characteristics of the nature of innovation, entrepreneurship and venture financing across China.Tongji University vice president Prof. Jiang Bo said the university plans to support the new research center with all available resources. With the Research Center of Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Venture Financing serving as a platform that enables the cross-integration and ongoing development of departments and disciplines, Tongji University will facilitate the cross-integration and development of SEM with other institutes at the school in a move to promote a deeper integration of and cooperation between industry, academe and the world of R&D. In addition, Tongji University will continue to upgrade the model for the training of talent, increase its investment in social development, enhance international cooperation and exchanges, as well as drive the development of innovative schools as well as of China's World-class Universities and First-class Disciplines program, a government initiative to elevate the quality of education at Chinese universities and colleges.Dean of SEM, professor at the university and an expert in innovation and entrepreneurship research, Li Yuan, believes the Index of Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Venture Financing will help build a big data center that provides essential data about innovation, entrepreneurship and venture financing by leveraging the research findings across a wide spectrum of disciplines, including economic management, information technology as well as humanities and social sciences. Tongji University and SEM plan to capitalize on the expertise of international experts to focus on concerns in respect specifically to China and, at a later stage, the innovation, entrepreneurship and venture financing issues facing the countries targeted by the One Belt, One Road initiative with the aim of creating a new model that facilitates cooperation among research organizations, universities and industry leaders.View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tongji-university-establishes-the-research-center-of-innovation-entrepreneurship-and-venture-financing-300561475.htmlSOURCE School of Economics and Management, Tongji UniversityCONTACT: Chen Lei, +86-13651756198, helena_sem@tongji.edu.cnLoad-Date: November 25, 2017End of Document

Rights report urges China to ban gay conversion therapyAssociated Press InternationalNovember 15, 2017 Wednesday 3:24 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 546 wordsByline: By YI-LING LIU, Associated PressDateline: HONG KONG BodyHONG KONG (AP) - The Chinese government should stop hospitals and other medical facilities from subjecting LGBT people to conversion therapy that in some cases has involved electroshock, involuntary confinement and forced medication, a human rights group said Wednesday.The report released by New York-based Human Rights Watch, based on interviews with 17 people subjected to the widely criticized techniques since 2009, comes as awareness has grown in China regarding the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.Homosexuality was removed from China's official list of mental illnesses more than 15 years ago, but stories of families enrolling their relatives in treatments seeking to change their sexual orientation remain common.The report says many victims of conversion therapy were forcibly brought to hospitals by their families, which became the subject of a groundbreaking lawsuit earlier this year.Chinese society continues to strongly favor children who can pass on their family name, and since same-sex marriage is not legal and same-sex couples may not adopt jointly, gay and lesbian people feel compelled to enter heterosexual marriages and have children.China also has no laws protecting people from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, which deters victims of conversion therapy from seeking justice out of fear that their sexual orientation will be made public.Under guidelines issued by the National Health Committee, the government is required to investigate activities by hospitals that could violate the Mental Health Law, which prohibits forced confinement of people unless they pose a danger to others. But the government has yet to issue clear guidelines prohibiting conversion therapy and holding abusers accountable.While the authorities no longer round up and prosecute homosexuals, the scope of public activism by LGBT rights groups is restricted and the depiction of gay people on television and popular web streaming services is banned.Despite that, activists say there has been progress on LGBT rights."In recent years, China has become increasingly liberal and open to LGBT people," said Wang Long, an LGBT activist from Zhejiang province.Shanghai has hosted an annual gay pride parade since 2009 and internet censors have tolerated increasingly open debate about LGBT issues.In July, a gay man successfully sued a mental hospital over forced conversion therapy, in what activists hailed as the first such victory for the LGBT community. The court in Zhumadian in Henan province ordered a city psychiatric hospital to publish an apology in local newspapers and pay the 38-year-old man 5,000 yuan ($750) in compensation.The man, surnamed Yu, had been forcibly confined to the institution in 2015 by his wife and relatives and was diagnosed with "sexual preference disorder." He was forced to take medicine and receive injections until he was released 19 days later.However, a single lawsuit is not enough to deter the practice of conversion therapy, Human Rights Watch and activists say.The practice of conversion therapy persists because "many doctors are ignorant about homosexuality, and just follow the mainstream opinion, which is that being gay is abnormal, a sickness that must be treated," Wang said.Load-Date: November 15, 2017End of Document

STANFORD STUDENT AMONG THE INTERNATIONAL SCHOLARS AWARDED A 2018 RHODES SCHOLARSHIPStates News ServiceDecember 8, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 397 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: STANFORD, Calif. BodyThe following information was released by Stanford University:By Kathleen J. SullivanQitong "Thomas" Cao, who is simultaneously earning a bachelor's degree in political science and a master's degree in management science and engineering, with a focus on computational social science, has been named a 2018 Rhodes Scholar.He will pursue a master's degree in Social Science of the Internet at Oxford.Cao, who was born and raised in Nanjing, China, and will represent China as a Rhodes Scholar, was one of 63 international scholars chosen from around the world for Rhodes Scholarships, which are considered one of the oldest and most celebrated international fellowships in the world. He is the first Rhodes Scholar from China whose bachelor's degree is not from a Chinese university.Qitong Thomas Cao (Image credit: Courtesy Qitong Cao)Rhodes Scholarships provide all expenses for two or three years of study at the University of Oxford in England and, in some instances, may allow funding for four years. Rhodes Scholars are chosen for their scholarly achievements, character, commitment to others and to the common good, and leadership potential.Cao and the other international scholars will join the 32 scholars selected as 2018 Rhodes Scholars from the United States, including four students with Stanford affiliations. Each year, the Rhodes Trust selects 95 scholars from the United States and 20 other jurisdictions (64 countries). The 2018 Rhodes Scholars will enter Oxford in October.At Stanford, Cao is a senior honors student in the Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law, which bridges the worlds of scholarship, policy and practice to understand and advance the conditions for just, democratic and sustainable development around the world. In his research, Cao applies formal models and statistical methods to study internet governance in different political systems. In his honors thesis, Cao is examining how the construction of a domestic cyberspace in China helps the Chinese government overcome the information dilemma facing authoritarian regimes."I am extremely grateful for my professors in the Political Science Department and the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies who have encouraged me to pursue my passion in social science research," said Cao, who has conducted quantitative social science research at the World Bank and at Google.Load-Date: December 8, 2017End of Document

Robert Pittenger:Today, President Donald Trump used his authority to block the proposed Chinese takeover of Lattice Semiconductor, the third-largest American producer of critical technology for U.S. military applications.In December, Congressman Robert Pittenger (NC-09) launched a bipartisan effort urging the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to block the transaction. A coalition of 21 Members of Congress supported Congressman Pittenger's effort.Today's decision is based on a recommendation by CFIUS."We are not opposed to all Chinese investments, but we must be aware of the Chinese government's strategic, systematic effort to infiltrate key American infrastructure through what appear to be benign business transactions," said Congressman Pittenger. "Granting China direct access to key military technology, the U.S. financial system, and other soft-power targets is simply unwise. The global economy creates new national security risks not faced by previous generations."In addition to his effort to block the Lattice Semiconductor takeover, Congressman Pittenger has led Congressional efforts to block the proposed Chinese takeover of the Chicago Stock Exchange and MoneyGram.Congressman Pittenger is also working with Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX) on bicameral legislation to modernize the CFIUS process, which hasn't been substantially updated since the 1970s.Congressman Pittenger serves as Vice Chairman of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance and Chairman of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism.Load-Date: September 14, 2017End of Document

Mobile-first China tackles cryptocurrenciesEturbo NewsNovember 8, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 eTurboNews, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 497 wordsDateline: U.S. BodyU.S., Nov. 8 -- The Chinese government's plans to launch its own digital currency, while clamping down on existing providers, could influence how travel is transacted in the future, reveals the Top 100 City Destination Ranking WTM London 2017 Edition.This September, the People's Bank of China introduces measured effectively declaring initial coin offerings (ICOs) illegal. ICOs are a way for startups to raise capital by selling digital tokens, similar to shares, to investors. The tokens can be bought using currency or other virtual currencies such as Bitcoin.The ICO market - described by Bloomberg as a cross between crowdfunding and an initial public offering - is unregulated.Earlier this year, the PBOC said it was planning to launch its own digital currency as part of the official money supply. The idea is that consumers will use the currency to buy goods and service via a digital wallet. This allows the Chinese economy to continue its digital revolution, while the PBOC keeps control over the financial market," Euromonitor International, the report's author, says.For travel, the implications are potentially far-reaching. "The impact on the travel industry could be immense, not only in the way people pay for travel, but also by simplifying loyalty schemes and through smart contracts," the report suggests.While cryptocurrencies are part of the future, the present is about mobile-first. China continues to innovate from a position of strength, particularly when it comes to the all-in-one app. The report highlights the breadth of options available to the 750 million users of WeChat as an example of how far mobile-first has developed."WeChat allows its users to find and book trips, check in for flights and hotels, contact customer services, book activities or restaurant tables, and scan QR codes to buy products or turn on the lights or TV in their smart hotel room," the report explains.Multi-functionality within apps increasingly important, it continues, as "80% of our time is spent on just three apps."The "mobile first mindset" is spreading, the report adds, to China's Asian neighbours, including Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand. "Governments and consumers in developing economies are turning to the mobile device to establish digital connectivity because of the cheaper network investment and falling mobile device prices," it said.WTM London, Senior Director, Simon Press, said: "China's influence on travel goes beyond the 100 million plus outbound travellers it contributes to the global travel industry. It has led the way with mobile development and is now at the forefront of bringing digital currencies into the financial mainstream, and many aspects of travel as we know it might change as a result."eTN is a media partner for WTM.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from US Eturbo News.

More debt helps China keep its economy hummingCNNMoney.comOctober 18, 2017 Wednesday 3:55 AM ESTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ECONOMYLength: 378 wordsByline: Daniel ShaneBodyThere were no nasty surprises in China's latest growth figures.The world's second largest economy expanded 6.8% in the third quarter compared with the same period a year earlier, government data released Thursday showed. But experts cautioned that it was propped up by yet another credit binge.The growth number was in line with economists' forecasts. Few had expected any big shocks, since Thursday's figures coincided with the ruling Communist Party's national congress, a major political event that takes place just twice a decade. The party has prioritized economic stability in the run-up to the congress at which President Xi Jinping is expected to consolidate power as he begins his second five-year term.China's target for annual economic growth this year is 6.5% or higher. The country was comfortably on track to achieve that goal already after posting growth of 6.9% in the first two quarters of the year.But the numbers come with caveats.Experts and even Chinese government officials have repeatedly flagged doubts about the accuracy of the country's economic data. And analysts say the broadly stable growth figures over the past couple of years mask underlying issues, such as the heavy debt burden among Chinese companies.During his speech to the party congress Wednesday, Xi stressed the importance of cutting high levels of debt in the financial system and reforming inefficient state-owned enterprises. But economists have expressed doubts about the president's willingness to push through the tough changes they say are needed to deal with the problems.Gerard Burg, National Australia Bank's senior Asia economist, pointed out that third-quarter growth was supported by a hefty dose of new debt."As a result, China's already high debt-to-GDP ratio has expanded further -- posing some longer term risks to the economy," he wrote in a research note.The reforms could also be complicated by the expectation that China's giant economy is set to lose steam after a prolonged period of credit-fueled expansion."We continue to believe that growth momentum will slow in the coming months, the main drags being the cooling property sector, rising financing costs and uncertainty over external demand," Nomura analyst Yang Zhao said in a note to clients Thursday.Load-Date: October 20, 2017End of Document

ClipperData And Ursa Partner To Monitor China Refinery Demand; The combination of reliable storage and vessel-by-vessel cargo tracking to deliver unprecedented granular transparency of China's weekly crude oil demandPR NewswireOctober 26, 2017 Thursday 7:30 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 498 wordsDateline: NEW YORK, Oct. 26, 2017 Body ClipperData LLC, the global leader in crude oil and petroleum product cargo tracking, and Ursa Space Systems, the innovator in accurate and comprehensive global oil storage inventories, today announced a partnership to measure, track and report China's crude oil demand on a weekly basis."China is the world's largest consumer of crude oil, yet the market is highly opaque," says Abudi Zein, Chief Executive Officer at ClipperData. "We're going to shine a bright light on demand on a weekly basis."For those who wish to stay abreast of China's weekly demand profile, ClipperData and Ursa are launching their first new product, the China Refinery Demand Report. This proprietary weekly report relies on tracking crude oil storage inventories tank-by-tank for both China's Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) and commercial storage as well as imports cargo-by-cargo.  State-of-the-art technology operates under all conditions, eliminating the problems previously associated with cloud cover or darkness. By combining reliable oil storage measurements with the industry's best global cargo tracking system, the report delivers an accurate assessment of China's refinery consumption on a weekly basis.  These data provide an independent "hard data" assessment far in advance of Chinese government statistics, which frequently overstate demand and lag the market by a full month or more."This partnership is unique in that it will immediately deliver value to global oil traders," says Adam Maher, Chief Executive Officer of Ursa Space Systems.

Trump stops China-backed takeover of U.S. chip makerCNN WireSeptember 13, 2017 Wednesday 9:18 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 369 wordsByline: By Seth Fiegerman and Jackie WattlesDateline: NEW YORK (CNNMoney) BodyNEW YORK (CNNMoney) --  President Trump has stopped the takeover of an American chip maker by a private equity firm with ties to China.The deal, which would have seen China-backed Canyon Bridge Capital Partners acquire Lattice Semiconductors, was blocked over national security concerns."Today, consistent with the administration's commitment to take all actions necessary to ensure the protection of U.S. national security, the president issued an order prohibiting the acquisition," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement Wednesday.The national security risk included "the potential transfer of intellectual property" to the Chinese-backed company and the "Chinese government's role in supporting this transaction," according to Mnuchin's statement. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which reviews deals that could result in a foreign entity taking control of an American company, had previously recommended halting the deal.The business deal put Trump in the middle of a hot-button issue: Chinese investment in the United States.Both Lattice and Canyon Bridge had said the acquisition could have boosted American jobs, a core issue for the Trump administration. Lattice had said that Canyon Bridge currently employs 300 people in Oregon -- and Canyon Bridge has committed to adding 350 more if the takeover deal went through.In a statement Wednesday, Canyon Bridge said it is "obviously disappointed" by Trump's decision and called the proposed acquisition "an excellent deal" for Lattice and for "expanding the opportunity to keep jobs in America."Reps for Lattice did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Lattice stock fell nearly 2% in after hours trading following the news. Canyon Bridge says it's headquartered in California, but its website also lists a Beijing address and states, "Initial funding for Canyon Bridge comes from limited partners in China."The takeover was pegged as a $1.3 billion deal when it was first announced in November 2016.Chinese investment into U.S. firms so far in 2017 includes 83 deals worth about $25 billion, according to research firm Rhodium Group.TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

CHINA'S PARTY CONGRESS RAMPS UP CONTROLS HEIGHTENED 'STABILITY MAINTENANCE' BODES ILL FOR RIGHTS UNDER XI'S SECOND TERMStates News ServiceOctober 16, 2017 MondayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 439 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Sophie RichardsonChina Director SophieHRWThe Chinese Communist Party, set to open its twice-a-decade congress on October 18, is now in overdrive to increase, "stability maintenance" to ensure that nothing unexpected happens and nobody challenges its rule.But this clampdown on perceived "instability" to create the appearance of harmony merely hides the government's casual suppression of basic liberties and the rule of law.On October 11, a Zhejiang Science and Technology University student filed a police report after discovering that funds in a personal online payment account had been stolen. Two days later, the student received a written warning from the school: by dialing 110 the police hotline "without authorization," the student had, "seriously damaged the reputation" of the university. Similarly, a Shanghai apartment management company issued a notice informing residents not to dial 110 between September 30 and October 25 before and after the Party Congress.What's the problem with dialing 110? As shrewd netizens speculate, it alerts the police command center and thus reflects badly on the low-level authorities for having failed to contain "elements of instability," within their community especially when the high-level authorities are meeting.Authorities are also restricting certain ordinary behavior during the Party Congress, apparently perceiving them as threats to stability.In Beijing, some malls, nightclubs, and even gyms have temporarily shuttered. On October 11, home-sharing website Airbnb announced the cancellation of its Beijing city center bookings for the rest of October. This "state of war," as some local governments have called this week's measures, means restaurants in the city center have been ordered not to use fire or flame, sales of fireworks and other flammable products are prohibited, and self-service at gas stations has also been halted.In keeping with past practice, police across the country have detained or restricted the movement of human rights activists and lawyers. Even gatherings far from Beijing are affected: police have capped events at a maximum of 500 people during this period, leading to the cancellation of a film festival on Hainan Island more 2,300 kilometers from Beijing.Behind an image of confidence, the Chinese government's suppression of everyday freedoms reveals not only its insecurity, but also its growing impulse to control all aspects of society under President Xi Jinping. As Xi enters his second term as Communist Party chief, the future for human rights in China does not look promising.Load-Date: October 18, 2017End of Document

China Commercial Vehicle Exhaust Emission System Industry Report, 2017-2021PR NewswireNovember 9, 2017 Thursday 8:05 PM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 734 wordsDateline: LONDON, Nov. 9, 2017 Body Despite great controversy over the role of emission pollutants from motor vehicle in the haze across the country, the Chinese government has begun dealing with the source of pollution, putting the national Phase-5 pollutant emission standard for motor vehicle into effect on January 1, 2017. Increasingly stringent motor vehicle emission standards also drive rapid development of the vehicle exhaust after-treatment system sector. Take diesel EGR market for example, installations soared from 520,000 units in 2012 to 1.37 million units in 2016 in the Chinese diesel EGR market, and were expected to hit 1.94 million units in 2021, representing a CAGR of 7.21% between 2016 and 2021, as implementation of environmental policies is strengthened and the number of relevant exhaust treatment systems increases.Download the full report:https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3273440Under the backdrop of the implementation of National V emission standard and with overall consideration of technologies, costs and availability of associated products, China has primarily adopted European technology roadmap for its own diesel vehicles:SCR for medium and heavy commercial vehicles and EGR+DOC/POC for light commercial vehicles. 728,300 sets of SCR systems for medium and heavy commercial vehicles were installed in 2016, compared with 1.37 million sets of diesel EGR systems for light commercial vehicles, and 1.99 million sets of gasoline EGR systems.The commercial exhaust emission system sector presents several distinct technological routes. In SCR field, local Chinese enterprises gain the upper hand with Wuxi Weifu Lida Catalytic Converter, Wuxi Kailong High Technology and Zhejiang Yinlun Machinery ranking from second to fourth with a market share of 21%, 15% and 9%, respectively, while Cummins (22%) taking the first place and Tenneco (8%) holding the fifth position. Wuxi Weifu Lida Catalytic Converter boasts excellent SCR technical competence with perfect R&D and production capabilities for core components except carriers in the whole industry chains. Cummins provides mature solutions to exhaust after-treatment systems covering engine emission control module, OBD module, vehicle urea-injection module and SCR catalyst module.With regard to diesel EGR, Wuxi Longsheng Technology, BorgerWarner, Rheinmetall Automotive and Yibin TRD Auto Parts hold the lion's share, 31%, 30%, 24%, and 5% respectively. Wuxi Longsheng Technology provides a full range of products for EGR system including pneumatic and electric EGR valves meeting national emission standards, ECU suitable for off-road diesel engine, industry-leading tube-type and plate-fin EGR cooler, and supplementary pressure, temperature and gas sensors. BorgerWarner, a leader in the industry with a more complete product line for EGR system, developed an economical new series of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) coolers featuring a compact floating core in 2017. The product enhances coolant distribution for durable performance even with minimum coolant flow, while reducing NOX emissions.China Commercial Vehicle Exhaust Emission System Industry Report, 2017-2021 focuses on the followings:Development background, industry standards and policies, and major technological routes of commercial vehicle exhaust emission system industry;Development of SCR system and EGR system industries (system structure, market pattern, market size, and major carmakers supported);Development of downstream markets (commercial vehicle production and sales, bus and truck production and sales, as well as the prediction of production and sales volume);Nine major SCR system producers, six EGR system producers, and four POC/DOC catalyst producers in China (operation, related product business, latest developments, development in China (mainly foreign companies), and enterprises using relevant products, etc.)Download the full report:https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3273440About ReportbuyerReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishershttps://www.reportbuyer.comFor more information:Sarah SmithResearch Advisor at Reportbuyer.comEmail:query@reportbuyer.comTel: +44 208 816 85 48Website:http://www.reportbuyer.comView original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/china-commercial-vehicle-exhaust-emission-system-industry-report-2017-2021-300553554.htmlSOURCE ReportBuyerLoad-Date: November 10, 2017End of Document

Others reported difficulty sending images and video on the service, which is owned by Facebook and offers more privacy than government-monitored Chinese social media.Chinese authorities are tightening controls on social media ahead of the party congress next month at which President Xi Jinping is due to be appointed to a second five-year term as leader.The ruling party encourages internet use for education and business but tries to block access to material that calls for political change or is deemed to encourage protests.Since coming to power in 2012, Xi has promoted the notion of "internet sovereignty," or the right of Beijing and other governments to dictate what their publics can do and see online.Private sector operators of Chinese social media are required to delete banned material. China has the world's biggest population of internet users, with some 730 million people online.The agency that enforces online censorship, the Cyberspace Administration of China, didn't respond to questions sent by fax about whether Chinese regulators were causing the WhatsApp disruption.Facebook declined to comment. WhatsApp is one of the world's most popular messaging services, with over 1.2 billion users.On Monday, the internet agency announced it was fining the parent of the popular Chinese messaging service WeChat, Tencent Ltd., and two other social media services for failing to fully enforce censorship.The agency said WeChat, Sina Corp.'s microblog service Sina Weibo and search giant Baidu Inc.'s Tieba allowed users to post false rumors and material that was pornographic or threatened national security. The agency gave no figure for a penalty but cited a law under which violators can be fined up to 500,000 yuan ($75,000) or closed in the event they fail to correct a violation.Also this month, regulators announced that organizers of messaging groups would be held responsible for managing their content.Meanwhile, Beijing is cracking down on the use of virtual private networks - technology that creates encrypted links between computers and can be used to see blocked websites abroad.Regulators say only government-approved VPNs are allowed and how they can be used will be restricted, potentially cutting off millions of Chinese entrepreneurs and other individual users.Users of WhatsApp in China reported similar disruptions in July, prompting fears authorities were blocking access.Chinese filters block access to other global social media including Twitter, Facebook and YouTube without a VPN. Officials argue that such services operating beyond their control pose a threat to national security.Chinese authorities increasingly pay attention to encrypted messaging apps. Users in China switched to WhatsApp after authorities blocked access to another encrypted service, Telegraph, following a 2015 crackdown on lawyers and human rights activists.Load-Date: September 27, 2017End of Document

POLICE IN CHINA'S TIANJIN DETAIN SUPPORTERS AS COURT TRIES 'THE BUTCHER' IN SECRETStates News ServiceAugust 14, 2017 MondayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 1074 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:People milling around on the street flanked by security personnel outside the Tianjin No. 2 Intermediate People's Court ahead of the trial of activist Wu Gan, Aug. 14, 2017.RFAAuthorities in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin have detained at least 20 supporters of detained rights activist Wu Gan, known by his online nickname "The Butcher," who stood trial behind closed doors on charges of subversion on Monday , fellow activists said.Wu, 43, was initially detained in the eastern province of Jiangxi in 2015 and handed a 10-day administrative sentence before being placed under criminal detention on suspicion of "picking quarrels and stirring up trouble," "libel," and "incitement to subvert state power.""Wu Gan's subversion trial opens in secret today ," rights activist and Wu supporter Zhang Xuezhong wrote in a post to social media. "Everyone is predicting that he will receive a heavy sentence, owing to the fact that he has refused to capitulate since being detained."Video shot outside the Tianjin No. 2 Intermediate People's Court showed dozens of people milling around on the street, flanked by security personnel.Ding Yu'e, a supporter of Wu's, said there was a heavy police presence outside the court building."They are on high alert, and the state security police are everywhere," Ding told RFA. "There are traffic controls in place outside the gates of the court compound, and the buses have stopped running there.""The entire place is surrounded by iron fencing, and they are stopping pedestrians at intersections a long way from the court," she said. "We were walking [near Kaide Square] and were questioned by them."An eyewitness outside the court said he had counted more than 100 plainclothes police officers."There is a large group of police officers surrounding a bunch of foreigners," he said. "I can also hear someone chanting 'Free the Butcher!'"Rights activists Wang Yi and He Jiawei were also detained at the court, yelling "Release Wu Gan!" as they were put into a police vehicle, he said.About 20 supporters detainedDing said she was among those detained."We hadn't done anything, but they took us down to the police station, where we couldn't even take out our cell phones, because they would be confiscated," Ding said. "I counted, and there were about 20 people all told.""The waiting room was completely packed when we got there," she said of the Guijiasi police station.Rights activist Zhu Chengde said another detained supporter, Wang Lihong, had been taken to hospital with heart problems from the same police station."We were in the Guijiasi police station in Tianjin, when Wang Lihong had a heart attack," Zhu said. "Two women wanted to board the ambulance to help her, but they wouldn't let them."Ding said she and her friends had been forced to wait around in the police station all morning, before she was sent to the Hongshunli police station in her home district of Hebei."They got in touch with them and they came to pick me up," Ding said. "I am on the way back there now, and the duty police officer is watching me."An employee who answered the phone at the Guijiasi police station declined to comment."If you have questions about cases or anything else you will have to speak to the external communications team at the Tianjin city police department and go through all of their procedures," the employee said. "We don't take queries over the phone."Wu Gan's case was transferred from the southeastern province of Fujian to Tianjin as part of the nationwide crackdown begun on lawyers and rights activists on July 9 , 2015 with a raid on the Beijing Fengrui law firm, his lawyer has said.Refusal to confessHe has reported suffering torture while being held under investigation in a police detention center.While police in Wu's home province of Fujian recommended state prosecutors formally arrest him, and critical articles about him have appeared in China's tightly controlled state media, his case may have been transferred in a bid to put further pressure on him after he refused to "confess," lawyer Wu Kuiming has said in previous interviews with RFA.Fengrui lawyers Wang Yu and Bao Longjun were released on "bail" following Wang's televised "confession" to subversion charges against her, and her repudiation of two overseas rights awards, which she wrote were acts of hostility towards the Chinese government.Activists say such "confessions" are now a common tactic used by police under the administration of President Xi Jinping. Prominent journalist Gao Yu has said that she made a similar televised "confession" after the authorities threatened to retaliate against her son, and later retracted it.Beijing-based rights activist Gou Hongguo said Wu Gan's trial is being held in secret because the lack of such a confession makes the authorities look bad."They have lost a lot of face with this case already," Gou told RFA. "It has had a very negative impact for them both at home and internationally."He said the Tianjin authorities, who have prosecuted all of the cases linked to a July 2015 crackdown on rights lawyers and related activists, are doing the central government's dirty work for it, and had been stymied by Wu's refusal to plead guilty or accept their treatment of him."Wu Gan has taken the attitude all along that he will not cooperate, he won't recognize their laws and he won't recognize the authority of any of the regime's actions," Gou said. "This is their worst nightmare, and this tactic of non-cooperation is very effective."Wu's initial detention came as he staged a performance protest he titled "selling my body to raise funds" in Nanchang city, Jiangxi province.He was trying to help finance a legal defense for four men who rights campaigners say were wrongly jailed by a court in Jiangxi's Leping city in 2000 for robbery, rape, and dismembering a corpse.A May 28 article in the state-run news agency Xinhua attacked Wu Gan for his criticism of the police killing of a man at the Qing'an railway station in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang earlier the same month.Rights activists say Wu likely first drew the ire of the authorities when he posted online his doubts about the credibility of the government's investigation of the shooting.Reported by Ng Yik-tung and Lam Kwok-lap for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Yang Fan for the Mandarin Service.

Eying next generation of patriots, Beijing propaganda tries a new look; A recent hit film film and video put the spotlight on Beijing's efforts to package propaganda for young, 21st-century audiences - a campaign with pop idols frequently on the frontlines.The Christian Science MonitorAugust 25, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights ReservedSection: WorldLength: 969 wordsByline: Michael Holtz Staff writerBodyThe Chinese teen idol Lu Han appears for only a few seconds in "The Founding of an Army," China's latest propaganda film, but even a little screen time is enough to rev up his biggest fans.At a showing earlier this month, the crowd chanted Mr. Lu's name when he appeared on screen. "The shouting was even longer than the time he appeared in the movie," wrote one moviegoer on Weibo, a microblogging site.Lu is one of at least three xiao xian rou - "little fresh meat," as young stars are called - in "The Founding of an Army," advertised as a war epic with "youthful revolutionary elements." The Chinese government commissioned the film to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army. It opened in late July, and has since become one of the summer's biggest hits.It may have had help. In a sign of the film's importance to the ruling Communist Party, a state ministry reportedly ordered that it be be shown on at least 45 percent of all Chinese screens. The promoters of the film have rebutted such reports.Still, that heavy-handedness is what many have come to expect from China's state-run propaganda apparatus - perhaps the largest in the world - as it works to promote President Xi Jinping and the Communist Party, a mission with added significance ahead of a key party congress this fall.But if the intensity of propaganda efforts is nothing news - nor the messages - some of the messengers are. Beijing's propaganda has become more sophisticated, researchers say, as it tries to speak to young people in their own language: one of viral videos and swooned-over boy bands. The decision to cast teenage idols in "The Founding of an Army" highlights that growing push to package state values for a younger, 21st-century audience."The Chinese Communist Party definitely recognizes that the main target for its patriotic education is the youth," says Anne-Marie Brady, an expert on Chinese propaganda at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand. "It recognizes that it's pretty hard to change the minds of people who lived through the Cultural Revolution and who have already made up their minds." While some older Chinese viewers criticized the filmmakers for what they called superficial casting decisions, Dr. Brady says those people aren't its target audience. Moreover, she says the decision to cast Lu and other xiao xian rou reflects the filmmakers' desire to strike a balance between propaganda and profit. Chinese producers regularly cast teenage idols as a way to attract young moviegoers, a much sought-after demographic in the film industry.It's also a demographic that some in the Communist Party worry it may be losing. For years, China's leaders have feared Western culture - from Hollywood blockbusters to pop music - could influence the thinking and values of the country's young people. They're not alone: 77 percent of Chinese believe their way of life needs to be protected from influences abroad, according to a 2016 Pew Survey."If you ask young Chinese what term they most closely associate with the US, the majority of them will say 'Hollywood,'" says Stanley Rosen, a political science professor at the University of Southern California who studies Chinese film and media. "The Communist Party is trying to compete with what American is selling in terms of popular culture."What's likely more concerning to the party, Dr. Rosen says, is that many Chinese college students have shown a preference for aspects of liberal democracy to China's one-party system. Sixty percent of Chinese between 18 and 34 years old have a favorable view of the US, according to the Pew survey, compared to 35 percent of those over 50.Old-school propaganda still exists in China. Communist slogans, censored newspapers, and oversized portraits of President Xi can be found all over the country. But in an attempt to modernize their methods, propaganda officials have developed new ones that include TED-style talks, animated videos, and rap songs.This youth-oriented approach to propaganda has started to show signs of success in mainstream Chinese culture. TFBoys, one of China's most popular boy bands, presents a wholesome schoolboy image that has won it praise from the government. Many of their songs promote traditional values such as social harmony and filial piety. They have even sung a modern rendition of "We Are the Heirs of Communism," the anthem of the Young Pioneers, the party's nationwide children's organization."Love the country and the people," they sing in a music video released by the Communist Youth League on International Children's Day in 2015. "Fear neither hardship nor the enemy."Although bands like TFBoys and films like "The Founding of an Army" have found an enthusiastic domestic audience, one of China's most recent global propaganda efforts undoubtedly missed the mark. Entitled "7 Sins of India," the English-language video attempts to use humor to criticize India amid a simmering border standoff in the Himalayas.The three-minute clip, which was produced by China's state-run news media, features a man in a turban and fake beard speaking in a crude Indian accent. The video was quickly denounced as racist in India, China, and beyond."If the goal was to draw attention to the video, then I guess they succeeded in doing that," says Mareike Ohlberg, a research associate at the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin who studies Chinese propaganda. "But overall I wouldn't consider it very successful."As for China's domestic propaganda campaign in the run-up to the party congress, at which Xi is expected to cement his status as the country's most powerful leader in decades, Dr. Ohlberg expects to see a sustained effort aimed at young people."They are the future of China," she says, "so the party wants to win them over."Load-Date: August 25, 2017End of Document

Don't terminate NAFTA. Focus on China instead.USA TODAYAugust 24, 2017 ThursdayFIRST EDITIONCopyright 2017 Gannett Company, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 7ALength: 502 wordsBodyWhen the United States, Canada and Mexico began talks this month to rewrite NAFTA, the Trump administration was full of its usual bluster.U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer lectured his counterparts in public. In private, he demanded that a substantial, though unspecified, percentage of the North American auto industry be based in the USA.There's virtually no chance that Canada and Mexico will accept such terms. President Trump admitted as much at a rally Tuesday in Phoenix when he said: "I don't think we can make a deal because we have been so badly taken advantage of ... so I think we'll end up probably terminating NAFTA at some point."Pulling out of NAFTA would be a grave mistake. It would punish the many innovative U.S. companies and farm interests that have thrived under the 23-year-old free trade agreement. And it would make U.S. industry less competitive.Gauging the impact of NAFTA is difficult, though it is probably safe to say it has produced losers as well as winners. The United States has a $36 billion trade deficit with Mexico so far this year. That's a big number. But America is running similar deficits with Germany, Japan and even Ireland, and they're not party to any trade agreements with the United States. America is running a whopping $171 billion deficit with China, and it also has no deal with the USA.The much-maligned pact, supported by presidents of both parties, could use some updates to deal with money laundering and the rise of digital industries. But Trump has shown little interest in making these types of improvements to a trade deal that has, on balance, benefited this country.Moreover, Trump's fixation with NAFTA has already distracted attention from more pressing trade issues. Take China, for instance.Companies owned entirely or in part by the Chinese government receive preferential treatment at home and use their domestic profits to expand abroad. China also largely ignores the theft of intellectual property -- everything from the pirating of CDs to sophisticated computer hacking campaigns to acquire corporate intelligence.But perhaps the most alarming Chinese practice is one that requires foreign companies to partner with local firms and furnish them with vital technologies. U.S. companies ranging from Microsoft to GM have agreed to these terms in return for getting access to the world's second largest economy. By turning over trade secrets, they sow the seeds for their own demise, as today's partners are likely to emerge as tomorrow's competitors.Trump is well aware of these Chinese practices. He recently signed a memo likely to trigger an investigation that will play out over the next year or longer. By contrast, he made Mexico-bashing part of his campaign and once in office moved quickly on his anti-NAFTA crusade.Trump has already abandoned one trade agreement -- the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which excludes China -- that would have benefited the United States. Tearing up NAFTA would be another great leap backward. Graphic photo Rick Scuteri, APLoad-Date: August 24, 2017End of Document

Siemens Innovates for Digital ChinaTargeted News ServiceSeptember 14, 2017 Thursday 3:12 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 671 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: MUNICH BodySiemens issued the following news release:Siemens China will lead the company's global research in autonomous robotics. As part of Siemens' innovation strategy to master technology fields that are critical for future success, a global research community comprising experienced experts from around the world will focus on the research and development of new mechatronics systems, human-robot collaboration and the application of artificial intelligence in robotic controllers. In line with this strategic move, Siemens has also entered into a partnership with Tsinghua University, one of Siemens' Center of Knowledge Interchange universities, to jointly set up a robotics research center in Beijing.The company announced the move on Siemens Innovation Day China 2017, which was held in Suzhou today. Around 400 customers and partners joined with the company in exploring the ways in which innovations are contributing to China's transformation."China's digital transformation is already having a profound impact on its economy. With Made in China 2025 and The Belt & Road initiatives, China intends to upgrade its national industry and boost its global competence through digitalization-focused innovations," said Dr. Roland Busch, Chief Technology Officer and member of the Managing Board of Siemens AG. "Siemens is investing heavily in the future of China and partnering with the country and many customers on its way to digitalization."In addition to autonomous robotics, the company's core R&D areas in China include data analytics, cyber security, industrial IoT and digital twin, and connected city solutions. To tap the great potential of these technologies, Siemens has been partnering with Chinese governments, universities and customers to address challenges such as traffic congestion, energy saving, public convenience and the environment and to build "digital cities" across the country by optimizing the performance of infrastructure and improving the living conditions of city dwellers through its connected city solutions.Powered by MindSphere: Creation of Hong Kong's first smart city digital hubSiemens and the Hong Kong Science Park today entered into an agreement to create Hong Kong's first smart city digital hub. This hub will be powered by MindSphere, the cloud-based IoT operating system from Siemens, to tackle the city's challenges through an open, interactive and holistic approach. Siemens has also extended its cooperation with Zhuhai for a tailored intelligent traffic management solution and deployed Embedded City Sensor Boxes in the Suzhou Industrial Park to help reduce congestion and air pollution, optimize infrastructure operation and improve public safety.Earlier this month, the Siemens China Cyber Defense Center, which started operation this May, received official National Grade Protection Level 3 certification from China's Ministry of Public Security. This and its previous ISO27001 certification from TUV SUD make Siemens the first industrial multinational company to be compliant with both local and international security standards and thus capable of protecting industries on their way to digitalization.Siemens has also teamed up with a number of local governments and 87 local universities and technology institutes in China to conduct scientific research and develop talent. "We're constructing an open, inclusive and trust-based innovation eco-system in China aimed at value co-creation in the digital age," said Lothar Herrmann, CEO Siemens Greater China. "Siemens is bringing the next generation of innovations to life for our customers and society, in China and the world."China has become one of Siemens' largest R&D locations worldwide. In fiscal 2016 (October 1, 2015 - September 30, 2016), Siemens had over 4,500 R&D researchers and engineers, 20 R&D hubs and more than 11,000 active patents and patent applications in China.This press release and press pictures are available atwww.siemens.com/press/innovation-chinaCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-5992766 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: September 15, 2017End of Document

China Commercial Vehicle Exhaust Emission System Industry Report, 2017-2021 - Research and MarketsBusiness WireNovember 9, 2017 Thursday 7:23 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business EditorsLength: 597 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "China Commercial Vehicle Exhaust Emission System Industry Report, 2017-2021" report has been added to Research and Markets' offering.Despite great controversy over the role of emission pollutants from motor vehicle in the haze across the country, the Chinese government has begun dealing with the source of pollution, putting the national Phase-5 pollutant emission standard for motor vehicle into effect on January 1, 2017. Increasingly stringent motor vehicle emission standards also drive rapid development of the vehicle exhaust after-treatment system sector. Take diesel EGR market for example, installations soared from 520,000 units in 2012 to 1.37 million units in 2016 in the Chinese diesel EGR market, and were expected to hit 1.94 million units in 2021, representing a CAGR of 7.21% between 2016 and 2021, as implementation of environmental policies is strengthened and the number of relevant exhaust treatment systems increases.Under the backdrop of the implementation of National V emission standard and with overall consideration of technologies, costs and availability of associated products, China has primarily adopted European technology roadmap for its own diesel vehicles: SCR for medium and heavy commercial vehicles and EGR+DOC/POC for light commercial vehicles. 728,300 sets of SCR systems for medium and heavy commercial vehicles were installed in 2016, compared with 1.37 million sets of diesel EGR systems for light commercial vehicles, and 1.99 million sets of gasoline EGR systems.The commercial exhaust emission system sector presents several distinct technological routes. In SCR field, local Chinese enterprises gain the upper hand with Wuxi Weifu Lida Catalytic Converter, Wuxi Kailong High Technology and Zhejiang Yinlun Machinery ranking from second to fourth with a market share of 21%, 15% and 9%, respectively, while Cummins (22%) taking the first place and Tenneco (8%) holding the fifth position. Wuxi Weifu Lida Catalytic Converter boasts excellent SCR technical competence with perfect R&D and production capabilities for core components except carriers in the whole industry chains.

China's Nio Unveils Car At Half The Price Of Tesla Model XCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 18, 2017 MondayCopyright 2017 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2017 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 319 wordsBody       Chinese electric vehicle start-up Nio has launched the NIO ES8, a seven-seater electric SUV, at about half the price of Tesla's Model X. The ES8 is Nio's first mass-produced model for the China market.  Founded in 2014, Nio unveiled the ES8 in Beijing on Saturday at a base price of 448,000 yuan, or $68,947, before subsidies. This is only about half the price for Tesla's Model X, which starts at 836,000 yuan, or $128,660, after import duties in China. Nio also said that a battery rental plan is available to ES8 customers, with a rental subscription of 1,280 yuan per month. The ES8 is customized and will be made to order. Customers interested in purchasing the ES8 can place an order through the Nio App. The ES8 has an all-aluminum body and chassis, front and rear motors with electric all-wheel drive, and active air suspension. The vehicle, which has a range of 500 kilometers on a single charge, will be able to accelerate to 100 kilometers per hour in 4.4 seconds. The SUV comes with Nio Pilot, a driver-assistance system. It also has an in-car artificial intelligence or AI system called NOMI that can help regulate the temperature and play music based on voice requests.  Nio also unveiled Nio Power, which will allow the ES8's battery to be swapped in three minutes.

Nio's investors include Tencent Holdings, Temasek, Baidu Capital and Lenovo. These companies have been supported by the Chinese government, which has given electric vehicle manufacturing licenses to promote non-emission vehicles as part of its efforts to cut dependence on oil imports and cut pollution.  China is now the world's biggest electric vehicle market, surpassing the United States.        Load-Date: December 20, 2017End of Document

China's top Bitcoin exchange to cease tradingThe Lion's Pride: Saint Leo UniversitySeptember 16, 2017 SaturdayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 1Length: 355 wordsBodySomething tells us that the Chinese government is going to find itself on the receiving end of a law suit. No central bank owns or controls bitcoins."Given the decentralized p2p trading characteristics of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, it is neither realistic nor feasible to ban Bitcoin".According to a Reuters report, published today, Chinese authorities have ordered Beijing-based digital currency exchanges to cease trading and immediately notify users of their closure. Some two-thirds of all bitcoin issued daily is "mined" in China, and an array of other companies benefit from such efforts, including equipment suppliers and construction firms that build enormous bitcoin farms. But now it seems like it might have been the start of something more ambitious: a coordinated campaign to shut down use of cryptocurrency in the Middle Kingdom.China's bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges have received instruction that they will need to voluntarily shut down by September 15. "This has happened many times in the past".- Heavy selling pressure across the board has left the crypto-currencymarket reeling.The cryptocurrency is down 27 per cent since 7 September after rising more than four-fold this year amid greater acceptance of the blockchain technology that underpins the exchange method, global political uncertainty and increased interest in Asia.Bitcoin can be converted to cash when deposited into accounts at prices set in online trading. People who are buying now are strong hands.Levitt said he would avoid investing directly in bitcoin due to its wild price fluctuations that are "hard to understand". Such currencies pose potential financial, legal, customer protection and security-related risks, the bank said.OKCoin, a leading mainland China exchange along with Huobi and CHBTC, other major Chinese bitcoin exchange put notifications regarding these changes on their websites, also in emails to users.Risk-off events often push the value of bitcoin higher.Acceptance of digital currencies varies from country to country. "But the Reserve Bank of India needs to give its stamp to make this investment valid".Load-Date: September 16, 2017End of Document

China's Chongqing is being transformed into global investment destination, attracting international projects and talentPR NewswireAugust 21, 2017 Monday 4:42 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1069 wordsDateline: CHONGQING, China, Aug. 21, 2017 Body Most recently gaining international stature as the eastern terminus of the Chongqing-Sinkiang-Europe International Railway connecting Eurasia, the city of Chongqing in the western part of China has maintained its leading position in terms of GDP among the country's provinces and direct-controlled municipalities for 13 consecutive quarters. The city has not only become one of the regions in the country experiencing the fastest economic growth, it is also the world's largest laptop manufacturing base and the country's largest automobile production base. The city is currently hosting the Chongqing International Talent Innovation Entrepreneurship Symposium, the grand international gathering event for professionals worldwide, with the mission of recruiting the best that the world can offer in term of talent from all over the world.Since 2014, Chongqing has maintained a double-digit GDP growth rate, topping China's other provinces and cities, creating the "Chongqing" phenomenon passionately discussed by the country's financial and business communities.The rapid economic growth coupled with an industrial restructuring has led to the inland city's strong demand for talent. By 2020, the city's key emerging industry segments are expected to need over 60,000 R&D specialists, 80,000 IT professionals and 110,000 individuals with skills in other sectors, translating into a recruitment drive calling for more than 250,000 skilled talents.Considering the increasing cost of living in the country's eastern provinces and cities, many professionals from these regions have chosen to relocate to some of the country's inland cities, including Chongqing. With the amount of investment that has been heaped on the latest hotspot, Chongqing Liangjiang New Area, the city has become very attractive to the China's young generation of university graduates. Similar to Shanghai Pudong New Area and Tianjin Binhai New Area, Liangjiang New Area, located at the intersection of one of the main routes of the One Belt, One Road initiative, the Chinese government's program to enhance ties with the countries of Eurasia, and the Yangtze River Economic Belt, has become an area targeted by the central government for major development. Since 2010, the new area has been attracting foreign investment amounting to, on average, US$4 billion per year. The ongoing inflow of talent and capital is contributing to the city's drive to transform itself into an international hub and port connecting the Yangtze River Belt to Central Asian and European markets.With the demands being created by the city's ongoing growth and the continuing influx of talent, Chongqing has identified the advantages that differentiate it from other rapidly growing cities as well as its unique requirements in terms of the rapidly increasing need for a professional workforce. The city is again hosting the Chongqing International Talent Innovation Entrepreneurship Symposium this year, attracting some of the world's top professionals and most innovative projects. The municipality's government and top event organizers look forward to building the symposium into the country's brand gala event attracting overseas talent.Debuting in 2015, this major event for the recruitment of the world's leading talents has now been held for two consecutive years, convincing 347 top managers and executives to make the move while drawing in 212 projects backed by capital amounting to 4.52 billion yuan (approx. US$678 million). In 2016, over 400 top-level talented individuals from various parts of China as well as from 21 countries and regions worldwide attended the symposium in search of new opportunities. Accordingly, in its recruitment drive, the symposium will continue to search for the best that the world can offer this year, holding competitions in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, as well as in Silicon Valley (US), Oxford (UK) and Singapore, in a move to bring in more projects and the necessary talent to assist in their management. The organizing committee commented that students from China studying in several other cities around the US including Chicago expressed their desire to see the competition expanded into other cities beyond Silicon Valley.The popularity of Chongqing among professionals and other talented individuals is also attributable to the benefits and the salaries on offer. The city issued two circulars outlining the effort to bring in top-level managers:Several Preferential Policies and Regulations to Attract High-level Talent to Chongqing MunicipalityandImplementation Measures of the 'Swan Goose Program' on Attracting Domestic and Overseas Talent, stating that c-suite-level and similar managerial level professionals can enjoy a one-off relocation grant of up to 2 million yuan (approx. US$300,000). Incoming executives are rated according to the professional histories, and those with the top rating will earn an annual salary of not less than 2 million yuan (approx. US$300,000) while working in the city.By virtue of its location in a gateway city that has chosen to make inclusiveness a core part of its philosophy, the new area will allocate not less than 100 million yuan (approx. US$15 million) in a talent fund, one billion yuan (approx. US$150 million) in an innovation and start-up fund and one million square meters in floor space for the housing of the incoming workforce every year.As stipulated in its recently issued series of support policies, referred to as theGolden 10,Liangjiang New Area will contribute up to 50 million yuan (approx. US$7.5 million) to the required paid-up registered capital of leading companies that choose to relocate or establish a presence there. In terms of providing an equity stake, the new area will reward high-level talents employed by a technology or R&D firm that has granted them stock dividends or allowed them to earn income as a result of an equity transfer with a financial subsidy representing 50 percent of their contributions to the local economy.TheGolden 10is now recognized as the strongest preferential policy worldwide by local media. The policy continuously receives positive feedback on China's social media platforms.View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chinas-chongqing-is-being-transformed-into-global-investment-destination-attracting-international-projects-and-talent-300506917.htmlSOURCE Chongqing Liangjiang New AreaCONTACT: Mingyi Xia, +86-23-6757-3989, 764932844@qq.comLoad-Date: August 22, 2017End of Document

This is a strong first step toward holding China accountable."SALT LAKE CITY Following President Trump's executive order regarding Chinese policies leading to forced technology transfer and trade secret theft, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) issued the following statement:"Theft of American intellectual property in China is a persistent and serious problem. This is a strong first step toward holding China accountable. Indeed, there is no doubt the Chinese government bears responsibility for the forced transfer of technology from American businesses and rampant theft of trade secrets, and our nation must take stronger action. I look forward to working with Ambassador Lighthizer on further action to protect U.S. intellectual property rights in China using the strong, WTO-consistent tools Congress has created for the enforcement of American rights."NOTE: A longtime advocate of establishing enforceable international rules for U.S. firms and workers doing business overseas, Hatch has fought to strengthen intellectual property rights (IPR) standards around the world. Hatch authored legislation to increase U.S. enforcement of American intellectual property rights overseas, including improvements to the Special 301 mechanism and the establishment of a Chief Intellectual Property Negotiator at Office of U.S. Trade Representative (USTR). Hatch also spearheaded efforts in Congress to enact bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) to help open more markets for U.S. exports and strengthen IPR protections in U.S. trade agreements, and led enactment of the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016.###Load-Date: August 14, 2017End of Document

Electronic Security Market - 10% Growth Forecast to 2024; The North America Electronic Security Market will dominate the global business landscape due to the government initiatives to integrate these systems into their public safety segment.PR NewswireDecember 6, 2017 Wednesday 9:00 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1227 wordsDateline: SELLBYVILLE, Del., Dec. 6, 2017 Body  Global Electronic Security Marketwill be valued USD 60 billion by 2024; according to a new research report by Global Market Insights, Inc. The state and central governments of various countries are placing high focus on the development and adoption of advanced systems in high-traffic locations such as public roads, transit stations, and malls, contributing to the growth of the electronic security market.For instance, the Indian government in 2014 set up a USD 125 million fund solely devoted to the prevention of sexual violence among women through the installation of security equipment such as surveillance systems at high-risk public locations. These hardware systems are equipped with video analytics and advanced algorithms that allow the detection of criminals. Furthermore, technological advancements have also aided in the improvement of existing technologies such as high-resolution 4k cameras and IP surveillance units.Make an Inquiry for purchasing this report @https://www.gminsights.com/inquiry-before-buying/2132Crime rates across the world are heavily impacted with the rising penetration of these systems in residential and commercial settings and is anticipated to drive the electronic security market growth. End-users across the world are replacing conventional security systems such as guards and physical body checks with high-tech solutions. Physical body checks in malls and airports can be cumbersome and increase customer discomfort, primarily among women. X-ray body scanners, on the contrary, requires the person to pass through an electronic frame.The rising trend of the development of smart cities in countries such as China and India is contributing to the high growth of the electronic security market. For instance, the Chinese government has undertaken large construction projects for the development of smart cities imbued with advanced security solutions in cities such as Dalian, Hangzhou, Nanjing, and Tianjin. The rise in traveler population across the world is also leading to the growth of the electronic security market.The surveillance and alert system market is anticipated to exhibit substantial growth during the forecast timeframe. The reduction in component and raw material costs is contributing to the decline in the electronic security market price trend. Remote monitoring systems are increasingly finding application in developed regions such as U.S and Western Europe. Installing a home security solution with remote monitoring capabilities allows the homeowner to access security cameras and video units situated inside the residential location in real-time.Request for a sample of this research report @https://www.gminsights.com/request-sample/detail/2132Public-sector applications are the largest revenue-generating segment. Various government bodies are making use of advanced solutions for surveillance and criminal detection applications. For instance, in September 2017, a police department in Arkansas was reported to be using drones for highly specialized missions such as the tracking of a suspect or obtaining an inside view and additional information in a hostage situation.The North America electronic security market is projected to dominate the global business landscape owing to the government initiatives to integrate these systems into their public safety segment. For instance, the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 contains provisions to make the unmanned aerial systems (UAS) licensing process easier and quicker for law enforcement officials. Various U.S states are currently conducting trial operations on drones to understand their capabilities and their operational efficiency.Players operating in the global electronic security market include Axis Communications, BOSCH Security Systems, Hitachi Ltd, OSI Systems, Inc., SDMS Security Products UK Ltd., Siemens AG, MilliVision Technologies, ASSA ABLOY, Scanna MSC Ltd., Thales Group, RedXDefense LLC, etc. Industry players conduct strategic moves such as mergers and acquisitions to sustain growth.

India's cross-border transgression is wrong and dangerousPR NewswireAugust 11, 2017 Friday 9:00 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 711 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Aug.11, 2017 BodyA newly released report from China.org.cn on India's cross-border transgression is wrong and dangerous:The incursion by Indian troops into Chinese territory in June has provoked confrontation across the border between the two countries. The standoff has lasted over a month with no signs of ending.The Chinese government has on one hand issued stern warnings while on the other hand exercised maximum restraint. It expects India to view the entire situation with a sober mind and retreat from the territory over which it does not have sovereignty in order to avoid an escalation of tensions and a repetition of the incidents of 1962.China has adopted a policy of patience and restraint, not because it fears confrontation, but because it has realized through its reform and opening up that peaceful development is the best option for the rise of a major nation.  However, the mentality of our Indian counterparts appears to be different, having failed to move out of the shadow of the Sino-India Border Conflict of 1962 when India was defeated. The defeat, in fact was also caused by India's invasion into Chinese territory.The economy of India has gathered pace since the 1990s. As one of the largest emerging economies in the world, it has become a member of the BRICS. In recent times, the trade between China and India has surged at an unprecedented speed.Unfortunately, in the context of this rare opportunity for peaceful development, Indian politicians have made the wrong decisions. Catering to a great power and getting together several other countries cannot contain China's growth, or even retrieve the face lost in the Sino-Indian Border Conflict of 1962. Rather, India is gambling with its future and national well-being for an extremely dangerous and worthless stake.Indian prime minister and foreign minister have publicly supported the resolving of the border dispute through dialogue and diplomatic means. But India is merely paying lip service. It is "illogical" for a country to invade another country's territory, while still holding high the banner of peace.China has demonstrated the utmost patience, but this patience has its limits. With the not-so-old lessons from 55 years ago, the Indian government should use its political wisdom against narrow-minded bias, and withdraw its troops from Chinese territory to solve the problem with a sincere attitude.China Mosaichttp://www.china.org.cn/video/node_7230027.htmIndia's cross-border transgression is wrong and dangeroushttp://www.china.org.cn/video/2017-08/11/content_41391937.htmAbout China.org.cnFounded in 2000, China Internet Information Center (China.org.cn/China.com.cn) is a key state news website under the auspices of the State Council Information Office, and is managed by China International Publishing Group.

Upcoming Earnings: General Motors And Ford To Report Quarterly Results This WeekBenzinga.comOctober 23, 2017 Monday 7:11 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Accretive Capital LLC d/b/a Benzinga All Rights ReservedLength: 1256 wordsByline: JJ KinahanBodyAmong the many companies reporting earnings this week, U.S. automakersGeneral Motors Company (NYSE: GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) release their quarterly results before market open on Tuesday, Oct. 24 and Thursday, Oct. 26, respectively. There s been a lot of attention on the auto industry in recent quarters. Some of the reasons for that are a sales slump in 2017, especially in passenger cars, the ongoing shift towards electric vehicles and the development of self-driving vehicles.   September saw a reversal in declining U.S. auto sales, which was largely attributed to the impact of destructive hurricanes in the Southeast U.S. According to estimates from Cox Automotive, the parent company of Kelley Blue Book, Hurricane Harvey destroyed an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 vehicles in the Houston area alone, and Hurricane Irma destroyed an estimated 200,000 to 400,000 vehicles. Total vehicle sales in the U.S., shown in Figure 1 below, significantly spiked from August to September and reversed the downward trend that had persisted so far in 2017.While the impact of hurricanes is expected to be a transitory one, the shift towards electric vehicles has been an ongoing global transition. For example, the Chinese government has projected 800,000 electric vehicles will be sold 2017. That s up from 500,000 electric vehicles in 2016. Electric-vehicle demand in China and many other countries has been supported by extensive subsidies, which the Chinese government recently announced it would slash by 20%.Currently, none of the major U.S. automakers operate independently in China, all of them operate through joint ventures with Chinese entities, or import their cars and incur stiff tariffs. The New York Timesrecently reported Tesla (TSLA) is working with the Chinese government on a deal to build the first wholly-owned manufacturing operation in Shanghai. Another broader trend a lot of companies have set their eyes on is the development of self-driving vehicles. Across industries, companies have been focused on developing the cars, hardware and software that will make them a reality. FIGURE 1: MONTHLY VEHICLE SALES.

The program is geared towards Uber, Lyft and delivery drivers. For a flat weekly fee, drivers can rent cars, including insurance and maintenance, directly from the company. GM is also a large investor in ride-sharing company Lyft.At the start of October, GM announced it plans to launch 20 new all-electric vehicles by 2023, with two new ones being released in the next 18 months. On the autonomous-vehicle front, GM has been testing a fleet of them in San Francisco and has said it plans to expand the test to New York City in early 2018 pending approval of its application from New York s Department of Motor Vehicles.For the third quarter, GM is expected to report adjusted earnings of $1.09 per share, down from $1.72 in the prior-year quarter, on revenue of $36.16 billion, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. Options traders have priced in about a 2.8% potential share price move in either direction around its upcoming earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim® platform.In short-term trading at the October 27 expiration, calls have been active at the 46 strike price, with a decent amount of activity at the 47 strike in trading today.

To that end, he s shared some broader goals focused on cost-cutting initiatives, focus on electric vehicles and autonomous ones, but there hasn t been a whole lot of details.In other management news, F recently appointed a new executive to head up its Chinese operations. Jason Kuo took over Ford China in August. Due to the size of the Chinese market and growing middle class, automakers  operations in the country have been a large focus for analysts. According to Reuters,F is also in the process of exploring a joint venture in China that is focused specifically on manufacturing electric cars.That s not the only step F has taken. It created an internal group, dubbed  Team Edison , to focus on global development of electric vehicles, according to Reuters. Management has also indicated it will reduce spending on combustion-engine research and development, and shift more towards electric vehicles.  On the autonomous-driving front, F announced a collaboration with Lyft to deploy large numbers of self-driving vehicles by 2021 through the ride-sharing company s network. When it reports on Thursday, F is expected to report adjusted earnings of $0.31 per share, up five cents from the prior-year quarter, on revenue of $33.07 billion, a 0.7% year-over-year decline, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates.Options traders have priced in about a 2.2% potential share price move in either direction around its upcoming earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator. In short-term options trading at the October 27 expiration, most of the action has been right around the money. Calls have been active at the 12 and 12.5 strikes, while puts have been active at the 11.5 and 12 strikes.

Global Education Summit 2017 Ushers in the New Era of Future Global EducationPR NewswireNovember 29, 2017 Wednesday 7:49 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2080 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Nov. 29, 2017 BodyThe Inaugural Global Education Summit ("GES") was held in Beijing on November 28, 2017. The summit was co-sponsored by China Development Research Foundation, Beijing Normal University, Tencent, GSV (Global Silicon Valley Capital Corporation), and TAL, under the guidance of the Development Research Center of the State Council and the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China. Meanwhile, it has established academic partnerships with Tsinghua University and ASU (Arizona State University). By cooperating with Babytree, VIPKID, IFLYTEK and DaDaABC, it has presented a grand global education summit hosted in China and dedicated to the whole world through the advanced live broadcast technology from TencentCloud.The summit invited more than 300 prominent figures in the global education industry, including Li Wei, Director of the Development Research Center of the State Council and Chairman of China Development Research Foundation, Du Zhanyuan, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, Dong Qi, President of Beijing Normal University, Lu Mai, Vice Chairman and Secretary General of China Development Research Foundation, Chen Li, Vice President of Beijing Normal University and Bai Yunfeng, President of TAL. Themed on Advancing Education through Science and Technology Innovation, the summit looked into topics such as education development driven by science and technology, revolution of learning approaches in the future, AI and personalized learning, globalized international education, early-stage development of children, and more balanced education development enabled by science and technology with keynote speeches, roundtable discussions, special dialogues and so on. It discussed the development trends of the education industry in the future from multiple angles. The summit aims to become a new linkage between current and future education and between the education sector of China and of the world.New Trend for Future Education: "Technology+Education"Education is a flourishing industry at home and abroad. According to the 2016 Edtech Trends released by Edtech Europe, global expenditure on education has exceeded 5 trillion US dollars and is expected to grow at 8% every year to reach 8.1 trillion US dollars in 2020. The expenses on educational technology are also well above the industrial average, growing at 17% every year. At the summit, many domestic and foreign guests agreed that science and technology are ushering in a better future for education.Li Wei, Minister of the Development Research Center of the State Council and Chairman of China Development Research Foundation shared his vision for future education: "President Xi stressed that education holds the key to the improvement of the overall quality and well-rounded development of the people and serves as an important foundation for national rejuvenation and social progress. Education is of great significance to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. We must give top priority to education by deepening reform in this area and stepping up the effort to modernize education, so as to provide quality education that lives up to the people's expectations." Li Wei also said that technology will bring more opportunities than challenges to mankind."On behalf of Minister Chen Baosheng, I would like to express warm congratulations on this summit," said Du Zhanyuan, Vice Minister of Education. Technology is one of the most important factors for future education. Especially the development of IT has revolutionary impact on education development and tremendous effect on realizing education development goals and promoting education reform. Therefore, the Chinese Government has placed great importance on ICT for education and introduced the 10 Year Plan for the Development of ICT for Education (2011-2020), where the project of "three links and two platforms" suitable for Chinese national conditions was proposed. Substantial progress has been made in this area over the years.The discussions at GES on the first day were exciting, sparking ideas among Chinese and foreign guests. It is reported that the following day will unveil more keynote speeches and sub forums. Zhang Bangxin, Founder and CEO of TAL and Yu Minhong, Chairman of New Oriental Education and Technology Group, will present a much anticipated one-on-one dialogue. The summit will be an arena for Chinese education enterprises to give their voice. Education empowered by AI: Mapping out the New Blueprint of Future EducationExcellent education achievements are breaking down the barriers of time and space, economy and culture. The Internet, big data, AI, VR and other technologies are integrating into more educational scenarios and profoundly changing people's ways of thinking, working, living and learning.Beijing Normal University, one of the sponsors, has full expectations for the application of AI in education and teaching and has made strategic layouts in this regard. Its president Dong Qi pointed out in his speech that in October this year, Beijing Normal University initiated the establishment of the National Alliance for Research on Children Brain and Intelligence in collaboration with 18 high-level research institutes including Peking University, Tsinghua University and Chinese Academy of Sciences. The Alliance mainly focuses on the laws of brain and intelligence development, learning and cognition dysfunction, and relevant technologies and methods to improve brain and intelligence. "In the new educational ecosystem, especially when this new ecosystem is created by science and technology such as AR, VR and AI, these have exacted new impact on the development of brain and intelligence of children and have also provided unprecedented opportunities for the liberation and development of the children's brains," said Dong Qi. The research findings on brain and intelligence will help the educators better understand the learners and better apply other technological achievements for more efficient education and learning, so as to create a better future for the learners.TAL has made serious explorations in the field of "education + technology", which is a highlight at the summit. Zhang Bangxin, Founder and CEO of TAL said that AI will be the keyword for future development of educational institutions, and the mission and vision of TAL is to advance education through science and technology. TAL will grow from an offline company to a technology company and from an operating company to a data-driven technology company. In this process, ITS, IPS, dual-teacher classroom, facial expression recognition technology, etc., are all important milestones for its technology development. Liu Yachao, Co-founder of TAL said at the summit that technology is having a profound impact on education sector. The principal entities and practitioners in this industry have changed. TAL gives very high priority to technology development and sees as its own mission to advance education through science and technology.Vice Minister of Education, Du Zhanyuan also commented in his speech on AI's impact on education that "we are aware that the rapid development of AI will have greater revolutionary impact on education and will present the space for wider cross-border cooperation between education and industry." Du also shared the vision for future development of education in China which is to build a digitalized educational system based on the Internet and able to provide lifelong personalized education for all, so that more open, suitable, people-centered, fair and sustainable education will be realized.Zhu Yongxin, Vice Chairman of The Central Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy and Under Secretary General of the CPPCC, Chen Li, Vice President of Beijing Normal University, Tang Daosheng, Senior Executive Vice President of Tencent all agreed with this opinion. Zhu Yongxin held that the allocation of educational resources in the future would be realized on a global scale rather than on a national one. The issue to address in the future is how to use data and put in place a better evaluation system for individuals. Che Li also pointed out that IT has become the internal driving force for educational reform and development which not only provides us with the new methods but more importantly also gives us new support for innovation in the new educational system and new service model by enabling us to think out of the box and understand the new laws of teaching and learning. Tang Daosheng stressed that cloud technology has solved the problem of connecting things. The connection of videos and audios are the change driven by the most basic technology. Moreover, big data and AI have also helped address some of the bottlenecks in the current education model and facilitate the realization of personalized education.At the summit, Huang Yan, CTO of TAL, Wu Ying, General Manager for Investment of TAL and Yang Songfan, head of AI Lab of TAL all discussed how to transform the way of learning in the future and mapped out the blueprint of future education with analysis on AI and personalized learning integration, and the effort to utilize capital to promote technology revolution and education innovation from their respective angles."GSV in China": Look at Future Global Education from hereTAL and other well-positioned education enterprises in China were active participants at the recent sessions of ASU-GSV where they have showed the world the breathtaking growth of China's educational technology. TAL, one of the sponsors of GES, always focuses on the studies of educational technology with forward-looking vision. At the summit, Bai Yunfeng, President of TAL shared his thought on future education on behalf of TAL: "Educational revolution must stay ahead of industrial revolution. Technology advancement is an effective way to promote education that benefits all." Bai also said that TAL will work to advance education through science and technology and usher in a better future in collaboration with public schools, private schools and third party science and technology institutions under the leadership of the government.Dozens of top crossover dialogues at this GES have revealed the new significance of "education + technology" in different dimensions. As a respected event with great international influence, GES deserves the reputation as China's GSV. Michael Moe, Founder and CEO of GSV talked about his idea about future education cooperation between China and other countries in his speech "From the Silk Road to Silicon Valley" and said that while the ancient Silk Road focused on the connectivity of commodities, the Belt and Road Initiative proposed by China works to realize a better integration and connection between the East and the West. Li Wei, President of the Development Research Center of the State Council and Chairman of China Development Research Foundation emphasized that "education is of great importance to the future and the common development of mankind, and therefore requires the participation of and extensive exchanges between governments, international organizations, non-public organizations, enterprises, universities and think tanks. We need to create and make good use of international exchange platforms to share knowledge and summarize experiences, so as to promote the common development of mankind."Vice Minister of the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, Du Zhanyuan also called on the participants of the GES to work together, share development experiences and carry out in-depth cooperation, with a view to realizing the beautiful vision for education in various counties and making bigger contribution to creating a community of shared future for mankind. Education and technology hold the key to national strength and prosperity. With the improvement of the overall education quality and the realization of educational equity, China is turning from a country with a big education sector into a country with a strong education sector. China has become an important contributor for global educational technology advancement. The GES will also become a new trademark of education in China and a force for good to be reckoned with. View original content with multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-education-summit-2017-ushers-in-the-new-era-of-future-global-education-300563523.htmlSOURCE TAL Education GroupCONTACT: Sherry JIN, +86-182-1025-8225, jinshiyu@100tal.comLoad-Date: November 30, 2017End of Document

Continue reading Future FinTech Group Reports Second Quarter 2017 Financial ResultsXI'AN, China   Future FinTech Group Inc. (NASDAQ: FTFT) ( Future FinTech  or  the Company ), a financial technology company and integrated producer of fruit-related products, today announced its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017.Second Quarter 2017 Summary:Total revenue was $2.8 millionGross profit was $1.3 millionGross profit margin was 47%Net loss attributable to Future FinTech was $2.5 millionCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $4.4 million as of June 30, 2017 We reported a decline in our financial results relative to the year ago quarter attributable to a difficult market environment resulting from a business contraction in all of our fruit product segments. A reduction in market demand, competitive pressures and an erosion in pricing caused a contraction in demand for our core fruit-related product segments,  said Mr. Hongke Xue, Chief Executive Officer of Future FinTech.  Although our fruit products business is currently facing challenges, we believe that our mission to lead the company into a new direction by utilizing sophisticated fintech capabilities to build a highly integrated agricultural enterprise will create a wide spectrum of growth opportunities.  A key growth initiative is our development of a kiwi processing and trading center in Mei County coupled with the lease of 3,292 acres of kiwi orchards and planned purchase of an additional 833 acres of kiwi orchards that will enable us to source our own supply and maintain our high quality standards. We are also adding a new fruit segment to our product platform by leasing 1,317 acres of orange orchards in Yidu, Hubei Province to be integrated with the development of new state-of-the-art orange processing facilities. We plan to utilize fintech, e-commerce and best-in-class agricultural practices to integrate production and distribution in order to maximize our return on investment for these key initiatives,  continued Mr. Hongke Xue. We are excited about the potential breadth of opportunities as well as our strategic approach to create sustainable value from our investments in fintech, e-commerce, commodities trading and in-house agricultural sourcing. Our vision is to augment our fruit juice and beverage sales and distribution with high margin fintech growth opportunities so as to generate diversified sources of cash flow for many years to come,  Mr. Hongke Xue concluded.Second Quarter 2017 Financial ResultsRevenue for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was $2.8 million, as compared to revenue of $10.2 million for the same period of 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in sales in all of the Company's fruit-related product segments.Revenue by SegmentSales from apple-related products were $0.03 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to sales of $1.9 million for the same period of 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a sharp decrease in the unit price of the apple-related products in the international market and a decrease in sales volume due to heavy competition. During the second quarter of 2017, the Company sold approximately 460 tons of concentrated apple juice and apple aroma as compared to 1,219 tons in the same period of 2016. Most of the Company's concentrated apple juice was sold directly or indirectly to the international market. Over the past three years, the purchase price of fresh apples has increased but the sales price of concentrated apple related products has remained low. Because of the negative trends in the international market and lower operating margins, our YingKou and Huludao Wonder factories did not operate their apple juice production facilities in fiscal 2016 and the six months ended June 30, 2017, which resulted in a lower inventory of concentrated apple juice and required the Company to purchase supply from third-party manufacturers to meet demand.Sales from concentrated kiwifruit juice and kiwifruit puree were $0.1 million for the second quarter of 2017, as compared to sales of $0.4 million for the same period of 2016. The decline was due to a decrease in products sold in the current quarter as compared to same period of 2016 due to lower market demand.Sales of concentrated pear juice were $0.1 million for the second quarter of 2017, as compared to sales of $1.0 million for the same period of 2016. The decline was due to a decrease in the unit price of the concentrated pear juice and a decrease in sales volume due to lower customer demand. The Company sold 1,149 and 1,314 tons of concentrated pear juice during the second quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively.Sales from our fruit juice beverages segment were $2.5 million for the second quarter of 2017, as compared to sales of $5.5 million for the same period of 2016. The decline was primarily due to a decrease in sales volume as a result of heavy competition in the China market.Sales from our others products segment were $0.01 million for the second quarter of 2017, as compared to sales of $1.5 million for the same period of 2016. The sale from other products for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was concentrated orange juice. The Company does not expect continued sales from other products as customers' orders related to other products are currently small and unpredictable.Gross Profit. Consolidated gross profit was $1.3 million for the second quarter of 2017, as compared to $3.2 million for the same period of 2016, mainly due to the decrease in sales from all of the Company's fruit-related segments. The consolidated gross profit margin was 47% for the second quarter of 2017 as compared to 31% for the same period of 2016 primarily due to the higher period-over-period weighting of the fruit juice beverages segment relative to each period's total gross margin. The gross profit margin of concentrated apple juice segment for the second quarters of 2017 and 2016 were 10% and 17%, respectively. The decrease in gross margin was mainly due to a decrease in the sales price of concentrated apple juice in the international market. The gross profit margin of the concentrated kiwifruit juice and kiwifruit puree segment for the second quarters of 2017 and 2016 were 31% and 7%, respectively, primarily due to an increase in sales price of concentrated kiwifruit juice and kiwifruit puree in the current quarter. The gross profit margin of the concentrated pear juice segment for the second quarters of 2017 and 2016 were 19% and 23%, respectively, with the decrease in the current quarter primarily due to the higher costs of raw materials. The gross profit margin of the fruit juice beverages segment for the second quarters of 2017 and 2016 were 49% and 48%, respectively. The gross profit margin of the other products segment for the second quarters of 2017 and 2016 was 50% and 3%, respectively, as the Company purchased concentrated orange juice that was sold to their customers in the second quarter of 2016, and which resulted in a lower margin during that period. NFM = Not meaningful figureOperating expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2017 were $3.4 million, as compared to $1.8 million for the same period of 2016. General and administrative expenses increased to $3.1 million for the second quarter of 2017 as compared to $1.0 million for the same period of 2016, mainly due to an increase in the amortization of leasing expenses associated with the kiwi orchard that the Company leased in Mei County and the city of Yidu. The Company has amortized $1.5 million as leasing expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The Company began the amortization of land lease rights in Hedetang Foods Industry (Yidu) Co, Shaanxi Guoweimei Kiwi Deep Processing Company and Trading Market Mei County beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016. Selling expenses decreased to $0.3 million for the second quarter of 2017, as compared to $0.8 million for the same period of in 2016, mainly due to the reduced amount of sales in the current quarter.Net loss attributable to Future FinTech shareholders for the second quarter of 2017 was $2.5 million, as compared to net income of $0.4 million for the same period of 2016. Diluted loss per share from continued operations was $0.49 for the second quarter of 2017 as compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.12 for the same period of 2016.Financial ConditionAs of June 30, 2017, the Company had $4.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, an increase from $1.1 million as of December 31, 2016. The Company had working capital of $22.1 million as of June 30, 2017 as compared to working capital of $24.7 million as of December 31, 2016. As of June 30, 2017, the Company had total liabilities of $93.6 million, which included $30.1 million in short-term bank loans and $16.9 million in capital lease obligations. Stockholders' equity attributable to Future FinTech was $132.3 million as of June 30, 2017 as compared to $135.0 millionas of December 31, 2016.During the six months ended June 30, 2017, net cash provided by the Company's operating activities was $0.1 million, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $6.6 million for the same period of 2016. The decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in net income of $4.3 million. During the six months ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016, the Company's investing activities used net cash of $1.2 million and $32.3 million, respectively. The Company made a refundable deposit of about $30 million pursuant to the letter of intent to purchase kiwifruits orchard during the first six months ended June 30, 2016. During the six months ended June 30, 2017, our financing activities generated net cash inflow of $5.0 million as compared to net cash inflow of $22.9 million in the same period of 2016. The decrease in cash inflow from financing activities was mainly due to a decrease in capital contributions of $14.0 million. The Company expects projected cash flows from operations, anticipated cash receipts, cash on hand, and trade credit will provide the necessary capital to meet its projected operating cash requirements for at least the next twelve months, which does not take into account any potential expenditures related to the possible expansion of its current production capacity.Project UpdatesThe Company entered into a Letter of Intent with the People's Government of Suizhong County fruit to establish a fruit and vegetable industry chain and processing zone in Suizhong County, Liaoning Province, China. The Company has made partial payment to acquire the land use right from the local government, purchase equipment and build facilities. As of the date of this release, the Company has finished construction of an office building, dormitory, refrigeration storage facility and a warehouse. However, due to heavy competition in the concentrated apple juice business in China, construction work on this project is currently suspended.The Company is developing an orange processing and distribution center pursuant to its investment/service agreement with the Yidu Municipal People's Government in Hubei Province, China. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company will be responsible for an investment amount of approximately $48 million which will be mainly used to establish the distribution center and the orange processing facility on project land of approximately 280 mu (approximately 46 acres). Also, the Company and the Yidu Municipal People's Government has agreed to discuss the investment amount and location associated with establishing an R&D center and an orange plantation. On November 23, 2015, the Company started the construction of the Yidu project. As the Chinese government recently tightened environment regulations, the Company is in the process of adapting to the new standards and the project has been delayed. Although the schedule for completion could change, the Company currently plans to finish the construction of infrastructure to include an office building, R&D center, fruit juice production facility, cold storage facility and other construction work in the fourth quarter of 2017. Although the schedule for completion could change, the orange plantation is currently planned to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the distribution center is currently planned to be completed by the second quarter of 2018.The Company is developing a kiwi processing and trading center pursuant to its investment agreement with the Managing Committee of Mei County National Kiwi Fruit Wholesale Trading Center, which has been authorized by the People's Government of Mei County, China. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company will be responsible for construction and financing with an investment amount of approximately $72 million for buildings and equipment on a total planned area of 286 mu (approximately 47 acres).  As of the date of this report, the Company is in the process of building fruit juice production lines, a vegetable and fruit flash freeze facility, an R&D center and an office building. Although the schedule for completion could change, the Company currently plans to complete the construction of these facilities in the fourth quarter of 2017.As of the date of this release, the Mei County National Kiwi Fruit Wholesale Trading Center has started normal operations. There are a number of enterprises operating in the trading center including 12 express delivery companies, four logistic companies, four on-line sales companies, two packing companies and three agriculture companies. In addition, all government departments that are relevant to the operations of the Mei County National Kiwi Fruit Wholesale Trading Center have moved into the trading center. Currently Mei County National Kiwi Fruit Wholesale Trading is building a data platform for agricultural products in the western part of China, an agricultural business incubator, and online-to-offline agricultural products trading center. To meet this requirement, the Company is upgrading its software and the project has been delayed. The Company is expected to have completed its investment in the trading center in the fourth quarter of 2017, and believes that it will generate income from the trading center through various means, such as rental income from cold storage and shops, and income from logistic services.As part of the Mei County National Kiwi Fruit Wholesale Trading Center project, on April 19, 2013, we established Shaanxi Guoweimei Kiwi Deep Processing Co., Ltd. to engage in the business of producing kiwi fruit juice, kiwi puree, cider beverages, and related products. The total estimated investment is RMB 294 million (or approximately $47.6 million). As the Chinese government recently tightened environment regulations, the Company is in the process of adapting to the new standards and the project has been delayed. The Company is building fruit juice production lines, a vegetable and fruit flash freeze facility, an R&D center and an office building. Although the schedule for completion could change, the Company currently plans to complete construction in the second quarter of 2018.Recent EventsOn June 6, 2017, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State for the State of Florida to amend and restate its articles of incorporation to change its name from SkyPeople Fruit Juice, Inc. to Future FinTech Group Inc.

Future FinTech Reports Third Quarter 2017 Financial ResultsPR NewswireNovember 20, 2017 Monday 5:00 PM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4750 wordsDateline: XI'AN, China, Nov. 20, 2017 BodyFuture FinTech Fruit Group Inc. (NASDAQ: FTFT) ("Future FinTech" or "the Company"), a financial technology company and integrated producer of fruit-related products today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2017."We experienced continued challenging market conditions in the third quarter of 2017 in our fruit processing business that resulted in a decline in customer demand attributable to a scarcity of raw materials, intense market competition and a contraction in our pricing power," said Mr. Hongke Xue, Chief Executive Officer of Future FinTech. "In order to transition away from some of these structural issues, we have begun to execute upon our strategic plan to transition from a heavy asset agricultural company into a lighter asset fintech company.""We announced a corporate name change earlier this year to reflect our commitment to fintech that we believe will drive fintech solutions through the entire agricultural value chain as well as offer opportunities for us in other sectors. Consistent with this plan, we have made substantial investments in commodities trading online platforms, developed strategic partnership with online marketing entities and entered into a potentially lucrative distribution agreement to market a men's healthcare product," continued Mr. Xue."We have also entered into a joint venture to form an asset management company to purchase non-performing assets of financial and non-financial institutions and entered into a series of agreements to acquire financial assets. In relatively short order, we are transforming our company into a leaner enterprise to capitalize upon opportunities in the fintech sector that we believe offer potentially strong returns on invested capital. Our goal is to develop a world-class enterprise with a diversified revenue stream that maximizes returns to our corporate shareholders," Mr. Hongke Xue concluded.Third Quarter 2017 Financial ResultsRevenue. Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2017 was $4.4 million, a decrease of 58% as compared to $10.6 million for the same period in 2016.Third Quarter 2017 and 2016 Revenue by Segment(In $000's)Three Months Ended September 30,20172016% of changeConcentrated apple juice and apple aroma56234861.5%Concentrated kiwifruit juice and kiwi puree18410772.0%Concentrated pear juice134,897(99.7%)Fruit juice beverages3,6704,624(20.6%)Other14615(97.7%)Total4,44310,591(58.0%)Revenue by Segment. Sales from apple-related products were $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017, as compared to sales of $0.3 million for the same period of 2016. During the third quarter of 2017, the Company sold approximately 738 tons of concentrated apple juice and apple aroma as compared to 472 tons in the same period of 2016. Most of the Company's concentrated apple juice was sold directly or indirectly to the international market.  Over the past three years, the purchase price of fresh apples has increased but the sales price of concentrated apple related products has remained low. Because of the negative trends in the international market and lower operating margins, our YingKou and Huludao Wonder factories did not operate their apple juice production facilities in 2016 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.  This resulted in a lower inventory of concentrated apple juice and required the Company to purchase supply from third-party manufacturers to meet demand.Sales from concentrated kiwifruit juice and kiwifruit puree were $0.2 million for the third quarter of 2017, as compared to sales of $0.1 million for the same period of 2016. The increase was due to higher demand and an increase in products sold in the current quarter as compared to the same period of 2016.Sales of concentrated pear juice were $0.01 million for the third quarter of 2017, as compared to sales of $4.9 million for the same period of 2016. The decline was due to a decrease in sales volume due to lower demand. The Company sold 16 and 5,967 tons of concentrated pear juice during the third quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively.Sales from our fruit juice beverages segment were $3.7 million for the third quarter of 2017, as compared to sales of $4.6 million for the same period of 2016. The decline was primarily due to a decrease in sales volume as a result of heavy competition in the China market.Sales from our others products segment were $0.01 million for the third quarter of 2017, as compared to sales of $0.6 million for the same period of 2016. The Company does not expect continued sales from the other products segment as customers' orders related to this segment are currently small and unpredictable.Gross Loss. Consolidated gross loss was $0.08 million for the third quarter of 2017, as compared to gross profit of $3.1 million for the same period of 2016. The consolidated gross loss margin was 2% for the third quarter of 2017 as compared to a gross profit margin 29% for the same period of 2016. The gross loss margin of the concentrated apple juice segment for the third quarter of 2017 was 5% as compared to a gross profit margin of 3% for the same period of 2016. The decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to a decrease in the sales price of concentrated apple juice in the international market. The gross profit margin of the concentrated kiwifruit juice and kiwifruit puree segment for the third quarters of 2017 and 2016 were 24% and 4%, respectively, with the period-to-period increase primarily due to an increase in the sales price of concentrated kiwifruit juice and kiwifruit puree in the current quarter. The gross profit margin of the concentrated pear juice segment for the third quarters of 2017 and 2016 were 8% and 28%, respectively, with the period-to-period decrease primarily due to the higher costs of raw materials. The gross loss margin of the fruit juice beverages segment for the third quarter of 2017 was 3% as compared to a gross profit margin of 29% for the same period of 2016. The decrease in profit margin was primarily due to lower production during the third quarter of 2017, which resulted in a higher ratio of fixed expenses to the unit cost of our products. In addition, the unit selling prices of our products decreased in the third quarter of 2017 as compared to the same period of 2016 as a result of heavy market competition. The gross profit margin of the other products segment for the third quarters of 2017 and 2016 was 50% and 53%, respectively.Third Quarter 2017 and 2016 Gross Profit by Segment(In $000's)Three Months Ended September 30,20172016Gross profit/lossGross marginGross profit/lossGross marginConcentrated apple juice and apple aroma(30)(5%)103%Concentrated kiwifruit juice and kiwi puree4524%44%Concentrated pear juice18%1,36728%Fruit juice beverages(99)(3%)1,36029%Other750%32453%Total(76)(2%)3,06529%Operating Expenses.Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2017 were $8.9 million as compared to $2.1 million for the same period of 2016.General and administrative (G&A) expenses increased to $8.7 million for the third quarter of 2017 as compared to $1.0 million for the same period of 2016, primarily attributable to expenses of $6.0 million recorded in the third quarter of 2017 that are a result of legal proceedings with China Cinda Asset Management Co., Ltd. Shaanxi Branch ("Cinda Shaanxi Branch") associated with loan guarantees that the Company entered into for two of its fruit suppliers. As the Company is in the process of settlement discussions as to this matter, the Company withdrew its non-enforcement request with the Xi'an Intermediate People's Court without prejudice, although it can refile the non-enforcement request at any time. Since the Company may still be liable for what it deems to be loans from Cinda Shaanxi Branch, it recorded expenses of $6.0 million as part of G&A expenses resulting from the judicial enforcement proceedings in the third quarter of 2017. The current quarter's G&A expenses also increased due to the amortization of leasing expenses associated with the kiwi orchard that the Company leased in Mei County and Yidu City. The Company has amortized $0.7 million as leasing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2017.Selling expenses decreased to $0.2 million for the third quarter of 2017, as compared to $1.1 million for the same period of in 2016, mainly due to a decrease in shipping and handling expenses due to the decrease in sales volume in the current quarter.Net Loss and Loss per Share.Net loss attributable to Future FinTech shareholders for the third quarter of 2017 was $9.3 million, as compared to a net loss of $0.4 million for the same period of 2016.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016, the Company's financing activities generated net cash inflows of $6.4 million and $24.0 million, respectively. The decrease in cash inflow from financing activities was mainly due to a decrease in capital contributions of $11.5 million. Project UpdatesThe Company is developing an orange processing and distribution center pursuant to its investment/service agreement with the Yidu Municipal People's Government in Hubei Province, China. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company will be responsible for an investment amount of approximately $48 million which will be mainly used to establish the distribution center and the orange processing facility on project land of approximately 280 mu (approximately 46 acres). Also, the Company and the Yidu Municipal People's Government has agreed to discuss the investment amount and location associated with establishing an R&D center and an orange plantation. On November 23, 2015, the Company started the construction of the Yidu project. As the Chinese government recently tightened environmental regulations, the Company is in the process of adapting to the new standards and the project has been delayed. Although the schedule for completion could change, the Company currently plans to finish the construction of infrastructure to include an office building, R&D center, fruit juice production facility, cold storage facility and other construction work in the second quarter of 2018. Although the schedule for completion could change, the distribution center is currently planned to be completed by the second quarter of 2018, and the orange plantation is currently planned to be operational in the second quarter of 2018.The Company is developing a kiwi processing and trading center pursuant to its investment agreement with the Managing Committee of Mei County National Kiwi Fruit Wholesale Trading Center, which has been authorized by the People's Government of Mei County, China. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company will be responsible for construction and financing with an investment amount of approximately $72 million for buildings and equipment on a total planned area of 286 mu (approximately 47 acres).  As of the date of this report, the Company is in the process of building fruit juice production lines, a vegetable and fruit flash freeze facility, an R&D center and an office building. Although the schedule for completion could change, the Company currently plans to complete the construction of these facilities in the fourth quarter of 2017.As of the date of this release, the Mei County National Kiwi Fruit Wholesale Trading Center has started normal operations. There are a number of enterprises operating in the trading center including 12 express delivery companies, four logistic companies, four on-line sales companies, two packing companies and three agriculture companies. In addition, all government departments that are relevant to the operations of the Mei County National Kiwi Fruit Wholesale Trading Center have moved into the trading center. Currently Mei County National Kiwi Fruit Wholesale Trading is building a data platform for agricultural products in the western part of China, an agricultural business incubator, and online-to-offline agricultural products trading center. To meet this requirement, the Company is upgrading its software and the project has been delayed. The Company is expected to have completed its investment in the trading center in the fourth quarter of 2017, and believes that it will generate income from the trading center through various means, such as rental income from cold storage and shops, and income from logistic services.As part of the Mei County National Kiwi Fruit Wholesale Trading Center project, on April 19, 2013, the Company established Shaanxi Guoweimei Kiwi Deep Processing Co., Ltd. to engage in the business of producing kiwi fruit juice, kiwi puree, cider beverages, and related products. The total estimated investment is RMB 294 million (or approximately $47.6 million). As the Chinese government recently tightened environment regulations, the Company is in the process of adapting to the new standards and the project has been delayed. The Company is building fruit juice production lines, a vegetable and fruit flash freeze facility, an R&D center and an office building. Although the schedule for completion could change, the Company currently plans to complete construction in the second quarter of 2018.The Company entered into a Letter of Intent with the People's Government of Suizhong County fruit to establish a fruit and vegetable industry chain and processing zone in Suizhong County, Liaoning Province, China. The Company has made partial payment to acquire the land use right from the local government, purchase equipment and build facilities. As of the date of this release, the Company has finished construction of an office building, a dormitory, a refrigeration storage facility and a warehouse. However, due to heavy competition in the concentrated apple juice business in China, the Company's Huludao Wonder and Yingkou facilities in Liaoning have had no production over the past two years, and construction work on this project is currently suspended.Recent EventsOn November 6, 2017, the Company announced that on November 2, 2017, one of its wholly owned subsidiaries, Hedetang Foods (China) Co., Ltd. ("Hedetang"), entered into a series of agreements to acquire financial assets (collectively, the "Acquisition Agreements"). The financial assets have been assessed by an appraisal firm, and three of four of the financial assets are either guaranteed by a third-party company or secured by land use rights.

Blockchain Leaders Coinfirm, NEO and QRC Partner to Build Smart Economy Ecosystem; AML/CTF risk and compliance platform Coinfirm, China-based blockchain giant NEO and blockchain venture platform QRC collaborate to address an industry-wide regulatory roadblock and to build a compliant blockchain economyPR NewswireDecember 13, 2017 Wednesday 6:58 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 791 wordsDateline: LONDON, Dec. 13, 2017 BodyRegtech leader Coinfirm announced today it has partnered with the blockchain platform NEO and the specialist venture platform QRC to nurture a compliant blockchain 'smart economy', with a particular focus in Asia.The collaboration launched this week when Coinfirm CEO and Co-Founder Pawel Kuskowski and QRC CEO Adam Vaziri joined the NEO team at NEO's blockchain competition kick off event in Tokyo. The three entities, who share a common interest in fostering compliance, will join forces in a program that will help spur development on the NEO blockchain -- a pillar in the Chinese blockchain community.The sudden ICO ban by the Chinese government earlier this year had a big impact on the blockchain industry and threw the spotlight onto regulation. Now, Coinfirm, NEO and QRC have teamed up to address the enduring insufficiency in blockchain regulation. Tackling this long-standing roadblock could open up the entire blockchain ecosystem to the mass market, and support the trend for ICO's.NEO is a non-profit community-based blockchain project that utilizes blockchain technology and digital identity to digitize assets, to automate their management using smart contracts and to realize a "smart economy" with a distributed network.QRC is a regtech specialist venture platform with a presence in the UK, Hong Kong, Japan, China, Vietnam and Malaysia. The company provides a 'one-stop-shop' for blockchain projects with the capability to handle design, build and deploy regtech tokens, as well as oversee the legal aspects."The blockchain community is all about collaboration and it is a delight to join forces with two entities who share with us the vision and capacity to embed compliance in the industry," Kuskowski said. "Launching this initiative in Asia has been particularly gratifying because of the vibrant engagement in a region that is crucial for the success of blockchain."Coinfirm has built its presence in the sphere through innovative solutions and partnerships with major players from both the crypto and traditional financial sectors for almost two years, including virtual currency leaders Dash and RSK (Rootstock), and international asset management funds such as SEI.QRC and Coinfirm have had an ongoing relationship and recently QRC also became an exclusive partner for Coinfirm's AMLT token in Japan. The token of compliance, AMLT is currently in the beginning of its Token Sale and is designed to bring new levels of transparency and democratization to the financial system by actively involving market participants in risk determination. AMLT Token will help fuel transactions on the Coinfirm platform, enabling risk management and creating a network for safe and transparent value exchange.Through their respective commitments the three groups help set the foundation for a new standard of safety and compliance that encourages the wider participation in global markets. This will both increase the efficiency of transactions and also improve trust for new and existing members in those markets.About CoinfirmCoinfirm is a recognized leader in their field, ranked among the most influential blockchain and regtech companies and serves as a foundation for the safe adoption and use of blockchain. The Coinfirm AML/CTF Platform uses proprietary algorithms and big data analysis to provide structured actionable data that increases efficiency, reduces costs and streamlines compliance to near automation. The blockchain agnostic platform benefits companies operating around blockchain as well as major financial institutions, asset management companies and BI companies.http://www.coinfirm.ioFor more information on Coinfirm's AMLT visit:https://amlt.coinfirm.ioAbout NeoNEO is a non-profit community-based blockchain project that utilizes blockchain technology and digital identity to digitize assets, to automate the management of digital assets using smart contracts, and to realize a "smart economy" with a distributed network. NEO was founded in 2014 and was real-time open source on GitHub in June 2015.About QRCQRC is a regtech specialist venture platform with a presence in the UK, Hong Kong, Japan, China, Vietnam and Malaysia. QRC has three areas to their business. The QRC Hub is a 'one-stop-shop' for blockchain projects with the capability to handle design, build and deploy regtech tokens, as well as oversee the legal aspects. QRC Institute works with universities to conduct blockchain research. QRC Ventures is the investment arm of the QRC Group that specialises in regtech projects and tools for the blockchain. View original content with multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blockchain-leaders-coinfirm-neo-and-qrc-partner-to-build-smart-economy-ecosystem-300570696.htmlSOURCE CoinfirmCONTACT: Lawrence Chiu, lawrence@tokenmarket.net, +44-7594-006777Load-Date: December 14, 2017End of Document

Virginia Tech professor arrested, charged with defrauding governmentThe Breeze: James Madison UniversitySeptember 26, 2017 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 666 wordsBodyA Virginia Tech professor is accused of defrauding the United States government and the university in a case that involves grant funding in excess of $1 million.Yiheng Percival Zhang, 46, is charged with wire fraud, making criminal false claims and making false statements to the "detriment of the United States Government's innovation and development programs," according to a federal affidavit filed in the U.S. Western District Court of Virginia.He was arrested last week and was still in Roanoke jail as of Monday evening, according to court records. A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately return messages seeking comment on the case Monday.Zhang's lawyer, Scott Austin, said that "Dr. Zhang maintains his innocence and intends to vigorously fight the charges."Zhang is a biological systems engineering professor. His expertise is in protein engineering, synthetic biology and biofuels.Zhang, along with Tech graduate Zhiguang Zhu and postdoctoral researcher Chun You, are alleged to have defrauded the university, the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy by withholding grant funds between January 2014 and May 2016, according to the complaint.Zhu and You currently work for the Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology in China, according to court documentation and their LinkedIn profiles.The complaint alleges that Zhang filed for grants to get federal money to pay for work that had already been completed in China.It also states that as part of grant stipulations , Zhang owed Tech 30 percent of his grant money received from the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy.A university representative interviewed by law enforcement said the school only received about 18 percent, according to the complaint.It also alleges that there are potential violations of federal law in two additional grants that aren't included in the initial filing last week.Zhang is accused of not being truthful on reporting what he did with grant money on forms filed through federal agencies that gave him awards in excess of the $1 million.He was still an employee of Virginia Tech on Monday, according to university spokesman Mark Owczarski.His annual salary was $113,772 in 2015-16, according to a state salary database maintained by The Richmond Times-Dispatch.Zhang is also being sued by a former employee of his startup Cell-Free Bioinnovations, Inc.According to filings in the Charlottesville division of the U.S. District Court of Virginia, the former employee started a new company called Bonumose Biochem LLC in Charlottesville.That lawsuit alleges that confidential trade-related information the former employee helped to develop with Cell-Free Bioinnovations was used by Chun You, the former student under Zhang, to benefit a Chinese government-owned company's work.That civil case is set to go to trial in 2018, according to online court records.Zhang has been teaching at Virginia Tech since 2005 and became a U.S. citizen in 2011.In May of 2014, he received national attention when he developed a method to turn wood chips into edible starches. He has since been featured by national news outlets and has been the recipient of several awards during his Virginia Tech tenure.In 2015, Zhang and his family settled with Carilion Clinic for a $1.8 million payout from a malpractice lawsuit after his infant daughter was permanently damaged by a procedure by doctors at Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital in 2012.Under the deal, the child will receive about $5,000 a month for 50 years after she becomes an adult. Lump-sum payments of $50,000 are to be paid to a special needs trust fund in her name.Success! An email has been sent with a link to confirm list signup.Error!

Ford is betting China will beat the US and dominate the electric car market (F)Business Insider USDecember 5, 2017 Tuesday 01:36 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 377 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Mark Matousek)Highlight: Ford is making significant investments in the Chinese market.BodyKamran Jebreili / AP• Ford executive chairman William C. Ford Jr. said China will be the best market to develop and sell electric vehicles.• The Chinese and Beijing governments are making investments and regulations that encourage electric vehicle production.• Ford's research also found that Chinese consumers are less fearful of the potential problems electric cars could introduce than some of their international counterparts.Once criticized for their lack of innovation, American car companies are making            heavy investments in electric and autonomous cars. But Ford executive chairman William C. Ford Jr. thinks China will be the most promising market for the development and sale of electric vehicles,            according to the New York Times."It's clearly the case that China will lead the world in E.V. development," Ford Jr. said on Tuesday while speaking in Shanghai. This may explain why Ford recently announced a $756 million joint venture with Chinese auto company Zotye Auto to produce and sell electric cars in China. Ford hopes to have 15 models ready by 2025.Ford is not the only car manufacturer developing an aggressive strategy in China, as General Motors, Daimler, and Volkswagen are making similar investments. They have been encouraged by China and Beijing's governments, which have put significant resources behind electric vehicle manufacturing and have introduced regulations that mandate car companies sell a greater proportion of electric and hybrid vehicles or get shut out of the world's biggest car market.Car manufacturers may also find consumers who are more willing to make the switch from gas to electric-powered vehicles. Ford has indicated its market research points to a consumer base that is less pessimistic about how far electric cars will be able to travel per charge, among other potential concerns.NOW WATCH: Ford has built a plug-in hybrid cop carSee Also:• Elon Musk's Boring Company just revealed a map of its proposed LA tunnel system• The CEOs of Apple and Google spoke at a conference that critics say makes them 'complicit actors in the Chinese censorship regime'• Three aviation giants are working together to create hybrid electric planesSEE ALSO: Wall Street couldn't be more wrong about Ford's businessLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

Future FinTech Group Reports Second Quarter 2017 Financial ResultsPR NewswireAugust 15, 2017 Tuesday 4:06 PM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4459 wordsDateline: XI'AN, China, Aug. 15, 2017 BodyFuture FinTech Group Inc. (NASDAQ: FTFT) ("Future FinTech" or "the Company"), a financial technology company and integrated producer of fruit-related products, today announced its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017.Second Quarter 2017 Summary:Total revenue was $2.8 millionGross profit was $1.3 millionGross profit margin was 47%Net loss attributable to Future FinTech was $2.5 millionCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $4.4 million as of June 30, 2017"We reported a decline in our financial results relative to the year ago quarter attributable to a difficult market environment resulting from a business contraction in all of our fruit product segments. A reduction in market demand, competitive pressures and an erosion in pricing caused a contraction in demand for our core fruit-related product segments," said Mr. Hongke Xue, Chief Executive Officer of Future FinTech. "Although our fruit products business is currently facing challenges, we believe that our mission to lead the company into a new direction by utilizing sophisticated fintech capabilities to build a highly integrated agricultural enterprise will create a wide spectrum of growth opportunities.""A key growth initiative is our development of a kiwi processing and trading center in Mei County coupled with the lease of 3,292 acres of kiwi orchards and planned purchase of an additional 833 acres of kiwi orchards that will enable us to source our own supply and maintain our high quality standards. We are also adding a new fruit segment to our product platform by leasing 1,317 acres of orange orchards in Yidu, Hubei Province to be integrated with the development of new state-of-the-art orange processing facilities. We plan to utilize fintech, e-commerce and best-in-class agricultural practices to integrate production and distribution in order to maximize our return on investment for these key initiatives," continued Mr. Hongke Xue."We are excited about the potential breadth of opportunities as well as our strategic approach to create sustainable value from our investments in fintech, e-commerce, commodities trading and in-house agricultural sourcing. Our vision is to augment our fruit juice and beverage sales and distribution with high margin fintech growth opportunities so as to generate diversified sources of cash flow for many years to come," Mr. Hongke Xue concluded.Second Quarter 2017 Financial ResultsRevenue for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was $2.8 million, as compared to revenue of $10.2 million for the same period of 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in sales in all of the Company's fruit-related product segments.Fiscal Year Revenue by Segment (in thousands)(In $000's, except %'s)Quarter Ended June 30,20172016% of changeConcentrated apple juice and apple aroma311,880(98%)Concentrated kiwifruit juice and kiwi puree117431(73%)Concentrated pear juice113957(88%)Fruit juice beverages2,5045,457(54%)Others121,504(99%)Total2,77710,229(73%)Revenue by SegmentSales from apple-related products were $0.03 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to sales of $1.9 million for the same period of 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a sharp decrease in the unit price of the apple-related products in the international market and a decrease in sales volume due to heavy competition. During the second quarter of 2017, the Company sold approximately 460 tons of concentrated apple juice and apple aroma as compared to 1,219 tons in the same period of 2016. Most of the Company's concentrated apple juice was sold directly or indirectly to the international market. Over the past three years, the purchase price of fresh apples has increased but the sales price of concentrated apple related products has remained low. Because of the negative trends in the international market and lower operating margins, our YingKou and Huludao Wonder factories did not operate their apple juice production facilities in fiscal 2016 and the six months ended June 30, 2017, which resulted in a lower inventory of concentrated apple juice and required the Company to purchase supply from third-party manufacturers to meet demand.Sales from concentrated kiwifruit juice and kiwifruit puree were $0.1 million for the second quarter of 2017, as compared to sales of $0.4 million for the same period of 2016. The decline was due to a decrease in products sold in the current quarter as compared to same period of 2016 due to lower market demand.Sales of concentrated pear juice were $0.1 million for the second quarter of 2017, as compared to sales of $1.0 million for the same period of 2016. The decline was due to a decrease in the unit price of the concentrated pear juice and a decrease in sales volume due to lower customer demand. The Company sold 1,149 and 1,314 tons of concentrated pear juice during the second quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively.Sales from our fruit juice beverages segment were $2.5 million for the second quarter of 2017, as compared to sales of $5.5 million for the same period of 2016. The decline was primarily due to a decrease in sales volume as a result of heavy competition in the China market.Sales from our others products segment were $0.01 million for the second quarter of 2017, as compared to sales of $1.5 million for the same period of 2016. The sale from other products for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was concentrated orange juice. The Company does not expect continued sales from other products as customers' orders related to other products are currently small and unpredictable.Gross Profit.Consolidated gross profit was $1.3 million for the second quarter of 2017, as compared to $3.2 million for the same period of 2016, mainly due to the decrease in sales from all of the Company's fruit-related segments. The consolidated gross profit margin was 47% for the second quarter of 2017 as compared to 31% for the same period of 2016 primarily due to the higher period-over-period weighting of the fruit juice beverages segment relative to each period's total gross margin. The gross profit margin of concentrated apple juice segment for the second quarters of 2017 and 2016 were 10% and 17%, respectively. The decrease in gross margin was mainly due to a decrease in the sales price of concentrated apple juice in the international market. The gross profit margin of the concentrated kiwifruit juice and kiwifruit puree segment for the second quarters of 2017 and 2016 were 31% and 7%, respectively, primarily due to an increase in sales price of concentrated kiwifruit juice and kiwifruit puree in the current quarter. The gross profit margin of the concentrated pear juice segment for the second quarters of 2017 and 2016 were 19% and 23%, respectively, with the decrease in the current quarter primarily due to the higher costs of raw materials. The gross profit margin of the fruit juice beverages segment for the second quarters of 2017 and 2016 were 49% and 48%, respectively. The gross profit margin of the other products segment for the second quarters of 2017 and 2016 was 50% and 3%, respectively, as the Company purchased concentrated orange juice that was sold to their customers in the second quarter of 2016, and which resulted in a lower margin during that period. Quarter Ended June 30,(In $000's, except %'s)20172016Gross profitGross marginGross profitGross marginConcentrated apple juice and apple aroma310%32017%Concentrated kiwifruit juice and kiwi puree3631%327%Concentrated pear juice2119%21623%Fruit juice beverages1,22649%2,60048%Others650%433%Total1,29247%3,21131%NFM = Not meaningful figureOperating expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2017 were $3.4 million, as compared to $1.8 million for the same period of 2016. General and administrative expenses increased to $3.1 million for the second quarter of 2017 as compared to $1.0 million for the same period of 2016, mainly due to an increase in the amortization of leasing expenses associated with the kiwi orchard that the Company leased in Mei County and the city of Yidu. The Company has amortized $1.5 million as leasing expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The Company began the amortization of land lease rights in Hedetang Foods Industry (Yidu) Co, Shaanxi Guoweimei Kiwi Deep Processing Company and Trading Market Mei County beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016. Selling expenses decreased to $0.3 million for the second quarter of 2017, as compared to $0.8 million for the same period of in 2016, mainly due to the reduced amount of sales in the current quarter.Net loss attributable to Future FinTech shareholders for the second quarter of 2017 was $2.5 million, as compared to net income of $0.4 million for the same period of 2016. Diluted loss per share from continued operations was $0.49 for the second quarter of 2017 as compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.12 for the same period of 2016.Financial ConditionAs of June 30, 2017, the Company had $4.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, an increase from $1.1 million as of December 31, 2016. The Company had working capital of $22.1 million as of June 30, 2017 as compared to working capital of $24.7 million as of December 31, 2016. As of June 30, 2017, the Company had total liabilities of $93.6 million, which included $30.1 million in short-term bank loans and $16.9 million in capital lease obligations. Stockholders' equity attributable to Future FinTech was $132.3 million as of June 30, 2017 as compared to $135.0 million as of December 31, 2016.During the six months ended June 30, 2017, net cash provided by the Company's operating activities was $0.1 million, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $6.6 million for the same period of 2016. The decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in net income of $4.3 million. During the six months ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016, the Company's investing activities used net cash of $1.2 million and $32.3 million, respectively. The Company made a refundable deposit of about $30 million pursuant to the letter of intent to purchase kiwifruits orchard during the first six months ended June 30, 2016. During the six months ended June 30, 2017, our financing activities generated net cash inflow of $5.0 million as compared to net cash inflow of $22.9 million in the same period of 2016. The decrease in cash inflow from financing activities was mainly due to a decrease in capital contributions of $14.0 million. The Company expects projected cash flows from operations, anticipated cash receipts, cash on hand, and trade credit will provide the necessary capital to meet its projected operating cash requirements for at least the next twelve months, which does not take into account any potential expenditures related to the possible expansion of its current production capacity.Project UpdatesThe Company entered into a Letter of Intent with the People's Government of Suizhong County fruit to establish a fruit and vegetable industry chain and processing zone in Suizhong County, Liaoning Province, China. The Company has made partial payment to acquire the land use right from the local government, purchase equipment and build facilities. As of the date of this release, the Company has finished construction of an office building, dormitory, refrigeration storage facility and a warehouse. However, due to heavy competition in the concentrated apple juice business in China, construction work on this project is currently suspended.The Company is developing an orange processing and distribution center pursuant to its investment/service agreement with the Yidu Municipal People's Government in Hubei Province, China. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company will be responsible for an investment amount of approximately $48 million which will be mainly used to establish the distribution center and the orange processing facility on project land of approximately 280 mu (approximately 46 acres). Also, the Company and the Yidu Municipal People's Government has agreed to discuss the investment amount and location associated with establishing an R&D center and an orange plantation. On November 23, 2015, the Company started the construction of the Yidu project. As the Chinese government recently tightened environment regulations, the Company is in the process of adapting to the new standards and the project has been delayed. Although the schedule for completion could change, the Company currently plans to finish the construction of infrastructure to include an office building, R&D center, fruit juice production facility, cold storage facility and other construction work in the fourth quarter of 2017. Although the schedule for completion could change, the orange plantation is currently planned to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the distribution center is currently planned to be completed by the second quarter of 2018.The Company is developing a kiwi processing and trading center pursuant to its investment agreement with the Managing Committee of Mei County National Kiwi Fruit Wholesale Trading Center, which has been authorized by the People's Government of Mei County, China. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company will be responsible for construction and financing with an investment amount of approximately $72 million for buildings and equipment on a total planned area of 286 mu (approximately 47 acres).  As of the date of this report, the Company is in the process of building fruit juice production lines, a vegetable and fruit flash freeze facility, an R&D center and an office building. Although the schedule for completion could change, the Company currently plans to complete the construction of these facilities in the fourth quarter of 2017.As of the date of this release, the Mei County National Kiwi Fruit Wholesale Trading Center has started normal operations. There are a number of enterprises operating in the trading center including 12 express delivery companies, four logistic companies, four on-line sales companies, two packing companies and three agriculture companies. In addition, all government departments that are relevant to the operations of the Mei County National Kiwi Fruit Wholesale Trading Center have moved into the trading center. Currently Mei County National Kiwi Fruit Wholesale Trading is building a data platform for agricultural products in the western part of China, an agricultural business incubator, and online-to-offline agricultural products trading center. To meet this requirement, the Company is upgrading its software and the project has been delayed. The Company is expected to have completed its investment in the trading center in the fourth quarter of 2017, and believes that it will generate income from the trading center through various means, such as rental income from cold storage and shops, and income from logistic services.As part of the Mei County National Kiwi Fruit Wholesale Trading Center project, on April 19, 2013, we established Shaanxi Guoweimei Kiwi Deep Processing Co., Ltd. to engage in the business of producing kiwi fruit juice, kiwi puree, cider beverages, and related products. The total estimated investment is RMB 294 million (or approximately $47.6 million). As the Chinese government recently tightened environment regulations, the Company is in the process of adapting to the new standards and the project has been delayed. The Company is building fruit juice production lines, a vegetable and fruit flash freeze facility, an R&D center and an office building. Although the schedule for completion could change, the Company currently plans to complete construction in the second quarter of 2018.Recent EventsOn June 6, 2017, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State for the State of Florida to amend and restate its articles of incorporation to change its name from SkyPeople Fruit Juice, Inc. to Future FinTech Group Inc.

Belt & Road Brand Expo 2017 in Shanghai comes to a successful closePR NewswireDecember 12, 2017 Tuesday 10:00 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1746 wordsDateline: SHANGHAI, Dec. 12, 2017 BodyThe "Better Life and Beyond"-themed Belt & Road Brand Expo 2017 came to a successful close at the Shanghai Exhibition Center on December 10, 2017.As the first edition of the event, the 10,000-square-meter exhibition assembled under one roof over 160 companies from 26 countries and regions, among them the host country, China, as well as Australia, Croatia, Cuba, the Czech Republic, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Greece, Hungary, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Mauritius, the Netherlands, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Turkey. Exhibitors from around the world showcased their best products, technologies and cultural artifacts in the food and beverage, cosmetics and skin care, handicrafts, home improvement, jewelry and gems, fashion and accessories, lifestyle, tourism and culture, as well as investment and trade sectors.The upcoming China International Import Expo in 2018 was announced at the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation held in Beijing in May 2017, further evidencing China's determination to continue its efforts in opening up its market to the world. Recently rolled-out policies are providing companies with investment and trade support as well as creating a friendly legal business environment that assists them in expanding on their globalization efforts. All of these actions are aligned with the guidelines of the Chinese government's One Belt, One Road Initiative. At the same time, the high level of engagement among professional buyers as well as by general visitors at the event reflected the new momentum in China's liberalization of trade.The Iran exhibition zone had on display hand-knitted Persian carpets, a handicraft dated back to as long as 260 years ago. In addition to carpets on display with lifelike images woven into the pattern reflecting the superior level of skill, Iranian companies also provided customized carpets, frames and cushions that meet the differing preferences of home owners, renters and decorators. Several Iranian exhibitors who attended a Chinese exhibition for the first time were deeply impressed by the huge market and high purchasing power of China's consumers. They quickly became cognizant of the vast potential behind the business opportunity and the enhanced access to the favorable business environment in China by participating in the event. High-end fine hand-knitted carpets that are well suited to enhance the decor of a Chinese home were on display, while affordable middle-end machine-made carpets attracted much attention from professional buyers. During the expo, the Iranian exhibitors showcased Persian culture as well as the country's centuries-old handicraft art with the aim of providing Chinese consumers with access to products embodying Iran's culture.Attendees had an opportunity to enjoy the aroma of Ceylon black tea from Sri Lanka. The island country's exhibitors said the popularity of Ceylon tea among Chinese consumers has continued to increase over last few years. Show visitors were provided an opportunity to sample the many flavors of the black tea. The exhibitors observed a strong preference for the tea among Shanghai-based visitors and, as a result, plan to focus on expanding their presence in Shanghai. An exhibitor from the island nation who engages primarily in Sri Lankan cotton products noted that it was his first visit to Shanghai, however, the positive feedback the exhibitor received during the three-day exhibition made him feel that he had found an exciting new market for his products. Consequently, he plans to open an online store working with one of the cross-border e-commerce firms, targeting the local Shanghai market. Sri Lankan sapphires showcased at a booth, despite the booth's non-prominent location, still drew an immense crowd and attention.  Pakistan-based companies displayed their handicraft and jade creations that feature the country's national colors. An exhibitor from the South Asian country said their presence at the event allowed Shanghainese shoppers to gain direct access to Pakistani specialty products, while his hand-made rosewood furniture on display received many positive comments from buyers and visitors passing by the booth. He said that he believes the One Belt, One Road initiative is sure to create more business opportunities for companies in Pakistan. Russian exhibitors said they made contacts with more than 30 trading partners during the expo. They showcased Russian ice cream, biscuits and puffed grains, all of which drew the attention of visitors. The Russian exhibitors explained that the event served as a networking platform that helps them expand into the Chinese market. They plan to build a showroom in Shanghai, where they will showcase Russia's specialty products as well as products that have a Russian cultural basis.A cigar agent from the Dominican Republic said the event gave visitors an opportunity learn about Shanghai-based companies specializing in the promotion of the cigar culture. Leading Dominican cigar masters were invited to put on an on-site cigar rolling performance, drawing the attention of many visitors and helping promote the culture that has grown up around the cigar. The event also proved successful for exhibitors from Kazakhstan as they were able to establish connections with leading Chinese e-commerce firms, including JD.com and Suning.cn. They said they plan to work with these Chinese firms to open online stores with the goal of introducing organic and green products from the Central Asian country into the Chinese market.At the Poland exhibition zone, the exhibits that attracted the most attention were those displaying chrysophoron and beeswax, known in the Eastern European country as "living gems". In addition to being presented with a dizzying array of accessories, visitors were given an opportunity to get a close look at the country's signature products. The Polish exhibitors said they experienced better-than-expected outcomes and plan to attend future editions of the event, adding that they would come regardless of whether subsequent events are held in Shanghai or elsewhere in China.Exhibitors from Mauritius provided visitors an opportunity to taste their specialty rums, a product that has been proving to be an online sensation. An executive from a participating Mauritius-based company said, even as he first entered the business at quite a young age, he had already become aware of the enthusiasm that Chinese shoppers has expressed about Mauritian rums and was confident about his expansion into China.Exquisite thangkas were on display at the Nepal exhibition zone. Skilled painters delivered an on-site drawing performance with natural mineral pigments of different colors, leaving a deep impression on attendees. Additionally, the on-site wood carving performance and the showcase of Buddha sound bowls were events that drew large crowds. Attendees expressed their interest in the Kopi Luwak or civet coffee displayed at the Indonesia exhibition zone, while giving high praise to the preservative-free seven-layer honey cakes made primarily from honey and walnuts after tasting them in the area reserved for exhibitors from the Czech Republic. The exhibitors who had established online stores on Taobao.com, China's leading online marketplace for retailers, saw the traffic to their store skyrocket as a result of their presence at the expo. Roses from Ecuador, among other little-known products displayed at the exhibition, gave attendees a chance to get a real and authentic sense of the culture, customs and lifestyles that define each of the 26 countries participating in the event.Chinese companies were the main exhibitors in the enterprise pavilions, with product displays from companies located in Ordos (Inner Mongolia), Huzhou (Zhejiang Province), Hong Kong and Taiwan being featured. Bright Food Group and its subsidiary Shanghai Tangjiu Group, Shanghai Yimin Commercial Group, Liangyou Group, Bright Dairy & Food and Shanghai Maling Aquarius each had exhibits. The Shanghai Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives teamed up with the city's time-honored brands to showcase their products. In the role of both traders and exhibitors, they sought opportunities in terms of networking, exchanges and partnerships with companies participating in the event.During the expo, a comprehensive series of concurrent events were held, including 12 forums and promotional conferences, several of which were hosted by consul generals, commercial attachés and other official representatives of countries with a presence in Shanghai, with a focus on investment and trade, tourism and culture as well as education in the folkloric traditions of each of the participating countries. The planned events included nearly 50 business matching sessions, attended by leading supermarket brands, including Bailian Group, RT-Mart, Auchan, Metro, JD.com, Suning.cn and Yhd.com, as well as several other leading Chinese e-commerce companies. Some sessions featured exotic performances that delivered an education in the tea and incense ceremonies that prevailed during the Han Dynasty. A few specialized events focused on scenario-based and "hands-on" experiences with many of the products on display throughout the expo.The three-day event brought together companies from across the world with the aim of leveraging the opportunities created by the One Belt, One Road Initiative as well as building an international platform for China and countries targeted by the Initiative where they could display their high-quality specialty products, engage in cultural exchanges with other participating countries at the event as well as generally promote trade exchanges and other forms of cooperation. Future editions of the event will be committed to showcasing branding products from a wider range of countries and providing visitors with an even more diverse set of exotic experiences. In addition to helping Chinese companies expand beyond the home market and introducing products from around the world, the event shares the vision of the One Belt, One Road initiative while responding to the expectation among Chinese consumers for an enhanced standard of living.  View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/belt--road-brand-expo-2017-in-shanghai-comes-to-a-successful-close-300569944.htmlSOURCE Shanghai International Exhibition Co., Ltd.CONTACT: Zhao Luyi, +86-21-6279-2828 ext.225Load-Date: December 13, 2017End of Document

White House Staff Shakeup; Pres To Hold Small Biz Meeting; Highest Real Estate Returns; Wasserman Schultz Inquiry; Tesla Model 3 Dash Changes; Hackers Hit HBO;MORNINGS WITH MARIA MORNINGS WITH MARIA 8:00 AM ESTAugust 1, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; DomesticLength: 7931 wordsByline: Maria Bartiromo, Dagen McDowell, Cheryl Casone, Tracee CarrascoGuests: Kathryn Rooney Vera, Mitch Roschelle; Roger KayBodyMARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning everybody. Thank you so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, August 1st. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Earnings in focus on Wall Street, all eyes on Apple this morning, the Dow component is reporting earnings after the closing bell tonight. We have the numbers you need to watch for. We are looking at a rally at the opening of trade quite the way to start a new month, August 1 and we see new records.Futures indicating the markets will open strongly, continuing the momentum of yesterday. The Dow is now eyeing 22000 coming off of another all-time high, the 30th all-time high so far this year. Dow Industrials set to open up 100 points, NASDAQ up 20 points, S&P 500 up five. That's a quarter of a percent.In Europe markets are also posting modest gains this morning. Take a look. Up about two-thirds of a percent across the board. And in Asia overnight gains across the board there as well, muted higher but nonetheless higher by three quarters of a percent in Hong Kong and in Korea, up a third of a percent in Japan.Onto the U.S. and specifically the White House, another staff shake-up, Anthony Scaramucci has been removed as White House communications director about 11 days after taking the job. This coming on General John Kelly's first day as the new White House chief of staff. The president praising Kelly at the White House yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I predict that General Kelly will go down in terms of the position of chief of staff, one of the great ever and we're going to have a big time but much more importantly we're going to work hard and we're going to make America great again.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The administration looking to move forward on policy as the president holds a meeting with small business owners this afternoon talking taxes and tax reform. Outrage on the streets of New York City, naked female panhandlers are harassing tourists in Time Square apparently. Why police say there is nothing much they can do about it because women are illegal immigrants. Really?Tesla showing off the dashboard of its new Model 3 but it is not what you used to. Plus, getting the most out of your real estate investment. A new report breaking down the top ZIP codes with the highest returns, is yours on it. Plus pairing wine and DNA. A new look at the new startup that uses genetics to help you select your next sip.All those stories coming up this morning. And joining me to talk all about it, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, PwC Partner Mitch Roschelle, and Bulltick Capital Market head of research, Kathryn Rooney Vera. Great to see you, everybody.KATHRYN ROONEY VERA, HEAD OF RESEARCH, BALTIC CAPITAL MARKET: Great to see you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Good show today.MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER: Pairing wine with DNA?VERA: Very interesting.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Where are the Trump tweets? (INAUDIBLE) the president.VERA: Good point.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: Let's get this party rolling, maybe it is a new era.VERA: This is true.MCDOWELL: Maybe this is --(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: I highly doubt that the president handed over his phone, but --BARTIROMO: Generally Kelly says he wants to put discipline in that White House and --(CROSSTALK)ROSCHELLE: You haven't seen the tweets since.MCDOWELL: There you --BARTIROMO: Those tweet. Yes.MCDOWELL: May I add one really quickly?BARTIROMO: Yes, please.MCDOWELL: The president keeps crowing about the record stock market we're watching for with Dow 22000 right now, moving great. We're looking at a really strong open at the moment.BARTIROMO: A hundred points.MCDOWELL: He keeps talking about record stock markets, the job growth, the unemployment rate, how great confidence is. You might want to stop taking credit for all that because policy wise, you haven't done a whole lot in terms of the agenda to really justify this market because when the market eventually and it will turn south, are you going to own it then?BARTIROMO: Yes. But you know the market is always going to be anticipating everything, right? So right now you got investors anticipating that maybe we will see lower taxes, maybe we will see a rollback in regulation. All that anticipation has created what? $3 trillion in market value since the election?MCDOWELL: As the Wall Street Journal put it yesterday, there was a quote in there that investors actually overestimated President Trump and underestimated corporate earnings.ROSCHELLE: Yes. Right.MCDOWELL: So --BARTIROMO: Good point. Yes.MCDOWELL: So it's really the earnings that are driving this story, not what's coming out of Washington.VERA: I think it's going to be hard to maintain double-digit earnings growth year-over-year without tax reform.BARTIROMO: Yes.VERA: Because tax has been great but (INAUDIBLE) hasn't been (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: Profits were 15 percent in the first quarter, they're talking about 11 percent.ROSCHELLE: Yes.BARTIROMO: Eleven percent growth.ROSCHELLE: But part of that is CEOs were optimistic that --BARTIROMO: But that's (INAUDIBLE) anticipating.ROSCHELLE: The change in leadership and realized some of the investment decisions that were made were made in the second and third quarter of last year, as well before the outcome relations (INAUDIBLE) there will be change and they were optimistic they decided to reinvest but if there's no net after tax savings.VERA: That's right.BARTIROMO: Luck for them profits were strong.MCDOWELL: Right.BARTIROMO: And that's the back drop and that is our top story right now. We are on Dow watch 22000, Dow futures indicating, we will see Dow 22000 in short order once the market opens this morning. We're talking about 100- point move at the open, now, we closed at an all-time high yesterday. As you see there, one of the markets biggest names set to report fiscal third- quarter earnings after the bell tonight. Apple is estimated to show a profit $1.57 a share. We're expecting revenue for the quarter almost $45 billion for the quarter.Investors will also be looking to see what the technology giant has to say about iPhone sales, whether there is a pause in purchases in anticipation of the iPhone 8 which is out in the fall. Joining us right now, the founder and president in Endpoint Technologies Associates, Roger Kay. Roger, good to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.ROGER KAY, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, ENDPOINT TECHNOLOGIES ASSOCIATES: Hi, Maria.BARTIROMO: How important is this quarter for Apple, how important is the Apple report to the market? And this idea that it's all about profits in terms of the backdrop leading this market to all-time highs?KAY: Yes. I think that this market is going to be pretty much a cakewalk for Tim Cook. This is the low quarter of the year, so expectations are low seasonally. Everyone is aware that there's a pause where iPhone 7 sales have slowed a bit before the iPhone 8 comes out. They're even aware that the iPhone 8 may be a bit delayed because the supply constraint on the fancy OLED screens. So that gives him a lot of room to just say, well, you know, we did the best we could and then if things are OK, of course, OK for them being still enormous revenues and profits. So there's nothing wrong in the soup, it's just that some of the numbers are going to come out later in the year and so, therefore, this is going to be a little bit soft. It may be below expectations but I don't think it's going to hurt the company very much, certainly not the stock.VERA: Roger, what does this mean in terms of tech, the broader sector. There's been a lot of talk of tech being in a bubble. How does tech really compare in terms of valuations and otherwise versus the tech bubble, is it really comparable or do you think this is a different scenario?KAY: Well, tech is sort of in its own world to some degree, you can watch the sector move independently of others quite often. I think yesterday the NASDAQ was going down while the Dow is going up. That was mostly tech shares doing that. So it's really there is that but also it's important to say that Apple itself doesn't always move with the rest of the tech sector. So, Apple is in some sense in its zone.ROSCHELLE: Roger, one thing the things that's -- is that in China, in greater China that sales have been down, and I'm looking at a dollar that's been weakening. And with the fact that the U.S. dollar is on sale, sort of the catalyst that sort of get sales of U.S. products like Apple products, anything broaden technology in general, sort of back on the favored purchase list of foreign retail consumers.KAY: Yes. Well, so I think the situation with China is pretty particular. You know, Apple has done better than a lot of American companies in China. I had recently appointed a China head who knows the local territory well. And it recently pulled from its app store certain messaging apps that allowed Chinese citizens to communicate an encrypted faction with the outside world. And Apple agreed to do that. So Apple is playing nice with the government in order to keep the doors open there.But, by the way, consumers are looking at for example, very nice android- based Chinese made phones for a lot less money, they're looking at a very nice Samsung Galaxy 8. So they have actually choices that are -- that have been taking them away from Apple to some degree. So, Apple is in a pitch battle in China, it's trying to be careful and do the right thing but there is no guarantee that its sales are going to increase over there.MCDOWELL: Well, this is a big picture question about China, though. Given the -- what we're facing here in the U.S. with North Korea, the provocation from the hermit kingdom and it increasingly looks like the Trump administration is going to take a harder line on China and I'm not talking about just secondary sanctions on banks and individual companies but are we looking at a trade war and how did that impact at least Apple's stock if the -- if the rhetoric coming out of Washington becomes a little more severe?KAY: Well, that's a big question I (INAUDIBLE)MCDOWELL: Give it a shot.KAY: My sense of it -- yes, I will. So, my sense of it is that Donald Trump isn't actually that aware of what the Chinese are -- what cards the Chinese are actually holding. The Chinese have a -- have a lot of leverage they can pull against the United States if they want to. They don't really want to because bilateral trade is good for them and they're certainly enjoying it but they have a lot of things they can do, if Trump tries to threaten them in some way. And I think that he would be quite surprised by how severe they could be, Chinese government is -- well, it may not be more unified than ours but it looks more unified than ours. And so I have a feeling that they can pretty much run it from the top down. So, they say we're not trading with you or we're cutting you off in some way or we're raising tariffs or something like that, then all the American companies will have to take the hit including Apple of course.BARTIROMO: Roger, we're watching an incredible stock market. We hit the 30th all-time high for the Dow industrials yesterday. 30 all-time highs year-to-date, we're looking at $3 trillion in value created since the election, it's obviously a busy earnings week, second busiest week for the -- for the second quarter and we've got the July jobs report out at the end of the week. Are any of these things that we're watching going to upset what has become stealth rally, it's expected to show that 183,000 jobs are added to the economy last month, the unemployment rate is expected to go down one tick to 4.3 percent. That's Thomson Reuters' expectations. What's your take on the backdrop here for the stock market?KAY: Well, everything is calm and everything is perfect. So I would say it's time to sell.BARTIROMO: Is that right? I mean, is that how you really looking at this as a contrary indicator that you think everything looks rosy and now you want to be a contrarian and get out, is that right?KAY: Well, exactly. I mean, what can go better than this would be the other way of asking that. So, you know, if we're already with everything's perfect and any little tiny perturbation of course could send things the other way but also people with a lot of profit could say, all right, I'm good, I'm pushing back from table now.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, I mean, the backdrop is strong, Dagen mentioned it earlier, earnings going to be up 11 percent the second quarter, Dagen?MCDOWELL: Right. And the expectations even looking into next year are still solid. You have global economies are all firing simultaneously. Something we haven't in recent years. We have a weaker dollar, we still have lower long-term interest rates, very low long-term interest rates here in the United States, you have pent-up capital that maybe companies will actually step and up and start investing.BARTIROMO: I think that's what's going to happen, businesses is going to feel unleashed, they're going to put their money to work and that's going to create whole another activity stream. Go ahead, Roger.KAY: You do -- you do want to -- you do want to keep an eye on something that Nassim Taleb would have brought up which is the black swan. So, you know, well, everything looks great, you know, a nuclear war with North Korea would upset a lot of things. So there are things that could happen but would change the picture very rapidly, and I think those are things need to be aware of.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Like there are things that you can't control.MCDOWELL: Well, that's why raised that issue, it doesn't -- it doesn't need to take a nuclear war, it can take just -- like very, very tough talk on trade coming out of Washington. And even not just end of secondary sanctions but even some trade restrictions with China that could send the market --ROSCHELLE: But what's interesting to me is the market has shrugged off all of this news like the Scaramucci store. Every little story two years ago probably would have caused the market to sell off 200 points but the markets just ignoring what I'm referring to as white noise that's coming out of the White House or coming out of Washington.BARTIROMO: Yes. And good reason to ignore it because you got profits that are stellar. And revenue growth as well, right?VERA: And volatility is at near decade lows from the past week.BARTIROMO: Yes.VERA: Nothing moves this market.KAY: Yes.BARTIROMO: Roger, good to see you, sir. Thanks for --KAY: Well, I take that back.BARTIROMO: Yes. Quite a road, Roger. Go ahead.KAY: Well, I take that back and it's probably going to go up forever.BARTIROMO: We didn't say it's going up forever.ROSCHELLE: We know you're selling though. You played (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: You are -- you are a seller and hey, that's what makes a market.VERA: That's right.ROSCHELLE: Yes.BARTIROMO: Roger, good to see you. Thank you so much, Roger Kay.KAY: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Still ahead, dashing the dashboard, the bull design decisions that make Tesla Model 3 unlike any other car you've seen before. And forget 90210. These are the ZIP codes you want to live in where you can see the biggest returns on your real estate, stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A conservative watch dog group is calling on congress to investigate Congressman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Cheryl Casone with the story. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: You know the story very well, Maria. So, the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust wants Wasserman Schultz investigated because she continues to employ a former house I.T. staffer for months after he was caught trying to leave the country. Imran Awan was fired by Wasserman Schultz only last week after he was arrested on bank fraud charges. He was trying to fly to Pakistan we should add. The watch dog group says the Florida democrat violated house rules by continuing to pay him after he was cut off from the house computer system.All right. Tesla's new Model 3 electric car has revolutionized the traditional dash board, as a matter of fact, it doesn't even have one. That's kind of the point. The Model 3 has stripped the divisional dashboard of all the gages and hardware features which drivers, you know, normally see. They've taken the speedometer and other gages traditional located behind the steering wheel, they move them over to a 15-inch touchscreen, that display is located in the center of the dash. So you can see it on your screen, decide if you like it for yourself or not. Tesla's stock up more than 51 percent so far this year.And there is this guys, real estate company Home Union releasing ZIP codes with the highest investment returns. Here are top three for you, 33434, that's Boca Raton, Florida, annual return 8.1 percent. 19035 is Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, the real estate return there 6.9 percent and then 48322, that's Bloomfield Township, Michigan, 6.9 percent annual return, Maria. Making some money in real estate.BARTIROMO: Wow. That is cool. All right. Well, I'm glad you narrowed it down to those ZIP codes. Thank you so much, Cheryl. Location, location, location.ROSCHELLE: There you go, I didn't see the 10504 there, that's my ZIP.BARTIROMO: I didn't see my ZIP code either. How is real estate doing right now?ROSCHELLE: I think it's OK. The problem is, there is just no supply, some people who want to buy homes can't buy them. And people who want to sell homes may not be able to buy the thing that they want to buy after they sell it. So there's a -- the volume is just going to continue to sort of peter out but the record low supply of new and existing homes on the market.BARTIROMO: And home come such record low supply?ROSCHELLE: Builders feel that their -- they have handcuffs on, they can't borrow as much as they like to borrow. They overregulated at a local level, land prices keep going up. So they're really sort of caught in malaise of inabilities to grow the way they want grow. There is demand that were forming households by crazy and they just can't create supply. Plus, there's a mindset and it's not just millenials (INAUDIBLE) mindset of people who would ordinarily be home buyers who have shifted towards renting because it just seems like a better value proposition. Anybody who lives through the financial crisis realizes that housing prices don't always go up, so people are (INAUDIBLE)MCDOWELL: And homeowners are choosing to renovate, that's a -- that's a incredible trend, it's home renovation because people can't buy a bigger home, so they're fixing up the ones they've got.ROSCHELLE: David bought a television network dedicated just to that.BARTIROMO: Yes. That's right.MCDOWELL: Very good point.BARTIROMO: Just tell us about that. We'll take a break. When we come back, tourists are getting an eyeful while sightseeing in Times Square that's for sure. Growing complaints from families this morning about near- naked women in Times Square hassling tourists for tips. Why police say they can't do anything to stop it because these are all illegal immigrants. Then, winter comes early for HBO. Hackers leaks spoilers online from the hit show Game of Thrones. What all was taken in the latest cyber-attack on Hollywood. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, maybe you've seen this before in New York. Near-naked women hassling for tips. It's turned Times Square into the Triple X crossroads of the world. Police say that their hands were tied meanwhile in arresting the lewd and rude pandhandlers because "most are illegal immigrations."Tracee Carrasco with the outrage this morning. Tracee, good morning to you. What a story.TRACEE CARRASCO, FBN REPORTER: Good morning. Yes. You know, this has been going on for years and among the Batman and Mickey Mouse costume characterizations in Times Square whom you and your kids can pose for pictures with and give a small tip to, they are the (INAUDIBLE) nudists, the mostly naked women covered strategically with body paint also hitting up tourists for money. Well, last summer the city painted these blue boxes on the ground and called them Designated Activity Zones, the areas where the characters and women can solicit for tips but the panhandlers frequently wander out of their designated areas and can get pushy looking for customers and tips. We spoke with some visitors who experienced this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They just come -- try to come right up into your face and, you know, want a picture? Want a picture? And, you know, they're just, you know, looking for money.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A little bit pushy, asking for more.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think they're trying to make living.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You get upset when they don't get a tip.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. Just tip, only tip, only tip.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARRASCO: And when the characters get out of line, well it's tough for NYPD to crack down. Although they do take action, the NYPD tells me so far this year, they've made five arrests compared to 26 for the same time last year. Officers have issued 159 summonses in 2017 compared to 137 for the same sometime in 2016. A law enforcement source told The New York Post, the past proposals to license the often pushy panhandlers went nowhere because "Most of them are illegal immigrants and wouldn't register anyway." In a statement, the president of the Times Square Alliance says "The handful of costume creeps who hustle, harass, and touch thousands of people a week without consent must be addressed. It's not about whether people lack garments or green cards, it's about whether they are engaged in nonconsensual or criminal conduct. It's about respecting boundaries whether in a public space or personal space.BARTIROMO: I don't understand why it's so hard for the NYPD to -- NYPD to enforce these laws. I mean, we've been hearing the president for -- since he's got in office saying that he's going to get control of the illegal situation in this country. And yet here we have them on display nearly naked and the cops can't do anything?CARRASCO: A lot of officers have said they have to witness them actually committing a crime. So, you know, whether it's the panhandling, they can't really say that's the crime, you know, as far as if they're --MCDOWELL: The crime is that they're in this country illegally.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: We're a sanctuary city in New York -- in New York, so the local police are not going to arrest these women for being here illegally. That's how the city works, it falls on the feds and immigration and custom enforcement.BARTIROMO: So who's accountable then, Dagen? I mean, what -- de Blasio, Governor Cuomo? Who's accountable for these people walking around half- naked, harassing --(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: And they do. I mean, I witnessed it on Saturday.BARTIROMO: What happened?MCDOWELL: They're aggressive, they're nasty, and where I grew, they're called prostitutes and that's illegal. So let's think about the law.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: It is really appalling. Very young children walking around Times Square.BARTIROMO: Yes. I like the Mickey Mouse.ROSCHELLE: Yes.VERA: I like to see these guys -- these ladies go the way of squeegee guys.MCDOWELL: Very nasty.VERA: Giuliani cracked down on those guys. We got a super same thing happen here.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll watch that. Tracee, thank you so much. Coming up. President Trump brings in the marines, how newly appointed chief of staff General John Kelly is already flexing his military muscle to get the White House under control.

What a way to kick off the new month, earnings , and rally and stocks. It is 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast. Earnings in focus this morning, among the top names reporting, Under Armour and Pfizer. Under Armour reporting a smaller than expected loss while Pfizer's earnings were mixed. As you see, Under Armour off of the lows but nonetheless down better than three percent; Pfizer down a fraction. The big one we're watching, Apple, what you need to know ahead of the technology giant's fiscal third-quarter earnings report. It happened after the close tonight, we will bring you the expectations.Meanwhile, we're looking at another rally on Wall Street. Futures indicating 100-point rally at the start of trading for Dow Industrials. This, after the Dow is off at a record-high close yesterday, the 30th record high of the year. The Dow Industrials today may hit 22,000 right out of the gate. In Europe, the major indices are higher across the board. Take a look at what we're seeing there with the FT-100 at the highs of the morning right now, up two-thirds of a percent across the board. In Asia overnight, gains across the board there as well. Best performer was Korea as well as Hong Kong, up three-quarters of one percent.Shake up at the White House, Anthony Scaramucci is now out as Communications Director after 11 days on the job.

This after another shake-up in the administration. Adam Shapiro is live this morning at the White House with the very latest. Adam, good morning to you.ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: And good morning to you, Maria. This is the 65th anniversary of the Small Business Administration. And that's part of what the invitation to the 100 small business owners is about, celebrating the SBA, but also to talk about the Trump administration and the Republican agenda on tax reform because small business, the engine of growth in this economy and how tax reform can help these individuals promote their businesses and help subsequently grow the U.S. economy.Now, this comes after yesterday's big news here at the White House, to which the President, by the way, tweeted, did you see this? He said, "A great day at the White House!" And things are very orderly when you think of the new chain of command and everyone now reporting to new Chief of Staff John Kelly. So, this is one of the issues that is being put in place here at the White House, but the Vice President, who is traveling abroad, talked about how this will all help push the agenda forward, here is what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I know there's a lot of focus on what's happening inside the West Wing. The President keeps all of his focus on advancing Americas interests in the world and creating more prosperous country for our people. We've been making great progress, and personnel decisions in the White House, I'll always support whatever decisions that the President makes, and both of us know that General Kelly is going to do an outstanding job.(END VIDEO CLIP)SHAPIRO: So, Maria, this meeting with the small business owners later this afternoon in the east room of the White House, we're going to be there, and of course, this is about promoting business, and small business, especially, the engine of this economy. Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll be watching that. Adam, thank you. Adam Shapiro at the White House. Joining me right now is former White House Chief of Staff under President Clinton and the Chairman of McLarty Associates, Mack McLarty is with us. Mack, good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.MACK MCLARTY, CHAIRMAN, MCLARTY ASSOCIATES: Maria, always good to be with you.BARTIROMO: First, your reaction to this over the last week what has taken place.MCLARTY: I think positive. I think President Trump stepped forward as empowered Chief of Staff. I think now, the real issue, you got to get a government in place, that's number one. Number two, you've got to support the President stepping on world stage in a purposeful and confident manner. And number three, Maria, picking up on your earlier comments, you've got to get your legislative agenda in place and get your foundational pillars moving forward, I think that's what the President is trying to do.I think Chief Kelly is an excellent choice, he's a person that obviously dedicated this country, he served it with distinction and valor. I think the fact he has been in the White House, Maria, as Head of Homeland Security is a real plus. That will give him a familiarity in a way to get started quickly. And I think the President has empowered him to manage and organize the White House, but the key is not just process, but to focus on results. That was key in the Clinton administration, and that really makes a difference if you can get results and people feel you're trying to work hard to improve their lives.BARTIROMO: But can he get results, though, Mack? I mean, that's what we're waiting for. We know that health care with all of the back-and- forth, ultimately failed. Now, they're talking about still trying to get a bill through the Senate, to repeal and replace. And, of course, there's tax reform, putting on a good face as far as tax reform all of August, they're going to be out talking about it but will they be able to come to common ground and get legislation produced. We know the Democrats don't want it. They want to obstruct as much as they can. We know there's divisions within the Republican Party. All that you're saying is right, but can he do it?MCLARTY: Well, Maria, I think you put your finger on number of important points there. You're correct, we were very fortunate in getting our foundational piece economic plan passed, health care was a big step back for this President, this administration. And particularly with the Republicans controlling both Houses and having talked about repealing and replacing Obamacare for seven years, the answer is it's doable. I think it's much better if it can be done on a bipartisan basis. You and I probably have or do have slightly different views in terms of how that might be achieved. I think, you know, a compromise is compromise. You've got to meet in the middle. Let's see with this new Chief of Staff, President Trump looking at his tax reform agenda, whether they can find that common ground.BARTIROMO: Now, what about the noise of, you know, Anthony Scaramucci, the Communications Director, was in, now he's out. I mean, obviously, last week, there was chaos. Has this become a distraction as well? Self- inflicted.MCLARTY: It has. We tried to keep the drama to a minimum. It's not easy in a White House, there's always going to be some backdrop of that, but you've got to keep focused on the agenda that you're trying to move forward for the country, you've got to basically pivot, Maria, from the campaign to governing. That's the key in the first year of any administration. Every administration has some lessons learned and some start-up issues. I mean, John Kennedy had the bay of pigs which was obviously a major -- a major concern and setback in the first six months of his administration, but he moved forward with his agenda. So I think, again, let's -- the soap opera is good for some things but it's not good for the American people in terms of governing. This administration, this President needs to look outward in terms of getting results for the American people.BARTIROMO: Yes, because there's not a lot of help inward. I mean, Fox News has confirmed now that Attorney General Jeff Sessions will hold a press conference on Friday on intelligence leaks. Now, the President has previously called on the A.G. to be tougher on the issue. What action do you expect Attorney General Sessions to take in terms of these leaks? What should he be doing?MCLARTY: Maria, we've discussed this before. It's a very serious issue, and I am glad to see the Attorney General addressing this in a serious way. I think a thorough review of any of these leaks needs to be conducted in the right way, a review that has credibility that isn't viewed as political. So, let's see what he has to say, but I think he -- I think he's taking the right steps, identifying the issue and addressing it.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you, Mack, because then there is -- then there is the Democrats and what they're facing, I mean, they're going to need more than just obstruction, right, to get votes?MCLARTY: I agree. I agree.BARTIROMO: They're going to -- they're going to need more than just stopping President Trump from getting his agenda through, they've tried to come out with a message a week and a half ago, a better plan, that really didn't resonate. But what do they need to do to get the American people to think, OK, well, maybe they're the party to govern and to try to get them voted in next year. Because there's not a bench and there's no real plan there.MCLARTY: Well, governing is about good ideas, and good ideas can come from Democrats, Republicans, or independents, they certainly can come from the private sector, and from other sources, whether it'd be academia or more broadly. So, I think it's really a matter of putting the best ideas forward, explaining those, advancing them, but I think you make the right point, the democrats need to stand their ground on principle when they think they sharply or strongly, sincerely disagree with President Trump, but they're going to have to have their agenda.And that agenda, I think, needs to be focused on the prosperity and the security of the American people. They need to come forward with their economic plan, as frankly, President Clinton did in the 1990s, and they need to come forward with how they would see moving -- addressing the serious issues in North Korea, for example. I think both Secretary Gates and Secretary Perry have put forth some very duple ideas. That's the kind of things that the Democrats need to embrace and put forward.BARTIROMO: You wondered what happened with this I.T. story of Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and now, the fact that this I.T. guy that she was using was with her for so many years. She refused to fire him, and then he was arrested trying to flee the country, trying to go back to Pakistan, him and his brothers and their wives made $4 million from this government. How does that happen, Mack, that he becomes the highest paid I.T. guy there. And now, there's all these questions about maybe it's a lot worse than bank fraud. What do you know about it?MCLARTY: I don't know much about it. So, I'm really truly reluctant to comment on something that I really don't have the facts. Maria, look, you're going to have these kinds of controversies, allegations, and potential deep concerns in politics and business. And they need to be, frankly, identified, rooted out, addressed and reviewed in a proper evenhanded but very proactive manner. That's what needs to take place on any matter like this, whether it'd be Republican or Democrat.But the real issue, Maria, we need to focus on the major issues of the day, both internationally and domestically. That's where this White House and this President needs to be focused in and not get distracted on partisan politics in my opinion.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a great point. We'll see if General John Kelly helps him do that. Mack, good to see you, sir. Thanks so much.MCLARTY: Maria, always good to be with you.BARTIROMO: Mack McLarty joining us there. Coming up, the Dow closing in another major milestone, flirting with Dow 22,000 this morning. We're talking about a market that's up almost 20 percent now from election day. Stuart Varney will weigh in on the economic optimism, next. And then, hackers take the Iron Throne, HBO falls victim to a cyberattack with several shows reportedly leaking online along this -- with the spoilers to "Game of Thrones". How the company is handling that hack, next. Stay with us.JESSICA VILCHIS, TENNIS CHANNEL HOST: Welcome back to another Tennis Channel Court Report. A special presentation for Fox Business, I'm Jessica Vilchis. The 2017 edition of the City Open kicked off Monday with stars from the ATP World Tour and the WTA in action. American Lauren Davis reached the championship match a year ago but the 23-year-old is packing her bags after going out to Aryna Sabalenka. After dropping a tight opening set, 7-5, Davis just couldn't get back into the match. As the Belarusian closed out the straight sets win, 6-3.Tommy Paul also flew the red, white, and blue, as he moved onto the second round. The former French Open Junior champ fought back from a set down and was up 3-love in a decider before (INAUDIBLE) retired for injury. And Tennis Channel's extensive live coverage continues Tuesday at 1:30 p.m. Eastern.BARTIROMO: Welcome -- 45 minutes away from the opening bell. Welcome back. She tried to say the markets are in record territory. We are expecting a big opening this morning, 100 points higher, perhaps Dow 22,000. A couple of names on move this morning, Time Warner is one to watch. The company's HBO unit is the latest victim of a cyberattack. Hackers released episodes of several of the network's shows, including "Game of Thrones", and "Ballers". They also reportedly leaked spoilers about the upcoming "Game of Thrones" episodes. Time Warner shares up better than 30 percent over the last year. We're also watching Groupon. The company has teamed up with Grubhub on a food delivery partnership. As part of that agreement, Groupon customers will be able to order food from Grubhub while using Groupon deals. Groupon shares are up 3-3/4 percent right now.We are on Dow watch, Dow 22,000 watch, to be specific. Amid up the earnings reports, ahead of Apple's quarterly reports, the market is on fire, once again, after the 30th record-high reached yesterday. Joining me now, host of "VARNEY & COMPANY", Stuart Varney who has been really navigating this market and predicting where it's been going very well. Stu, good morning to you.STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: I thought you're going to call it, the Varney Rally. No, it is not the Varney Rally.(LAUGHTER)VARNEY: I'd be proud to accept that name but it's not going to happen. Look, Maria, I see a mood of optimism on the economy gradually emerging. We got a timeline for tax cuts, details coming in September, the House votes October, the Senate votes November. I know that's a very optimistic and, you know, it sounds good. But it's there, it's a timeline, that's something to grasp at, if you like. We've got record profits on Wall Street, we've got a big jobs' report coming up on Friday. I think that's going to surprise to the upside. And here we are, 22,000 on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. If you want to follow the news, forget the swamp for a second. I don't care about Scaramucci. I care about 22,000 on the Dow, and a rosy outlook for the United States' economy because that's what it's all about.BARTIROMO: Yes, but I mean, you know what's interesting, Stuart, I mean, I know there's a lot of optimism about what can get done, in terms of what tax reform will do to the economy and profits, but it's really been about profits driving this rally, right? I mean, look at revenue expected to be up 12 percent in second-quarter -- revenue.VARNEY: That's the -- I think that was the second leg of the rally. Right after Election Day, we went straight up, that was the original Trump rally. In the early part of this year, we plateaued, and then just recently, we've taken off again. And I agree, Maria, that's on the back of these record profits. That's where we're going.BARTIROMO: Yes. Absolutely.VARNEY: Look at that -- look at that Futures, up triple digits right from the get-go. That will put us right at 22,000. What would it be, 30, 42 minutes from now.BARTIROMO: So, what do you think? You think -- you think we're going to open at 22,000 then, Stu?VARNEY: Or real close to it, yes, very, very close.BARTIROMO: All right.VARNEY: Well, the close yesterday was 21,891. If Futures show a gain of 100 points, you'll be right at 22,000, 9:30 Eastern.BARTIROMO: Better join Stuart and see where this market goes at the open. Stu, we'll see you in about 10 minutes.VARNEY: Sure.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. "VARNEY & COMPANY" begins top of the hour, right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Join Stuart as he navigates this opening of trading in less than 45 minutes. Coming up next, running your DNA through the grapevine. How a new start-up is pairing customers to the perfect wine by using their genetic code. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The President is tweeting this morning. He just tweeted out this. We want to show you what the President is saying. "Stock market could hit an all-time high, again. 22,000 today. The Dow was at 18,000 only six months ago on Election Day. Mainstream media seldom mentions!" We've been mentioning it all day. This market is on fire and we continue to see money moving to stocks. 22,000, Dagen.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Mr. President, we talk about it all day long, every day about the market and how great the economy is, and confidence is up and all of the reasons for the run in the market.BARTIROMO: But that doesn't mean you can't get -- that you're off the hook on tax reform.MCDOWELL: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Yes, because we need to see tax reform in order to see the economic story continue strongly. How about this, searching for the perfect glass of vino, one start-up claims to select wines that you love based on your DNA. And they say that they'll deliver it straight to your door. Joining us right now are the cofounders of Vinome, Sara Riordan, Ron Andrews, and Shannon Kieran. Good to see, all, thank you so much for joining us.RON ANDREWS, CO-FOUNDER, VINOME: Yes, thanks for having us.SARA RIORDAN, CO-FOUNDER, VINOME: Hi, Maria.BARTIROMO: They have the kit in front of us right here. Tell us how the vinome's wine pairings work and about this kit that we are just opening this morning to see more about vinome's wine pairings and DNA.SHANNON KIERAN, CO-FOUNDER, VINOME: Yes. So, people can go online to have that kit delivered right to their door, that's a DNA collection kit that works by just taking a quick swab of your cheek. Consumers also answer our quick quiz online and tell us a little bit about their taste preferences and combined together in about four weeks from sending back their kits, they receive their results online.BARTIROMO: Well, why would -- how does that -- I mean, I'm only going to like wines that -- I like wines that are tied to my DNA better than other wines? I mean, why do I care if it's connected to my DNA?ANDREWS: Really, what we do is we take your DNA, we combine it to lifestyle choices and preferences. I mean, we come from the clinical side and there, we use DNA and combined it biology and disease to solve a dilemma, and here, we took the same approach. We take your DNA, we take the biology that DNA around taste preferences, we combine that and we're able to put you into a flavor profile.And then based on your flavor profile, we could find wines using our concierges team from small boutique wineries up and down the coast that you're never going to find in your grocery store back there in New York because these small wineries can't get through distributor network to get their wine to you, but they can go direct to consumer, and the direct consumer market is growing rapidly, we think it's going to be over $2 billion by 2020. And so, we're very excited to be breaking down -- breaking down some of the barriers for access for these small boutique family wineries.BARTIROMO: Yes. That's right. Straight to consumers, Mitch.MITCH ROSCHELLE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: So, I have a question. This is, you know, not something to whine about, no pun intended, at top of the morning here, but I can't drink red wine because I get massive headaches, is that something that would show up in the preferences that I articulate online or do you figure that out from the DNA, maybe even cure my problem?RIORDAN: Yes. It's not something we're -- we're not testing sensitivities to very -- to red wine at this point, we really are narrowing down on flavor profiles, so we test for genetic factors that are involved in taste and smell and that combined with the taste quiz results that people provide us, both of the lifestyle and the DNA, goes into our algorithm to provide people their taste preference profile.BARTIROMO: Well, what safety protocols are you taking to ensure that DNA data won't be breached?ANDREWS: Great question. Yes.KIERAN: That was a great question. So, we, you know, having come from the clinical space are very sensitive to people's privacy and privacy around their information and of course, DNA data. And so, we use state of the industries security around data encryption and even taking small steps like using barcodes on the saliva collection to rather than writing someone's name and date of birth.BARTIROMO: Interesting stuff.KATHRYN ROONEY VERA, HEAD OF RESEARCH, BALTIC CAPITAL MARKET: It sounds very interesting like a good addition to 23andMe which does a similar things. Do you acquisition aspirations?ANDREWS: Well, we obviously want to get started. We're launching today, we're very excited. We are one of the premium apps on the new helix DNA marketplace, which is launching as we speak. And so, we're very excited about getting this -- as I'd like to say, getting the party started and --BARTIROMO: Yes, let's get this party started.ANDREWS: That's right. Yes.BARTIROMO: I love it. All right. Thank you so much. We'll be watching. Appreciate your time this morning.ANDREWS: Thank you very much.RIORDAN: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Sara Riordan, Ron Andrews, and Shannon Kieran, we'll see you soon. Coming up, final thoughts from this all-star panel. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Final thoughts from this All-star panel. Kathryn, over to you.VEGA: What I'm focused on is earnings, of course, and the fact that, I think, that tax reform does not happen or double-digit earnings do not happen unless we get tax reform in the near horizon. Another cloud I see on the horizon is the debt ceiling debate and how about (INAUDIBLE) the stock markets.BARTIROMO: Mitch Roschelle?ROSCHELLE: We'll hit -- we'll probably hit another all-time high today but we haven't solved everything. Let's get Congress back from vacation.BARTIROMO: Right. Good point.MCDOWELL: Although, President Reagan, President Trump, stocks go up, stocks go down. Something he said after the '87 crash.BARTIROMO: Looks like they're going up today. Stuart Varney, over to you in "VARNEY & COMPANY".Load-Date: August 1, 2017End of Document

Chengdu: the Most Suitable City for New Economy DevelopmentPR NewswireDecember 7, 2017 Thursday 12:08 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 887 wordsDateline: CHENGDU, China, Dec. 7, 2017 BodyAmid a concrete jungle of steel and glass office towers, hotels, and apartment buildings, people relax under the myriad spots of shade. Many park their public bicycles neatly in a row. They're starting a day of work at the Chengdu Tianfu Software Park, a joint venture established by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) -- an American semiconductor company -- and its Chinese partner. It is located in the eponymous Chengdu, the frenetic capital of China's southwestern Sichuan province.Today, the Chengdu branch of AMD is currently busy at work developing a brand new type of chip. And according to experts, this kind of domestically produced chip will eventually replace counterparts from foreign manufacturers. It will enable Chinese super computers to operate with even more functions than previously imagined, introducing higher compatibility with more software and platforms.Chengdu Tianfu Software Park is the fastest-growing professional software industry park in China today. It opened its doors in 2005 and has since attracted nearly 250 tenants that include major corporations, of which foreign-funded enterprises account for 40 per cent of the total. Companies that are now operating there include IBM, SAP, NEC, GE, NCSI, Huawei, Alibaba, Maersk, Siemens, Ericsson, Tencent, WIPRO, and DHL.Chengdu is an advantageous location for these companies because it has for a long time been a hub for science and technology innovation. International med-tech giant Medtronic and automotive behemoth Volvo are also jumping on the bandwagon.In October this year, Medtronic announced the decision to construct its Centers for Therapeutic Innovation in Chengdu -- which is the company's third major project there. Medtronic has built more centers in Chengdu than anywhere else in China. Swedish car-maker Volvo plans to set up a factory in Chengdu to manufacture Polestar, its new generation of electric vehicles.Science and technology are changing the fabric of Chengdu -- the city is increasingly becoming a more central part of the Chinese economy. Chengdu's development follows the phenomenon of the so-called new economy, when economic transformation is driven by hi-tech industries under the backdrop of globalization.Fresh data from the government show that Chengdu is home to 24,369 science and technology enterprises, 965 research and development facilities of all kinds, and 31 potential unicorn companies. Last year, Chengdu's new economy industries were on track to grow by more than 10 per cent, while the value of hi-tech industries reached RMB 844.6 billion -- making it the city's pillar industry.Major leaders of Chengdu Municipal Party Committee believe that other than emphasizing growth through developing hi-tech industry and innovation, the new economy should also stress partnerships between the government, academia, and enterprises. The government especially wants collaborations between academia and enterprises in research and development, to thoroughly transform the advantage of human resources advantage into the advantage of human capital.Chengdu is home to 56 institutions of higher education, more than 30 national-level scientific research institutes, and 318 military industry companies and organizations. It has a rich reserve of human resource that includes nearly 5 million scientific and technological innovation talents.According to information from a relevant official at the Chengdu Science and Technology Bureau, Chengdu has already signed strategic cooperation agreements with 13 higher education institutions. The institutions are both within and outside Sichuan province -- such as Peking University in Beijing and Sichuan University -- in order to foster entrepreneurship, incubate new projects, and reach new key research achievements.The government member said that capital investment from higher education institutions and private funding has reached more than RMB 875 million. The government member also said that the area for innovation and incubation spaces now exceeds 500,000 square meters, and over 1,000 scientific and technological achievements from higher education institutions have been either transferred or commercialized.Since reforms in household registration policies for talents rolled out in July, Chengdu has attracted more than 87,000 master's degree or otherwise secondary degree holders. It is estimated that about 15 per cent of those degrees are from Ivy League schools in the United States.According to the 2017 Returned Chinese Employment and Entrepreneurship Survey Report, Chengdu has climbed its way to the number three spot for the most preferred cities for employment and entrepreneurship among Chinese who study or work abroad and then return to the country. It comes just after Beijing and Shanghai.The Chinese government's active steps in attracting funding -- continual assembling distinguished talents, and putting innovation and entrepreneurship first -- along with relatively lower land and labor costs compared with cities like Beijing and Shanghai, are all crucial factors that may propel Chengdu forward as China's most ideal city for cultivating the new economy.View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chengdu-the-most-suitable-city-for-new-economy-development-300568212.htmlSOURCE Chengdu Science and Technology BureauCONTACT: Ms. Hou, +86-10-63074558Load-Date: December 8, 2017End of Document

AS IVANKA TRUMP TRAVELS TO ASIA, HUMAN RIGHTS, LABOR, UNION AND PUBLIC INTEREST GROUPS CALL ON FIRST DAUGHTER TO PLEDGE IMPROVEMENTS FOR WORKERS MAKING HER BRAND'S CLOTHES IN CHINAStates News ServiceNovember 1, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 846 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Public Citizen:As Ivanka Trump travels to Asia to speak about what she terms "women's empowerment" at the fourth annual World Assembly for Women in Tokyo this week, a coalition of labor, consumer, union and human rights organizations today criticized her hypocrisy in ignoring the plight of workers who make the clothing marketed under her name.More than 20 groups, led by Public Citizen, the International Labor Rights Forum and China Labor Watch, released a video highlighting the contrast between Ivanka Trump's words and the conditions in her brand's factories. The groups sent a letter (PDF) to Ivanka Trump demanding she raise labor standards for the mainly female workers who produce her Ivanka Trump product line.The letter and video are being circulated a day before Ivanka Trump is scheduled to speak in Japan at the women's empowerment symposium. Also this week, President Donald Trump is scheduled to leave on a Nov. 3-14 trip to countries including China, where the bulk of Ivanka Trump-branded handbags, shoes and clothes are manufactured.The video, shared widely via social media, juxtaposes words from Ivanka Trump's book, "Women Who Work," with reports of abysmal labor conditions at her company's overseas suppliers' facilities.This spring, investigators from China Labor Watch found grave abuses at two factories that make Ivanka Trump-branded shoes in China. The investigators were then detained for a month on criminal charges of using illegal surveillance equipment (e.g., mobile phones and cameras for recording images and footage to document illegal practices) before being released on bail pending trial.In addition, several media reports this year, including a comprehensive Washington Post investigation, have highlighted allegations of abusive treatment of the women who work at footwear and garment factories in China and Indonesia to make apparel and shoes bearing Ivanka Trump's brand. The workers have faced verbal and physical abuse as well as 15-hour work days and wage deductions."The Trump administration claims to have made buying American-made products and hiring American workers a core tenet," said Public Citizen President Robert Weissman. "It is the essence of hypocrisy that Ivanka Trump-branded clothes and footwear are produced in China and other overseas locations, often under abusive conditions. Most shameful is that labor rights investigators still face the threat of prosecution for investigating conditions for workers making Ivanka Trump-branded products. It's past time for Ivanka Trump to stand up for their freedom.""If Ivanka truly wants her legacy to include protecting working women, she needs to start with the women in her supply chain," said Judy Gearhart, executive director of the International Labor Rights Forum. "Enthusiastic statements about empowerment are not needed. Transparency, worker-driven monitoring and decent working conditions are essential.""After finding labor rights violations at factories in China earlier this year, China Labor Watch sent letters to Ms. Trump in hopes that she would help improve the working conditions at her brand's suppliers," said Li Qiang, founder and executive director of China Labor Watch. "It is her responsibility to ensure that assembly line workers producing for her brand are not abused, and to identify and compensate those whose rights are violated while producing for her brand. To date, we have not received any response from either Ms. Trump or her company."The groups' letter urges Ivanka Trump to:- Publicly demand that the Chinese government not pursue criminal prosecution of the three China Labor Watch investigators.- Work to ensure labor rights and fair treatment of the workers who make Ivanka Trump-branded products, irrespective of whether they are direct employees or employed by suppliers or in what country they work.- Allow independent workers' rights organizations to monitor working conditions and talk to workers about their labor rights inside her supplier factories.- Publicly disclose the names and addresses of factories making Ivanka Trump-branded products.- To the extent she intends to continue sourcing her products outside the United States, sign the 2018-2021 Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety.The full list of groups signing the letter is below:American Federation of TeachersChild Labor CoalitionChina Labor WatchCommunications Workers of AmericaCommunity Action for Justice in the Americas, Africa, AsiaFair World ProjectFarmworker Association of FloridaFood and Water WatchFood Chain Workers AllianceGlobal ExchangeInterfaith Worker JusticeInternational Corporate Accountability Roundtable (ICAR)International Labor Rights ForumJobs With JusticeKentucky State AFL-CIONational Consumers LeagueNetwork for Environmental and Economic Responsibility of United Church of ChristPublic CitizenRetail, Wholesale and Department Store UnionService Employees International UnionUltraVioletUnited Food and Commercial Workers International UnionWomen's Institute for Freedom of the PressLoad-Date: November 1, 2017End of Document

I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday August 2nd. Your top stories, 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.We are on DOW 22,000 Watch, once again, the DOW eyeing another record high this morning due to Apple. After the close last night, looks like we reached that magic number this morning.The stock is set to open at an all time high due to strong earnings. Results beat analyst expectations last night and the guidance come invest (INAUDIBLE) over delays of the new iPhone. Stock is six percent right now. Giddy-up, you check out the global market action this morning.European indices are lower, not taking the queue from the U.S. but the FTSE100, the CAC Krones, and the DAX Index down by just a fraction.And in Asia Overnight, markets mostly higher this morning. Take a look, the exception was in China, the Shanghai Composite down a quarter of a percent. But the Nikkei in Japan up one-half of one percent.Escalating tensions to report with North Korea, the United States will test an unarmed ballistic missile today just days after North Korea's latest launch. Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson calling on China once again to take action.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REX TILLERSON, SECRETARY OF STATE: We strongly don't blame the Chinese for the situation in North Korea. Only the North Koreans are to blame for this situation.But we do believe China has a special and unique relationship because of this significant economic activity to influence North Korean regime and ways that no one else can.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: We have the very latest developments coming up. Meanwhile Tesla giving investors a look under the hood, take a look, the company set to report after the closing bell tonight. What to expect, coming up. Stock is down this morning we're looking into the numbers down one and a quarter percent.Amazon is going on a hiring spree, it is expected to offer jobs to 50,000 people today at warehouses across the country. Getting set up for back to school and the holidays.When it comes to millennial debt, who has more, men or women?

Joining me to talk all about it, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell. Market Strategist Kevin Kelly. And Former Mitt Romney Policy Director, Hoover Institution Research Fellow, Lanhee Chan is with us this morning. Lanhee, good to see you.LANHEE CHAN, RESEARCH FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Thank you. Thank you for having me.BARTIROMO: Thanks for joining the conversation.CHAN: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: Good morning.KEVIN KELLY, CIO, RECON CAPITAL PARTNERS: Good morning.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning.KELLY: This is a very tough seat to be in after the Discovery CEO was here yesterday and it was a phenomenal scene the coverage you gave because everybody in the press was talking about how it's such a hard environment for these cable companies.And hearing hi, come out and talk about their vision for the future and the Olympics, it was a phenomenal interview, so that --BARTIROMO: Yes. He had a lot of things to say about things away from the big deal that he announced yesterday which, of course, makes him the king of cable, 20 percent of viewership in the U.S., Dagen.MCDOWELL: That is right. Again, it's businesses acting in their best interest and the best interest of their customers regardless of what's going on in Washington and I think that we -- that we all can potentially lose focus.Certainly the other cable networks do that but to just get down to the brass tax of running and operating a business and hiring. And that's why the economy is holding up as well as it is.BARTIROMO: Amazon jobs day today.MCDOWELL: That's right.BARTIROMO: Lot to talk about today. Fifty thousand jobs, we had a lot on deck. Stay with us.Coming up this morning, joining the conversation, Branch Messenger Founder and CEO, Atif Siddiqi is with us this morning. Plus, 32Advisor CEO and "FOX NEWS" Contributor, Robert Wolf will weigh in. The CEO of Three Square Market is here, Todd Westby. And "FOX NEWS" Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano. Plus, Sternlock (ph) CEO Collin Dunlap.A lot of emerging small business on deck as well after the big small business focus yesterday in Washington.But first, our top story right now and that is markets. Record territory once again, the DOW Industrial set to open at an all time high once again this morning and we know this because it is up about 45 points, just shy of 22,000. But last night Apple came out with much better than expected numbers.We came within 10 points of 22,000 yesterday but this is what's going to help us cross it today. Apple is up six percent right now. The company reported than expected earnings last night, the stock rallying on the news.And joining us right now to talk more about is Canaccord Genuity Chief Market Strategist, Senior Managing Director, Tony Dwyer. Tony, good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.TONY DWYER, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST & SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR, CANACCORD GENUITY: Great to see you Maria.BARTIROMO: Well you were pretty (INAUDIBLE) the last time you joined us and said put money into this market, now thanks for that you were right, we're about to hit all time highs once again.DWYER: This too shall pass Maria.BARTIROMO: Would you do it again? Are things are getting -- how do you see it?DWYER: I see a little bit of a correction. Kevin and I were having a great conversation about volatility and low volatility but it's funny because we're all looking for a fraction --MCDOWELL: Well share that, elves in the greenroom, we didn't hear it.DWYER: Well what's interesting is historically volatility is very low and people look at that like it's a cell signal but it's not.When it gets this low and stays this low for this long, it's actually a bi- signal, it last a lot longer. So when you look for a correction, you have to identify what really causes a major correction because that's the current fear.And what it is you have to have a recession to want to be a significant seller -- sustainable seller of equities. The only thing that creates that is a negative credit environment and we are so far from a negative credit environment at this point that all you're saying is the market can correct because it's too good.BARTIROMO: Yes.DWYER: Ultimately the fundamentals, the market going back to earnings, the market correlates with the direction of earnings full stop.BARTIROMO: Yes. They're talking about earnings being up 11 percent this quarter, Dagen.MCDOWELL: Right. Which is a major surprise with the uptime in terms of growth rate. The first time we've had two back-to-back quarters of double digit earnings growth in six years, 2011 since then.And just yesterday because I'm a nerd, I was paying attention to the inflation indicator, the personal consumption expenditures that came out with personal income and spending up 1.4 percent year-over-year.Incredibly low inflation which, again, gives the Federal Reserve at least a little bit of wiggle room and then the interest rates.DWYER: It creates the length -- Dagen, such a good point because it creates the length of the credit cycle. And ultimately, you have to invert the yield curve in for the viewers, that's when short-term interest rates are higher than long-term interest rates which shuts down lending.You have to have an inversion of the yield curve to go into recession. It's not anywhere near an inversion and here's an interesting step on earnings, it isn't flat though which has --KELLY: And market participates.DWYER: Correct. And that the best part, Kevin, going back to our volatility comment, when you go from where it is now to inversion, it's a bi-signal. You can have a correction.But if you look at the last two cycles from the point where you went from 100 basis points on a two-tenth spread to the inversion, the markets been up both times significantly from the inversion to the bull market peak, it's been up even more so --KELLY: I think one of the things we're missing in this narrative is that we have to go back to the Federal Reserve and because of their lower for longer policy, I mean this recent rally was kicked off by Janet Yellen saying rates aren't going to get anywhere near historical levels.And so that means earnings are worth more. So that's why you have Apple trading at 15 to 18 times earnings as opposed to 12 to 15 times earnings or multiple has expanded. And so you can't give credit to this administration for the market high, you actually have to give credit to our credits due and that's the Federal Reserve.Their low interest rate policy, you can see the dollar was down six percent in the beginning of the year, you can see that technology is leading the way, 47 percent of the revenues are overseas. The economy is getting better globally, not domestically.BARTIROMO: So let's talk about Apple for a second.DWYER: If you take GE out of it -- just for a quick second Maria. If you take GE out of it to drop in GE earnings this quarter, the number would actually be close to the 13 percent earnings, Dagen.BARTIROMO: Wow.MCDOWELL: Yes.DWYER: So you were right. Once the height is having that dramatic in effect --BARTIROMO: So GE is down, that one.DWYER: Yes, they're down 46 percent from a year ago.BARTIROMO: Apple have some good stuff to talk about, the technology giant beat expectations.Revenue $45.4 billions, earnings per share, $1.67, better than expected on both cons. During the company's earnings call, CEO Tim Cook dodged the question about whether Apple plans to build three big beautiful plants in the U.S. as Donald Trump has told us.The president recounted to "The Wall Street Journal" that last week. Cook said the company would have some things, we'll say about that later in the year. So we're waiting on that. But look, cash increased in the quarter, so they've got all that cash overseas.11.4 million iPads were shipped, iPhones, also 41 million iPhones, good quarter?DWYER: That was a great -- I mean it was a great quarter.BARTIROMO: Better than you thought?DWYER: It's a -- better than we thought. We raised our estimates at Cannacord today, Mike Walkley, the analyst, everybody's raised.BARTIROMO: Yes.DWYER: If you're worried about the economy, Apple is telling you the economy is okay.BARTIROMO: And you're saying it's only trading at 15 to 17 times earnings?DWYER: Yes. So --BARTIROMO: It's not bad.KELLY: So what's happening with Apple is that their core focus is on China. You saw Tim Cook capitulate to the Chinese government about encryption.And this says something because Tim Cook has said six quarters ago that he's focused on the Chinese consumer because there's going to be more Chinese consumers in the middle class and there is the population of United States.So they have to go over there and get their sales. They fallen in China, revenues were down 14 percent over there because China is focused on applications, WeChat, they're not focused on the hardware.So they need income and they need wealth to be created in China for people to spend a lot of money on these phone and they're not doing it. And so the problem is you look at these revenue numbers from Apple, this isn't their peak revenues.Actually, these revenues are lower than they've had in the past so everyone's focused on the upgrade cycle, they're going to need to deliver because their expectations for the fourth quarter high because they guided everybody there. So they need to deliver in the third and fourth quarter to justify this valuation.MCDOWELL: Credit -- but they delivered in what is typically their weakest quarter and revenue was up, had the best growth in revenue in seven quarters and they actually are selling more iPads and more Macs.And the iPad sales were -- let me point this out, Mac sales were up on the seven percent, 6.7 percent for the first time in 14 quarters, iPad shipments increased.BARTIROMO: So that was a surprise.MCDOWELL: Yes, it was a huge surprise. Shipments were up 15 percent because they're selling to schools and businesses.So I think that that shows that they're still -- we always focus so much on the iPhone. Shipments were there were up slightly, up 1.6 percent which is decent considering your movement to the quarter before the upgrade cycle, before they rollout the new iPhone.But the fact that they're finding areas where they can sell the iPad, because many people had written off the (INAUDIBLE)KELLY: Well real quick, the reason that's important is because they built this ecosystem. Everybody's focused on their services business.So if you have an iPhone, you're going to -- because you're built into that ecosystem, because you're built into the services, the Apple Music, the Apple TV, everything, you want it, then get an iPad, you want to get a Macbook as supposed to anything else because you're built into their system.BARTIROMO: Do we need to see legislation come out of Washington to see this market hold on to the gains? Dagen, you pointed out to a headline in "The Washington Post" earlier this morning that was somewhat troubling.MCDOWELL: So GOP, the headline is --BARTIROMO: I don't know if I believe it but let's see.MCDOWELL: GOP tax package may be delayed. So -- and Lanhee can speak to this.BARTIROMO: Says "The Washington Post."CHAN: I mean, are we surprised though? Right. But I mean are we surprised by this? What I wonder is how much of this that we're seeing in the market is driven by the assumption that stuff's going to happen?You talk about Apple, one of those company has got ton of money parked overseas, one of the biggest premises of corporate tax reform is let's figure out a way to bring that money back, right? Let's figure out --(CROSSTALK)DWYER: This is such an important question.CHAN: (INAUDIBLE) going to happen or not.DWYER: I love this question because it goes to something we were talking about earlier. The market is not up because of fiscal change expectation.It is -- every time I give a talk to a client or a group of people I ask them a question, would you like more regulation and would you like more taxes? And I've yet to see a hand go up. The animal spirits are not about the president right now. The animal spirits --MCDOWELL: Well to your point --DWYER: -- are about you're not going to have increased regulation, you're not going to have increased taxes. So you actually get tax cuts.MCDOWELL: Well it -- because the market was up solely because of what Washington might do, then the failure of the healthcare bill in the senate, the market would have sold off to it.BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE) instead we're talking about DOW 22,000.MCDOWELL: Right. Because "The Washington Post" --DWYER: Which is what the market correlates to.MCDOWELL: Wait, wait. This "Washington Post" story does go through and it's just -- it's very fact-based. It is what does the GOP have -- what are they facing even before September?They're talking about having to raise the debt ceiling, having to keep the government funded, having to get a budget pass in order for them to even do tax reform based to just along party lines. That's a lot of heavy lifting if you got Mark Short who's predicting that they will have tax reform in front of the senate and voted on by November. So I think that that's --BARTIROMO: Well it's China's year-end now, they may have backpedaled that November -- I'm talking leadership. So Kevin Brady's end-of-year he told me this week on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES," Paul Ryan last week said end-of- year.I think they're going to get it done simply because they know they have to get it done but I don't know, it could be tax cut (INAUDIBLE), right?KELLY: Bringing it back to the market though, we need to focus that the net affected tax rate of S&P500 companies that we're all talking about is 25 percent or lower.Let's look at Apple's tax rate, what are they paying, 12 percent corporate taxes? And then they're going to get a bonus by repatriating all their taxes back here at 10, 12 percent. We need to fix taxes for small businesses and the American consumer and not the S&P500.DWYER: Well let me qualify --BARTIROMO: Yes, real quick because I want to take (INAUDIBLE)DWYER: -- if you -- if Thomson Reuters did this study for me and they found that if you cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent, retroactive this year it increases S&P operating earnings estimates by 9.7 percent, next year it would be 9.4 percent. That is not my numbers.BARTIROMO: Ten seconds, jobs number, good number this Friday?DWYER: We expect a good number this Friday.BARTIROMO: We'll leave it there. Tony Dwyer, good to see you sir. Thank you so much.DWYER: Thank you Maria.BARTIROMO: We'll talk more about the jobs number coming up. And a reminder, Friday, 8:00a.m. Eastern, we're taking on jobs in America. We are identifying where are the opportunities right now. "MORNINGS WITH MARIA" be here, we'll be right back, stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Two deputies are recovering this morning after being shot in California. Cheryl Casone with the story, Cheryl, good morning.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Well good morning Maria. They were shot after responding to reports of a dispute on a marijuana farm.A suspect fled to a home nearby and the two deputies had been searching the home when the gunman opened fire. SWAT teams called in and fired teargas into the house before they entered and then after they entered they found the gunman dead.Authorities now trying to determine whether the suspect was shot or he killed himself. Both deputies expected to recover after undergoing surgery.Meanwhile, the United States expected to conduct a missile test today. Now this launch follows last week's record setting intercontinental ballistic missile test by North Korea. Now the US Air Force says today's test is just routine. The missile set to fly more than 4,000 miles to a test range out in the Pacific.Now Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says the U.S. is willing to talk with North Korea, listen to what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TILLERSON: We're trying to convey to the North Koreans, we are not your enemy, we're not your threat. But you are presenting an unacceptable threat to us and we have to respond.And we hope that at some point they will begin to understand that and that we would like to sit and have a dialogue with them about the future that will give them the security they seek.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Well a willingness to talk if North Korea agrees not to pursue nuclear weapons. That was also something that the Obama Administration had enacted those policy but, again, those talks were never executed between our two countries, so we'll see as that story develops today.And then finally, music streaming service Spotify is reportedly prepping to go public. Now the company had 20 million paid subscribers in less than a year bringing in a total of 60 million. If you compare that to Apple Music's 27 million subscribers, there you go.Spotify is planning to be a direct listing and go public without doing an IPO. The streaming service is expected the list before the end of this year, that's according to a report this morning Maria in "The Wall Street Journal" but Spotify could be a good one, we'll see.BARTIROMO: Yes, we will see. I mean that's really good numbers there of streaming, thank you Cheryl. What do you think about that, Spotify goes public, Kevin Kelly?KELLY: Yes. This has been telegraphed before they actually did -- they actually had some debt come through leading people to talk about this.And everything about doing a direct offering where they actually don't do an IPO process, they were going to directly list their shares on the Nasdaq which led the New York Stock Exchange to change the rules to do a direct listing.So this is pretty interesting, a lot of people want to get involved in this because they've dominated so well and they've actually swatted away stiff competition like Apple, right? They are actually --BARTIROMO: Spotify that much better than Pandora?KELLY: It's a different type of system. Pandora has had a lot of issues, you just saw them strike a recent deal with SiriusXM, so they're more radio as opposed of curated playlist, so yes.BARTIROMO: I see.KELLY: So it's a different business model in a sense but it's pretty fascinating to see what's happening in the music space because of the royalty payment. Amazon is now giving away music for free with their prime membership.BARTIROMO: I saw that, yes.KELLY: Yes. So it's a battleground.BARTIROMO: Sure is. All right. We'll take a break. When we come back, preparing your financial future. The surprising study on how much debt millennials have right now. We're looking at men versus women there as well.Then a breakfast treat with a twist, Reese's unveiling their limited edition peanut butter donut, where you can buy it, straight ahead.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. New numbers this morning on debt among millennials, who is piling it on more, men or women? Tracee Carrasco with the details now. And you got a first look on the survey, Tracee.TRACEE CARRASCO, FBN CORRESPONDENT: We did, yes. LendingTree recently surveyed more than a thousand millennial men and women on debt and credit and found that millennial women had much higher student debt, credit card debt, and just debt in general.With an average of more than $68,000 compared to $53,000 of debt for millennial men. But on the flipside, women carried higher credit scores than men suggesting maybe they're more responsible in paying down that debt.The survey also found the gender wage gap is significant, 57 percent of millennial men have an annual income of $50,000 or higher compared to 42 percent of women. Interesting survey there.BARTIROMO: So what are they doing in terms of piling up all this debt? Is this largely from school?CARRASCO: I think it is, student loans for both the men and the women.KELLY: Yes. Well we're seeing that actually play out that more women are actually enrolling and going to four-year schools and getting their college education. I mean I think it's somewhere around like 52 to 48 percent.CARRASCO: You know --BARTIROMO: And definitely going to higher education (INAUDIBLE) much more in terms of getting medical degrees and law degrees.MCDOWELL: No, I was going to make a joke about women being educated but I'm just going to --BARTIROMO: Stifle.MCDOWELL: I'm going to --BARTIROMO: Self edit?MCDOWELL: I'm self editing, that's what I'm doing.CHAN: Well it's interesting though because I think in the millennial generation, there is actually a greater or better understanding of just how badly they're going to get hosed down the road when it comes to things like retirement savings in the Social Security program.It's so interesting that the students that I teach all the time, none of them think they're going to get Social Security, none of them do.BARTIROMO: They don't have that expectation.CHAN: And maybe that drives them there --BARTIROMO: That's good.CHAN: Well I think it's good because it drives their desire then to save more now to use Private Vehicle 41Ks, various sort of private sector of savings vehicles to save up that money because otherwise, they maybe hosed down the road.MCDOWELL: Here's a problem though with the entitlement culture that has developed that is growing in this country is that when people start working though, student say that that they might say, "I don't think that any of these entitlement programs will be there for me when I retire."But when you start working and you start paying in, it develops that attitude of like, "That's my money. Where's my money I paid in?"CHAN: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: And it is. But it is.KELLY: No. But it doesn't say Social Security, right? It says FICCA and they're just like, "What is this? Who am I paying?"BARTIROMO: "Who is FICCA and why am I paying?"KELLY: And the sad point is we need to educate students that their wage -- their salary isn't actually their salary, that their employers actually paying taxes on top of that, right?So there is -- that goes back to the complicated tax code that they don't know they're actually paying those taxes as well, they'd be getting a higher salary if their employer didn't have to pay it.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a good point actually. Bullet points.MCDOWELL: Where's my money?BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly.MCDOWELL: My parents are like that. We talk about this all the time about Medicare. They were like, "We paid in." I'm like, "But you were taking out more money than you ever paid in. You're getting these very rich health benefits that I'm paying for mom and pop." Like, it's our payroll taxes that are helping fund the people who are collecting Medicare today.KELLY: The government knows what to do bet -- how to spend our money better than we do (INAUDIBLE) yes, the trust fund somewhat, right? All these (INAUDIBLE)CARRASCO: Even more, right?BARTIROMO: Let's see what changed over -- when they start working. As Dagen said, they've seen that they're actually paying in.CHAN: I bet.BARTIROMO: Really important point.KELLY: The good news is rich people want to pay more taxes, that's the latest movement.MCDOWELL: Trump said that. Trump said that.KELLY: Yes. All the top one percent.CHAN: Yes, totally.MCDOWELL: Trump said that in "The Wall Street Journal," that "My friends tell me they wouldn't mind paying higher taxes" because your friends are liberal.BARTIROMO: Yes, there you go.MCDOWELL: Your rich liberal New York friends Donald Trump.BARTIROMO: He must know that.MCDOWELL: Yes, he must.BARTIROMO: Coming up, the healthcare battle. How senators are responding to major premium hikes from ObamaCare provider, top story in "The Journal" today, that's next.Then keeping America safe, details on the immigration and customs enforcement operation, 650 illegal immigrants were arrested. We've got the story, next.BARTIROMO: Good Wednesday morning, everybody, welcome back. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, August 2nd. Your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast. Dow 22,000 is in reach. The reason Apple last night, stock rallies this morning.It is set to open at all-time high today following a strong earnings report last night that should take this market above 22,000. The technology titan's fiscal third-quarter earnings topped expectations. The company sold more iPhones than expected and they sold iPads more than expected as well. We're going to tell you why. Global markets this morning, all rallying once again.Take a look at the U.S. markets are rallying rather. A part maybe the European markets are under pressure. Take a look at the FT-100 down a fraction as is the CAC Quarante and the DAX Index. This is all off of the lows in the morning, however. In Asia overnight, markets were mostly higher after the big rally yesterday on Wall Street. The exception was China, the Shanghai Composite down a quarter of a percent.The White House is setting its sights on protecting our borders this morning. President Trump set to announce major legal immigration reform later this afternoon. The details on the plan, coming up. The move comes as the health care battle rages on Capitol Hill.

We'll tell you about it. Plus, two of your favorite sweets meeting up. We have a look at Krispy Kreme's new Reese's peanut butter doughnut this morning.But first, our top story right now, finding a prescription to rising health care cost. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, major Obamacare providers are now raising premiums on exchanges by 30 percent or more in Idaho, Iowa, South Carolina, West Virginia, Wyoming, while several other states are looking at increases of 20 percent or more. This is the top story in the Journal this morning. The big issue for insurers is the turmoil in Congress over health care. Senators are still grappling with the -- what the best move is, on repealing and replacing Obamacare.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)THUNE: Health care is not dead, no. The issue is -- the issue is going to -- it's not going away. I mean, this is an issue that's going to be with us and we have to fix it. And now -- right now -- right now, it's a different strategy. We came up with, I think, three different proposals to vote on last week, none of which got 50. So, we have to figure out how to get to the magic number. And when we do, we'll get back on it. But, we know that it's an issue that we need to respond to try and spare the American people from a program that's failing.(END OF VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And joining us this morning is Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, General Partner, Tom Scully. Good to see you, thank you so much for joining us, Tom.THOMAS SCULLY, GENERAL PARTNER OF WELSH, CARSON, ANDERSON & STOWE: Good morning.BARTIROMO: So, you are a former Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the former Associate Director of the OMB under President George H.W. Bush. I want to get that straight, so the people understand the context. What do you think is the next step in terms of this health care battle?SCULLY: I know, it just can't go away. I mean, it's incredibly complicated but, I think, the thing that people miss most in this debate is the big issue is Medicaid. I mean, Medicaid is an enormous program that's growing shockingly fast. The exchanges are a huge problem, the front of the paper says this morning. But the real goal here was to try to rein in Medicaid and get Medicaid under control. And I think, whatever happened in the Senate that seems to have dropped off the radar. So --BARTIROMO: Well, that's the big issue. I mean, the Republicans in the House try to slow down the growth of Medicaid. We know that this is the fastest growing entitlement program. Every morning, we're having this discussion that these programs are going bankrupt and sold and so we do need to slow down the growth, but, I guess, when you give somebody something, you don't want to take it back and the Senators right now are having trouble doing it.SCULLY: Well, look, Medicaid, once you start giving benefits, it's tough.BARTIROMO: Yes.SCULLY: Medicaid this year, 98 million people in the program.BARTIROMO: Ninety-eight million.SCULLY: Ninety-eight million, on any one day, it's 77 million. But during the course, they are 98 million people. When I first got (INAUDIBLE) at 1989, which means I'm a fossil, you know, I think we had 26 million people in the program.BARTIROMO: Wow.SCULLY: Since President Obama came in, we've gone from about 45 million people in the program to 77 million.BARTIROMO: So Obama really opened up the program to include people that weren't necessarily under the umbrella of poor, blind, pregnant?SCULLY: This is a complicated issue. What President Obama fundamentally do was he expanded Medicaid to 138 percent of poverty and it gave the state the option to do that with essentially 100 percent federal money. We could argue it's a good idea or bad idea but there's many other problems in the Medicaid problem. Most states don't kick any money. The funding stream is broken.I'll just give you one example, under the board of Dartmouth Med School, New Hampshire hasn't put a penny on its Medicaid program, many of the states don't. So Medicaid is a $600 billion a year program, growing unbelievably fast, and the financial rules are a mess. So if there's ever a federal program that need to be reformed was Medicaid, and that's kind of dropped off the radar with this whole debate.BARTIROMO: Was there ever an idea to get the states involved so that the states pay more into the Medicaid entitlement program?SCULLY: In some states. Again, these 56 states entitled to -- they all have a different deal, that's part of the problem, it's completely scrambled eggs over the last 40 years, I've sadly been involved to a lot of it. You know, the idea of going per capita cap, which does not do anything about taking away individual entitlement. It's exactly what Paul Ryan is trying to do. It's the right thing to do.It just basically says, look, we're going stop all the financial gains, those states that are -- if I were a state, I'd do the same thing. If federal government gave you those incentives, you're going to do it. But the match rates are a mess, the programs a mess, and the idea is to say, look, let's stop the musical chairs, everyone gets (INAUDIBLE) today per person and over the next 10 years. We're basically going to try to, you know, rationalize the program and that in itself saves money. President Clinton assured us. Tom (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: Yes.BARTIROMO: Do you think now, in the fall, when we start having hearings on both sides, maybe the Democrats come in and they come up with a solution? Where is this going, Tom?SCULLY: I think Republicans are going to have to get 50 votes. If I'd do it all over again, I would be a little bit about bipartisan from the beginning. I mean, my primary job in the administration 15 years ago was passing Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage. You know, we got Senator Kenny, we have 12 Democratic Senators that voted for it. You know, they started for better or worse, very partisan. The administration poked, you know, Schumer, and widened those guys in the eyes, in the beginning, I wouldn't have done that. But, you know, it's -- I think it's hard to see Democrats wanting to do anything bipartisan. If I were them, I'd let the Republicans sit here in (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: And that's what's happening.SCULLY: Yes. So they're going to have to get --BARTIROMO: And then the American people are left holding the bag.SCULLY: Well, I think, you know, the House Bill probably was further than the Senate could have gone. But, I think -- I think they have no choice but to keep coming back and keep coming back till they get 50 votes, or maybe I'm wrong about that, but they're going to keep trying because you can't do tax reform. The money is all in health care.Medicare, Medicaid, taxes, and defense are the moving pieces of the budget, period. That's where the money is. I mean, we all touch Medicare, let me touch on Social Security, nobody's touching defense, Medicaid, getting it under control is the effort to save a little money for tax reform. It's the right thing to do but, you know, it's not easy.BARTIROMO: Yes, really nice assessment of all that's going on there, Tom. Let's talk about the big businesses of micro hospitals, where you are obviously working. There are small 24/7 facilities that can fill the middle ground between an urgent care and a larger hospital. These micro hospitals often cater to smaller communities, offering inpatient options, surgical procedures. Micro hospitals are growing rapidly across the country, locations in more than a dozen states, including Texas, Colorado, and Arizona. One of your clients is a micro hospital operator, tell us about the benefits here.SCULLY: Yes, we own it. It's my private equity firm. So it's -- there are a bunch of different types of micro hospitals, there's good ones and bad ones in our view. I mean, ours are all joint ventures with nonprofit, actually won four profit chain. You know, essentially, if you're in, say, San Antonio, where we happen to operate, in South San Antonio there were basically no hospitals.So the big hospital chain backed us in San Antonio in south of town, you build a 100-bed hospital, 150-bed hospital and you build a 10-bed hospital with a great emergency system that feeds the mother ship. That's basically what we are trying to do, and around the country and our views. When there are gaps and care in the city, we have done a bunch in Colorado, a bunch in Texas.Essentially, they're satellite hospitals, micro hospitals. This is not a - - it's not a good idea if you're in a rural area or expanding suburban area. If you want to build a 150-bed hospital, 110-bed hospital, we've don't that. They're frequently too big. So we build and always a joint venture with the system. And say, look, we'll build you a hospital, the name I believe, will be Baptist or Baylor, or Sisters of Charity, whatever.BARTIROMO: I love it. I love it.SCULLY: And basically, a 10-bed hospital --BARTIROMO: You also got technology really enabling things, right? Because people can be doing things at home, talking to a doctor. I mean, there's also that part of health care. So, there's the innovation of technology advancement going on including micro hospitals within health care to try their own way to come up with controlling costs.SCULLY: Yes. I think it's happening a lot better because, you know, massive advances in managed care and the government. The more the government gets out of fixing prices and setting prices which they did Medicare and Medicaid, and gives the market a chance to work which is more managed care, more capitation, both in Medicare and Medicaid, you know, the market responds. You get more out-patient care, you get more efficient care, and that's happening.BARTIROMO: On the Medicaid story, do you think the best way is to just slow down the growth or would you do something even more severe?SCULLY: No, I'm not against what President Obama's trying to do, believe it or not, which is to cover for people is we should be doing. The issues is there are a lot of problems in Medicaid that you need to resolve. So, a slow headed growth, you know, do we need to go from 77 -- even the House bill, you have 77 million people in Medicaid. Ten years from now, you have 77 million people in Medicaid.In the Senate bill, you have that 83, 84, the original Senate bill. Under Obamacare, it goes to 97 million people. If you want to have those 20 million people more than Medicaid problem? You can debate that, but nobody is thinking about the cost of that. It's enormous and some of the southern states don't want to do that. So, would I slow it down, yes, I would.But fundamentally, you know, it's incredibly complex, but the financing mechanism of Medicaid is basically broken. The states have a huge incentive to add people, to not put their own money in. If I were the state, I'd do exactly what they're doing. Those are the incentives, but at some point, it's the second biggest program of the government, it's quickly going to be the biggest, $600 billion a year. New York's problem alone is 60 billion this year.BARTIROMO: Wow.SCULLY: You got to fix it. It is the single biggest broken thing in the government.BARTIROMO: Yes.SCULLY: And I think we should take care of poor people but you got some rationale about how you do it.BARTIROMO: Really important analysis that you made, Tom, great to have you on the program.SCULLY: Thanks.BARTIROMO: Come back soon, Tom Scully, joining us there. Coming up, reforming legal immigration, President Trump's plan to overhaul the system with help from two Senators this morning. Then Kanye West is lawyering up. The $10-million lawsuit he filed because of a tour that he canceled, straight ahead, back in a moment,BARTIROMO: Welcome back, we are in record territory watch, the Dow purchasing another major milestone this morning. We are on Dow 22,000 watch. Check out Futures indicating a higher opening for the broader averages. You've got to believe it hits 22,000 today, given what happened with Apple last night. Stock is on fire this morning after the company reported better than expected earnings and revenue.A couple of other names we're watcing is Groupon, the company is set to report its second-quarter earnings before the bell this morning. Analysts are expecting revenue of nearly $700 million at Groupon. The stock is down nearly 25 percent in the last year. We're watching shares of Fitbit, the wearables maker scheduled to report second-quarter earnings after the bell tonight. Analysts are expecting a loss there, $0.15 a share. Fitbit shares are down 60 percent -- better than 60 percent in the last year.Breaking news this morning. A NATO convoy attacked in Afghanistan. Cheryl Casone with the story -- Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes. We just got word on this one an hour ago, Maria. A suicide bomber has targeted a convoy of NATO troops near an airport in the southern Afghan province of Kandahar. A statement from the U.S. military says the attack did cause casualties. It's not immediately clear if U.S. troops were part of that convoy. The airport, though, in Kandahar is home to a major military base for international troops. Now, the Taliban has claimed responsibility for that attack. Well, President Trump set to announce a plan to overhaul legal immigration today with Republican Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue. The lawmakers have been working with the White House on the bill which would restrict and reform overall the immigration system. And they also proposed to cut legal immigration levels by about half by the year 2027.Meanwhile, 650 people have been arrested nationwide in raids by federal immigration agents. The four-day operation last week targeted families and unaccompanied children who had entered the country illegally.Well, remember eight months ago when rapper Kanye West canceled his Saint Pablo Concert Tour because of a mental breakdown? Well, it turns out, the insurance companies don't believe it was a breakdown. They don't want to pay out this $10-million claim. The singer has filed a lawsuit to collect the funds. Reports of the insurers are blaming his marijuana use for his problems. Now, West was hospitalized at the UCLA neuropsychiatric hospital back in November of 2016. He was forced to cancel his remaining 21-tour date. Insurance company is saying, not so fast.And Maria, I always say this, never underestimate the power of the doughnut. Krispy Kreme has now gone just out of this world with this newest creation. They're teaming up with Reeses to create the Reeses Peanut Butter doughnut. Yes, calories not -- we're not discussing. It's Reese's peanut butter cream filling inside, it's got chocolate icing, chocolate and peanut butter drizzle on the top of it, and it's got Reese's many peanut butter chips in and peanuts as well. I don't have one yet. I may never even have to put it in front of my face because it'll be over. It is a limited time situation, though, so if you can resist it, good luck.BARTIROMO: All right, good to know. It's only a limited doughnut there.CASONE: Yes, I've got to protect myself here.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I will try to get fat if I ate that.BARTIROMO: Of course.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I wish I didn't have a peanut allergy.BARTIROMO: It has got to be 2,000 calories or something net like that.MCDOWELL: But I can't eat one. That's the problem. Give me a dozen. I'll sit down and destroy them.KEVIN KELLY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Oh, I'm sure that (INAUDIBLE) a dozen.MCDOWELL: No, but it's the eating part.BARTIROMO: Oh, my god, how do you feel after a dozen doughnuts?MCDOWELL: I have eaten a dozen of the hot glaze in one sitting.BARTIROMO: No, you didn't.MCDOWELL: It was in -- when I was in high school, yes. I worked -- I fasted and then ate a dozen doughnuts.BARTIROMO: But the glazed are really good.KELLY: I wonder how many Kanye West would eat during his mental breakdown. That's the real question.BARTIROMO: Wow. Mental breakdown.KELLY: Yes, he's done very well for a (INAUDIBLE) and their corporate earnings are up. He's got their Yeezy Boost. People can't wait to line up for it. If you saw Adidas' earnings killing it, Under Armour was down yesterday (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: Adidas is killing it. You're right. And they've got their Stan Smiths which I love. And they are still going.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: We'll take a break. When we come back, want to swap a shift at work, there's an app for that. We'll talk with the CEO of Branch Messenger, about his company, next. Back in a moment. We're on record- setting watch for stock prices. Stay with usBARTIROMO: So, do you need an employee scheduling platform? There's an app for that. Branch Messenger is an employee self-service space that enables workers to swap shifts. It's catching the attention of retailer Target. The mobile app is now part of a pilot program in 130 Target stores. Joining us right now is the founder and CEO of Branch Messenger. He is Atif Siddiqi. Atif, good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.ATIF SIDDIQI, CEO & FOUNDER, BRANCH MESSENGER: And thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Congrats on this company that you founded. Tell us about it, what is the advantage to use Branch Messenger?SIDDIQI: Sure. Branch Messenger is an employee self-service platform for hourly shift workers to allow them to manage their work life in real-time. So, what that means for employees, they can swap, trade shifts, amend their schedule, track earnings, and communicate all on a private network. For large enterprises like Target, it allows them now to tap into this elastic workforce that can scale up and down across their locations and really communicate to those frontline workers at scale.BARTIROMO: And everybody knows sort of where everyone is because the employee can be dealing with that with another employee and it's right there on the system.SIDDIQI: That's correct. I mean, to give you an example how the system was managed before at Target before Branch, it was a series of paper on the back wall, you know, that they would take days, right, or if an -- you know, an employee calls in and a manager needs to get somebody in the store, they would make a series of 30 to 40 phone calls a day. So now, that process is done in minutes on Branch.KELLY: Paper archaic, do you believe it? So, is this one of the things where you volt into their current H.R. systems and then you help automate these systems for them, and then, how do you generate revenue for your company?SIDDIQI: That's correct. So, we integrate with their existing system, so typically a workforce management system. So, there really is no switching cost for the enterprise. It really allows them to maximize the value of these investments they've already made. And the way we charge revenue and make money is we sell these premium features like the integrations, the back-end systems, as well as administrative controls, such as managing over time or some controls, say, on off-the-clock usage. We can certain (INAUDIBLE) certain aspects of the application, as well as provide some data and analytics around shift-worker performance and attendance and tracking.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, if you've got people that are at different wage levels then as an employer, you can control -- in other words, I only want certain people to be able to swap with one another, so I don't incur extra expenses or -- and go way over budget for example?SIDDIQI: That's exactly right. You know, you can kind of segment out what workers you need, and managers have full control on the app, right? So, they can now approve, reject any changes, and they're also getting these alerts ahead of time so they'd be more proactive of these changes.MCDOWELL: When you go into introduce the messenger service at companies, do you have organizations that basically install it system-wide or is it really kind of piece me -- we were looking at some of the statistics on, say, Dominoes, for example. Ultimately, that would be your goal, but how are you seeing companies roll this out?SIDDIQI: Yes. So, what's interesting to note is that we have a free application, that's available for employees and managers, so they can download it on the app store right now and they can get started with it. And then, for enterprises, once they, you know, they have a large amount of their employees on the platform, they opt in for some of these premiums features and provide it to their employees. And it's all opted in for the employees. Now, if they don't have a smartphone, for example, they can still access it from the Web. And we also install an on-site tablet, you know, at their physical location so they still have full access to the platform.BARTIROMO: Are staffing creating some problems, though, because managers are not approving the changes? That's what the critics are saying. What do you say to those -- I mean, I think this is probably what you were referring to as well, Lanhee, that managers are not approving this, and so, it is causing higher expenses?SIDDIQI: So, really, you know, all the alerts -- I think one of the advantages and the things that we have seen working with enterprises, building those controls in place, so managers do get alerts on branch for - - if it's going to put an employee into overtime, right? And so, they also can approve and reject any of those changes all from the mobile device from the Web.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll leave it there. Atif, great to see you. Thanks so much.SIDDIQI: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We'll be watching. Atif Siddiqi there of Branch Manager. Still ahead, flying for less than $30? The airline company offering cheap airline tickets but only for today. That's next hour on MORNINGS WITH MARIA -- 30 bucks. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, good Wednesday morning, everybody, happy Wednesday. I'm Maria Bartiromo, thanks for joining us. It is Wednesday, August 2nd. Your top stories right now 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast. We are on Dow 22,000 watch. The markets are rallying once again, and the Dow is eyeing another record high this morning due to Apple. The stock is set to open at an all-time high this morning due to strong earnings last night. The results beat analysts' expectations and the guidance calmed investor fears over delays for the new iPhone. They sold more iPhones and iPads than expected, and that has the stock up 5-1/2 percent. That should empower the Dow Industrials to reach that 22,000 mark today.Checking global market action meanwhile. We are looking at some selling in Europe this morning. Take a look at the European indices down across the board. The FT-100 is down a third of a percent. The CAC Quarante and the DAX Index down fractionally. In Asia overnight, markets mostly higher with the exception of Shanghai. Best performer there was Japan. Nikkei Average up one-half of one percent. Earnings in focus once again. Humana reporting last hour. The profit came in above expectations.Load-Date: August 2, 2017End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 26 of 316CHINA 'FIRES' EDITORS OVER CRITICISM OF MAO, DETAINS LEFTIST ACTIVIST  Page 28 of 316China Dairy Products Monthly News - Research and Markets  Page 30 of 316Google is opening an artificial intelligence center in China  Page  of DOJ Charges Three Chinese Nationals In Hacking Targeting Corporations  Page  of US Sets Import Duty On Chinese Aluminum Foil  Page 35 of 316CHINA: THE NEW LEADING VOICE ON CLIMATE CHANGE?  Page 53 of 316North Korean Threat; Bracing for Hurricane Irma; Deadline for Insurers; Congress Returns to Work Harvey's Toll; Escalating Violence; Settlement Details; Man Acc....  Page 55 of 316Trump ratchets up pressure on China with rare trade action  Page 58 of 316Rising cultural industry boosts Guangdong's soft power  Page  of Trump administration pursues antidumping case against China  Page 62 of 316Ceremonial Opening of Ballard's China Stack Joint Venture Production Facility  Page 64 of 316Piper Jaffray's Mike Olson: Apple Needs To Keep Up With Chinese Innovation  Page 67 of 316EGYPTIAN AUTHORITIES FORCIBLY DISAPPEAR 16 UYGHUR STUDENTS FROM NOTORIOUS PRISON  Page 69 of 316CHINA'S 'FALLEN' OFFICIALS LEAVE GAPS, SILENCED VOICES IN COMMUNIST PARTY RANKS  Page 71 of 316China activist admits to using Twitter to incite subversion  Page 73 of 316China blocks access to 'sacred' mountain near North Korea  Page 77 of 316Agriculture Chemical Markets in China 2017 - Research and Markets  Page 79 of 316China Thriving In Technology Sector Despite Strict Internet Censorship Policies  Page 81 of 316China's bitcoin crackdown forces exchanges to close.
