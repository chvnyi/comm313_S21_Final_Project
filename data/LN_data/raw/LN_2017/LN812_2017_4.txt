The Chinese government has made development of modern, more effective agricultural produce distribution systems a priority.In Jiangxi, the agricultural sector represents 13.8 percent of its GDP yet involves 54.3 percent of its population. Inadequate market infrastructure, storage and transport services, and information systems have contributed to low farm-gate prices, and little incentives for farmers to improve product quality."Geographically, Jiangxi is located close to the major urban markets of Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hong Kong SAR, China, with well-developed transportation routes by road, air, and the Yangtze River. There is potential for growth through accessing these high value urban markets, if bottlenecks in the distribution system can be minimized," said Xiaolan Wang, World Bank's Senior Operations Officer and Project Team Leader. "Through the new project, we will work with Jiangxi to address the key bottlenecks in each of the selected value chains and modernize the farm produce distribution systems, which will eventually increase the incomes of farmers."The Jiangxi Farm Produce Distribution System Development Project will increase the efficiency and productivity of production logistics and farm systems, including the integration of systems to collect, sort, package and store agricultural products. It will support farmer cooperatives in their purchase of business equipment, access to markets, product certification, and e-commerce development. For the first time, the project will use a partial risk guarantee mechanism to improve farmers' access to credit from local commercial banks. The project will also improve the physical structures, services and management systems of the farm produce markets and distribution centers, to increase their efficiency, provide value added benefits and reduce waste of farm produce. Technical assistance and training will be provided under the project.The project will be implemented in eight counties of Jiangxi province between 2018 and 2023. Its total cost of US$198.28 million will be financed by the IBRD loan and a counterpart fund of US$48.28 million from Jiangxi provincial government and the participating counties.Local farmers will benefit from improved post-harvest handling, market information, certification, and greater volume of products sold. Traders, wholesalers, buyers, processors, e-commerce operators, and retailers will benefit from more efficient produce distribution and transparent price formation. Staff and management of the markets and distribution centers will benefit from training and capacity building. Consumers also benefit through access to greener, safer and higher quality foods.Contact: Li Li, (86-10) 5861-7850, Lli2@worldbank.orgCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6108876 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 16, 2017End of Document

China-Northeast Asia Expo Pushes Regional CooperationPR NewswireSeptember 3, 2017 Sunday 10:12 PM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 462 wordsDateline: CHANGCHUN, China, Sept. 3, 2017 BodyThe 11th China-Northeast Asia Expo opened Friday in Changchun, Jilin Province, drawing global attention to Northeast Asia to deepen international cooperation in the region through exchanges and cooperation.The expo will promote the Belt and Road Initiative in Northeast Asia and coordinate development of the Northeast Asian countries to jointly expand international market.Approved by China's State Council, the event is a comprehensive international fair attended by six Northeast Asian countries, namely China, Russia, Mongolia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It has become an important platform for regional economic and trade cooperation, people-to-people exchanges, joint regional development of the Tumen River as well as the opening up of northeast China.Featuring smart manufacturing, this year's expo was attended by senior executives from the world's top 500 enterprises and large multinationals such as Siemens, BASF, DuPont and Shell, and from China's central state-owned enterprises and large private firms.This year's expo includes exhibitions and seminars on advanced technologies in rail transit equipment, satellites, drones, smart equipment and robots, 3D printing and Internet of Things.The Northeast Asia region covers an area of 28.8 million square kilometers and has a total population of nearly 1.7 billion. The regional GDP accounts for one fifth of the world's total and half of the foreign exchange reserves.Driven by economic globalization and regional economic integration, the region has seen closer economic and trade ties and become one of the most dynamic regions in the world's economy.Hosted by Jilin Province, geographical center of Northeast Asia, the China-Northeast Asia Expo has been one of the most influential fairs in China since it began in 2005.Senior political figures from more than 100 countries and regions and 620,000 businessmen have attended the past ten sessions of the event, with transactions of commodities exceeding 8 billion USD. The number of exhibition stalls has increased from 1,900 in 2005 to 3,300 in 2015.In the early 1990s, the United Nations Development Program launched a development project in the Tumen River area among countries in the region.

SINA Files Proxy Materials; Mails Letter to Shareholders Highlighting Record Performance and Continued Shareholder ReturnsPR NewswireSeptember 25, 2017 Monday 4:30 PM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3446 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Sept. 25, 2017 Body SINA Corporation (the "Company" or "SINA") (NASDAQ: SINA), a leading online media company serving China and the global Chinese communities, today announced that it has filed definitive proxy materials with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") in connection with the Company's upcoming 2017 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (the "Annual General Meeting") to be held on November 3, 2017. SINA shareholders of record at the close of business on September 20, 2017 are entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting. The proxy statement and other important information related to the Annual General Meeting can be found on the Company's website athttp://corp.sina.com.cn/eng/AGM/.The SINA Board of Directorsunanimouslyrecommends that shareholders vote "FOR" Yichen Zhang and vote "AGAINST" each of Aristeia's nominees today by signing and dating the enclosed WHITE proxy card.In connection with the filing of the proxy statement, the SINA Board mailed the following letter to shareholders:VOTE THEWHITEPROXY CARD TODAY TO SUPPORT THE SINA BOARD'S RECOMMENDATIONSSeptember 25, 2017Dear Fellow Shareholders,At the SINA 2017 Annual General Meeting to be held on November 3, 2017, you will be asked to elect the director(s) whom you believe are most qualified to oversee the execution of the Company's strategy and serve in the best interests of ALL SINA shareholders.Your Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the re-election of Yichen Zhang.This decision, we believe, will help protect the immediate future of the Company and the value of your investment in SINA.A New York City hedge fund, Aristeia Capital, L.L.C., that owns approximately 3.5% of SINA's shares has launched a costly and disruptive proxy contest to elect two of its hand-picked nominees to your Board. We urge our shareholders to discard any proxy materials sent to you by Aristeia and tovote "AGAINST" the Aristeia nominees, Brett Krause and Thomas Manning, on SINA's WHITE proxy card. We believe that Aristeia's proposed plan will not create sustainable shareholder value, but will instead consist of financial engineering maneuvers that will introduce substantial risk to your company, including certain proposals that are simply not feasible. We also note that Messrs. Krause and Manning are collectively being paid up to $160,000 in cash for their participation in Aristeia's proxy fight. We believe such payment clearly indicates that the Aristeia nominees will not function independently of Aristeia and instead, if elected, would seek to implement Aristeia's value-destructive agenda and could place in jeopardy the significant increase in SINA's share price that has recently occurred.SINA'S ONGOING STRATEGY HAS DELIVERED RECORD PERFORMANCE ANDHIGHLY ATTRACTIVE RETURNS FOR SHAREHOLDERSSINA has built a strong digital media network in China, which includes SINA.com and SINA.cn (PC and mobile portal), SINA Mobile Applications (SINA News App and other vertical apps) and Weibo (the leading social media platform in China). Online advertising has been a main source of SINA's revenues since its inception, and we are now adapting our core business to address headwinds facing PC advertising by expanding and enhancing our mobile advertising platform. Weibo is an integral component of this strategy, creating significant revenue synergies through the sharing of data and IP to drive user traffic and strengthen targeted advertising and content specifically tailored for the SINA mobile portal and apps. Our work is delivering results, and we believe our strategy will successfully position our web portal business for the long-term.The SINA Board and management team have also overseen significant stock price appreciation, established SINA's solid balance sheet and proven its ability to help incubate and develop new businesses and business models, such as Weibo. Weibo continues to benefit from the resources provided by SINA across critical areas including technology, talent, leadership and capital as it builds on its position. The operating synergies between SINA and Weibo directly contribute to Weibo's value generating ability as part of the SINA portfolio, and we believe these efficiencies add value that would not otherwise be created on a standalone basis.The success of our operating strategy is demonstrated by our record high non-GAAP income from operations growth of 235% year-over-year and net revenue growth of 47% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2017. SINA's relative stock performance, which has outperformed the NASDAQ Composite Index by approximately 28% and 123% over the past one- and three-year periods, respectively[1] , further reflects the success of our operating strategy and investments.SINA HAS A RECORD OF VALUE CREATION THROUGH ROBUST CAPITAL RETURNS ANDIS COMMITTED TO ENHANCING SHAREHOLDER VALUESINA's record of growth and value creation has been overseen by five highly qualified directors, four of whom are independent, with a wealth of relevant experience in China's internet industry, professional online media and social media businesses and finance and asset management at publicly-traded companies, including leadership and operating experience in China.Importantly, our independent director, Mr. Zhang, who is subject to re-election at the 2017 Annual General Meeting in accordance with our articles, has direct leadership experience in many of these key areas.Additionally, Charles Chao, our Chairman and CEO, beneficially owns approximately 12% of SINA's outstanding ordinary shares, and is the largest shareholder of SINA, ensuring the Board's and management's interests are fully aligned with the interests of all shareholders. Mr. Chao purchased these shares in 2015 at an above-market price when SINA's stock price was under pressure for an extended period of time. He did so in an effort to increase shareholders' confidence in SINA and align management's interests with those of all shareholders. SINA's stock price rose on the day after Mr. Chao's purchase was announced, demonstrating shareholders' support of this initiative.This alignment with shareholders is further demonstrated by the Company's return of approximately $1.8 billion of capital to its shareholders since 2014, which is the highest for China-based internet and technology companies listed in the U.S. SINA is executing on a prudent capital allocation plan that balances significant shareholder returns, organic and acquisitive growth investments and a strong and stable balance sheet.Ongoing share repurchase planA portion of SINA's returns to shareholders has been through the execution of a $500 million share repurchase plan under which the Company has repurchased $311 million of its shares. On August 9, 2017, the Board approved an extension of the $500 million share repurchase plan until June 30, 2018, which plan was originally announced in March 2016. We expect to fund the repurchases out of our existing cash balance and execute repurchases at appropriate times.Distribution of Weibo sharesAdditional shareholder returns have been through the distribution of approximately 14.2 million Weibo shares to SINA shareholders in October 2016 and July 2017, representing more than 12% of SINA's total holdings in Weibo valued at approximately $1.5 billion.[3] Following the distribution of Weibo shares in July 2017, SINA's total equity stake in Weibo decreased from approximately 49% (or approximately 74% by voting power) to approximately 46% (or approximately 72% by voting power). Aristeia has promoted a proposal to further distribute 33 million shares of Weibo. This distribution would be taxable to U.S. shareholders, and thus could prevent shareholders from fully participating in Weibo's upside to the extent they need to sell such shares to satisfy tax obligations.Prudent capital allocationThe SINA Board and management team also regularly explore, develop and invest in value-enhancing opportunities to increase business scale, diversify business models and increase competitiveness to generate sustained growth and return capital to shareholders. The strength of SINA's balance sheet enables the Company to be nimble when accretive and synergistic transaction opportunities arise and to avoid costly and risky financing to fund its growth needs.This is especially important in the current environment when the Chinese government is monitoring corporate leverage. We believe SINA's balance sheet is aligned with the government's intentions and taking on leverage would create undue risk for SINA and our shareholders. As S&P highlighted in a September 21, 2017 ratings report on China, "Although [China's] credit growth had contributed to strong real GDP growth and higher asset prices, we believe it has also diminished financial stability to some extent. The recent intensification of government efforts to rein in corporate leverage could stabilize the trend of financial risk in the medium term."[4]ARISTEIA'S PROPOSALS ARE RISKY AND POTENTIALLY VALUE DESTRUCTIVEAristeia has proposed a strategy to partially or fully distribute assets in exchange for cash or to engage in a change of control merger as a way to narrow SINA's trading discount to its Net Asset Value ("NAV"). We have conducted comprehensive analysis and concluded that these proposals would likely have no impact on the Company's discount to NAV and would be highly risky and potentially value destructive. We note, and third-party financial analysts agree, that trading discounts at holding companies are common as a result of multiple factors, some of which are beyond the companies' control. A survey of listed holding companies with listed subsidiaries operating in the internet industry in China shows implied holding company trading discounts to NAV ranging from 33% to 37% in the second quarter of 2017. Importantly, a research report issued by a leading third-party financial institution recently calculated the Company's trading discount to NAV to be within the lower range of the aforementioned survey.Our analysis further shows that to eliminate any discount to NAV, all of the free cash flow generated by SINA's subsidiaries would need to flow to the consolidated holding company level. Such a strategy would eliminate reinvestment in the subsidiary businesses, thereby destroying value over time as our subsidiaries would no longer have capital to invest in continued growth. This strategy is especially harmful for fast growing companies in a highly competitive market, such as Weibo, which require significant reinvestment to maintain a growth trajectory. In addition, remittance of all of the free cash flow generated by SINA's subsidiaries in China is contrary to the current foreign exchange control policy and implementation measures widely adopted in the People's Republic of China ("PRC"), and thus is not feasible in the foreseeable future.SINA believes that a partial distribution would not be effective in reducing any discount to NAV. In fact, contrary to what Aristeia may allege, the announcement of SINA's distribution of Weibo shares in July 2017 had a limited impact on SINA's stock price at the time. The Company opportunistically manages this discount by using its balance sheet to repurchase shares and assist the marketplace in absorbing peaks in the NAV discount.Regarding the sale of SINA's stake in Weibo specifically, both SINA and Weibo would incur substantial dis-synergies as a result of contractual obligations to ensure continued shared services across data, management and IP, as well as tax inefficiencies for SINA shareholders.Furthermore, in a change of control transaction for either SINA, Weibo or SINA's other businesses, SINA would be subject to applicable PRC laws and regulations that govern merger and acquisition activities, which for the value-added telecommunication industry and the media industry, are highly complex. For instance, the PRC Ministry of Commerce requires acquisitions by foreign investors of Chinese companies engaged in industries that are crucial to national security, such as online media, to be subject to security review before consummation of any such acquisition.In light of these facts, Aristeia's proposals clearly demonstrate Aristeia's complete lack of understanding of our business and factors affecting our industry, and as a result, Aristeia's purported "available option" for SINA to explore a sale of itself is not a viable option.It is clear that the SINA Board and management team have delivered industry leading performance, created significant and certain value and expect additional upside from its organic growth strategy and Weibo holdings. On the other hand, Aristeia, through its financial engineering, is seeking to conduct a risky, short-term interest driven and potentially long-term value destructive process for SINA and our stake in Weibo.A transaction for SINA or its stake in Weibo would be unlikely to succeed in China. The time, resources and capital invested to pursue a transaction with a high likelihood of failure, rather than accretive and value creating opportunities, is not in the best interests of SINA shareholders.              PROTECT YOUR INVESTMENT - VOTE "FOR" OUR SINA NOMINEE, YICHEN ZHANGAristeia and its two nominees lack the relevant skills, experience and understanding of SINA, the China market and public companies operating in the internet and media industries in China, as clearly demonstrated by Aristeia's proposal calling for the sale of the Company or its stake in Weibo.We believe it is inappropriate for Aristeia, an approximately 3.5% shareholder based in New York City that has traded in and out of SINA's shares over the last few years, to control nearly 30% of the Board - approximately nine times more Board representation as compared to the number of shares Aristeia owns.After the Board evaluated the qualifications of each of Aristeia's nominees, the Board determined that the Aristeia nominees - a law school professor and a tech-startup investor - would not bring additive skills or experience to the Board and believes the Aristeia nominees would seek to implement a strategy that would threaten the investment of all other SINA shareholders. Moreover, Mr. Krause has no experience serving on the Board of a public company and may have a potential conflict of interest as a result of his personal involvement as a managing partner of PurpleSky Capital, an angel investor in Inke (映客), a company that is in direct competition with SINA. Mr. Manning already serves on three public company boards, has commitments to five other organizations and resides in Illinois, USA, and is therefore unlikely to have the necessary time to devote to SINA.Given our focus on enhancing our long-term strategy, SINA will not support risky tactics that provide an unlikely and modest short-term benefit, but create substantial long-term risk. We do not believe that is what you want us to do, or that you would be well-served by it.We urge you to vote "AGAINST" each of Aristeia's nominees on the enclosed WHITE proxy card and to discard any proxy materials you may receive from Aristeia.Instead, we trust that you want us to implement strategies and programs that are calculated to sustain our long-term performance without undue risk. If that is indeed what you desire,we encourage you to vote "FOR" Yichen Zhang todayby signing and dating the WHITE proxy card and returning it in the postage-paid envelope provided.We thank you for your continued support.Sincerely,Charles Chao  Chairman of the Board and CEOTer Fung Tsao  Independent DirectorYan Wang  Independent DirectorSong-Yi Zhang  Independent DirectorYichen Zhang  Independent DirectorYour Vote Is Important, No Matter How Many or How Few Shares You Own! If you have questions about how to vote your shares, please contact:INNISFREE M&A INCORPORATED Shareholders may call toll-free (from the U.S. and Canada): 888-750-5834 International shareholders may call: +1-412-232-3651 Banks and brokers (call collect): 212-750-5833 Please visit  http://corp.sina.com.cn/eng/AGM/  for more information.    About SINAWe are an online media company serving China and the global Chinese communities.

Hina: Sham Trial for Taiwan NGO WorkerTargeted News ServiceSeptember 12, 2017 Tuesday 4:06 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 463 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: LONDON BodyAmnesty International issued the following news release:The Chinese government's prosecution of a Taiwan NGO worker for allegedly trying to subvert state power via social media channels opens a new front in the unrelenting crackdown on civil society and freedom of expression."By charging Lee Ming-cheh with subversion, the Chinese government is giving a warning to NGO workers promoting human rights and democracy that their work will land them in jail," said James Fang, Director of Amnesty International Taiwan.Lee Ming-cheh was tried on Monday 11 September at Yueyang City Intermediate People's Court on the charge of "subverting state power" and for encouraging multi-party rule. He was detained in late March and held incommunicado for nearly six months before news about his trial was announced by a spokesperson for China's State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office.Lee is being tried with co-defendant Peng Yuhua, who is facing the same charges. Lee is accused of taking part in social media groups in which articles slandering and attacking the government were shared widely. While such activities are routinely prosecuted under the lesser charge of "inciting subversion of state power", the authorities chose to prosecute Lee for "subverting state power", a much more serious crime for which the maximum sentence is life imprisonment.Lee said in court that some of the material spread by Peng included information related to the Tiananmen crackdown, Western "colour revolutions" and the dissolution of the Soviet Union."Lee Ming-cheh's detention, similar to detained Chinese activists, is riddled with irregularities including no access to lawyers of own choice for months, no communication with his family and generally not following any of the required criminal law procedures." said James Fang.It is not clear if Lee was able to hire lawyers of his own choice. His wife Lee Ching-yu stated previously that she will not recognize the lawyers as legitimate until she is able to meet with her husband.While Lee Ching-yu attended the trial it is unclear if she was able to speak with her husband or the lawyers. In a subtle act of defiance, at an improvised press conference at her hotel after the trial, Lee Ching-yu displayed tattoos on her arms that read, "Lee Ming-cheh, you are my pride". She also released a statement later, condemning the trial as a "foolish drama" and urging the Chinese government to release Lee Ming-cheh.Lee is a manager of an NGO in Taipei, Wenshan Community College. While he has supported civil-society organizations and activists for many years in China, Lee was visiting China for personal reasons when he was detained by state security authorities on the Macao border on 19 March 2017.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-5989159 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: September 13, 2017End of Document

3Q: INSTITUTE PROFESSOR JOHN DEUTCH ON MAINTAINING US LEADERSHIP IN TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONStates News ServiceDecember 15, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 1006 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. BodyThe following information was released by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT):MIT Institute Professor John Deutch, who has been on the MIT faculty since 1970, has served as a department head, dean of the School of Science, and provost, and has published over 160 technical publications as well as numerous publications on technology, energy, international security, and public policy issues. He served in the U.S. government as director of central intelligence from 1995 to 1996, as deputy secretary of defense from 1994 to 1995, and in other posts in the departments of Defense and Energy. He is a member of the nonpartisan Aspen Strategy Group, which is composed of current and former policymakers, academics, journalists, and business leaders whose aim is to explore foreign policy and national security challenges facing the United States. The group has just released its annual report, and it includes a chapter co-written by Deutch and former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, about how the U.S. should deal with the risk of losing important intellectual property rights regarding technological innovations, in the face of efforts by China to acquire such technology through underhanded means. MIT News asked Deutch to describe the potential risks and remedies for such actions that he and Rice outlined in their report.Q: What was the challenge that you and Prof. Rice, now at Stanford Business School, were asked to address in this piece, and what conclusions did you reach?A: This year the subject [of the Aspen Strategy Group's annual report] was the future challenges we see for policy. There was a lot of talk about China and what its relationship with the United States is likely to be, and in the course of this there was a lot of discussion about national security and the tremendous emphasis in China's new five-year plan on technology, in key areas such as robotics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. There also was a great deal of discussion about nefarious activities by some in China, including trying to get certain Chinese nationals who live here to provide information to the Chinese government to help them acquire this advanced technology. As a result of that, there's been a hint of a new set of proposals from some elements of the natonal security community to, first, control information in the United States from leaving the country, and, second, restrict Chinese nationals from participating in certain kinds of research projects. Condi and I decided to write a short piece about the danger of these proposals.Basically our view was, yes, the Chinese are putting a greater emphasis on technology; they are growing very fast and they're increasingly competent, and so we should expect greater competition. And yes, they are performing illegal acts against the U.S., especially theft of intellectual property. The U.S. should do everything it can to push back on that effort and prevent it if possible. But the idea that we should respond to this threat by either restricting access to U.S. universities or keeping our ideas in the United States is completely wrong. We'll lose the tremendous advantage we have of an open university system if we do that. The only answer is for U.S. universities to do even more in pursuing their great record of being innovative and creative.Q: Do you think it's possible to maintain academic freedom of information in the context of dealing with people who may not share our commitment to protecting intellectual property?A: In such a situation, we need to recognize that we will have some losses. But there will be more severe effects on our innovative enterprise, which is the best in the world, if we start trying to stop these losses by applying restrictions. Universities aren't very good, first of all, at assessing the nature of the risk [of intellectual-property loss] and, second, at deciding what restrictive measures should be put in place. So, both my co-author Condi and I believe, keep the system open. Recognize that you will have some losses, but do what you do well.Universities should make sure that our scholarly efforts and our educational efforts permit advances in key areas where fundamental research and practical application come together, in health, energy, and environment, including an emphasis on innovation. And we see that happening. By the way, much as the Chinese universities are improving, they do not have the kind of ecosystem that is so strong here, in terms of promoting innovation, creativity, and getting important things implemented in the private sector.Q: So are there specific measures that universities should be taking to address these efforts to exploit U.S. innovations, or is your advice that they should avoid taking any special measures?A: My answer is no, there are not specific measures they should take, but it is very important that the administrative leadership of the university understands the concerns in Washington, appreciates the risks, and doesn't enter into joint projects that could really lead to a loss of sensitive technology.The universities should try and explain to the government that we think the proper response here is better performance by U.S. universities, rather than trying to keep people out or keep our ideas in.I think one should expect that the technical competence of China will continue to improve, because of the capabilities of its people and the significant amount of resources the Chinese are putting into technology leadership in a variety of fields. We should expect that. How much of an advantage is given to China by their quite sustained illegal efforts to acquire technology from both the United States and Europe? I think it is helpful but by no means the most important or the determining factor in their advance.This short piece with Condi Rice is not so much directed to U.S. universities; rather it is directed to the government and the national security community, to say to them, be cautious here don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.Load-Date: December 15, 2017End of Document

How the semiconductor industry is taking charge of its transformationMcKinsey & CompanyOctober 11, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 McKinsey & Company, Inc All Rights ReservedLength: 1314 wordsByline: McKinsey QuarterlyHighlight: Three snapshots demonstrate areas of change and opportunity.Body Link to Image Semiconductors are the unsung heroes of technology, providing high-speed processing power for computers, flat-screen displays, smartphones, and other electronic devices. But while semiconductor revenues are hitting record levels, recent geographic and product shifts are upending long-standing business plans. Moreover, R&D budgets are rising by about 6 percent annually because of new technological and business challenges, such as increased complexity in coding, testing, and verification. Three developments in the semiconductor industry-the evolving demand for automotive chips, the availability of new productivity tools, and the growth of China as a revenue source-provide opportunities to increase performance. Changing in tandem: Opportunities in the automotive sector If you walked into an electronics convention today, you might see hundreds of exhibits from automotive OEMs. Their displays typically focus on new car features that rely on sophisticated electronics, such as mapping applications and automatic-braking systems. This emphasis on innovation has helped increase revenues for automotive semiconductors from about $7 billion in 1996 to almost $30 billion in 2015 (Exhibit 1). Automotive chips now account for about 8 percent of total semiconductor sales, and current projections suggest that they will see about 6 percent annual growth through 2020-higher than the 3 to 4 percent growth predicted for the sector as a whole. That would put yearly revenues from automotive semiconductors in the $39 billion to $42 billion range. The new electronic systems are shifting demand for semiconductors among the major application segments-body,1 safety, driver information, powertrain, and chassis. For instance, the safety segment only accounted for 17 percent of total demand in 2015, but this figure will rise to 24 percent by 2020, since OEMs are now developing more applications in this area. Similarly, the growth of electronic vehicles is shifting demand among device segments (such as memory, microcomponents, logic, and optical and sensors). Although all semiconductor companies are tracking these trends, the highest performers will go a step further by identifying emerging pockets of growth within each segment. Take safety again. Most growth in this burgeoning segment will come from collision-warning systems, which will account for $4.1 billion in sales, far surpassing other segments. The best semiconductor companies will also begin considering strategic questions now, including tactics for differentiating their offerings, addressing opportunities and challenges within the Chinese market, and collaborating with automotive OEMs or tier-one suppliers.Stefan Burghardt is a specialist in McKinsey's Munich office, where Florian Weig is a senior partner; Seunghyuk Choi is an associate partner in the Seoul office. For the full article, see "           Mobility trends: What's ahead for automotive semiconductors." How advanced analytics can improve team performance Like their peers in other industries, many semiconductor companies have embarked on ambitious programs to decrease costs and boost productivity using better data and analytics. Most of their efforts have focused on streamlining basic engineering tasks, such as chip design or analyzing component failure. But with costs continuing to rise, semiconductor companies are applying advanced data analytics to engineering management, with the goal of deriving fresh insights that will improve decision making. This new analytical approach, which we term "Moneyball for engineers," relies on pattern recognition and machine learning to uncover counterintuitive management insights, typically delivering productivity gains of 20 percent or more for engineering groups.2 Data from our analyses identified five staffing parameters-including some overlooked measures-that had the greatest impact on team performance in engineering management:            team size, team-member fragmentation, collaboration history, individual experience, and geographic footprint (Exhibit 2). Semiconductor managers can transform their engineering groups by taking a new look at these parameters when assembling teams. In addition to providing a competitive edge, the new team structures should also help employees gain greater satisfaction from their jobs.Eoin Leydon is a senior expert in McKinsey's London office; Ernest Liu is an associate partner in the Taipei office, where Bill Wiseman is a senior partner. For the full article, see "Moneyball for engineers: What the semiconductor industry can learn from sports." China: The new global-local challenge for multinationals China has become an important center of R&D and global product development for many OEMs. Between 2007 and 2015, overall R&D spending in the country rose more than fourfold-the greatest increase among major regions in the world. Both locally owned product-design centers and those owned by multinational corporations contributed to this high growth. In an effort to better understand the market, we recently surveyed 80 executives at Chinese design centers about their current operations and future aspirations. Survey respondents cited many forces behind China's product-development surge, but one stands out: the greater talent pool within the country (Exhibit 3). With more skilled engineers and technological staff, Chinese product-design centers can create more innovative products for export, rather than simply developing low-cost offerings for the local market. As Chinese design centers focus on innovation, their total demand for components, including semiconductors, will increase from $350 billion in 2016 to $500 billion by 2020. But the path for capturing growth may be more difficult for multinational suppliers. Many of our survey respondents believe that the Chinese government will provide new incentives, including subsidies, for companies to create products that can be considered Chinese in origin. This shift could prompt multinational OEMs with significant Chinese sales volumes to increase purchases of semiconductors and other components from Chinese-owned suppliers (Exhibit 4). OEMs headquartered in China might also source more components locally. Such changes are both an opportunity and a threat to global chipmakers. To thrive in this environment, multinational semiconductor companies should consider increasing local investment in China while also striving to maintain their global business. Options for local investment include partnerships with Chinese investors or semiconductor vendors, as well as greater customization of products, pricing, and business arrangements for the Chinese market. As multinationals increase their local presence, they may need to restructure their global operating models by moving more decision-making authority to China. The shift to a new model may be challenging, however, since it requires a thorough understanding of China's available leadership talent, regulatory issues, and intellectual-property environment.  Thierry Chesnais is an associate partner in McKinsey's Hong Kong office, and Christopher Thomas is a partner in the Beijing office.

OEMs headquartered in China might also source more components locally. Such changes are both an opportunity and a threat to global chipmakers. To thrive in this environment, multinational semiconductor companies should consider increasing local investment in China while also striving to maintain their global business. Options for local investment include partnerships with Chinese investors or semiconductor vendors, as well as greater customization of products, pricing, and business arrangements for the Chinese market. As multinationals increase their local presence, they may need to restructure their global operating models by moving more decision-making authority to China. The shift to a new model may be challenging, however, since it requires a thorough understanding of China's available leadership talent, regulatory issues, and intellectual-property environment.  Thierry Chesnais is an associate partner in McKinsey's Hong Kong office, and Christopher Thomas is a partner in the Beijing office.

Cyber Monday? So Passé. Asia's Online Retailers Are the Stocks to ShopRealMoneyNovember 21, 2017 Tuesday 11:00 AM EDTCopyright 2017 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1709 wordsByline: Alex McMillanHighlight: You call that an online sale? Singles' Day in China dwarves Cyber Monday, with China's largest e-commerce company doing more than double in one day what all U.S. retailers sell over the entire Thanksgiving weekend. Here are the stocks to own to capitalize on Asia's e-commerce boom.BodyWith Thanksgiving on Thursday, the totally-made-up shopping spree of Cyber Monday is just days away. So, the selling season has begun -- a boon to retailers all the way through Christmas. Just feel that peer pressure forcing you to fork out the cash.Amazon.com  and eBay  might be the first beneficiaries that spring to mind. But the day is arguably more important for brick-and-click retailers like Walmart  , Best Buy  , Foot Locker  , Gap  , Target  and privately held Toys R Us, whose overseas operations are not affected by its September filing for bankruptcy.Digital sales know no boundaries, there are no Big Box walls. In fact, the most important e-commerce action in the world already happened. It's sacrilegious to a Brit like me, but in my part of the world Nov. 11 is "Singles' Day" -- the anti-Valentines. It's an equally made-up selling "holiday" in China and increasingly other parts of Asia, since the date is all alone: 1, 1, 1, 1.In Britain and other Commonwealth countries, Nov. 11 is better known as Remembrance Day, the day the guns fell silent in World War I, at 11 a.m.Forget that, though. It's all about web-window shopping and yuan/yen/won in my part of the world.Singles' Day crushes Cyber Monday when it comes to sales. Shoppers spent $3.39 billion on Cyber Monday in 2016, at an average of $505 per person, and sales for the entire Thanksgiving weekend were $9.36 billion. That was for all retailers.China's largest e-commerce operator Alibaba Group Holding  , via its Taobao and luxury Tmall sites, had 168 billion yuan ($25.3 billion) in sales in 24 hours on Singles' Day. That's for one site. On one day.Chinese consumers alone are forecast to spend $100.2 billion in online sales this year, according to research company eMarketer, at an average rate of $882 per person (granted, for a full year, so in no way comparable to the $505 figure for Cyber Monday). Frankly, that seems modest after the Singles' Day success.There are 751 million Internet users in China. That's a little over half the 1.4 billion population, leaving plenty of room for market penetration.So instead of Amazon.com, investors may want to go shopping for a little stock to fill their stockings in this part of the world. Chief among them would be Tencent Holdings  , which  (half a trillion!) in market capitalization. It's at $523 billion as of Tuesday's close in Hong Kong, site of its primary listing.Alibaba, now at $482 billion in market cap and running neck and neck in terms of size with Tencent, surely won't be far behind. Both companies have seen their shares double this year, and just keep on going.I  that investors need to be wary of the social responsibility that comes with investing in Chinese Internet stocks. The Great Firewall of China ensures that content in the Middle Kingdom is heavily restricted, and companies like Alibaba and Tencent play along with the censorship imposed by the Communists.But investors who put dollars ahead of scruples will certainly not be alone. Alibaba shares are up 114% in 2017, while Tencent's stock is up 127%.Even Tencent spinoffs generate massive investor interest. Everything it touches seems to turn to gold -- and it tries to touch everything.Its online publishing arm China Literature HK:0772 went public on Nov. 8 in Hong Kong, and promptly doubled when it started to trade. No surprise - the offering was oversubscribed by a factor of 625 times the available number of shares.China Literature raised $1.1 billion in the initial public offering, the largest tech IPO in a decade in Hong Kong. Thanks to the share rise, the company is now valued at $10.8 billion. Let's forget that China Literature has even greater restrictions on what it can e-print than your basic run-of-the-mill e-commerce or online-gaming company, shall we?New York investors have been considerably more circumspect. The Chinese search engine Sogou  raised $585 million in its debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Nov. 9, valuing the company at $5 billion. But its shares, which priced at the top of their range at $13, rose only 10% on the day. They have given up more than half that, too, and are now up only slightly at $13.55.Tencent is Sogou's largest shareholder, investing alongside Sohu.com  . The Sogou Web browser is a key component of the Tencent empire -- China's biggest search engine, Baidu  , bars you from accessing Tencent content via a search. In response, Sogou search is now the default browser for Tencent apps. And only Sogou can search through the billions of posts on WeChat, Tencent's superpopular chat app.The company's Sogou Input system is also the top software used by Chinese speakers who want to input Western characters into their phone or computer and have them translated into Chinese characters.So Tencent is actually building up a nice little tech portfolio of its own. It owns about 12% of the total shares of Snap  , the parent of the disappearing-message Snapchat app. Its $2.0 billion support has been key at a time that Snap is struggling to sustain momentum as a public company.Tencent has long owned a major stake in Kakao KR:035720, which runs KaTalk, the most-popular messaging app in South Korea. The Shenzhen-based company is also likely to list its Tencent Music division, which is the third-largest music-streaming service in the world.It's all part of an apparent plan for world domination that means Tencent is far more than a company selling mobile video games, although it is certainly expert at that. It is moving into artificial intelligence, Big Data, self-driving cars ... you name it, really.Alibaba is heading down the same paths. Its Alipay mobile-payment system goes right up against Tencent's WePay equivalent in China. And it is also investing in artificial intelligence, Big Data and cloud computing.Somewhat incestuously, Alibaba's Ant Financial affiliate has invested $200 million in Kakao Pay, the mobile-payment subsidiary of the South Korean messaging app that Tencent has backed.Ant Financial, valued at $60 billion in a funding round last year, is being watched closely for a likely stock offering of its own. It is placing its own bets like a roulette player, with chips also down on Paytm, the Indian mobile payment and e-commerce site, and Ascend Money, the Thai financial-technology company.Ant Financial, which pays part of its profits to Alibaba, has also bought 45% of Mynt, the main mobile-finance company in the Philippines, which has introduced GCash as a similar "mobile-wallet" app. Ant's partners in conquering the Filipino market are local conglomerate powerhouses the Ayala Group  and Globe Telecom  .The only place it's not making any headway is the United States. Contrary to President Donald Trump's claim that the U.S. market is open and ready for Chinese investment, Ant has been nixed twice in its efforts to buy the U.S. money-transfer company MoneyGram International  . The company is hoping third time will be lucky in its efforts to get the deal approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which is obviously leery of allowing a Chinese company to access the U.S. financial system. No reducing the trade deficit there. Tencent's WeChat app has expanded beyond its original chat function (which operates just like WhatsApp, only with Chinese government vetting) and now allows you to pay at the corner store or mall and hail a cab via its WePay function. Call up a QR code that the merchant scans, and away you go.You can spot the tourists in Shanghai, jokes Mark Tinker, the head of AXA IM Framlington Equities Asia, because they're using credit cards or (gasp!) cash. Soooo last century.And you can spot the locals who invested in Tencent in Hong Kong -- by the way, they're splashing the cash in the bars. Tencent has created a wealth effect not only in its top earners -- three execs are now making more than HK$300 million ($38 million) a year, making them the best-paid top brass in the city -- but thanks to the gains in the Hang Seng, rank and file investors as well.Hong Kong is the top-performing Asian exchange this year (among the major ones), in a year that has been exceptionally kind to equities in my part of the world. Outdoing even record highs in South Korea and a Nikkei in Tokyo that's climbing steadily toward its pre-bubble prime, the Hang Seng is up 33.0% in 2017.Tencent's rise to a record high is in turn accounting for around 33% of Hong Kong's entire gains. In Seoul, Samsung Electronics  has driven around 40% of the Kospi's gains over the last year.There's a chicken-and-egg situation."Are Tencent or Samsung up so much because people are buying the index? Or vice versa?" Tinker asks.Where are the next Alibaba or Tencent? That's the half-trillion-dollar question. But given the recent rise of tech listings in Hong Kong, it's more likely to happen here than in New York.Razer HK:1337, the gaming hardware maker backed by Intel  and Hong Kong's richest man, Li Ka-shing, climbed 18% when it went public here on November 14. Yixin HK:2858, China's largest online car-sales site, rose 6% in its Nov. 16 offering, although it has given up those gains. It is worth watching, though -- it is backed by not just Tencent but also JD.com JD, the second-largest e-commerce site operator in China behind Alibaba. Meanwhile on Wall Street, Best  , a logistics group backed by Alibaba, had to halve the size of its offering in September due to poor demand. Its competitor ZTO Express  raised $1.4 billion to Best's $450 million -- then promptly saw its shares drop 15% on debut.Beijing-based Bytedance, which runs China's best-known news app, is following in the steps of Alibaba and Tencent with overseas investment. Earlier this month it struck a deal to buy the karaoke app provider Musical.Ly for a price that could climb as high as $1 billion.We're also watching for the offerings of Meituan-Dianping, which offers everything from movie tickets, beauty products and restaurant bookings online, now valued at $30 billion, and Lufax, an online finance company now worth $18.5 billion. Neither of those two, nor Ant Financial, has commented publicly about their listing plans. So you can bet exchange operators on both sides of the Pacific are lobbying hard for that business.Load-Date: November 22, 2017End of Document

VOA Staff Employment Terminated; Months After Livestreamed InterviewTargeted News ServiceNovember 13, 2017 Monday 10:59 PM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 660 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: BRUSSELS BodyThe International Federation of Journalists issued the following news release:The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) calls on Voice of America (VOA) to provide an explanation for the termination of the employment of three staff members, following the Guo Wengui live stream interview in April, 2017.On April 19, VOA livestreamed an interview with Chinese fugitive billionaire, Guo Wengui. The interview was originally scheduled to run for three hours, but the livestream was abruptly cut short, citing issues of 'miscommunication' for the disconnection. VOA strongly refused claims of self-censorship, however several media reports said that senior officials of the Foreign Ministry Affairs in China met with the Beijing Bureau Chief of VOA, and reportedly told VOA that the interview 'interfered with China's internal affairs' and 'interfered with the 19th National People's Congress'. Following the interview, five VOA staff, Yang Chen, Bao Shen, Sasha Gong Xiaoxia, Dong Fang and Bao Shen were ordered to take administrative leave with pay until further notice.Last month, Yang Chen was the first staff members to be informed that his employment had been reinstated and he could resume duties. Earlier this month, senior editor, Bao Shen was allowed to resume his duties. However Sasha, Gong and Bao were advised that their employment would be terminated as they violated certain regulations including disobeying management orders and not following journalistic practices. Sasha and Dong were the interviewers and Bao was the technician during the interview.Sasha told the IFJ that she will fight the termination and she disagreed with the allegations. She said: "They could not tell me which order I had disobeyed. I don't understand how I had not followed the journalistic practice."Gong told the IFJ that: "The senior demanded me not to ask any corruption questions related to Guo and the Chinese leaderships, when they tried to stop the interview. I did not produce all of my materials of Guo Wengiu that he gave to me for the interview, even though management demanded them when I was suspended. I refused to give them , as I have a duty to protect all my materials. This is the basic principles of press freedom."Gong went on to say: "I can tell you that the Chinese Embassy in Washington DC tried to suppress us at least twice. I have the evidence to prove it. They called my office directly on the day before the interview. I believe they did the same thing to the management." However she claimed that she did not know whether there was any press from the US Government. Gong said that she asked VOA for help after she received a threatening letter three months ago, but VOA refused. The letter, which was written in Chinese said: "Let bullet passed".According to several overseas media reports, Chinese officials ordered VOA to stop the interview, otherwise their working visas might have 'problems'. Several US representatives have demanded an investigation into the case.The IFJ Asia Pacific office said: "VOA must provide clarification regarding the termination of Sasha, Dong and Bao. No journalist or media outlet should succumb to the pressure of external actors, particularly governments. Organisations, such as VOA, have an important role to play in supporting press freedom in China. As a watchdog, the media needs to stand firm to guarantee press freedom, serving the public not any authorities."The Chinese Government took a number of steps to stop the interview from taking place. On April 19, Interpol issued a warrant for Wengui's arrest. On April 20, the Communist Party issued several reports smearing Guo's integrity. Several of Guo's online and social media accounts have been suspended and closed down.We call on the US Government to investigate this case, particularly why the interview abruptly stopped.This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 12, 2017.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6072251 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 14, 2017End of Document

Pershing Square Holdings Releases Semiannual Financial Statements Including Investment Manager's Report to ShareholdersBusiness WireAugust 17, 2017 Thursday 8:00 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business EditorsLength: 19086 wordsDateline: AMSTERDAM BodyRegulatory News:Pershing Square Holdings, Ltd. (LN:PSH) (NA:PSH) today released Semiannual Financial Statements including its Investment Manager's Report to Shareholders. The report is now available on PSH's website, https://www.pershingsquareholdings.com/company-reports/financial-statements/ .In addition, please find below the full text of the half yearly report.About Pershing Square Holdings, Ltd.Pershing Square Holdings, Ltd. (LN:PSH) (NA:PSH) is an investment holding company structured as a closed ended fund that makes concentrated investments principally in North American companies.MEDIA CONTACTMaitlandJames Devas, +44 20 7379 5151, Media-pershingsquareholdings@maitland.co.ukThis is a disclosure according to Article 17 of the EU Market Abuse Regulation (Regulation 596/2014/EU).Pershing Square Holdings, Ltd.Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial ReportSix Months Ended June 30, 2017ContentsChairman's Statement2Investment Manager's Report4Statement of the Directors14Independent Review Report15Unaudited Interim Financial StatementsCondensed Interim Statement of Financial Position16Condensed Interim Statement of Comprehensive Income17Condensed Interim Statement of Changes in Net Assets Attributable to Management Shareholders18Condensed Interim Statement of Changes in Equity19Condensed Interim Statement of Cash Flows20Notes to the Condensed Interim Financial Statements21Chairman's StatementINTRODUCTIONThis interim financial report covers the period from January 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017. During this period assets under management ("AUM") 1,2 of Pershing Square Holdings, Ltd. ("PSH" or the "Company") decreased from $4.5 billion to $4.4 billion due to adverse investment performance and share buybacks.INVESTMENT PERFORMANCEFor the period January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2017, the Company returned -2.3%3 net of fees4. During the first half of the year, a number of holdings made positive contributions to performance, with Restaurant Brands International being by far the most significant. The portfolio's gains, however, were offset by mark-to-market losses in several holdings, with the Herbalife short, Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac and Mondelez long positions being the largest detractors to performance year-to-date. From July 1, 2017 through August 15, 2017, the Company returned 0.5% net of fees, bringing YTD performance through August 15, 2017 to -1.7%.The Investment Manager's report on page 4 provides a detailed discussion about the portfolio. For an up-to-date NAV, please refer to our website at www.pershingsquareholdings.com where we publish our NAV on a weekly basis.NEW INVESTMENTOn August 4, 2017, Pershing Square Capital Management, L.P. (the "Investment Manager," or "PSCM" or "Pershing Square"), issued a press release announcing a new investment in ADP. The company fits the long-term profile of historically successful Pershing Square activist investments as it is a simple, predictable, free-cash-flow-generative business with a long-term history of growing cash flows and a dominant market position. In disclosing its stake, Pershing Square stated that it had acquired an 8% stake in the company and that it "has long admired ADP's business. Based on extensive research and due diligence, Pershing Square believes that there is an enormous opportunity to improve the operating performance of ADP by accelerating growth, improving the quality of ADP's software and service offerings, dramatically reducing operating costs, and increasing efficiency."On August 7, 2017, Pershing Square gave formal notice to the company of its intent to nominate three directors for election to the board of directors at the company's 2017 Annual Meeting and on August 14, 2017 it filed a Preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC. Pershing Square presented its ADP investment thesis on a webcast on August 17, 2017.LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING / FTSE INDEX INCLUSIONOn March 23, 2017 PSH announced that it intended to apply for admission of its ordinary shares to the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange. The Board and the Investment Manager believed that the London listing would benefit the Company by widening the pool of prospective investors in the Public Shares, increasing liquidity in the Public Shares, and attracting greater analyst coverage for the Company. On May 2, 2017, PSH announced that its Public Shares had been admitted to the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and shares commenced trading on the Premium Segment of the Main Market of the LSE. Since then, investors have been able to trade a single class of PSH shares on both the LSE and Euronext Amsterdam under the same ISIN/SEDOL number. PSH shares are quoted and traded in Sterling in London and in USD on Euronext Amsterdam.On May 31, 2017, it was announced that PSH shares had qualified for inclusion in the FTSE 250 and FTSE All-Share indices. The change was effective on Monday, June 19, 2017. On the preceding Friday there was a spike in PSH volume as the index trackers rebalanced their exposures in advance of Monday's opening. Since PSH shares started trading in London on May 2, 2017 through August 15, 2017, the average daily trading volume on the Amsterdam and London Stock Exchanges has almost doubled to nearly one million shares per day, excluding the 25.1 million shares that traded on Friday, June 16, 2017.In connection with the UK listing, PSH changed its primary central securities depositary ("CSD") from the Nederlands Centraal Instituut voor Giraal Effectenverkeer BV ("Euroclear NL") to Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited ("Euroclear UI" or "CREST"). PSH's Public Shares are now accepted for clearance both through the book-entry facilities of Euroclear NL and CREST, the electronic securities settlement system operated by Euroclear UI which enables securities to be evidenced otherwise than by certificates and transferred otherwise than by written instrument.SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAMOn April 19, 2017, PSH announced a share buyback program of up to 5% of PSH's outstanding Public Shares. Jefferies International Limited, the buyback agent, commenced the program on May 2, 2017. PSH believes that the repurchase is an attractive investment at current discount levels which should contribute to performance, and may assist in reducing the current discount between PSH's share price and NAV.As of August 15, 2017, a total of 1,775,793 shares have been repurchased under this program representing 14.8% of the total buyback authorization.PSH BONDIn June 2015, the Company issued $1 billion aggregate principal amount of its Senior Notes due July 15, 2022 at an interest rate 5.500% per annum which is payable semi-annually (the "Bonds"). The proceeds from the offering were used to make investments and hold assets in accordance with the Company's investment policy. At issuance, the Bonds received a BBB rating with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor's Rating Services (now known as S&P Global Ratings or "S&P") and a BBB+ rating with a stable outlook from Fitch Ratings, Inc. ("Fitch"). Currently Fitch maintains its rating BBB+ with a stable outlook while S&P's current rating is BBB with a negative outlook.As of July 31, 2017 the Bonds were trading at approximately a 6% premium to par, having risen during the year from a low of $99.42 on January 4, 2017.As of July 31, 2017, the Company's Total Indebtedness to Total Capital Ratio5 was 18.1%. The principal covenants of the Bonds limit the incurrence of debt or distributions to shareholders when this ratio is greater than or equal to 33.3%. Unlike margin debt, the Bonds do not have mark-to-market covenants.While the leverage of the bond issue has amplified losses during the period as the portfolio declined in value, the Board and PSCM believe that a prudent amount of long-term, cost-effective leverage should enhance the long-term returns to PSH shareholders.HIGH WATER MARKAs reported in the 2016 Annual Report, the terms of PSH's investment management agreement with PSCM have a "high water mark" feature such that investors in PSH only pay performance fees on increases in the NAV above the highest NAV at which a performance fee has previously been charged. As a result, PSH investors will not incur performance fees until PSH's NAV exceeds $26.37 per share.PREMIUM AND DISCOUNTThe Board monitors the trading activity of the Company's shares on a regular basis. The Company publishes its NAV per share weekly on its website together with monthly performance reports and transparency reports disclosing certain information with respect to the Company's underlying positions, which are predominantly in large cap listed companies. The Board and the Investment Manager believe that this transparency should help the Company's shares trade (over the long term) at or above NAV. In addition, the UK listing and share buyback program were undertaken with the goal of increasing the liquidity of PSH shares and helping to narrow the discount. We note that the discount narrowed from a high of 16.5% several days prior to the London Listing to approximately 14% on the first day of trading in London and the commencement of the buyback program. However, since then, PSH shares have fluctuated between a low of 13.2% and a high of 23.3% discount to NAV. Ultimately, the Investment Manager and the Board believe that a return to the historically strong performance of the Investment Manager will be the primary catalyst for closing the discount.I look forward to reporting to you again in our 2017 Annual Report./s/ Anne FarlowAnne FarlowChairman of the BoardAugust 17, 2017___________________________1 "AUM" is the NAV of the Company without taking into effect accrued and/or crystallized performance fees and any accrued portion of the Potential Offset Amount (as defined in Note 8 of the financial statements) as of the end of a period.2 "NAV" means the value of the Company's portfolio securities, cash and other assets less its liabilities (including any accrued performance fees and the accrued portion of the Potential Offset Amount), as determined by PSCM in accordance with its valuation policy and procedures, and in accordance with applicable accounting principles (except that the net asset value of the Company attributable to Management Shares issued from time to time will not be classified as liabilities for purposes of calculating NAV).3 Calculated with respect to Public Shares only. On May 2, 2017, the Company began its share buyback program whereby its buyback agent began to repurchase Public Shares subject to certain limitations. Any positive impact on performance due to these share buybacks is reflected herein.4 Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Net returns include the reinvestment of all dividends, interest, and capital gains and reflect the deduction of, among other things, brokerage commissions, administrative expenses, management fees and performance fees (if any). Performance results provided herein also assume an investor has been invested in the Company since inception and participated in any "new issues" as such term is defined under Rules 5130 and 5131 of FINRA.5 For purposes of this report, "Total Indebtedness", "Total Capital" and "Total Indebtedness to Total Capital Ratio" have the meaning given to these terms under the Indenture, dated June 26, 2015, between, among others, the Company, as the issuer, and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee, Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent (the "Indenture"). As defined in the Indenture, "Indebtedness" reflects indebtedness (i) in respect of borrowed money, (ii) evidenced by bonds, notes, debentures or similar instruments or letters of credit (or reimbursement agreements in respect thereof), (iii) representing capital lease obligations, (iv) representing the balance deferred and unpaid of the purchase price of any property or services (excluding accrued expenses and trade payables in the ordinary course of business) due more than one year after such property is acquired or such services are completed or (v) in respect of PSH's capital stock that is repayable or redeemable, pursuant to a sinking fund obligation or otherwise, or preferred stock of any of PSH's future subsidiaries. "Indebtedness" does not include, among other things, PSH's NAV attributable to any Management Shares (whether or not the Management Shares are accounted for as liabilities) or hedging obligations or other derivative transactions and any obligation to return collateral posted by counterparties in respect thereto. Under the Indenture, the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date is the principal amount thereof.

Except for Valeant, where our loss is permanent as we have exited that investment, we believe that the other sources of negative performance will reverse to become material contributors over time.We have made four new investments in the last year (we exclude one immaterial commitment which increased in price as we began to build our position), which is a slightly higher than normal pace of investment. Two of these were passive investments that we sold at a profit, Hilton Worldwide Holdings, which we discuss below, and a continued undisclosed investment. We remain an owner of the two active investments, Chipotle and Automatic Data Processing (ADP), which are both in an early stage of investment.At Chipotle, we have achieved an appropriate level of influence over the company as we added two directors along with two mutually agreed upon directors to the board, who now represent a majority of the independent directors of the company. We have an excellent working relationship with management and the board. We believe they are making substantial business progress as we discuss further below, despite an unfortunate recent health incident at one restaurant (unrelated to Chipotle's supply chain).We are now working to achieve an appropriate degree of influence as the largest owner of ADP by the November annual meeting of the company.NEW INVESTMENTAutomatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP)ADP is a classic Pershing Square investment. It is a simple, predictable, free-cash-flow generative business that has underperformed its potential. As a conservatively financed, capital-light business with long-term customer relationships in a sector with substantial positive growth, we believe it has modest downside. If it is able to achieve its potential, we believe it offers substantial upside. We acquired ADP for the funds along with a co-investment vehicle (PSVI) which we recently raised to increase our ownership of the company.We believe that ADP is one of the highest quality businesses we have owned, and one which offers an enormous opportunity for operational improvement. Earlier today, we shared our research and its conclusions on ADP with the investing public on a webcast. We highlighted the sources of underperformance of the company and the opportunities for operational enhancement. You can view the webcast at www.ADPascending.com .It has been five years since the inception of our investment in Canadian Pacific (CP), where we had to wage a proxy contest to obtain board seats in a long-term activist portfolio holding. (While we did run a slate in the Allergan situation in 2014, it was in the context of a hostile takeover which we consider to be a fundamentally different type of situation.) As in CP, we approached ADP and offered to share privately our due diligence and analysis with the board to see if we could work together to unlock value for all shareholders. We requested a one-week extension of the nominating deadline in order to accommodate such a meeting. The board was unwilling to grant an extension, and therefore, we announced our slate on Monday, August 7, 2017 in advance of the deadline. We were disappointed by the company's response, but it is by no means unprecedented. We have learned from experience that often the greatest opportunities for profit exist at companies that are the most resistant to and threatened by change.Our experience in this situation has been analogous to the inception of our investment in CP. As in CP, we were offered the opportunity to meet with the CEO and Chairman. As in CP, we believe the company in its public statements and filings mischaracterized our meetings and conversations with the CEO and Chairman. For a detailed summary of our interactions with the company, please read the "Background to This Solicitation" section of our recent proxy filing which you can find here . Fortunately, it now appears that the board is willing to engage. The ADP board has recently asked to interview our board candidates and offered to meet with us on September 5, 2017. We look forward to the opportunity to share our due diligence and analysis with the full board.PORTFOLIO UPDATEMondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ)On August 2, 2017, Mondelez reported second quarter 2017 results. Underlying organic sales growth was essentially flat excluding the impact of a global cyberattack in late June that disrupted the systems of a number of large corporations including Mondelez. Europe, Mondelez's largest region, delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of underlying volume growth. Many emerging markets, including India, Mexico, and Southeast Asia, grew strongly, while others such as Brazil and the Middle East continued to suffer from challenging macroeconomic conditions that should improve over time. While North America sales declined, we are optimistic that this region will turn to growth in the second half of the year driven by new product launches as well as expected retail shelf space gains in the biscuits category.Operating profit margins expanded in the second quarter to 15.8%, as the company's zero-based budgeting program delivered cost reductions in both overhead and advertising spend. Year-to-date operating profit margins were 16.3%, putting the company well on its way towards management's goal of a mid-16% margin for 2017. Management remains committed to its 2018 operating profit margin target of 17% to 18%, and has stated that it has good visibility to expand margins after 2018.Concurrent with its earnings release, Mondelez announced that Dirk Van de Put, currently the President and CEO of McCain Foods, would succeed Irene Rosenfeld as CEO in November. We have enjoyed our constructive and rewarding relationship with Irene Rosenfeld over the years and wish her well. We look forward to learning more about Dirk Van de Put's strategic vision in the months ahead.With its leading global snack brands, dominant market shares, deep international routes-to-market, meaningful presence in the emerging economies, and significant future cost savings opportunity, Mondelez is one of the few large cap food companies with strong visibility to grow both revenues and earnings for the foreseeable future. With Mondelez's stock trading at approximately 18 times our estimate of 2018 earnings, we believe that the market is significantly discounting the company's earnings growth potential and its strategic appeal in a consolidating industry.Restaurant Brands International Inc. (QSR)Restaurant Brands reported continued earnings growth for the second quarter of 2017. The company delivered strong net unit growth at each of its three brands and significantly improved Popeyes' cost structure in its first full quarter of ownership. Same-store-sales growth was mixed, as Burger King returned to growth and Tim Hortons results modestly declined.Same-store-sales this quarter showed strong growth of nearly 4% at Burger King, with 3% growth in the U.S. as the company struck a better balance between value and premium offerings. Tim Hortons' same-store-sales declined just under 1%, due to weakness in its baked goods offerings and lunch day part. A recent public dispute with a group of franchisees may have also contributed to the decline this quarter. We believe the company is taking the appropriate steps to improve franchisee relationships and expect that the recent introduction of espresso-based drinks and a new mobile app will enhance future sales.Net units grew 6%, the highest rate in several years, reflecting strong growth across all of the brands. The company also announced an agreement with an existing Burger King franchisee to develop Tim Hortons restaurants in Spain, which represents the brand's fourth international development agreement.As a result of same-store-sales and net unit growth, Restaurant Brands' organic revenue grew 6%. The company also continued to reduce costs, most notably at Popeyes, where margins increased by nearly 1,500 basis points. As a result of strong top line growth and cost reduction, Restaurant Brands grew organic EBITDA 9% this quarter. Reported EBITDA grew 6%, due to the headwind from the strengthening U.S. dollar.We sold approximately 25% of our stake in QSR as its strong price appreciation year-to-date, and over the last 12 months, made it a disproportionately large percentage of the portfolio.The Howard Hughes Corporation (HHC)Howard Hughes initiated an effort this year to increase visibility and transparency into its business. HHC started conducting quarterly conference calls and releasing a quarterly supplemental information package, which provides investors and analysts with additional detailed data about its business. HHC conducted its first ever Investor Day on May 17, 2017 at the South Street Seaport in New York City. Pershing Square also presented Howard Hughes at the Sohn Conference on May 8, 2017 in a presentation entitled SimCities . We believe that the increased transparency will showcase the significant underlying value at HHC over time.HHC continues to make steady progress across its three business lines - Operating Assets, Strategic Developments and Master Planned Communities (MPCs). In its Operating Asset portfolio, Howard Hughes has steadily increased its projected stabilized net operating income target to $245 million. In its Strategic Development segment, Howard Hughes sold an additional 65 condo units at Ward Village in Hawaii during the first half of the year, increasing the percentage of total units closed or under contract at its four condo towers to 85%, with three towers at more than 93% sold, and the fourth at 69%. The South Street Seaport is on track to open in New York City in summer 2018. In its MPCs, HHC will likely generate over $100 million in land sales at Summerlin (Las Vegas) for the fifth year in a row. Land sales are increasing in Houston as that market is showing signs of a rebound as crude prices have stabilized.HHC refinanced its existing bonds with a new $800 million bond issuance in a positive net present value transaction, saving 150 basis points in interest and extending the maturity date by 3.5 years. It then subsequently closed on an incremental $200 million bond add-on at a yield-to-worst of less than 5%. HHC now has $660 million of cash on its balance sheet, which will allow it to finance its remaining development projects without the need to raise additional equity capital.David Weinreb, HHC's CEO, sold some of his expiring warrants, exercised warrants to purchase $50 million of common stock and agreed to purchase $50 million in new warrants from the company which he is restricted from selling or hedging for the next five years. Along with a smaller purchase by Grant Herlitz, HHC's President, this is one of the largest investment commitments that we have seen by a management team.During the quarter we net settled our HHC warrants shortly before their expiration according to their terms (the warrants were not exercisable). By doing so we slightly reduced our notional exposure to HHC, disposed of the only Level 3 asset that we owned, and now own only HHC common stock and total return swaps.Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG)Although Chipotle has made significant progress in improving its business and driving a sales recovery since early 2016, the company suffered an unfortunate setback in mid-July in the form of a norovirus incident at a single restaurant in Virginia. Norovirus is a common and highly contagious illness affecting nearly 20 million Americans each year and is unrelated to Chipotle's food supply chain. The incident in Virginia was the result of a failure in one restaurant to comply with the company's procedures used to minimize the risk of a norovirus outbreak. While Chipotle has already implemented a robust and advanced food safety program, the company will continue to build a culture of compliance in its operations through relentless training and enforcement of its policies.Despite this setback, we are pleased that Chipotle has taken a number of significant steps since Pershing Square's initial investment to position the company for long-term success. These steps include (1) the dismantling of the co-CEO structure and the appointment of Steve Ells as sole CEO; (2) a major board refresh that reconstituted half of the current board with new directors, including investment team partner Ali Namvar and Pershing Square advisory board member Matthew Paull; (3) a renewed focus on simplifying operations and delivering an excellent guest experience which has led to improvements in key performance metrics; (4) the strengthening of the leadership team with the additions of a proven restaurant operations executive from Arby's in the newly created role of Chief Restaurant Officer and a seasoned communications executive with over 20 years of public affairs experience at Yum! Brands as the first-ever Chief Communications Officer; and (5) the opening of the Chipotle NEXT Kitchen to explore the operational impact of potential menu innovation.Potential new menu additions in various stages of testing include queso, the single most requested item by guests, frozen margaritas, new salad greens served with an avocado citrus dressing, and buauelos, a crispy cinnamon dessert served with a Chipotle-infused chocolate dipping sauce. On the technology front, the company is on track to launch a new mobile app later this year which will provide substantial improvements to the digital experience for its customers.We made our investment in Chipotle anticipating that the sales recovery would be neither smooth nor predictable, but with a belief that the key drivers of Chipotle's powerful economic moat and long-term success would remain intact. With the steps that the company has taken to improve its business, we continue to believe there is an enormous long-term growth opportunity for Chipotle given: (1) the significant potential to drive sales per restaurant higher through mobile and digital ordering, menu innovation, catering, and improved operations, (2) the opportunity to expand its vastly underpenetrated restaurant base in the U.S., and (3) the considerable potential to build the brand internationally.Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (APD)APD continues to deliver strong results for its shareholders. On July 27, 2017, the company reported that Fiscal Q3 earnings per share grew 15%, driven by 8% revenue growth from increased volumes and 90 basis points of underlying margin expansion. Revenue growth was driven by organic growth and contributions from new plants coming on stream. Margin performance reflects continued operating efficiencies. Management has stated that they "have more work to do on productivity" and that "they continue to see productivity opportunities." Equipment sales, which are more episodic, added to APD's strong performance.While foreign currency headwinds have been a material drag on APD's results in recent years, we expect this dynamic will start to become a modest tailwind assuming that rates stay at current levels. A modest global recovery in industrial activity is another positive factor that we expect will fuel further growth.In addition to the organic growth APD has achieved, the company continues to bring on stream growth capex projects, including large facilities in India and China, which are producing results. Growth capex continues to drive meaningful increases in cash flow despite significantly reduced capex budgets as new projects benefit from the capable underwriting of CEO Seifi Ghasemi and his team.One of the largest catalysts for APD's further value creation remains the use of the company's excess capital. The company currently has approximately $5 billion of investment capital, comprised of cash and leverage capacity. Management expects this amount to grow to $8 billion over the coming three years, as the company generates annual cash flow of approximately $1 billion before growth capex and after dividends. On the recent call, CEO Seifi Ghasemi reiterated that the company will be disciplined in deploying this cash in value-generating projects.We reduced our position in Air Products during the quarter for portfolio management reasons.Platform Specialty Products Corporation (PAH)Platform reported strong earnings this quarter due to continued organic revenue growth and positive results from its ongoing cost savings initiatives. Platform's organic revenue increased 2%, as Performance Solutions grew 6% and Ag Solutions declined 2%. The growth in the Performance Solutions segment was due primarily to the positive results of the electronics business it recently acquired from Alent and strength in its industrial business. The modest decline in Ag Solutions resulted from poor weather conditions in Eastern Europe and the restructuring of its business in Africa. Ag Solutions reported positive growth in all of its key regions outside of Eastern Europe and Africa.Platform's organic EBITDA increased 8% due to strong results in both segments. Performance Solutions organic EBITDA grew 7% due to revenue growth and ongoing cost synergies from the acquisition of Alent, which was somewhat offset by a higher mix of sales from lower margin products. Ag Solutions organic EBITDA grew 9% in spite of the decline in revenue due to increased sales of higher-margin products and continued cost reductions in the business.Platform's overall EBITDA grew 6% due to a 2% headwind from the strengthening U.S. dollar. As a result of interest savings from the company's recent debt refinancing and its leveraged capital structure, EPS grew roughly 25%.Nomad Foods Limited (NOMD)Nomad continues to make significant progress with its "focus on the core" strategy under CEO Stefan Descheemaker. In Q1 2017 Nomad delivered its first quarter of positive top-line growth and the sixth consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in sales trends. For the quarter, like-for-like sales growth was +1.1% despite a ~100 basis points headwind from this year's later Easter timing.Iconic brands and core categories in each of its markets, which management has dubbed Must-Win-Battles (MWBs) are the key drivers of performance. Having grown 5.5% in Q1, MWBs represent 70% of revenue and will continue to drive top-line results for the company. Italy, the UK and Germany, the company's big three markets and the core of the legacy Iglo business, are all now back on solid footing with the new strategy in place. While NOMD will not report Q2 earnings until later this month, the company indicated in its Q1 release that Q2 was off to a good start across the company, and that trends have been sustained at good growth levels that will be further aided in the second quarter by the timing of the Easter holiday.The company raised its guidance for the year. Nomad expects to achieve mid-to-high single digit growth in underlying EBITDA, the result of low single-digit like-for-like revenue growth, continued cost controls and synergies from the Findus acquisition. In addition to the positive operating results, the company completed a favorable debt refinancing that extended its maturities from 2020 to 2024 and will generate (EURO)14mm of annual cash interest savings. The company remains highly cash flow generative, and had (EURO)372mm of cash on its balance sheet at the end of the first quarter.Fannie Mae (FNMA) / Freddie Mac (FMCC)Fannie and Freddie have cost us substantial performance this year as their large share price gains after the November U.S. Presidential election have nearly completely retraced. Both stocks have fallen by approximately 30% year-to-date. They are trading modestly above our average purchase prices of nearly four years ago despite substantial increases in intrinsic value since that time (albeit these increases have been offset by a nearly 100% sweep of the profits of both companies by the U.S. government), and the growing potential for a resolution of their status.Over the last nine years since the financial crisis, the Congressional dialogue around Fannie and Freddie has changed dramatically, and in a manner which we believe is favorable for shareholders. We believe the consensus view in Congress and the White House is that the 30-year prepayable fixed rate mortgage, which is the bedrock of middle-class housing values and affordability, is essential for the economy and the American people, and would not exist without Fannie and Freddie. In addition, there is a growing consensus that the U.S. government must play a role as a catastrophic guarantor for the housing financing system, and that the private sector should pay a market-based fee for that support. As importantly, the government would like the private sector to invest a large amount of capital in a first loss position to protect the government's guarantee from ever being called upon.We believe that there is a growing consensus that the simplest and lowest risk solution to address each of these key considerations is the reform and restructuring of Fannie and Freddie supported by a large capital raise from the private sector and the retained earnings of the two companies. In order for this capital to be raised, the investment proposition for new investors has to be appealing. No new investor will invest in Fannie and Freddie unless historic investors are protected from, and compensated for, the expropriation of profits from the two companies that took place with the cash-flow sweep transaction that has swept more than $270 billion of profits from Fannie and Freddie since the crisis.Wall Street's memory of injecting tens of billions of dollars into Fannie and Freddie just prior to their conservatorship, and the expropriation of both companies' profits forever, just as they began to turn profitable, is still fresh. Completing the largest capital raise in history in a newly restructured Fannie and Freddie will not be achievable unless and until investors in the companies are treated fairly and receive commitments that the extra-legal action of the past will be reversed and not reoccur. We believe this is understood in Washington.We are fortunate that two of the most financially sophisticated Senators in Washington, Senators Corker and Warner, have taken the lead on housing finance reform and have suggested that they will put forth new legislation shortly to address this last remaining restructuring of the financial crisis. We believe that this initiative combined with support from the Treasury Secretary has dramatically increased the chances of a favorable resolution for the country and for investors in Fannie and Freddie, including the government, which is not reflected in their current share prices.Since the government and taxpayers own 79.9% of the common stocks of both companies, the interests of shareholders and the government are largely aligned. Fannie and Freddie offer one of the few potential opportunities for political compromise in the current political environment as a resolution could generate tens of billions of dollars for taxpayers and reduce the risk of future government outlays. For all of the above reasons, we believe that there is likely to be significant positive developments at both companies in the short term which are not reflected in their share prices.Herbalife Ltd. (HLF) ShortOn Monday, August 14, 2017, Chinese media outlets reported that the Chinese government has launched an investigation and crackdown on multi-level marketing and pyramid selling companies. HLF's stock declined 5.25% on the day's news. As we previously noted in our first quarter letter, Herbalife updated its risk-factor disclosures in its first quarter 10Q, adding new language about regulatory risk in China. China is approximately 20% of Herbalife's revenues. A substantial decline or shutdown of HLF's China business would have a material adverse effect on the company.With the implementation of the FTC mandated injunctive relief in late May, the second quarter provided the first opportunity for investors to witness its partial effects on Herbalife's financial performance. While the changes to its U.S. business practices were only in place for a fraction of the second quarter, Q2 results were disappointing to HLF investors and analysts from a top line perspective as volume declined 8% year-over-year. Year-over-year constant currency sales declines in North America (-18%), South & Central America (-9%), Mexico (-1%) and Asia Pacific (-1%) were partially offset by growth in EMEA (+4%) and China (+5%). Note that China benefited in the quarter from the recognition of certain revenue for product which was shipped in Q1 (ahead of a price increase) but was in transit at quarter end; for context, China volume declined 14% year-over-year, a more accurate measure of current trending.We expect the U.S. business to continue to suffer as distributors attempt to comply with the new restrictive elements of the FTC consent order, with the full impact more evident in Q3 and thereafter. The company materially reduced Q3 implied and full year top-line guidance as the business begins to adapt to the significant changes required in its largest market (the U.S.). Other regions of the world remain weak including major markets such as China, South Korea, Brazil, and Mexico. We expect sequential operational deterioration to continue and to weigh further on Herbalife's share price.During the second quarter, HLF stock increased significantly after the company announced a large share buyback despite a reduction in guidance and substantial insider selling. While Herbalife's share price has declined approximately 16% from its June high, it has still appreciated approximately 30% year-to-date. We believe this result is largely due to technical factors and financial engineering, as significant share repurchases, more than 5% of shares outstanding since February, cost deferrals and one-time tax benefits have enabled the company to meet and increase EPS targets despite deteriorating underlying business performance.HLF continues to trade at a high valuation multiple particularly when compared to its actual GAAP earnings. Remarkably, investors appear to have accepted the company's Non-GAAP EPS metric which excludes interest expense on its $1.15 billion substantially out-of-the-money convertible note that is due in 2019. Adding back interest expense to earnings as if it were not an expense is perhaps the most aggressive example we have seen of Non-GAAP earnings addbacks. Herbalife also adds back expenses "related to regulatory inquiries," expenses "related to the FTC settlement implementation," and "expenses related to challenges to the company's business model."We expect continued business deterioration and ongoing regulatory and public relations issues for the company, which should lead to further stock price declines. This is likely to be compounded by Herbalife's aggressive buyback program.EXITED POSITIONHilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT)During the quarter we exited our previously undisclosed passive investment in Hilton Worldwide Holdings at a 32% profit versus our cost over an 11-month holding period. Our approach to disclosure is to provide to you the information that we would want if our positions were reversed; that is, if you were the investment manager and we were the client, with the caveat that we do not disclose information that would create a competitive disadvantage for the funds unless we are legally required to do so. We did not disclose our investment in Hilton until we disposed of it for this reason.Hilton is an asset-light, high-margin, fee-based business that primarily franchises and manages hotel properties under more than a dozen hotel brands, including Hilton, Hampton, DoubleTree, and Hilton Garden Inn. Hilton has organically established (i.e., not through acquisition) an industry-leading global pipeline of franchised hotel rooms, which amounts to nearly 40% of its existing room count and should support a high level of capital-light growth for years into the future. Hilton's extensive and growing network of brands and properties offers a significant and self-reinforcing value proposition to both guests and hotel owners, which creates a strong competitive moat around the business. For guests, Hilton provides a consistent and reliable experience in a variety of destinations at different price points and an attractive loyalty program which features enhanced customer service, amenities, and awards. For hotel owners, Hilton provides access to its more than 60 million loyalty program members, scaled marketing programs, reservation and IT systems, and supply chain purchasing power.Prior to our investment in the summer of 2016, the company announced it would spin off its owned hotel and timeshare businesses, which we believed would highlight the significant value of its remaining franchised and management business. We have long admired Hilton's business and had followed its progress since the IPO at the end of 2013. Despite strong business performance since the IPO, which included 15% unit growth, more than 30% EBITDA growth, and more than 70% free cash flow per share growth, Hilton's share price had increased by a total of only about 10%. We believed that two key investor concerns were weighing on the share price: a potential downturn in the lodging cycle and the potential competitive threat from Airbnb.To determine the risk of a downturn in the lodging cycle, we undertook an extensive analysis of the previous cycles over the past thirty years. We observed that in the three prior downturns (1991, 2001-2002, and 2008-2009), RevPAR (a measure of same-store sales for the lodging industry) averaged positive annual growth over the five-year period starting just prior to the downturn. While we recognized that it was possible that RevPAR might decline for a period of time, we believed it likely that RevPAR would average positive growth over a three-to-five year time horizon. Moreover, we believed the capital-light unit growth embedded in Hilton's hotel pipeline would more than offset a potential decline in RevPAR and allow for continued annual revenue and EBITDA growth.To understand the potential competitive risk regarding Airbnb, we reviewed the publicly available data and research on the company and we interviewed dozens of hotel owners, travel agents, lodging industry consultants, and employees of Airbnb and other vacation-rental competitors. We concluded that Hilton's business model was unlikely to face a meaningful threat from Airbnb as the two businesses tend to compete for different customer sets. The vast majority of Hilton's revenue derives from short-stay business travelers who value the consistent experience, amenities, and loyalty program that Hilton's brands provide, whereas the typical Airbnb customer is a leisure traveler who seeks out unique and local accommodations for a lengthier stay. Furthermore, a large portion of Hilton's portfolio is based in suburban markets where there is currently limited Airbnb inventory.In the beginning of 2017, Hilton spun off its owned hotel and timeshare businesses. After the spin, Hilton's share price began a steady upward ascent as the company continued to report strong business performance and initiated a meaningful share repurchase program. We recently exited our position to allocate capital to other opportunities and achieved a 32% total return on our investment in less than a year. Hilton did not make a more meaningful impact on overall Company performance because its rapid rise at the time of our investment limited the position size to ~5% of the portfolio.Hilton embodied many of the characteristics that we have identified in other successful investments: a high-quality business with a significant opportunity for capital-light growth, a best-in-class management team, sponsorship from a well-regarded sponsor (Blackstone), and a built-in catalyst, the spinoffs, to unlock shareholder value. While we generally prefer to allocate our capital to activist situations, if we can find a high quality business run by a highly capable management team, and there is appropriate shareholder oversight in the boardroom, we are open to passive investments.Sincerely,William A.

Positions with performance attributions of at least 50 basis points are listed above separately, while positions with performance attributions of 50 basis points or less are aggregated.5 Each position that has been publicly disclosed and was in the Company's portfolio during 2017 is shown separately. Positions that were not publicly disclosed during 2017 are aggregated under "All Other Positions". In the event that a position was held for only a portion of 2017, total shareholder return is calculated only with respect to that period of time. On 1/1/17, the Company owned Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. ("Hilton"). On 1/4/17, Hilton spun off two other companies: Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. ("Park Hotels") and Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. ("Grand Vacations"). The Company sold out of Park Hotels and Grand Vacations as of 1/5/17. Total shareholder return for Hilton includes the returns of Park Hotels and Grand Vacations through 7/27/17, the date which the Company disposed of Hilton.6 Total shareholder return is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not an indication of actual returns to the Company over the periods presented or future returns of the Company. Additionally, it should not be assumed that any of these returns indicate that the investment recommendations or decisions that PSCM makes in the future will be profitable or will generate values equal to those of the companies discussed herein. Total shareholder return takes into account the issuer's dividends, if any.The attributions (and gross portfolio returns) presented herein are based on gross returns which do not reflect deduction of certain fees or expenses charged to the Company, including, without limitation, management fees and accrued performance fee (if any). Inclusion of such fees and expenses would produce lower returns than presented here.In addition, at times, PSCM may engage in hedging transactions to seek to reduce risk in the portfolio, including investment specific hedges that do not relate to the underlying securities of an issuer in which the Company is invested. The gross returns reflected herein (i) include only returns on the investment in the underlying issuer and the hedge positions that directly relate to the securities that reference the underlying issuer (e.g., if the Company was long Issuer A stock and also purchased puts on Issuer A stock, the gross return reflects the profit/loss on the stock and the profit/loss on the put); (ii) do not reflect the cost/benefit of hedges that do not relate to the securities that reference the underlying issuer (e.g., if the Company was long Issuer A stock and short Issuer B stock, the profit/loss on the Issuer B stock is not included in the gross returns attributable to the investment in Issuer A); and (iii) do not reflect the cost/benefit of portfolio hedges. Performance with respect to currency hedging related to a specific issuer is included in the overall performance attribution of such issuer. All other currency positions are aggregated.The performance attributions to the gross returns provided herein are for illustrative purposes only. The securities on these lists may not have been held by the Company for the entire period. All investments involve risk including the loss of principal. It should not be assumed that investments made in the future will be profitable or will equal the performance of the securities on these lists. It should not be assumed that investments made in the future will be profitable. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Please refer to the net performance figures presented on page 4.Limitations of Performance DataPast performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. All investments involve risk including the loss of principal.

This report contains information and analyses relating to all publicly disclosed positions above 50 basis points in the Company's portfolio during 2017. PSCM may currently or in the future buy, sell, cover or otherwise change the form of its investment in the companies discussed in this report for any reason.

We have read the other information contained in the interim financial report and considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the condensed set of financial statements.This report is made solely to the Company in accordance with guidance contained in International Standard on Review Engagements 2410 (UK and Ireland) "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Auditing Practices Board. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company, for our work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have formed.DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITYThe interim financial report is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the Directors. The Directors are responsible for preparing the interim financial report in accordance with International Accounting Standards 34, "Interim Financial Reporting" and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority.As disclosed in Note 2, the annual financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB"). The condensed set of financial statements included in this interim financial report has been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards 34, "Interim Financial Reporting".OUR RESPONSIBILITYOur responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the condensed set of financial statements in the interim financial report based on our review.SCOPE OF REVIEWWe conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Auditing Practices Board for use in the United Kingdom. A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.CONCLUSIONBased on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed set of financial statements in the interim financial report for the six months ended June 30, 2017 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority./s/ Ernst & Young LLPErnst & Young LLPGuernseyAugust 17, 2017Condensed Interim Statement of Financial Position(Stated in United States Dollars)NotesJune 30, 2017UnauditedDecember 31, 2016AuditedAssetsCash and cash equivalents$1,695,924,045$2,076,161,696Due from brokers755,840,166542,850,061Trade and other receivables12,077,57111,740,284Financial assets at fair value through profit or lossInvestments in securities43,003,754,9882,636,767,173Derivative financial instruments4974,085,2071,022,162,881Total assets$6,441,681,977$6,289,682,095LiabilitiesDue to brokers$392,686,374$150,995,192Trade and other payables34,811,13832,313,479Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or lossSecurities sold, not yet purchased4581,226,129385,314,274Derivative financial instruments421,157,838190,734,223Bonds101,014,441,1811,013,552,905Liabilities excluding net assets attributable to management shareholders2,044,322,6601,772,910,073Net assets attributable to management shareholders6158,557,464161,137,460Total liabilities2,202,880,1241,934,047,533EquityShare capital65,987,024,6206,003,372,824Accumulated deficit(1,748,222,767)(1,647,738,262)Total equity(1)4,238,801,8534,355,634,562Total liabilities and equity$6,441,681,977$6,289,682,095Net assets attributable to Public Shares$4,238,689,052$4,355,519,077Public Shares in issue239,086,229240,128,546Net assets per Public Share$17.73$18.14Net assets attributable to Management Shares$158,557,464$161,137,460Management Shares in issue8,500,7968,500,796Net assets per Management Share$18.65$18.96Net assets attributable to Special Voting Share$112,801N/ASpecial Voting Share in issue1N/ANet assets per Special Voting Share$112,801.25N/ANet assets attributable to Class B SharesN/A$115,485Class B Shares in issueN/A5,000,000,000Net assets per Class B ShareN/A$0.00002(1) Total equity of the Company is comprised of the aggregate net asset values of all Public Shares and the Special Voting Share as of June 30, 2017 and Public Shares and Class B Shares as of December 31, 2016.

CORPORATE INFORMATIONOrganizationThe Company was incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Bailiwick of Guernsey on February 2, 2012. It became a registered open-ended investment scheme, under the Protection of Investors (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 1987 and the Registered Collective Investment Scheme Rules 2008 (issued by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission, the "GFSC"), on June 27, 2012, and commenced operations on December 31, 2012.On October 2, 2014, the GFSC approved the conversion of the Company into a registered closed-ended investment scheme under the Protection of Investors Law and the 2008 Rules.The Company's registered office is at 1st Floor, Royal Chambers, St Julian's Avenue, St Peter Port, Guernsey, Channel Islands.The latest traded price of the Public Shares is available on Reuters, Bloomberg, Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange.A copy of the Prospectus of the Company is available from the Company's registered office and on the Company's website ( www.pershingsquareholdings.com ).Investment ObjectiveThe Company's investment objective is to preserve capital and to seek maximum, long-term capital appreciation commensurate with reasonable risk. The Company seeks to achieve its investment objective through long and short positions in equity or debt securities of U.S. and non-U.S. issuers (including securities convertible into equity or debt securities), derivative instruments and any other financial instruments that the Investment Manager believes will achieve the Company's investment objective.Investment ManagerThe Company has appointed PSCM as its investment manager pursuant to an agreement between the Company and PSCM. The Investment Manager has responsibility, subject to the overall supervision of the Board of Directors, for the investment of the Company's assets in accordance with the strategy set forth in the Prospectus. The Company delegates certain administrative functions relating to the management of the Company to PSCM. William A. Ackman is the managing member of PS Management GP, LLC, the general partner of PSCM.Board of DirectorsThe Chairman of the Board is Anne Farlow. The other independent, non-executive Directors are Richard Battey, Jonathan Kestenbaum and William Scott. Nicholas Botta, the President and a partner of the Investment Manager, is also a non-executive Director.Audit CommitteeThe Company has an audit committee (the "Audit Committee") that is comprised of Ms Farlow and Messrs Battey, Kestenbaum and Scott. Mr Battey was appointed as Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee's responsibilities may include, but are not limited to, the appointment of external auditors, discussion and agreement with the external auditors as to the nature and scope of the audit, review of the scope, results and cost effectiveness of the audit and the independence and objectivity of the external auditor, review of the external auditors' letter of engagement and management letter and review of the key procedures adopted by the Company's service providers. The Audit Committee reports regularly and makes such recommendations as it deems appropriate to the Board on any matter within its remit.Prime BrokersPursuant to prime broker agreements, Goldman Sachs & Co. and UBS Securities LLC (the "Prime Brokers") both serve as custodians and primary clearing brokers for the Company.Administrator and Sub-AdministratorPursuant to an administration and sub-administration agreement dated April 2, 2012, Elysium Fund Management Limited (the "Administrator") and Morgan Stanley Fund Services (Bermuda) Ltd. (the "Sub-Administrator") have been appointed as administrator and sub-administrator, respectively, to the Company. The Administrator provides certain administrative and accounting services including the maintenance of the Company's accounting and statutory records.The Administrator delegates certain of these services to the Sub-Administrator. The Administrator and Sub-Administrator receive customary fees, plus out of pocket expenses, based on the nature and extent of services provided.London Stock Exchange ListingOn May 2, 2017, the Company announced that its Public Shares had been admitted to the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and had commenced trading on the Premium Segment of the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange. As a result, shareholders are able to trade Public Shares on both Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange with shares quoted and traded in USD in Amsterdam and Sterling in London. In connection with the listing, at the annual general meeting held on April 25, 2017, the shareholders of the Company amended the Articles of Incorporation and authorized, among other things, the exchange of the 5,000,000,000 Class B Shares held by VoteCo (as defined below) for a Special Voting Share (as defined below) and the amendment of the Company's investment policy to add the following investment restrictions: (i) no more than 10%, in aggregate, of the Company's total assets can be invested in other UK-listed closed-ended investment funds, unless such other closed-ended investment funds themselves have published investment policies to invest no more than 15% of their total assets in other UK-listed closed-ended investment funds and (ii) investments in (or exposure to), the securities of any one issuer may not, in the aggregate, represent more than 25% of the Company's gross assets, measured at the time of making the investment.2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESBasis of PreparationThe condensed interim financial statements of the Company for the six months ended June 30, 2017 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting.The accounting principles used to prepare these unaudited condensed interim financial statements comply with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") and are consistent with those set out in the notes to the annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016. The condensed interim financial statements have been prepared on a historical-cost basis, except for financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss that have been measured at fair value. The unaudited condensed interim financial statements do not include all of the information and disclosures required for full annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016.After making reasonable inquiries and assessing all data relating to the Company's liquidity, particularly its holding of cash and Level 1 assets, the Investment Manager and the Directors believe that the Company is well placed to manage its business risks, has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and do not consider there to be any threat to the going concern status of the Company. For these reasons, they have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the annual and condensed interim financial statements.Net Assets Attributable to Management ShareholdersNon-redeemable Management Shares can be converted into a variable number of Public Shares based upon the net asset values as of the last day of each calendar month and are therefore classified as financial liabilities in accordance with IFRS. At no time can non-redeemable Management Shares be redeemed in cash at the option of the management shareholders. Net assets attributable to Management Shares are accounted for on an amortized cost basis at the net asset value calculated in accordance with IFRS. The change in the net assets attributable to Management Shares, other than that arising from share issuances or conversions, is recognized in the condensed interim statement of comprehensive income.3. NEW STANDARDS, INTERPRETATIONS AND AMENDMENTSThe following relevant standards, which have been issued by the IASB, have an effective date after the date of these condensed interim financial statements:InternationalAccountingStandards(IAS/IFRS)DescriptionEffective DateIFRS 9Financial InstrumentsJanuary 1, 2018IFRS 15Revenue from Contracts with CustomersJanuary 1, 2018In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9, Financial Instruments that replaces IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9. IFRS 9 brings together all three aspects of the accounting for financial instruments: classification and measurement, impairment and hedge accounting. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Except for hedge accounting, retrospective application is required but providing comparative information is not compulsory. For hedge accounting, the requirements are generally applied prospectively, with some limited exceptions.The Directors have chosen not to early adopt the above standards and amendments and will adopt them on the required effective date. The Company has performed a high-level impact assessment of all three aspects of IFRS 9. This preliminary assessment is based on currently available information and may be subject to changes arising from further detailed analysis or additional information made available to the Company in the future. Overall, the Company expects no significant impact on its statement of financial position and equity, and will perform a more detailed reassessment at the end of 2017.i) Classification and measurementThe Company does not expect a significant impact on its statement of financial position or equity on applying the classification and measurement requirements of IFRS 9. The Company measures all financial assets and liabilities at fair value which are currently held at fair value and expects to continue with this treatment.ii) ImpairmentIFRS 9 requires the Company to record expected credit losses on all of its debt securities, loans and trade receivables, either on a 12-month or lifetime basis. The Company expects to apply the simplified approach and record lifetime expected losses on all investment income and other receivables. Given that investment income and other receivables have not been impaired to date, the Company does not expect there to be a significant impact on its equity from reviewing the expected credit losses on investment income and other receivables over their lifetimes, but it will need to perform a more detailed analysis which considers all reasonable and supportable information, including forward-looking elements to determine the extent of the impact.iii) Hedge accountingThe Company does not currently designate any hedges as effective hedging relationships which qualify for hedge accounting. Therefore, the Company does not expect there to be any impact with respect to hedge accounting on the Company as a result of applying IFRS 9.The Company has assessed the impact under IFRS 15 and determined that it will not have an effect on the Company's financial statements as the Company does not have any contracts with customers which meet the definition under IFRS 15.4.

FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIESFair Value HierarchyIFRS 13 requires disclosures relating to fair value measurements using a three-level fair value hierarchy. The level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Assessing the significance of a particular input requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. Financial instruments are recognized at fair value and categorized in the following table based on:Level 1- Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets at the measurement date. The assets and liabilities in this category will generally include equities listed in active markets, treasuries (on the run) and listed options.Level 2- Inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) are obtained directly or indirectly from observable market data at the measurement date. The assets and liabilities in this category will generally include fixed income securities, OTC options, total return swaps, credit default swaps, foreign currency forward contracts and certain other derivatives. Also, included in this category are the Company's investments in affiliated entities valued at the net asset value, which can be redeemed by the Company as of the measurement date, or within 90 days of the measurement date.Level 3- Inputs, including significant unobservable inputs, reflect the Company's best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the assets and liabilities at the measurement date. The assets and liabilities in this category will generally include private investments and certain other derivatives.Recurring Fair Value Measurement of Assets and LiabilitiesJune 30, 2017December 31, 2016Level 1Level 2Level 3TotalLevel 1Level 2Level 3Total$000$000$000$000$000$000$000$000Financial Assets:Equity Securities (Designated at Fair Value):Common Stock$2,996,549$-$-$2,996,549$2,626,270$-$-$2,626,270Preferred Stock7,002204-7,20610,253244-10,497Derivative Contracts (Held for Trading):Currency Call/Put Options Purchased-5(1)-5-12,303(1)-12,303Equity Forwards-509(1)-509----Equity Options Purchased-945,769(1)-945,769-819,636(1)-819,636Foreign Currency Forward Contracts-----5,329(1)-5,329Total Return Swaps-27,802(2)-27,802-140,235(2)-140,235Warrants------44,660(3)44,660Total$3,003,551$974,289$-$3,977,840$2,636,523$977,747$44,660$3,658,930June 30, 2017December 31, 2016Level 1Level 2Level 3TotalLevel 1Level 2Level 3Total$000$000$000$000$000$000$000$000Financial Liabilities:Debt Securities (Held for Trading):Convertible Bonds$-$30,983$-$30,983$-$27,154$-$ 27,154Equity Securities (Held for Trading):Common Stock550,243--550,243358,160--358,160Derivative Contracts (Held for Trading):Equity Forwards-25(1)-25----Equity Options Written-----190,734(1)-190,734Foreign Currency Forward Contracts-13,407(1)-13,407----Total Return Swaps-7,726(2)-7,726----Net assets attributable to management shareholders--158,557(4)158,557--161,137(4)161,137Total$550,243$52,141$158,557$760,941$358,160$217,888$161,137$ 737,185(1) Level 2 securities include OTC currency call/put options and equity options, equity forwards, foreign currency forward contracts and credit default swap contracts that are fair valued by the Investment Manager using prices received from an independent third-party valuation agent. The fair values of these securities may consider, but are not limited to, the following inputs by the independent third-party valuation agent: current market and contractual prices from market makers or dealers, market standard pricing models that consider the time value of money, volatilities of the underlying financial instruments and/or current foreign exchange forward and spot rates. The independent third-party valuation agent uses widely recognized valuation models for determining fair values of OTC derivatives. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing, option models and swap models, using present value calculations. The significant inputs into their valuation models are market observable and are included within Level 2.(2) Level 2 securities include total return swap contracts that are fair valued by the Investment Manager using market observable inputs. The fair values of these securities may consider, but are not limited to, the following inputs: market price of the underlying security, notional amount, expiration date, fixed and floating interest rates, payment schedules and/or dividends declared.(3) Level 3 investments include warrants that are fair valued by the Investment Manager using prices obtained from an independent third-party valuation agent. The independent third-party valuation agent utilizes proprietary models to determine fair value. The valuation agent's modeling may consider, but is not limited to, the following inputs: amount and timing of cash flows, current and projected financial performance, volatility of the underlying securities' stock price, dividend yields and/or interest rates. The valuation committee of the Investment Manager considers the appropriateness of the valuation methods and inputs, and may request that alternative valuation methods be applied to support the valuation arising from the method discussed. Any material changes in valuation methods are discussed and agreed with the Board of Directors.(4) Net assets attributable to management shareholders are classified as Level 3 and are valued based on their net asset value. In assessing the appropriateness of net asset value as a basis for fair value, consideration is given to the need for adjustments to that net asset value based on a variety of factors including liquidity and the timeliness and availability of accurate financial information. No such adjustments were deemed necessary. The movements for the period are disclosed in the condensed interim statement of changes in net assets attributable to management shareholders.The Company's cash and cash equivalents and short-term receivables and payables are recorded at carrying value which approximates fair value. The Bonds are classified as Level 1 financial liabilities and the carrying value of the Bonds is discussed further in Note 10.Some of the Company's investments in Level 1 securities represent a significant proportion of the Company's portfolio. If such investments were sold or covered in their entirety, it might not be possible to sell them at the quoted market price which IFRS requires to be used in determining their fair value. Many factors affect the price that could be realized for large investments. The Investment Manager believes that it is difficult to accurately estimate the potential discount or premium to the quoted market prices that the Company would receive or realize if investments that represent a significant proportion of the Company's portfolio were sold or covered.Transfers Between LevelsTransfers between levels during the period are determined and deemed to have occurred at each financial statement reporting date. There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and one transfer out of Level 3 (as discussed below) fair value measurements of material significance since the last financial statement reporting date.Level 3 ReconciliationThe following table summarizes the change in the carrying amounts associated with Level 3 investments for the period ended June 30, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016.WarrantsBalance at December 31, 2015$45,561,789Total gains and losses in profit or loss(901,521)Balance at December 31, 2016$44,660,268Transfers*(49,193,147)Total gains and losses in profit or loss4,532,879Balance at June 30, 2017$-Total unrealized gains and losses for the year included in profit or loss for assets held at December 31, 2016$(901,521)Total unrealized gains and losses for the period included in profit or loss for assets held at June 30, 2017$-* During the period ended June 30, 2017, the transfer from Level 3 to Level 1 related to the cashless conversion of the warrants to common stock shares of The Howard Hughes Corporation.All gains and losses from Level 3 securities during the period/year are recognized in the net gain/(loss) on financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss in the condensed interim statement of comprehensive income.6. SHARE CAPITALAuthorized and Issued CapitalThe Board of the Company is authorized to issue an unlimited number of shares that are already in existence, and such other shares, classes of shares or series as determined by the Board. All of the Company's share classes participate pro rata in the profits and losses of the Company based upon the share class's ownership of the Company at the time of such allocation.The Company currently has outstanding the Special Voting Share, the Public Shares and the Management Shares.In connection with the listing of the Public Shares on the London Stock Exchange, the Company exchanged for a Special Voting Share its Class B Shares held by PS Holdings Independent Voting Company Limited ("VoteCo") which was established as a limited liability company with the sole objective to vote in the best interest of the Company's shareholders as a whole. The Special Voting Share at all times carries 50.1% of the aggregate voting power in the Company. The Investment Manager has no affiliation with VoteCo. VoteCo is wholly owned by a trust established for the benefit of one or more charitable organizations.The Investment Manager waived the management fee and/or the performance fee with respect to shares issued to certain shareholders, including the Investment Manager itself and certain members, partners, officers, managers, employees or affiliates of the Investment Manager or certain other shareholders. Such persons hold Management Shares.Lock-upMr. Ackman and other members of the management team and officers of the Investment Manager have each agreed with the Company to a lock-up of ten years commencing from October 1, 2014, of their aggregate Management Shares, less amounts (i) attributable to any sales required to pay taxes on income generated by the Company; (ii) required to be sold due to regulatory constraints, including, without limitation, sales required due to ownership limits; or (iii) attributable to sales following separation of employment from the Investment Manager. Under the terms of the lock-up arrangement, shares subject to lock up may from time to time be transferred to affiliates, provided that the transferee agrees to be subject to the remaining lock-up period.As of June 30, 2017, total Management Shares outstanding were 8,500,796 with a value of $158,557,464 (December 31, 2016: $161,137,460).Share ConversionSubject to the terms of the lock-up agreements, holders of Management Shares will be entitled to convert into Public Shares at the current NAV as of the last day of each calendar month upon such days' prior written notice to the Company as the Board may determine.Voting RightsThe holders of Public Shares have the right to receive notice of, attend and vote at general meetings of the Company.Each Public Share and Management Share carries such voting power so that the aggregate issued number of Public Shares and Management Shares carries 49.9% of the total voting power of the aggregate number of voting shares in issue. Each Public Share carries one vote and each Management Share carries such voting power so that the total voting power of the Public Shares and Management Shares are pro-rated in accordance with their respective net asset values. The Special Voting Share carries 50.1% of the aggregate voting power in the Company.DistributionsThe Board may at any time declare and pay dividends (or interim dividends) based upon the financial position of the Company. No dividends shall be paid in excess of the amounts permitted by the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008 and without the prior consent of the Board and the Investment Manager. No dividends have been declared or paid for the periods ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016.The Public Shares, Management Shares and Class B Shares / Special Voting Share transactions for the six month period ended June 30, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016 were as follows:ManagementSharesPublic SharesClass B SharesSpecial Voting ShareShares as of December 31, 20168,500,796240,128,5465,000,000,000-Issuance of Shares----Shares Repurchased-(1,042,317)--Conversion Out--(5,000,000,000)-Conversion In---1Shares as of June 30, 20178,500,796239,086,229-1ManagementSharesPublic SharesClass B SharesShares as of December 31, 20158,500,796240,128,5465,000,000,000Issuance of Shares---Shares as of December 31, 20168,500,796240,128,5465,000,000,000Capital ManagementThe Company's capital currently consists of Public Shares which are listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange, non-redeemable Management Shares which can be converted into Public Shares, and the Special Voting Share (as more fully described on page 25). The proceeds from the Bonds which were issued on June 26, 2015 and are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange are being used to make investments in accordance with the Company's investment policy (as more fully described in Note 10).The Company's general objectives for managing capital are:• To continue as a going concern;• To maximize its total return primarily through the capital appreciation of its investments; and• To minimize the risk of an overall permanent loss of capital.To the extent the Investment Manager deems it advisable and provided that there is no legal, tax or regulatory constraints, the Company is authorized to manage its capital through various methods, including, but not limited to: (i) repurchases of Public Shares and (ii) further issuances of shares, provided that the Board only intends to exercise its authority to issue new shares if such shares are issued at a value not less than the estimated prevailing NAV per share (or under certain other specified circumstances). On April 25, 2017, the Company held its annual general meeting at which shareholders authorized the Company to engage in share buybacks in an effort to assist in narrowing the discount to NAV at which the Public Shares traded. On May 2, 2017, the Company commenced its share buyback program whereby its buyback agent, Jefferies International Limited ("Jefferies"), began to repurchase Public Shares subject to certain limitation. Any repurchased Public Shares are subsequently retired.Also, as discussed on page 26, the Investment Manager has also imposed a ten-year lock-up on certain holders of Management Shares, subject to certain exceptions, though this lock-up and conversion do not affect the capital resources available to the Company.7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESPSH, PSCM, PS Fund 1, LLC and other related parties (the "Pershing Square Parties") and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. and other related parties (the "Valeant Parties") are defendants in a class action lawsuit entitled In Re Allergan, Inc. Proxy Violation Securities Litigation, Case No. 8:14-cv-2001- DOC, pending in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, relating to their investment in Allergan, Inc. ("Allergan"). The court file in the case is available to the public. Plaintiffs allege the defendants violated federal securities laws in their trading in Allergan common shares and related derivatives. The defendants believe they have meritorious defenses to plaintiffs' claims. Under the court's schedule, a trial, if needed, would not commence until January 30, 2018. In consultation with counsel, a $75 million reserve was taken at December 31, 2016 for the potential settlement of the class action lawsuit and allocated proportionately across the Company and the three affiliated entities managed by the Investment Manager, based on their adjusted net asset values. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company was allocated $29,176,480 for this reserve which is included in trade and other payables in the condensed interim statement of financial position.On February 10, 2017, the Pershing Square Parties and the Valeant Parties entered into a Litigation Management Agreement (the "Litigation Agreement"). The Litigation Agreement, which expires on November 1, 2017, provides that in the event of a settlement, the Pershing Square Parties will bear 40% and the Valeant Parties will bear 60% of any mutually agreed upon settlement amount. The Litigation Agreement further provides that in the event of a settlement, the Pershing Square Parties will release specified claims they may have against the Valeant Parties relating to their investment in Valeant securities. The Litigation Agreement was filed as an exhibit to a Schedule 13D on February 10, 2017 and is available to the public.The defendants and plaintiffs each filed motions for summary judgment on July 10, 2017, arguing that the case can be resolved in their respective favors based on the undisputed factual record. The motions are scheduled to be heard in September.The class of plaintiffs in the pending suit is defined to be only those who traded in Allergan common shares during the class period of February 25 to April 21, 2014. On June 28, 2017, another class action complaint was filed on behalf of parties who, during the class period, traded in derivatives related to Allergan common shares. At a court conference on July 25, 2017, the Court set a schedule for the new class action, culminating in a trial date of October 2, 2018.Recent events in the case, and the filing of the additional class action complaint, have not changed our view as to the likely outcome of these matters and do not, in our view, in consultation with counsel, require any adjustment to the reserve taken at year end 2016.Other than above and as noted in the annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, there were no other commitments or contingencies as of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.8. INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND PERFORMANCE FEESThe Investment Manager receives management fees and performance fees from the Company pursuant to an IMA.The IMA was amended and restated as of December 1, 2016 to clarify the language describing the formulation of the performance fee and to eliminate the accretion of 4.25% annually in the computation of the Potential Offset Amount (referred to as the "offset amount" in the IMA prior to December 1, 2016) (the "Accretion"). The elimination of the Accretion was favorable to shareholders and resulted in a reduction of the Potential Offset Amount equal to $9.5 million as of December 1, 2016. Except for the elimination of the Accretion, these amendments to the IMA do not change the amount of the performance fee that may be payable from time to time to the Investment Manager.Management FeeThe Investment Manager receives a quarterly management fee payable in advance each quarter in an amount equal to 0.375% (1.5% per annum) of the net assets (before any accrued performance fee) attributable to fee-paying shares. The fee-paying shares of the Company are the Public Shares and the Special Voting Share.Performance FeeGenerally, the Investment Manager receives an annual performance fee in an amount equal to 16% of the net profits attributable to the fee-paying shares of the Company (the "16% performance fee") minus the Additional Reduction (defined below). Such annual performance fee is defined as the "Variable Performance Fee" in the IMA. The Variable Performance Fee cannot be higher than the 16% performance fee, but it may, as a result of the Additional Reduction, be lower (although it can never be a negative amount).The "Additional Reduction" is an amount equal to (i) the lesser of the 16% performance fee and the Potential Reduction Amount (defined below), offset (up to such lesser amount) by (ii) the then current portion of the Potential Offset Amount.The "Potential Reduction Amount" is equal to (i) 20% of the aggregate performance fees and allocation earned by the Investment Manager and its affiliates in respect of the same calculation period on the gains of current and certain future funds managed by the Investment Manager or any of its affiliates plus (ii) if the Potential Reduction Amount for the previous calculation period exceeded the 16% performance fee, the excess amount (which is in effect carried forward).The "Potential Offset Amount" refers to the fees and other costs of the offering and admission on Euronext Amsterdam of the Public Shares and the commissions paid to placement agents and other formation and offering expenses incurred prior to the IPO of the Company that were, in each case, borne by the Investment Manager pursuant to the IMA. The Potential Offset Amount will be reduced by each dollar applied to reduce the Additional Reduction, until it is fully reduced to zero.The Potential Offset Amount equaled $120 million in the aggregate at the time of the IPO. As of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, after giving effect to the offset of the Potential Reduction Amount in the year ended December 31, 2014 and the amendments to the IMA removing the Accretion described above, the Potential Offset Amount was approximately $100.8 million.The Potential Offset Amount is not a Company obligation but instead is a component used in the calculation of the Variable Performance Fee. Thus, if the Company or the Investment Manager terminates the IMA or the Company liquidates and the Company pays the Variable Performance Fee that may crystallize in connection therewith, the Company has no obligation to pay any remaining portion of the Potential Offset Amount.The Company had no net profits and thus no performance fee accrued for the period ended June 30, 2017 and year ended 2016. The aggregate Potential Reduction Amount at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $2.9 million, which will be carried forward to reduce any performance fee in future years, subject to any offset by the Potential Offset Amount.For the six month period ended June 30, 2017, the Investment Manager earned $32,214,384 of management fees and no performance fee. For the six month period ended June 30, 2016, the Investment Manager earned $32,918,265 of management fees and no performance fee. The shareholders of Public Shares will not incur performance fees until the Public Shares exceed a high water mark of $26.37 per share.9. RELATED PARTY DISCLOSURESThe relationship between the Company and the Investment Manager and the fees earned are disclosed in Note 8. In addition, the Investment Manager and related parties to the Investment Manager hold Management Shares, the rights of which are disclosed in Note 6.The Investment Manager may seek to effect rebalancing transactions from time to time pursuant to policies that are intended to result in the Company and the affiliated entities managed by the Investment Manager generally holding investment positions on a proportionate basis relating to their respective adjusted net asset values, which are equal to each of the entities' net asset values plus any accrued (but not crystallized) performance fees, any deferred compensation payable to the Investment Manager to the extent such deferred compensation is determined by reference to the performance of such entity, and the net proceeds of any outstanding long-term debt, including the current portion thereof (which in the case of the Company, includes the net proceeds from the bond offering as further discussed below in Note 10). Rebalancing transactions involve either the Company purchasing securities or other financial instruments held by one or more affiliated entities or selling securities or other financial instruments to one or more affiliated entities. These transactions are subject to a number of considerations including, but not limited to, cash balances and liquidity needs, tax, regulatory, risk and other considerations, which may preclude these transactions from occurring or limit their scope at the time of the transactions.In the normal course of business, the Company and its affiliates make concentrated investments in portfolio companies where the aggregate beneficial holdings of the Company and its affiliates may be in excess of 10% of one or more portfolio companies' classes of outstanding securities. At such ownership levels, a variety of securities laws may, under certain circumstances, restrict or otherwise limit the timing, manner and volume of disposition of such securities. In addition, with respect to such securities, the Company and its affiliates may have disclosures or other public reporting obligations with respect to acquisitions and/or dispositions of such securities.At June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company and its affiliates had beneficial ownership in excess of 10% of the outstanding common equity securities of Nomad Foods Limited, Platform Specialty Products Corporation, Restaurant Brands International Inc. and The Howard Hughes Corporation. William A. Ackman is the chairman of the board of The Howard Hughes Corporation. Ryan Israel, a member of PSCM's investment team, is a board member of Platform Specialty Products Corporation. Brian Welch, a member of PSCM's investment team, is a board member of Nomad Foods Limited. Ali Namvar, a member of PSCM's investment team, is a board member of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Stephen Fraidin, vice chairman of PSCM, and William A. Ackman joined the board of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. effective March 9, 2016 and March 21, 2016, respectively; neither stood for re-election and both no longer served as board members effective as of May 2, 2017.For the six month period ended June 30, 2017, the independent Directors' fees in relation to their services for the Company were $146,185 of which $74,422 were payable as of June 30, 2017. For the six month period ended June 30, 2016, the independent Directors' fees in relation to their services for the Company were $163,768 of which $76,564 were payable as of June 30, 2016.10.

Technological change and geopolitical risk dominate top predictions for 2018; Europe will be in the spotlight: The prospects for a hard Brexit will increase, even as Macron and Merkel will be impeded from making substantial progress on EU reformsPR NewswireDecember 5, 2017 Tuesday 10:00 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1149 wordsDateline: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5, 2017 Body Global scrutiny of US Internet giants such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Amazon will reach a fever pitch in 2018, resulting in new government regulation according toYear-Ahead Predictions 2018from A.T. Kearney'sGlobal Business Policy Council. The dramatic power that these companies have amassed is only now beginning to be understood around the world, thanks in part to revelations about Russia's interference in foreign elections. As policymakers take action in 2018 to curb that power, there will be clashes between governments and technology companies over regulation and taxation. To read the second annual Year-Ahead Predictions report, visithttp://www.atkearney.com/YAP2018Also in the spotlight in 2018 will be the future of the EU. The EU will continue to rise in importance on the global stage as the United States persists in turning inward and European economic activity strengthens, amplifying investor focus on "Merkron" summitry. But the Global Business Policy Council predicts that domestic politics will limit the ability of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron to enact a bold agenda for EU reform. At the same time, difficult and drawn-out negotiations between the EU and UK will raise the possibility of a hard Brexit in 2019.In 2018, the tension between Chinese investors and the governments of their targets will come to a head. Chinese companies-both state-owned and private enterprises-have dramatically expanded their foreign presence in recent years. But in August, the Chinese government issued new guidelines on overseas investments, encouraging outbound investments in select categories that align with the country's strategic interests. In 2018, governments around the world will find themselves in direct conflict with the new Chinese outbound investment guidelines as they seek to protect key domestic industries. As a consequence, the number of "blocked" outward Chinese investment deals will grow in 2018, as will tensions between China and the rest of the world.On a global level, the seemingly ever-increasing rate of catastrophic natural disasters will put more pressure on insurance markets. Although some of the world's largest insurance and reinsurance companies have survived losses over the past few years because they had sufficient capital reserves, the Global Business Policy Council predicts that not all insurers will be able to keep pace in 2018. As a result, policyholder premiums and the rates of reinsurance will increase in 2018. And since less than one-third of natural disaster-related economic losses are insured, the Council predicts that the insurance industry will also seek to expand its market in 2018, particularly in emerging markets.The Global Business Policy Council predicts a variety of technological breakthroughs and rising rates of technological adoption will open the door to a more efficient, healthier, greener future. These include advances in quantum computing and cancer treatments, and rising demand for and adoption of electric vehicles and facial recognition technology."One of the more profound predictions is that in 2018 we will reach quantum supremacy, which will lead to a reshaping of how we interact with technology in our everyday lives," saysErik Peterson, co-author of the publication and Managing Director of A.T. Kearney's Global Business Policy Council. "Quantum computing will dramatically enhance the power of artificial intelligence and data security, in addition to opening up new areas of scientific discovery."The full list of A.T. Kearney's Global Business Policy Council Year-Ahead Predictions for 2018 is as follows:Quantum supremacywill be achieved.Difficult negotiations will raise the risk of ahard Brexitin early 2019.Facial recognition technologywill become omnipresent.The threat from theIslamic Statewill metastasize in Southeast Asia, Africa, and beyond.Domestic politics in Germany and France will cut short the"Merkron" honeymoon phase.Catastrophic natural disasters will put even more pressure onglobal insurance markets.New regulations will emerge as scrutiny of theUS Internet giants' power and autonomyreaches a fever pitch.Rapidly risingdemand for electric vehicleswill spark a spike in global sales.Chinese foreign investmentwill accelerate but will face growing resistance.Breakthroughs in cancer treatmentswill accelerate at an unprecedented rate.To read the full report, visithttp://www.atkearney.com/YAP2018 About Year-Ahead PredictionsAs part of its mandate, the A.T. Kearney Global Business Policy Council continually scans the horizon for developments along the key dimensions of demography, economy, environment, geopolitics, governance, resources, and technology. In assessing this wide range of dimensions, the Council keeps its finger on the pulse of events and trends that are likely to affect the external operating environment and helps business leaders and strategic planners be mindful of likely near-term developments that could affect their industry broadly and their company specifically.Year-Ahead Predictions 2018 forecasts 10 significant events that the Global Business Policy Council believes will occur and trends that are likely to gain momentum in the coming year. For each prediction, the Council first explains the current state of play and then presents expectations for how it will unfold over the next 12 months. Each of these developments will have an important near-term impact on the global business operating environment. When considered together, they signify potentially profound shifts.This is the second consecutive year in which the Council has made such predictions. At the end of the publication, there is an assessment of the validity of the predictions made last year.About the Global Business Policy CouncilThe Global Business Policy Council is a specialized foresight and strategic analysis unit within A.T. Kearney. Since its first CEO Retreat in 1992, the Council has been a strategic service for the world's top executives, government officials, and business-minded thought leaders.

CPA Supports Administration's Section 301 InvestigationTargeted News ServiceAugust 7, 2017 Monday 4:26 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 337 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: SOUTHWICK, Mass. BodyThe Coalition for a Prosperous America issued the following news release:The Coalition for a Prosperous America welcomes and supports the Trump administration's planned investigation of China's trade practices under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act. According to press reports, the Trump Administration is close to launching an investigation that would likely focus on Chinese trade practices that violate the intellectual property (IP) rights of US companies. For years, US companies have complained privately and publicly that Chinese requirements for joint ventures with Chinese-owned companies and other Chinese legal practices often amount to little more than theft of US intellectual property without compensation."China has exploited trade laws to benefit their industries at the expense of US industry for years," said CPA chairman Dan DiMicco. "China is now targeting technology industries with the goal of global leadership, which would result in shrinking markets for US companies. The Administration needs to take action to stop the wholesale theft of US intellectual property and make sure US companies don't play China's game and sell their souls for a minuscule piece of the Chinese market."Under Section 301, the president can unilaterally impose tariffs on a nation if an investigation finds that nation has policies that "burden, restrict, or discriminate against US commerce." According to many industry sources, Chinese forced technology transfer has affected US industries including steel, semiconductors, software, aerospace, automotive, and others. Many observers also believe the Chinese government has played a role in espionage cases involving individuals stealing US trade secrets and transferring them to Chinese companies, such as the current case in federal court involving seven individuals who allegedly stole secrets regarding the production of syntactic foam for the benefit of a Chinese company. Syntactic foam has naval military uses.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-5955817 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: August 10, 2017End of Document

THE HOOVER LIBRARY AND ARCHIVES YEAR IN REVIEWStates News ServiceDecember 22, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 6600 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: STANFORD, Calif. BodyThe following information was released by the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace:The year 2017 has seen amazing growth in the Library and Archives' efforts to acquire, preserve, and make available the world's most important materials on war, revolution, and peace across the globe. Digitization initiatives, exhibitions, events, workshops, scholarship, and educational programs continue to make our collections available to scholars, students, policy-makers, and a broad public interested in the meaning and role of history.This year we expanded access to our collections by launching a digital portal containing thousands of images from our collections, and introduced a new software program, Aeon, to serve the 2,500 scholars who visited our reading rooms. Nearly 7,000 visitors enjoyed our summer exhibition, Weapon on the Wall: American Posters of WWI, and approximately 600 students attended classes in the archives. As can be seen by the long list of student awards and achievements below, our Silas Palmer fellowship program continues to promote academic excellence. The year 2017 has also been a year of cross-campus collaboration: in the summer we teamed with Stanford's Center for Russian, East European and Eurasian Studies (CREES) to host a five-day professional development course for educators and in the fall we joined Cantor Arts Center in marking the centennial of the Russian Revolution through the joint exhibition The Crown under the Hammer: Russia, Romanovs, Revolution. As always, we continue to acquire documents vital to the understanding of history and to promote scholarship based on our collections."Primary documents are the heart and soul of the historical enterprise. No historian of the modern world can enter the Hoover archival, newspaper, and library collections without hyperventilating at the depth and breadth of the magnificent materials that are held there. For Stanford undergraduates and graduate students, for Hoover scholars and Stanford professors, indeed for the world of scholarship as a whole, the Hoover Library and Archives provide an absolutely unique and irreplaceable resource."Norman M. Naimark, Robert and Florence McDonnell Professor of East European Studies, Stanford Department of History Senior Fellow, Hoover InstitutionHighlights of the year 2017 at the Library and Archives include:Expanding Digital InitiativesThis year the Library and Archives launched its new digital collections portal. The site contains more than 55,000 digitized posters, photographs, documents, sound recordings, and moving images from Hoover collections, with new items frequently added. The portal will allow remote users from around the globe to access the rich collections at Hoover for research and educational purposes.The Library and Archives also announced the launch of The Collected Works of Milton Friedman, the largest collection of Milton Friedman's work available on the internet. This new online resource features over 1,400 digital items by and about the Nobel Laureate and Hoover fellow, including every episode of the PBS series Free to Choose, 206 episodes of Friedman's weekly Economics Cassette Series, sound and video recordings of the lecture series Milton Friedman Speaks, and hundreds of Friedman's op-eds published in Newsweek and the Wall Street Journal. By providing free, convenient, and comprehensive access to these resources, the Hoover Institution allows for the continued study and appreciation of the work and life of one of the twentieth century's most influential economists.On January 25th, representatives of Hoover Institution Library and Archives and three units of the Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage met in a ceremony celebrating an agreement to provide free digital access to some of Hoover's most important materials about Soviet totalitarianism and its legacy. With the support of Poland's Central Archives of Modern Records, National Digital Archives, and Witold Pilecki Center for Totalitarian Studies, thousands of testimonies of Polish survivors of the Soviet Gulag preserved in Hoover's WÅ,adysÅ,aw Anders collection will be given full digital access in both the original Polish and English translation. By making unique testimonies of the Gulag experience readily available to academics, students, and policy-makers, this landmark digital hub will be a premier online resource for the study of authoritarianism.Hoover Archives digitized and made available more than 3,700 pages of autobiographical sketches written by members of the Nazi Party. The documents are from the Theodore Abel papers. During the 1930s Abel, a sociologist at Columbia University, sponsored a contest "for the best personal life history of an adherent of the Hitler movement" and received 683 responses, which he used for a landmark study of authoritarian regimes and their ideology. The collection represents one of the most innovative and insightful attempts to understand Nazi psychology in the 1930s.Hoover established an ongoing partnership with the Library of Congress, the U.S. National Archives, and the Wilson Center to create the Radio Preservation Task Force Increasing awareness, discoverability, and access to Cold War communication materials is the goal of the project which includes symposia, publishing opportunities, and a web portal among its initiatives. Hoover's Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty collections figure prominently.For the first time since acquiring the collection in 2001, the Hoover Institution Library and Archives is hosting, free-of-charge, full-length Firing Line videos online through its digital collections website and YouTube channel. With a roster of guests including Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, Milton Friedman, Groucho Marx, Tom Wolfe, Jack Kerouac, Woodward and Bernstein, Barry Goldwater, Joan Baez, Hugh Hefner, and others, Firing Line serves as one of the most important and complete records of political and cultural movements in twentieth-century America.Library and Archives announced that more than 4600 audio recordings from the Commonwealth Club of California records are now available through our digital collections portal, including 129 recordings of lectures delivered by Hoover fellows. The collection contains sound recordings of such memorable moments as Dan Quayle delivering the famous "Murphy Brown" speech and Enron director Jeffrey Skilling receiving a pie to the face at the podium.New digital materials from the Friedrich A. von Hayek papers were made available to researchers for the first time. Digital archivists recovered files created by Hayek's longtime secretary, Charlotte Cubitt, from 39 3.5 inch floppy disks. The files contain notes made by Cubitt during the course of her work and document Hayek's meetings, travel, and daily activities from the late 1970s until Hayek's death in 1992. Cubitt's accounts will give a unique look into Hayek's life and work during his final years.We announced the online release of the sound recordings in the Mont P lerin Society records. These recordings contain the proceedings of the Berlin (1956), Princeton (1958), Oxford (1959), and Kassel (1960) meetings of the society. In these recordings one can hear the voices and arguments of Friedrich A. von Hayek, Milton Friedman, Ludwig von Mises, Felix Morley, and debates on freedom, economics, healthcare, the welfare state, and many more topics. Previously only available in our reading room, these recordings are now available for free, immediate access by anyone around the world.More than fifty lectures by economists, historians, and other academics at the Institute for Humane Studies from 1961 to 1977 were made available online. Formed to expand understanding of human affairs and freedom, the Institute for Humane Studies invited speakers such as Milton Friedman, Friedrich von Hayek, Arthur Ekirch, Arthur Kemp, and Thomas LeDuc to explore monopoly and competition, the role of government and the military, US intellectual history, and many other topics.Photographs and documents from Hoover's Joshua Powers collection were made available online through our digital collections portal. The materials relate to the life and career of Homer Lea, a Stanford graduate who served as military adviser to Sun Yat-sen and was the author of the influential book The Valor of Ignorance. The materials provide excellent sources for understanding the revolutionary movement in China between 1900 and 1920.Newly digitized photographs from the Ron Kovic papers were made available to the public for the first time. The images were taken by photographer Roger Steffens, a close friend of Kovic, and capture on the period when Kovic was writing the manuscript for his Vietnam War memoir, Born on the Fourth of July. These images offer a personal glimpse into the life and creative process of a prominent figure in the anti-Vietnam War movement.Hoover joined the digital content provider Adam Matthew and renowned archival repositories across the globe in forming a new online digital resource for the study of health and medical services during wartime. Medical Services and Warfare: 18501927 gathers material from multiple conflicts and institutions to build a picture of the experience and development of medical practice as influenced by the wars of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The collection draws heavily from Hoover's rich holdings on WWI, particularly holdings related to the Red Cross.Materials from Hoover Archives' rich collections on modern China were featured in a new digital platform called Madspace, created by Cecile Armand, a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford's Department of History and Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA). The platform presents an interactive spatial history of advertising in modern Shanghai between 1905 and 1949, incorporating a wide range of primary sources, including municipal and business archives, personal papers, press advertisements, professional handbooks, original sketches, street photos, and videos.New AcquisitionsIn 2017 Library and Archives added new materials to the collection of Henry S. Rowen (1925-2015), a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution as well as a professor of public policy and management at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business and a member of that university's Asia/Pacific Research Center. An expert on international security, economic development, and high-tech industries in the United States and Asia, Rowen served on the Presidential Commission on the Intelligence of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction in 2004-5. He was assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs in the US Department of Defense from 1989 to 1991, and served as president of the RAND Corporation from 1967 to 1972. The newly available materials in Rowen's archive will give researchers new and valuable insight into the United States' Cold War policies concerning the Soviet Union and the nuclear arms race.Hoover Library and Archives received a never before published cache of letters written between Hoover fellow and Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman, his wife and collaborator Rose Friedman, and New York publisher William Jovanovich of Harcourt, Brace, and Jovanovich, Inc., publishers of Milton Friedman's 1980 bestseller, Free to Choose. The letters not only illuminate the close personal relationship between the Friedmans and their publisher, but reveal Milton Friedman's early praise for the works of Hoover fellow Martin Anderson, whose work he lauded as "first-rate" and "necessary."The family of Harold Agnew, a scientist instrumental to Project Alberta ("Project A" ) of the Manhattan Project, recently donated new material relating to the atomic bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima during World War II to Hoover Archives. These new items complement the original camera footage of the bombings (the only known moving images of the event in existence), which was donated to Hoover by Agnew in 1980. The entire collection is open and available for research as part of the Harold Agnew papers. The new increment consists of a scrapbook belonging to Harold Agnew, which includes personal items such as his travel orders to Tinian Island, photographs of crew and other Project A members at the base, as well Agnew's special passport that was issued for the project, among other never before seen documentation.Hoover Library and Archives added a remarkable piece of memorabilia to the collection of Hoover Senior Fellow and former U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz: Mr. Shultz's cabinet chair, which bears plaques for the four different US cabinet positions Mr. Shultz held from the 1960s to the 1980s. Shultz served as Secretary of Labor, Director of Management and Budget, Secretary of the Treasury, and Secretary of State. Only one other person in American history, Elliot Richardson, holds the distinction of having held four different US Government Cabinet positions. The Shultz cabinet chair is currently on display in the Annenberg Conference Room at the Hoover Institution.Hoover expanded its Japanese and Japanese Diaspora collections with the acquisition of a complete, handwritten Japanese translation of the Bible that was the life work of Masuo Kitaji (1897-1973), a Bay Area Japanese American officer in the Salvation Army and an internee at the War Relocation Authority Center in Poston, Arizona, during WWII. The two-volume Bible, lavishly illustrated with Kitaji's drawings and notes about his life and Christian vision, is both a remarkable manuscript and a valuable record of the experiences of Japanese Americans during the latter twentieth century. You can read more about the Bible and an interview with Kitaji's niece, Laura Dominguez-Yon, in a recent article in the San Jose Mercury News. The digital images will be made available at Hoover's digital collection, courtesy of Monterey District, California State Parks.Hoover acquired the papers of Bai Chongxi, one of the greatest military strategists in Chinese history. In 1946 Bai was appointed minister of national defense and assisted Chiang Kai-shek in waging war against the Chinese Communists. His papers include official files at different stage of his military and political careers, correspondence between Bai and important Nationalist Chinese government officials, family letters and correspondence, and personal diaries. The collection also includes more than a thousand rare photographs that document the general's military and political careers at different stages of his life.Hoover Archives received a group of original documents of the Poglavnik (head of government) of the fascist UstaÅ'e regime of the Independent State of Croatia, a quasi-protectorate of Hitler's Germany and Mussolini's Italy. The collection focuses on official appointments and commendations made by the order of Poglavnik Ante PaveliÄ‡ (18891959) and his subordinates. The UstaÅ'e were members of the Croatian Revolutionary Movement, an ultranationalist, anti-Serb organization that in the preWorld War II period engaged in terrorist activities against the Yugoslav state. The new acquisition complements other Hoover collections pertaining to the former Yugoslavia, including the papers of Jozo Tomasevich, Milovan Djilas,Vicko KrstuloviÄ‡, and ÄŒaslav NikitoviÄ‡.Library and Archives received the papers of Marek Latynski (ÅatyÅ„ski), who worked for Radio Free Europe's (RFE's) Polish broadcast service for nearly two decades and was its director during the final three years of communist Poland, 198789. His papers are a significant complement to the extensive documentation of RFE and its Polish service available at Hoover.Hoover Archives acquired the papers of Payson Dennis Carter, an American who worked in the USSR as a communications engineer between 1933 and 1937, helping lay telegraph and telephone lines between Moscow and Leningrad. As a member of the Friends of the Soviet Union after his return to the U.S., "Comrade Carter" was active in speaking to church groups in the American Southmaking him a prime target of McCarthyism during the Red Scare. The collection complements Hoover's strong holdings on communist activities in twentieth-century America.Documents, correspondence, and writings of General WacÅ,aw Stachiewicz (18941973), the chief of staff of Poland's armed forces during 193539, were received by the Hoover Archives. Stachiewicz was largely responsible for Poland's defensive preparations and the subsequent armed response to the invading armies of Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia in September 1939, the first month of World War II.The papers of one of the most distinguished experts on Warsaw Pact affairs of the 1970s and 1980s were added to the Hoover Archives. The donor, Colonel Michael Sadykiewicz, was formerly one of the highest-ranking military strategists of Communist Poland. His papers are a significant contribution to Hoover's strong holdings related to Poland under the Soviets.Hoover's Polish archival collections, the largest and most comprehensive holdings on twentieth-century Poland outside Poland, now include the papers of another key figure in the process of transforming of the country from a Soviet satellite ruled by an authoritarian communist regime into an independent democratic republic. StanisÅ,aw Ciosek's papers and photographs document mostly the years 198096, his tenure as minister of labor as well as a Central Committee and Politburo member, endeavoring to contain the rise of the Solidarity trade union movement, followed by nearly seven years of work for his erstwhile adversaries as the new Poland's ambassador to Moscow.Library and Archives acquired two photograph albums of Stefano Braccio, a lieutenant in the engineer combat battalion of the Italian Expeditionary Corps participating in the German invasion of the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa). The albums provide a complete visual record of his unit's operation in the Ukraine, from the crossing of the Soviet frontier in July 1941 to the end of Italian troops' participation on the Eastern Front in February 1943, after the Axis forces' defeat at Stalingrad.Hoover Archives acquired the papers of Tom Killion, a leading scholar on the history of Eritrea. In March of 1988 Killion traveled in the liberated zone of Eritrea with the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, witnessing the battle of Afabet and reporting on it for the Los Angeles Times. He went on to have a celebrated career as an academic and a woodcut artist. The recently acquired Killion collection includes sound recordings of his interviews with various Eritrean national and labor leaders, including revolutionary Woldeab Woldemariam.Hoover Archives opened the collection of Steven Grant, an expert on Russian culture and history who worked for the United States Information Agency from 1980 until 2004, serving as Assistant Cultural Affairs Officer at the US embassy in Moscow from 1982-85. Grant's collection contains a wealth of material on public opinion polling during the late Soviet period.

Global Healthcare IoT Market Likely to Grow at CAGR 30% During 2016- 2023: Occams Business Research & Consulting Pvt Ltd.PR NewswireSeptember 11, 2017 Monday 11:00 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 957 wordsDateline: INDORE, India, September 11, 2017 BodyHealthcare sector is projected to be between $5 trillion to $6 trillion in 2017 according to World Economic Forum. On an average, healthcare accounts for 10% of countries GDP in 2016, and is expected to reach 15% by 2025, according to World Bank estimates. Healthcare industry is constantly changing with new innovations and advanced treatment methods & services. IoT enables medical devices and other allied applications to connect & co-ordinate with each other via internet. OBRC research shows that in 2016, venture capital raised more than $74 billion for technology start-up of which roughly 4.8% went to medical device companies and increase from 3.72% in 2012. Global IoT healthcare market is projected to rise at CAGR of 30% during forecast period 2016-2023. Increasing demand for connected devices within healthcare sector, high adoption rate of cloud computing in healthcare, falling prices of electronic components, increasing healthcare expenditure, and demand for better quality of healthcare are some of the factors driving healthcare IoT market. Government regulation with respect to implementation of IoT device, data privacy & security and lack of device standardization, restraints global IoT healthcare market growth for the forecast period.     (Logo:http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161024/431641LOGO)You can find the detailed description of the report at:http://www.occamsresearch.com/iot-in-healthcare-market.Increasing demand for connected devices: Growth driver OBRC research anticipates that the number of IoT connected devices across the globe is anticipated to reach more than 29 billion by 2021, increasing from 15billion in 2015. Demand for connected devices in healthcare is attributed to low price of sensors & chips, increasing internet penetration & subscribers, and increasing of aging population. According to National Institute of Health (NIH) funded Census Bureau report of 2016, more than 9% of the world's population were aged 65 years & above (approx. 617 million). The percentage of geriatric population is expected to reach 17% by 2050 (1.6 billion). With aging population, probability of chronic diseases like cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, asthma, and mental health disorders are likely to increase. Thus, demand for 24*7 monitoring and diagnostic technology devices is likely to increase in forecast period, aiding IoT healthcare market growth. IoT devices (like remote glucometers) can replace paper based healthcare procedures to that of remote patient monitoring & real time patient data.Dataprivacyandsecuritylimitations:Restraints market growth Increasing connectivity amongst IoT devices for data collection and sharing would make it vulnerable to potential attacks from malwares and other data thieves. For example, researchers at University of Michigan & Microsoft found loopholes in security of Samsung's SmartThings smart home platform. Some of the IoT devices (for example glucometer) tend to have limited computing capabilities and storage capacity, making security and privacy protection difficult to deploy. OBRC research shows more than, 84% of the 5000 top technology companies across the globe are likely in process to deploy IoT devices by 2019. From these, only 10% feel confident about IoT device security against potential hackers. Suffice to say data privacy and security limitations are likely to drag pace of healthcare IoT market for the forecast period.Asia-Pacific: Fastest growing market OBRC studies showcase Asia Pacific being the fastest growing healthcare IoT market during the forecast period. Healthcare IoT market in Asia Pacific is driven by large pool of population, increasing cases of chronic diseases, aging population, increasing healthcare expenditure, high internet penetration rates, government investment policies, demand for quality treatment, and rising adoption of cloud computing. As of 2016, countries like South Korea, Japan, Australia, Singapore, Taiwan and Australia, boast highest IoT device penetration rates according to OBRC research. India, China, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia are key healthcare IoT market according to OBRC analysis. Both India and China accounts for an average 35% of Asia Pacific population in 2016 (according to UN estimates) making it a lucrative investment destination for healthcare IoT market. Also, healthcare expenditure in India and China is likely to rise by an average of 9% per annum till 2022, according to World Bank estimates. Chinese government has put forth Internet Plus policy plan to create economic model for driving social & economic innovation in technology sector by the end of 2020. Through this policy, Chinese government is likely to push for investments in IoT sector by or before 2022. Similarly, Indian government via 'Make in India' initiative is likely to fund IoT device manufacturing in the country.About Occams Business Research & Consulting (OBRC): Occams Business Research & Consulting has been in the business (Market Research) for the past three years.

English Soccer Giants Liverpool in Hot Water Over Tibetan Glacier DealRealMoneyOctober 9, 2017 Monday 11:00 AM EDTCopyright 2017 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 776 wordsByline: Alex McMillanHighlight: Liverpool Football Club is subject to protests over its choice of "official water partner" in China.BodyEnglish soccer team Liverpool FC has found itself in heated debate over a cold-water deal with a Hong Kong-listed sponsor. Its troubles are a reminder of the minefield that international companies carefully tread when finding partners in Asia -- particularly China.At issue is Liverpool's link-up with Tibet Water Resources (HK:1115), which claims to produce its flagship product , 5100 Tibet Glacial Spring Water, from mineral water that flows from a natural spring rising from deep out of the Nianqing Donggula Mountains in Tibet, at 5,100 meters above sea level.Activists from the Free Tibet campaign have taken the sports team to task for accepting the sponsorship deal, which, as of July, made Tibet Water the "official water partner" of the soccer club in China. The cash infusion provides the water company a host of benefits, including "access to players and legends of the club," as Liverpool said in a release , and both online and social-media advertising.The Premier League, in which Liverpool plays, is immensely popular in China, and Liverpool -- which has won the league 18 times and been crowned cup champions of Europe on five occasions -- is one of the best-supported clubs across Asia.Free Tibet launched a campaign against Liverpool's partnership on Wednesday,  . The group insists that Liverpool is effectively condoning human-rights abuses in Tibet by doing business with a Chinese company operating there.The sponsorship from a "prestigious and well-regarded team," such as Liverpool, "lends an air of legitimacy" to China's occupation of Tibet and abuse of human rights there, John Jones, a campaign manager for Free Tibet, told the FT.That belies the team's "progressive fan base" and "strong position on human rights," Jones added. He said he had raised his concerns with Liverpool but received no response. Liverpool is owned by the Fenway Sports Group, the same company that owns the Boston Red Sox.Tibet Water also brews beer made from highland barley grown on the Tibetan plateau. Besides Liverpool, it has supplied water to sports events in China -- and to meetings of the Communist Party.The company has  , which is run by researchers who work to remain anonymous. Iceberg says Tibet Water, which has a market capitalization of $1.0 billion, "shows all the signs of financial fraud," such as profitability that "does not make sense," inexplicably high margins and a high debt level -- despite financial statements that show ample cash flow.Tibet Water has countered that the Iceberg report has "no factual basis," and contains allegations that are "false, malicious and misleading." It            says it will start litigation against Iceberg's members for a report that is "maliciously misleading," and points to earnings that were audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.Like better-known short sellers such as Carson Block at Muddy Waters, Iceberg has  -- such as the Singapore-listed commodities trader Noble Group  , a favorite subject of its work for the last two years.Tibet Water says its water -- also used in the beer -- is particularly pure, coming from such an isolated part of Lhasa. The company adds that the water contains rare minerals such as lithium, strontium and meta-silicic acid. It bottles the water less than two miles from the glacier source.Liverpool boasted of Tibet Water's role as "a Chinese company with deep roots in Tibet." The company seeks "business growth and economic development" for Tibet, as well as "supporting conservation and protection of water sources and the environment across the region," the Liverpool release states.There's no sense from the club that Tibet, which China invaded in 1950 and has occupied ever since, could be a contentious issue.Doing business in China -- which consistently leads the world in the number of people executed each year -- is fraught enough. With Xi Jinping firmly in control and cementing his place as the country's strongest leader since Mao, "the outlook for fundamental human rights, including freedoms of expression, assembly, association and religion, remains dire,"  .Tibet and neighboring Xinjiang, which is 45% populated by the Uyghur people who are mainly Muslim, are overseen by Beijing and "its highly repressive rule," the rights organization states. The Chinese government suppresses political, religious and ethnic identity, the group states.There's a saying in Chinese that the "mountains are high, and the emperor is far away" -- basically suggesting that what happens in Chinese Vegas stays in Chinese Vegas. For Liverpool, even the Tibetan mountains may not be high enough -- and for soccer teams and their sponsors, the market is very much global.Load-Date: October 10, 2017End of Document

APAC Project Portfolio Management Market by Type, Application, Deployment, Organization Size, Vertical and Country - Forecast to 2022PR NewswireAugust 14, 2017 Monday 4:50 PM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1050 wordsDateline: LONDON, Aug. 14, 2017 Body"Factors such as huge infrastructure development in APAC and the globalization of APAC enterprises are expected to drive the growth of the APAC PPM market."The APAC Project Portfolio Management (PPM) market size is expected to grow from USD 586.9 million in 2017 to USD 1,352.8 million by 2022, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 18.2%. The APAC PPM market is driven by various factors, such as huge infrastructure development, need for optimum resource utilization and cost management, proliferation of startups, and rapid generation of complex data volumes. However, the APAC PPM software and service vendors also face some challenges, such as demand for customized PPM software, and integration of traditional and agile methodologies.Download the full report:https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/5059896/"Integration and deployment services segment is expected to hold the largest market share during the forecast period."The integration and deployment services segment provides end-to-end enterprise support, which is the main reason for its higher adoption. Integration and deployment services are gaining traction in the APAC PPM market, as they help organizations in identifying the project scope; designing the plan layout; optimizing data quality and delivery through testing, building, and deploying customizable designs suiting the organizational business needs; and assisting trained professionals in ensuring the smooth installation of PPM software."Project management application is expected to hold the largest share during the forecast period."The project management process involves initiating, planning, executing, controlling, and concluding the work of a team to achieve specific goals and meet particular business requirements. Project management helps enterprises plan and allocate resources, and allows organizations prioritize tasks based on the availability of resources. Once a task is created, budget and resources are allocated, and timeline is established, the project management application automates project initiation, resource planning, time management, and financial reporting. The use of cloud in PPM facilitates timely project execution, automated compliance with employee and industry regulations, improved resource utilization, reduced resource gaps, increased project visibility, enhanced workforce productivity, and greater operational effectiveness. The demand for project management applications is increasing, due to real-time decision-making and communication needs, and increased control over project related expenditures."China is projected to hold the largest market share during the forecast period."Among the countries taken into consideration for the study, China is expected to hold the largest market share during the forecast period. The PPM software and services market in China is dynamic and complex, due to the presence of several growing local and international companies. The US vendors of PPM software face a stiff challenge in conducting business in China, due to the country's strong "De-IOE" campaign. The "De-IOE" campaign is led by the Chinese government and aims to reduce China's dependency on IBM Corporation, Oracle Corporation, and EMC Corporation. Although the acronym "IOE" targets the 3 companies mentioned above, the effect has been cascading among the other US IT suppliers as well. This initiative of the Chinese government, to switch the suppliers of the massive companies under its authority to domestic suppliers, has provided a massive opportunity for domestic and regional PPM players.Manufacturing, construction, and defense are some of the major industries that face huge demands for PPM software.The break-up of the profiles of the primary participants is given below:· By Company Size: Tier 1 - 20%, Tier 2 - 50%, and Tier 3 - 30%· By Designation Level: C-Level - 48%, D-Level - 35%, and Others - 17%· By Country: India - 33%, ANZ - 27%, Singapore - 22%, China - 11%, and Rest of APAC - 7%The various key APAC PPM providers profiled in the report are:1. Oracle Corporation (California, US)2. Software AG (Darmstadt, Germany)3. Changepoint Corporation (Washington, US)4. Microsoft Corporation (Washington, US)5. SAP SE (Walldorf, Germany)6. Upland Software, Inc. (Texas, US)7. Planview, Inc. (Texas, US)8. Planisware S.A.S. (California, US)9. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (California, US)10. ServiceNow, Inc. (California, US)11. Clarizen (California, US)12. CA Technologies (New York, US)Research CoverageThe APAC PPM market has been segmented on the basis of types, applications, deployments, organization size, countries, and verticals. A detailed analysis of the key industry players has been done to provide crucial insights into their business overviews, products and services, key strategies, new product launches, partnerships, agreements, and collaborations, business expansions, and competitive landscape associated with the APAC PPM market.The report will help the market leaders/new entrants in the following ways:· This report segments the APAC PPM market comprehensively and provides the closest approximations of the revenue numbers for the overall market and the subsegments across different verticals and countries.· This report helps stakeholders understand the pulse of the market and provides them with information on the key market drivers, restraints, challenges, and opportunities.· This report helps stakeholders better understand their competitors and gain more insights to enhance their market position.

I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, October 16th. Your top stories right now, 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.Tensed talks at the White House, President Trump and Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell meeting for the first time face-to-face since the failure of the healthcare vote. One of the key items on the agenda, of course, tax reform.Here's what Treasury Secretary Steven MNuchin told me yesterday on "Sunday Mornings Futures" about getting the vote.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY: And I think the Senate understands the importance of this. And I would also just comment, I hope we get a lot of democrats on board as well because cutting taxes for the middle class and making business taxes competitive for jobs. I think that's something that democrats understand as well.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: All right. What to expect ahead of the meeting coming up this morning. Breaking news overnight, an oil rig explodes in Louisiana. A massive fireball erupting over Lake Pontchatrain. The latest as crews search for the missing.Meanwhile, your Wi-Fi at risk, new reports says wireless security vulnerable to hacking and your internet browsing could be tracked, we're on it.More signs of trouble at Tesla. The company already struggling with Model 3 production. Now it is laying off hundreds of others.It's merger Monday of sorts on Wall Street, Aramark announcing a pair of deals valued at nearly $2.5 billion. A broader look at the M&A activity this morning coming up for Aramark Holdings.Global markets this morning point to a slide gain at the opening of trading, Futures indicating the DOW Industrial are up 18, S&P and the Nasdaq also in the plus column.In Europe this morning are edging higher as well. The DAX Index up about a quarter of a percent, the other majors, FTSE100 and the CAC Krones up fractionally.In Asia Overnight, markets mostly higher with the exception of China which was down about a third of a percent.And a wild win for the Dodgers, Los Angeles now leading the Cubs 2-0 in the NLCS, we will have all the highlights coming up.All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to talk all about it, Rasmussen Reports Political Analyst, Amy Holmes is here. Kelly and Company Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly. And Maslansky and Partners President, Lee Carter. Great to see you.LEE CARTER, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS PRESIDENT: Great to me here.BARTIROMO: Good morning.AMY HOLMES, RASMUSSEN POLITICAL ANALYST: Good morning.KEVIN KELLY, KELLY AND COMPANY MANAGING PARTNER: It was a great weekend too. I mean --BARTIROMO: It was a good weekend.KELLY: Yes. And what was interesting is I found out that Jeff Garzik's mother has been bought into the whole Bitcoin debate. We saw that --BARTIROMO: Yes, that's right.KELLY: So that was pretty interesting.BARTIROMO: An 86-year-old mother was asking for the Bitcoin,KELLY: Yes, which is pretty fascinating and showing how the tides have changed especially when it comes to the financial markets since 2009 and especially because of all the regulation that's happened in the banking sector and we've got some bank earnings coming up.Tomorrow, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley so we'll see some interesting results there.BARTIROMO: Goldman Sachs.KELLY: Yes. Yes, exactly. So I think -- oh yes, Goldman Sachs is what I meant. But what's fascinating today, Netflix, the big disruptor coming up. And so we're going to talk about that too.BARTIROMO: Yes, we're going to talk about Netflix as well. And then, of course, there's the Iran deal which the president did not certify. He said, "I cannot certify this deal." We're going to get reaction from the Israeli Prime Minister this morning, Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, my guest yesterday on "Sunday Mornings Futures."We'll hear more of that this morning. Reagan Economic Advisor, Art Laffer is weighing in, we're going to talk about tax reform with him. And Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano is here. Plus, talk about Netflix, we'll talk with the CEO of MoviePass, he's the Former Co-Founder of Netflix, Senior Executive Mitch Lowe is also here as well. MovieaPass CEO join us, big show coming up this morning.And let's kick it off right now at this hour, we got our top story, President Trump will meet with Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell later today to talk about the fall agenda. And it is important that you will focus on the budget and tax reform according to the White House.I spoke with Treasury Secretary Steven MNuchin yesterday on "Sunday Morning Futures" he said he hopes to pass the bipartisan tax plan before year-end.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MNUCHIN: We have a consensus with the leadership and the House and the Senate. As you know, we've been working on these issues all year. These are difficult issues.Tax reform hasn't been done in 31 years. If this were simple, it would have been done before but President Trump is committed and I am committed to getting done this year. I hope we get a lot of democrats on board as well because cutting taxes for the middle class and making business taxes competitor for jobs. I think that's something that democrats understand as well.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: This, of course, times ahead of the Senate vote on the budget resolution that will determine whether or not republicans can pass the tax package without democratic support. Republicans hold a 52 to 48 Senate majority and can lose no more than two seats to pass that budget.Lee Carter, let's talk about this, the administration has been messaging this tax plan, is it enough to get the bipartisan support?CARTER: You know what I find really, really interesting? As I've been testing to see how people are responding to the message that's out there, voters really are responding well. Even dems are responding to the idea of simplification in a very, very meaningful way.Now, what we're seeing in inside Washington is a lot of politics, people are wondering do they have the votes? Don't they have the votes? We're hearing now though that Rand Paul is on board that (INAUDIBLE) on board.So it looks like we could get something done and I think that's really encouraging, I think we're seeing that play out in the markets. And hopefully they're going to meet their deadline.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean this week obviously is the big vote from the Senate. They were on vacation last week. Once that opens the door to reconciliation Amy, you would expect that this is going to move quickly.HOLMES: Well you would expect to and I talk to some sources on Capitol Hill about how the Senate is going to be tackling the budget.And remember the budget is the framework to be able to then move forward on tax reform. And they're saying, "Look, the Senate has to answer three answers." The first one being focusing on the middle class when it comes to tax reform. As you say, it looks like they're getting -- get Senator Rand Paul on board with that.Secondly, if they need to satisfy the deficit hawks being led by Senator Bob Corker. And thirdly, there's some other issues that are still at play which might surprise some of your viewers. We're looking at defense spending, we need John McCain to be on board with that.Even ANWR Drilling in Alaska, Susan Collins in the budget, she wants to see that that is dealt with. And then you still have Ted Cruz who wants to see ObamaCare repeal and replace. So they're going to be grappling with those things this week to get all those republicans on board. If they do, then they actually don't need to reach out to the other side.BARTIROMO: So they're budgeting $1.5 trillion in this tax plan, in this budget this week. Yes. They may not have to reach out but they're counting on -- like you said Lee, they're counting on Bob Corker and they're counting on Rand Paul being there. Yes.HOLMES: They only have that two votes very -- they only have two votes that they can lose on this.BARTIROMO: Yes, right. In terms of the dems, they're counting on Heidi Heitkamp and they're also counting on Donnelly. So we'll see what happens there.KELLY: Well that goes to the point. I mean the tax whether reform or cuts is a bipartisan issue especially when you see each party come out with their plans.And the reason being is it's so critical to the 2018 elections. If the republicans don't get something done on the tax side, they're going to have a dismal showing next year and they have egg on their face because they're all for three on major legislative agenda and they ran on that.The repeal and replace was a big pivotal part and they started with that. And so if they can't even get simple tax cuts done, then they are in for some deep trouble.CARTER: I think --BARTIROMO: I think they've got the votes. I think this is going to start picking up speed.CARTER: I think so too. And I think that dems have to be careful going into 2018 because their biggest talking point is that this is a tax cut for the wealthy which simply is not true.And the American people are saying, "We get that. We want money back. We want more money in our paychecks. We want money for ourselves." And if the democrats are going to keep playing up that talking point, it's not going to work.HOLMES: That's right. The worst thing that could happen for democrats is that republicans pass this, it's successful, we see the economy picking up, we see more money in people's pockets.And democrats just playing the role of obstructionists, of spoilers, that doesn't help them in the mid term.BARTIROMO: Absolutely. And when you look at the American people, majority want to see tax reform. They think that this is going to move the needle on economic growth.Of course, the president is also pushing healthcare reform as the Senate turns to Capitol Hill today. This coming after President Trump announced that he would cut off federal payments to insurers.The money goes to companies for lowering out of pocket cost like co- payments and deductibles for low and middle income customers without the subsidies. The Congressional Budget Office is saying that premiums on midlevel ObamaCare plans will rise by 20 percent creating a defici increase of $194 billion over the next decade.What about this? Can republicans get the support they need to pass this given that the divineness that is obviously still there in healthcare?HOLMES: I think it's a tough sell. Again, democrats, their main strategy is being obstructionists. But the ObamaCare as it stands, the status quo isn't working.We're seeing that ObamaCare is circling the drain, premiums are going up and shares are pulling out of the individual market. I think it would behoove democrats particularly in the Senate and those 10 states that Donald Trump won handedly. Those blue states that went red for him, those democrats are going to be under a lot of pressure.BARTIROMO: Funny, the president last week said, "Look, this is -- we're taking a different road and all of this." But maybe this is actually going to be as effective, if not, more effective and maybe this will be better.KELLY: Yes. I think -- listen, the president has to use executive fiat to get anything done. You've seen republicans not work with him, you've seen democrats not work with him. So he's just going to go it alone.And one of the things when you look at this executive orders that allows choice for the American consumer, those low and middle class consumers have been strangled by ObamaCare. They're the ones complaining about the deductibles going up as well as their premiums going up and worst, healthcare.Now they're offered choice, they can pull together and band together and get cheaper plans, plans they want they want. Whether it's 90-day plans or one year plans.BARTIROMO: Yes. You know what, I feel like this past week was a very successful week for the GOP because they came together in some way.They're talking about getting all of these new votes like Rand Paul, perhaps Susan Collins, obviously possibly Bob Corker. And they're also -- they also got through this executive order with healthcare.It looks like budget vote happens this week, reconciliation opens the door for tax reform and we move forward. You agree?CARTER: I totally agree. I think that this is going to be a very, very important week to follow up on last week. I think the president has to continue to stay focused on these issues, not get distracted by any other tweets and let's get this done because that's what the American people want to see.HOLMES: And showing that the Republican Party and the president and the White House can work for the American people, can try to make this legislation of ObamaCare actually benefit the middle class and low income.BARTIROMO: The president played golf with Lindsey Graham and Rand Paul apparently over the weekend. I'm sure the conversation was quite interesting on the golf course.We'll take a break. When we come back, we have breaking news this morning, at least seven people are hurt after an oil rig explosion in Louisiana. The search is now on for at least one person still missing.And then Tesla dropping the hammer, hundreds are fired as the automaker tries to tighten up and solve these production problems. We'll get into it, back in a moment,.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A powerful oil rig explosion Louisiana to report, Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now. Cheryl, good morning to you.CHERYL CASONE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning Maria. Happening overnight, at least seven people have been injured, one person is still missing this morning.Happened in Lake Pontchatrain Train which is just northwest of New Orleans. Clovelly Oil owns the oil rig. As for any threats for residents, official say drinking water in the area will remain safe because it is pulled from the nearby Mississippi River.Well Iran your Wi-Fi router at home could be vulnerable to hackers. A government security group says the security protocol used to protect Wi-Fi connections has been broken. And it warns that hackers within physical range of any WPA2 protected router could monitor basically your work, everything you're doing. Experts say that you may want to have your home router reprogrammed.Well Tesla firing hundreds of employees amid signs of production of its Model 3 is off to a slow start. The firing has included engineers, managers, sales people, even factory workers after an annual performance review.Elon Musk has said that Tesla will be making 5,000 Model 3 cars per week by the end of the year. A few weeks ago though we said there were bottlenecks in production. Taking a look at the stock, it's up 65 percent so far this year but it is down in the premarket, almost half a percent.And a dramatic ending in Los Angeles last night.(VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Yes, they were. Justin Turner, he's a hero for Los Angeles for the National League Championship Series. Game three is tomorrow night in Chicago. Game three of the American League Series between the Astros and the Yankees is tonight right here in New York City.BARTIROMO: Big game.CASONE: Standby.BARTIROMO: Thanks Cheryl. All right. How about Tesla, stock had an incredible year, production problems, does this impact the stock further?KELLY: I don't think so because the markets are forward-looking indicator and they're so far ahead of the curve in terms of competition.I mean you see everyone else trying to come in and go to electric by 2020. They're also going to have to procure the lithium in order to make the batteries, Tesla is ahead of that, they're building their $5 billion plan in Nevada. So I think investor concerns, you've seen it, it shrugs it off every single time.HOLMES: But I have a question about that which is Tesla is so dependent on lobbying the federal government to pass regulations to make their cars look attractive as compared to oil powered cars and does that affect their software?KELLY: No. No, it hasn't. I mean you've seen these subsidies are -- you've seen whether it's the solar industry, whether it's the wind turbine industry, I mean they're so depend on these. I mean it's engrain, this will never go away.CARTER: I think it's really like fascinating though that they have done such a good job of messaging that you have an expectation with them that they're not necessarily going to turn the profit right now, that they're a long-term play.They change themselves from an auto company to an energy company and that makes you look forward with them rather than just looking at how they're doing right now.BARTIROMO: It makes you look at growth.CARTER: Exactly.BARTIROMO: And is this the growth story? I mean it worked for Amazon.KELLY: And China is going electric too, that's a big thing for them. That's the next wave over there as they're going to electric vehicles.BARTIROMO: Earning season in Earnest this week, for sure we got the beginning last week with the major banks. How does earnings season shakeout this year? I mean I think the expectation is for four percent profit which is not great.KELLY: No, it's not great. But we're out of that earnings recession that we've seen. So this -- I think this earnings seasons, a lot of expectations have been checked especially because of the hurricanes that have happened and guidance going forward has been tempered.BARTIROMO: Yes. True. We're going to talk more about that and investing. Coming up in the next segment, we'll talk with Stephen Wood from Russell. Stay with us on that.But first, the four most terrorists state of our time, that's what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calls Iran as he throws his support behind President Trump's bold action on the decertification of the ObamaCare Era Nuclear Deal.Then taking a bigger bite out of the market, food service giant Aramark acquires two companies in the largest deal since going public, we'll tell you about those. Back in a moment right here.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The momentum continues in this market, take a look at Futures this Monday morning pointing to gains of the opening of trading once again, DOW Industrial set to open up about 20 points.We're kicking off a busy week. Earnings season ramps up this week plus that Chairman Janet Yellen speaking on the economy yesterday at the INF meetings this weekend, standing up beat. She signaled that the Central Bank could raise interest rates again this year, probably in December.Joining us right now Russell Investment's Chief Market Strategist, Stephen Wood. And Stephen, it is good to see you.STEPHEN WOOD, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, RUSSELL INVESTMENT: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Do you want to still put money into this market or are you still sort of trimming back telling into any rally?WOOD: I think from a global perspective you want to put money into the market. Our view is that the fundamentals in the U.S. are good, probably going to get a little better as we go into the end of the year.Earnings are fantastic, probably going to fall back to good. So the fundamentals look okay. The valuations of the U.S. equity market lead us to think that a global rebalancing is in order. So for U.S. dollar, American investor they've done very, very well.On these fundamentals, they're working harder and harder to just find these valuations. So this is probably a very good opportunity for the average American just to trim a little bit of the U.S. rally, start looking globally.Europe, emerging markets a bit because it would be very broad multi-asset, it has to be very discipline, very planfull in how you do this.BARTIROMO: You know what I thought was interesting, Jeffrey Gundlach, DoubleLine Capital this week on Wall Street Week said to me Kevin, "Look, the dollar deserves a little bump up but long-term the dollar is down."I thought that was interesting because you've got a guy in the White House, President Trump who is basically saying all about America, nationalism that you would think that the dollar strength up, what do you think?KELLY: Yes. So I think this is an interesting point because we've seen emerging markets, we're talking about rotating into there. The emerging markets have benefited from the weaker dollar.BARTIROMO: Right.KELLY: So their currencies have been stronger as well as the commodities that have supported their economies have done very well. And so when you're picking and choosing where to play, it's a fascinating story because the dollar has been down 12 percent this year.Or at points, it's down about eight percent now. So when you're looking to allocate across the globe, even looking internally into the U.S., if you -- a stronger dollar if it bounces up, you want to go to -- you want to go to Russell2000 companies, right?BARTIROMO: Is that what you're doing Stephen?WOOD: Well I think within the U.S., I think the issue is probably not so much sectors. I think this is a broad valuation concerns that we have. And as you know Maria, we've been saying for some time now that you want to look more global.EM is a part of that, Europe has been one of our favorite destinations. The dollar has been trending weaker. I don't know there's tremendous upside, there could be some (INAUDIBLE) like dollar euro or could be some more tactical considerations.But I think ultimately for a long-term discipline investor, valuations matter. Short-term you can get some of these cross current, so we look at that broader effect. I think the dollar right now is probably going to -- I think chop in this range.I think if the euro, if that appears as 120, 121, 122, I think Mario Draghi is going to get very, very busy and he's going to reassess his stance. So that could end a little bump in the Europe cycle, a little bump in the Europe funding. So I think right now looking at Europe, even given this rally, maybe something America wants to consider.BARTIROMO: Are you buying directly companies in Europe or buying ETFs in Europe?WOOD: Well we'll be investing directly through the multimanager strategy that we've got.HOLMES: Now you say that you're looking and expecting tax cuts in at least early 2018. We know that Capitol Hill is turning to that this week with the budget and then hopefully a framework for tax reform. What if that doesn't happen, how does that change your outlook?WOOD: Well I think the market is pricing in some movement at least in the corporate tax front. I think there could be some bipartisan agreement on corporate taxation but I think the market in the U.S. has clearly priced that in.And we think the effects would be positive. We're a little bit more modest on how positive we think they will be. So right now, again, that valuation argument we think embeds progress not only in corporate taxes but individual taxes.HOLMES: So let me follow-up with that that you also hear the administration and where you could get bipartisan agreement is on middle class tax cuts, is that enough when you're looking at the market?WOOD: I think it could be on the individual side. The big bang is going to come from the corporate side. If we get repatriation of foreign earnings, also that could be pretty big.I think on the personal side, just a bit more political, people have more emotional attachments to middle class, upper class. But my understanding of President Trump's proposal right now is in high tax states like as we know New York or California, this could actually be something of a tax increase in order to fund the middle class tax cut.So I think we just need to look at this in what kind of longer term macroeconomic stimulus it has which should be measurable but I don't think it's going to double the rate of growth in the economy. So we just take a more middle of the road kind of view.BARTIROMO: Yes, he pushed back -- Steven MNuchin was on the program yesterday, he pushed back that there's actually tax increases for the highest earners but they are coming out with a plan to put some kind of a cap on the state and local tax deduction.WOOD: Sure. Sure.BARTIROMO: So if you make more than $1 million you won't be able to deduct. Perhaps if you make less, I don't know the actual numbers but they're trying to --WOOD: Yes. And no one does.BARTIROMO: Yes. And they're trying to come up with something whereas you won't see a middle class tax increase for those people who won't be able to deduct that anymore.WOOD: Yes. Because my understanding is that simplification is the goal. So 25 -- 35, 25, 12, and then 0. But the removal of deduction is a subtle point maybe but it's a big, big, big point. So how they treat deductions is going to be rather significant.BARTIROMO: Yes. And do you think the market is up the way it is? $5 trillion in market value since Election Day. Now because there's some anticipation that this gets done or is this going to be gravy on a rally that's already up 25 percent?WOOD: I think it's anticipation that it does get done. And if I get back to something that you guys were talking about earlier is I think the turnaround in Chinese growth is probably something that's underreported.The Chinese economy is growing about 6.5-ish percent. For the -- a couple of years before this, the Chinese government said it was growing at 6 percent and it wasn't.BARTIROMO: How does that impact us?WOOD: Looking at emerging markets, commodity prices, you're seeing the effect in the dollar. So I think the expansion and the broadening of global growth, allowing Europe to participate, emerging markets, Asia.So, again, you're getting this improvement in the global economy and in those markets by in large their valuations are attractive relative to the U.S. that's we're --KELLY: Inter-technology sector has outperformed our technology sector here so far this year so everyone's talked about how tech is up doing so well or talking about Apple, Facebook. Per technology with Alibaba, JD.com, all of them, Tencent have outperformed ours.BARTIROMO: Interesting. All right. We will leave it there. Stephen, great to see you.WOOD: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Stephen Wood joining us there, Russell Investments. We'll take a break. When we come back, historic and bold, why Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says President Trump's action on the Obama Era Nuclear Deal is the right decision for the world. My interview with the prime minister coming up next.And then costume fail, an Anne Frank Halloween costume pulled after sparking social media outrage, back in a moment.MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back, happy Monday, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us this morning. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, October 16th, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast. Strengthening the deal, President Trump decertifies the Iran nuclear agreement and threatens to end it entirely if Congress fails to take action to improve it, America's key ally in the region, applauding the decision.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL: Iran is the foremost terrorist state of our time. To have a rogue regime like that, acquire an arsenal of nuclear weapons in 10 years' time which is what the Iran agreement now provides Iran to do, is a terrible folly. So I commend the President for taking the historic and bold decision to avert this dangerous --(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: More of this morning from my interview with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday. Why he says President Trump made the right move. Meanwhile, oil jumping on fears of new sanctions against Iran, oil is up one in a quarter percent this morning, above $52.10 a barrel. Global markets are also pointing to a gain at the opening of trading. The Dow Industrials set to open up about 20 points, NASDAQ, S&P 500 also with the firmer tone this morning.In Europe, stocks are edging higher, take a look at the European indices, with the FT-100, the CAC Quarante and the DAX Index, all higher by a fraction. In Asia overnight, markets close mostly higher with the best performer in Hong Kong, Hang Seng Index up three-quarters of one percent.Over in California, the combating of the California wildfires continues. Crews have gained ground on the flames, apparently, in what's now the deadliest wildfire in the state's history, the very latest on this devastation in California, coming up. Cutting ties, Amazon Studios severs its relationship with the Weinstein Company entirely. A sexual harassment allegations pile up against Harvey Weinstein, the drastic measures the technology titan is taking to distance itself from the company.And costume controversy, a Halloween store facing major backlash this morning over its World War II-themed Anne Frank outfit, the company's response to the outrage, and then Microsoft branching out, why the technology titan is building a trio of treehouses for employees (INAUDIBLE) we will take you there.First, to our top story this half an hour, revamping the Iran nuclear deal, on Friday, President Trump announced that he will not recertify the 2015 agreement and threatened to end it all together if Congress does not strengthen it. United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley explained the administration's decision.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NIKKI HALEY, UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: The goal at the end of the day is to hold Iran accountable, is to get them to be good community leaders, is to get them to stop all of these violations that they are doing. What we are trying to say is, look, the agreement was an incentive. The agreement was for you to stop doing certain things. You haven't stopped doing certain things, so what do we do to make Iran more accountable so that they do?(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: America's key ally in the region commanded the move. I spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday about the deal. He said he doesn't care if they keep it or if they leave it, but the deal has to be changed. He told me the decision to decertify is very important.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)NETANYAHU: Iran is a foremost terrorist state of our time. It hangs gays, jails journalists, subjugates women, and foments terrorism throughout the world and wild aggression in the Middle East. To have a regime like this, that is -- whose economy is 30 times the size of North Korea, to have a rogue regime like that, acquire an arsenal of nuclear weapons in 10 years' time which is what the Iran agreement now, provides Iran to do, is a terrible folly.So I commend the President for taking the historic and bold decision to avert this danger in time. He could have kicked the can down the road. He could've said it's not going to happen on my watch, so I'll just let it go, but he didn't. And he faced up to this danger and I think he gave an opportunity for all of us in the Middle East and beyond to fix this deal, fix it or nix it because it could be very, very dangerous if it just went through.BARTIROMO: Yes, I'm glad you mentioned North Korea. I'm going to ask you about that in a moment. But the idea that he said fix it or nix it, really surprised some people that he left the door open to, look if Congress can't come up with something, we will walk away. Watch this, Mr. Prime Minister. I want to get your reaction to this as we examine these flaws in the deal.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies to address the deals' many serious flaws, so that the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with nuclear weapons. In the event we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Mr. Prime Minister, would you rather see this deal terminated or do you they actually can amend these serious flaws that the President refers to?NETANYAHU: I'm focused on the goal. The goal is to prevent Iran from ever in acquiring -- ever acquiring nuclear weapons and with -- you could achieve it either by fixing this bad deal or by nixing it. I don't particularly care which one, but it's the result that we want to have. And there are several key things that you want to make sure, one is that you don't remove the restrictions on Iran's nuclear program just by changing the calendar. You want to see a real change in Iran's behavior.That's eliminating the so-called automatic sunset clause on restrictions. The second thing is, prevent Iran from developing intercontinental ballistic missiles that are only useful for nuclear weapons and you can do that. The third thing is equally to see that you have real inspections. Right now, Iran, you know, Iran doesn't allow you to inspect military sites, it lets you inspect everywhere else, where do you think they are going to hide these things? So, these are some of the key changes that have to go through. If you get it, fine. If you don't get it, cancel the deal.BARTIROMO: Yes. This is a really important point that you make because Tom Cotton of Arkansas is now looking at some of these flaws, as a way to come up with a bill to actually change this. And it is the sunset clauses, insufficient enforcement and the silence on Iran's missile program. So do you think that they will actually be able to come up with, what, an amendment that Iran will follow? I mean, do you really believe that we will be able to start viewing their facilities?NETANYAHU: I think that what you have is immense leverage. People don't recognize that. You have immense leverage and not only because Israel and the key Arab states in the region support what the President has done. You said Israel supports the President, absolutely, but so does Saudi Arabia, so do the Emirates, and, you know, when Israel and the Arab states agree on something, you know, you should pay attention. I think this is a historic moment.The leverage you have is based upon the fact that the United States is a great superpower. It's the world's greatest power. Its economy is nearly $20 trillion. The Iranian economy is two percent of that. So when various countries including your allies have to choose between crippling sanctions on Iran or cutting themselves out of the American market, well, it's a no- brainer what they'll choose.That's part of the leverage that you'll have, and the President is right to put that forward now and to say, I'm not going to authorize the continuation of a very bad deal that will give a rogue criminal state the power to threaten the United States mainland, we have seen what happens when that goes through. I'm going to act now, again, fix it or nix it, exactly the right thing to do.BARTIROMO: But that's not what we are hearing from some of our partners on this deal, right? I mean, what are you going to do? What should the President be doing to work with the other five countries who are basically saying, look, we are fine just keeping this deal as is, I'm talking about Europe? I'm talking about China. So if the U.S. even put snap back sanctions back in place, what does it really mean if the other countries involved in this deal are not agreeable?NETANYAHU: Well, look, I think the reason they say they want to keep the deal, is because they think that changing it would mean canceling it. But the President said something very astute, he said, well, unless you change it, I'm going to cancel it. So if you want to save the deal, start fixing it.And that's exactly the right -- so it takes time until governments actually understand the significance of what the President put forward, but he has said, I, the President of the United States, will not allow these bad deal to go through. So, the only way you guys can save the deal is by helping amend it, fixing it. And that's something that I think will have great leverage down the line.BARTIROMO: So you do believe that Europe --NETANYAHU: Maybe right now.BARTIROMO: For example, will join in on perhaps potentially snapping back those sanctions against Iran then?NETANYAHU: Well, I think if the U.S. decides to do that on its own, it can do so by its own because it has such immense economic leverage. And I think the Europeans, once they think about it will see that the President is giving them an opportunity to avoid something that is very bad for them today. You know, you don't want -- none of us as leaders should, you know, sacrifice the long-term or even the middle-term for the short-term.And the short term, yes, it's comfortable, they have business ties with Iran and so on that are developing but in a very few years, Iran will be this humongous power, with declared -- you know, this was Iran that says, death to America, death to Israel, you know, you're the great Satan, we're the little Satan. I suppose Europe in between is middle-sized Satan, I hope they're not offended. But we're all under their guns.They're developing ballistic missiles not to fire against us, we already have the -- is to fire against the threatened Europe, to threaten the United States. So, I think when people come around and think about it, they say, we really don't want this bad deal to go through, we really should act now to correct it.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: My thanks once again to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for joining me. Coming up next, Harvey Weinstein battling back this morning, the ousted movie executive reportedly planning to challenge being fired by the company he founded.

Now, Harvey Weinstein, who is reportedly in sex rehab in Arizona will be present at the meeting by phone tomorrow and plans to challenge his firing by the Weinstein Company, the company he founded. This, after Weinstein's membership in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, was revoked over the weekend, and the Clinton Foundation told The Daily Mail it will not return as much as $250,000 in donations from Harvey Weinstein. Saying on Sunday: the money had already been spent on the organization's programs and used for charitable purposes.Meanwhile, Amazon is now apologizing after Studio Head, Roy Price was placed on leave, following allegations of sexual harassment by Amazon producer. In a memo to employees first published by BuzzFeed News, Amazon Executive Jeff Blackburn said in part: "The news coming out of Hollywood over the past weekend has been shocking and disturbing, and unfortunately, we are part of it. Amazon does not tolerate harassment or abuse of our employees or our business partners. If a concern is brought to your attention, we investigate it quickly and thoroughly."BARTIROMO: Well, part of the issue has they had the clause in the contract that basically said, if you get charged with sexual harassment, it's fine, you have to pay back the company. I mean --AMY HOLMES, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Pay to play.BARTIROMO: Right. So, that's why, I guess, he's saying, look, it's not right that I was fired because it was all there.HOLMES: Right. And that there are some speculations that this actually puts the company in more legal jeopardy because it indicates that, yes, in fact, they did know that Mr. Weinstein had a predilection predatory behavior. And I'm curious about the Amazon thing that they say that they investigate? Well, apparently, this producer had complaint about this person's behavior toward her and he was still, you know --BARTIROMO: So, how much investigating?HOLMES: Would they really get to the bottom of that?KELLY: Well, the really -- the hard part when you're talking about the sexual harassment clause in the contract is it's a recognition of sexual harassment but the issue is the rape allegations that have come out.BARTIROMO: That's right.HOLMES: That's a criminal offense.KELLY: Let me finish. There's a big distinction between sexual harassment and a criminal rape allegation, right?CARRASCO: Yes.KELLY: So, I mean, there's no protection for him under that and I think that's why you saw the Academy really expel him because there is some legitimacy to those claims.BARTIROMO: And those rape claims are within the last five years or is it beyond the statute of limitations?HOLMES: Well, there is the sexual assault allegation from 2015 of the Italian model that said that he, you know, groped her and got him on tape, apparently admitting it. But getting back to the difference between, you know, the criminal complaints and the civil complaints, the criminal that has to do, of course, of putting Harvey Weinstein in jail. When it comes to the Weinstein company if this contract seems to indicate that they knew about ongoing sexual harassment, there is employment law that says, you don't get to wiggle out of it just because you find him, this is an employment law issue.BARTIROMO: What about this cover? New York Post today, Woody Allen: don't go all witch hunt over Harvey. He said multiple times, it's very sad -- particularly, it's very sad for the women involved as we all understand it and we all agree. But to say don't go all witch-hunt over Harvey from a fellow pervert himself, an accused molester --KELLY: Birds of the same feather flock together. This is just -- this is confirmation of the type of person that Weinstein is that -- if you have Woody Allen coming to your defense and he's the only one, then, you know what, there's probably some validity to a lot of the accusations that are out there.LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: And how about self- protection? I mean, that's so interesting. You might as well be drawing attention to your own actions in saying something like that. I don't even know why he --CARRASCO: He later had to come out and kind of clarify what he had said.BARTIROMO: Well, look who's still in the American -- the Motion Picture, right? Roman Polanski? Who else?CARTER: Bill Cosby.BARTIROMO: Bill Cosby.HOLMES: Right, and these are just the people we know. Let alone who else are all the bugs under that rug.BARTIROMO: What a story? Just an incredible turn of events. Harvey Weinstein, we will keep following that. Tracee?CARRASCO: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Tracee Carrasco. Still ahead, what is in the cards for the home of "House of Cards"? We've got a preview of quarterly earnings for Netflix next hour. MORNINGS WITH MARIA, back in a minute. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back! Good Monday morning, everybody. Thank so much for joining us this morning. Happy Monday to you. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, October 16th.

The9 Limited Announces Receipt of Nasdaq Notice of DeficiencyPR NewswireDecember 26, 2017 Tuesday 10:00 PM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 660 wordsDateline: SHANGHAI, Dec. 26, 2017 BodyThe9 Limited (Nasdaq: NCTY) ("The9" or the "Company"), an online game developer and operator, today announced that it received a notification letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. ("Nasdaq") dated December 20, 2017 indicating that the Company no longer meets the continued listing requirement of minimum Market Value of Publicly Held Shares ("MVPHS") for the Nasdaq Global Market, as set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(C), because the market value of the Company's publicly held American depositary shares ("ADS"), each representing one ordinary share of the Company, for the last 30 consecutive business days was below the minimum requirement of US$15,000,000.Pursuant to Rule 5810(c)(3)(D) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Company has a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until June 18, 2018 (the "Compliance Period"), to regain compliance with Nasdaq's minimum MVPHS requirement. If at any time during the Compliance Period, the Company's MVPHS closes at US$15,000,000 or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide the Company a written confirmation of compliance and the matter will be closed. In the event the Company does not regain compliance with Rule 5450(b)(2)(C) prior to the expiration of the compliance period, the Company will receive written notification that its securities are subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Global Market.The Company's management is looking into various options available to regain compliance and maintain its continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Market, and is also considering other options, including a potential transfer of its listing of securities to the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Nasdaq Capital Market is a continuous trading market that operates in substantially the same manner as the Nasdaq Global Market where listed companies must meet certain financial requirements and comply with Nasdaq's corporate governance requirements. The Company is confident that, if the business conditions and the Nasdaq Listing Rules warrant, the Company can regain compliance with Nasdaq's minimum MVPHS requirement within the Compliance Period.Safe Harbor StatementThis announcement contains forward-looking statements.

Bitcoin Price Hits a New All-time High; FinancialBuzz.com News CommentaryPR NewswireOctober 13, 2017 Friday 9:00 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1972 wordsDateline: NEW YORK, October 13, 2017 BodyBitcoin price rose to a new all-time high on Thursday due to increasing investor interest in the cryptocurrency. The price of bitcoin jumped 11.28 percent to $5,375.72 during Thursday's session, according to data from CoinDesk. The new record surpassed its previous high of $5,013.91 on September 2nd. The recent rally in Bitcoin brings its market capitalization to about 89 billion. Bitcoin is the biggest digital currency by market cap, accounting for over 54 percent of the total cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin was up about 23 percent this month and has gained over 430 percent year-to-date. Chineseinvestors.com, Inc. (OTC: CIIX), Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTC: GBTC), Riot Blockchain Inc. (NASDAQ: BIOP), Overstock.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: OSTK), Global Arena Holding Inc. (OTC: GAHC)Speculation that China may resume cryptocurrency trading and increasing trading volumes in other Asian countries such as Japan and South Korea boosted bitcoin prices. According to a report from Cryptocoinnews.com, the Chinese government is considering licensing exchanges for cryptocurrencies. Last month, the world's second largest economy banned initial coin offerings (ICOs) and shut down operation of cryptocurrency exchanges, which caused a bitcoin price drop to a low of $2,980 in mid-September. "Speculators are bullish on bitcoin's value with the anticipation of China's reintegration with global crypto markets," Aurelien Menant, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Gatecoin, said in a CNBC report on Thursday.Chineseinvestors.com, Inc.(OTCQB: CIIX) announced earlier this week that, "the Company has launched the first cryptocurrency daily video newscast in the Chinese language, entitled Bitcoin Multimillionaire, broadcast from the NYSE. The video newscast covers timely information and analysis regarding all aspects of the emerging digital currency world, including specific cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, industry trends, price movement, blockchain technology, and sector-related stocks and ETFs listed on major exchanges and the OTC market.""Many Chinese investors are seeking information and education related to the cryptocurrency sector," says Warren Wang, Founder and CEO of CIIX. "Moreover, in response to the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies and ICOs, governments around the world, including but not limited to, the United States, China, Japan, South Korea and Switzerland are weighing in and/or enacting regulatory policies regarding cryptocurrencies and ICOs. In the United States, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recently announced that it is considering a new trading operation dedicated to bitcoin and other digital currencies."In addition, CIIX also has plans to launch a new cryptocurrency website under the domain name newcoin168.com to serve Chinese cryptocurrency investors. The site, expected to launch next month, will endeavor to be a leader in digital media and cryptocurrency and blockchain technology education providing straightforward explanations of cryptocurrency basics, trading guidelines, real-time market commentary and analysis regarding currency mining, blockchain technology, industry hotspots, sector-related stock trends and ETFs, and other strategies and opportunities to capitalize on the bitcoin market."After the recent launch of our Bitcoin Multimillionaire daily video newscast, the Company has decided to further expand its presence in the digital currency sector," says Wang. "Similar to U.S. stocks, as the price of digital currency, such as Bitcoin, continues to increase, Chinese people all over the world are taking notice and seeking access to timely information regarding market trends, news, and analysis. We look forward to being the premier source for this information."Bitcoin Investment Trust(OTCQX: GBTC) is a publicly-quoted security that is solely invested in and originating value from the price of bitcoin. The BIT exposes the value and price movement of bitcoin to investors through a traditional investment vehicle, without requiring the purchase, storing and safekeeping of bitcoins. The Bitcoin Investment Trust tracks the bitcoin market price, fees and expenses.Riot Blockchain Inc.(NASDAQ: BIOP) leverages its expertise and network to build and support blockchain technology companies. Recently, the company announced it has made a strategic investment in Coinsquare Ltd., one of Canada's leading exchanges for trading digital currencies. This investment into a blockchain-focused company is indicative of similar opportunities Riot Blockchain plans to pursue, including possible acquisitions of businesses serving the blockchain ecosystem. Blockchain protocols offer a secure way to store and relay information without the need for middlemen. It uses a decentralized and encrypted ledger that offers a secure, efficient, verifiable, and permanent way of storing records and other information. Blockchain protocols are the backbone of numerous digital cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin.Overstock.com, Inc.(NASDAQ: OSTK) is the first major retailer to accept multiple cryptocurrencies as payment. On August 8, 2017, the company announced an integration with ShapeShift, the world's leading instant digital asset exchange, that allows customers to use all the major cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, Monero, and the new Bitcoin Cash, to buy online from Overstock's selection of nearly 4 million products, including, furniture, accessories, bedding, décor, rugs, DIY, and more. ShapeShift allows digital currencies to be easily converted between different coin types in a matter of seconds, all without any account setup or personal data required. Instead, the funds are sent to a specific address, with the blockchain record of the transaction acting as both the order and the receipt.Global Arena Holding Inc.(OTC: GAHC) is a holding and technology development company. The company is focused on acquiring technologies, patents and companies having the ability to leverage the blockchain crypto technology. GAHC incorporated GAHI Acquisition Corp. to be the merger subsidiary for the acquisition of Blockchain Technologies Corporation ("BTC"). Currently, GAHC and BTC have entered into an acquisition arrangement where BTC will merge with GAHI Acquisition Corp. BTC is a technology company which leverages the underlying crypto technology of Bitcoin [Blockchain], acting as a seed accelerator. BTC currently features a number of innovative startups utilizing the Blockchain and operating within the crypto technology field.Subscribe Now!

Alibaba and JD.com's Latest Numbers Provide Much to Smile AboutRealMoneyNovember 13, 2017 Monday 10:22 PM EDTCopyright 2017 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 886 wordsByline: Eric JhonsaHighlight: The Chinese e-commerce giants saw impressive third-quarter sales growth and even better Singles Day volume growth. A few different trends are giving them a lift.BodyFor a little while in 2016 and early 2017, as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.'s  transaction growth slowed, and worries about slowing Chinese GDP growth picked up, it didn't seem far-fetched to think that China's online retail boom was slowing down in a meaningful way.But today, as Alibaba and top rival JD.com Inc.  bask in the glow of very strong third-quarter and Singles Day numbers, such worries are looking antiquated. Just as Amazon.com Inc.  has been able to accelerate its U.S. growth this year thanks to both the local e-commerce market's growth and share gains made possible by its superior scale and resources, China's e-commerce giants are seeing the good times roll on.For Singles Day (Nov. 11, by far China's biggest online shopping day),  its gross merchandise volume (GMV) for transactions settled via the Alipay payments platform grew 39% annually to $25.3 billion. That's above the 32% growth registered during last year's Singles Day, as well as the 22% GMV growth Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall marketplaces saw in fiscal 2017 (it ended in March).JD, which didn't disclose Singles Day numbers in prior years, reports its GMV for the Nov. 1-11 period grew more than 50% to $19.1 billion. That's a little better than the 46% GMV growth JD saw in 2016.JD's shares rose 3.5% on Nov. 13 to $41.34, following both the release of its Singles Day event data and a better-than-feared Q3 report. The company's sales rose 39% annually in Q3 to $12.61 billion, slightly topping a $12.59 billion consensus. GMV rose 44% to $32.9 billion.Those growth rates, it's worth noting, represent a slowdown from the 44% revenue growth and 53% GMV growth JD saw in Q2. And growth might slow a little more this quarter: JD is guiding for 35% to 39% Q4 sales growth.But from the looks of things, the culprit here isn't slowing demand growth, but tougher competition from Alibaba, whose Tmall marketplace (it caters to larger merchants) has stepped up its efforts to grow sales within verticals such as electronics and apparel. On its earnings call, JD said it recently lost over 100 merchants from its marketplace due to attempts by a rival (clearly Alibaba) to force merchants to choose between its platform and JD's.JD added the merchants that left were all "major domestic apparel brands," and that it hasn't seen any big foreign brands depart. Nonetheless, Alibaba dismisses JD's allegations, and insists merchants are free to use whichever online platforms they want.Alibaba, for its part, beat its September quarter estimates and reported its China Commerce Retail revenue, which covers Taobao, Tmall and offline Chinese businesses, grew 64% to $5.9 billion. That's better than the June quarter's 57% growth, not to mention the 43% growth seen in fiscal 2017.Alibaba doesn't break out the segment's quarterly GMV growth anymore. But for the second quarter in a row, it did announce that Tmall's "physical goods GMV" grew 49%. It also said that the segment's Commission revenue, which is driven by Tmall, saw growth improve to 47% from the June quarter's 28%. Customer Management revenue, which covers ads and other services provided to Taobao/Tmall merchants, grew 58%.Going forward, Alibaba wants to keep its momentum going by  in its Cainiao logistics platform, which the company recently upped its stake in to 51%. Cainiao relies on both its own infrastructure as well as those of partners to handle a large chunk of the orders placed on Alibaba's sites.Building up Cainiao's internal warehouse and delivery infrastructure would partly address what to date has been one of JD's core strengths. Namely, the quality control that comes with having your own logistics infrastructure, directly selling a large percentage of the goods offered on your platform and closely vetting which third parties sell on the platform. In April, JD created  , a move meant in part to let the company provide logistics services for merchants using other platforms.In addition to share gains against smaller rivals with less mindshare, product selection and economies of scale, a few different trends have been giving both Alibaba and JD a lift this year:After moderating in prior years, China's GDP growth has inched higher this year, defying fears of a continued slowdown. It came in at 6.9% in Q3. Disposable income growth continues growing faster than GDP, as China's middle class swells . It also doesn't hurt that the Chinese government has been  consumer spending. China's relatively poor physical retail infrastructure, together with the big investments Alibaba, JD and others have been making in improving online delivery and lowering fulfillment costs, are allowing e-commerce to claim an outsized share of retail transactions in many urban locales. The aforementioned trends are also contributing to booming sales of fresh food, bulkier consumer staples and other items one would normally expect to buy offline. JD says it sold over 20,000 tons of fresh products from Nov. 1 to 11. China remains a trendsetter when it comes to mobile commerce and payments. Mobile devices accounted for 79% of Alibaba's fiscal 2017 mobile GMV, and a whopping 90% of the company's Alipay-based Singles Day GMV this year. Until those growth drivers show signs of abating, Chinese e-commerce remains as powerful of a growth story as one will find in tech.Load-Date: November 15, 2017End of Document

Victoria's Secret Fashion Show: Is It In Trouble After Gigi Hadid & Katy Perry Reportedly Banned?HollywoodlifeNovember 19, 2017Copyright 2017 Penske Media Corporation All Rights ReservedLength: 536 wordsBodyWith both Gigi Hadid and Katy Perry reportedly 'banned' from China, it seems the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show is falling apart! Plus, the VS staff reportedly thinks the government is 'spying' on them.Someone cue Rockwell's biggest hit, because supposedly the cast and crew of the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show think that "Somebody's Watching Me." Following            Katy Perry and            Gigi Hadid's exit of the show, reportedly due to visa issues, things are just getting worse for the Victoria's Secret gang, who now think that the Chinese government is reading their communications. "They want to discuss what's going on as far as replacements for those denied visas and alternative arrangements," a source told            Page Six, "but they have to be tight-lipped because it seems that the government is watching their e-mails."TV and media-industry insiders, who desperately want to figure out what the hell is going on, are getting "frustrated" messages from their colleagues in China, according to Page Six. However, with the government reportedly looking over their shoulders, these workers will have to hold their tongues until they get out of China. On top of that, Page Six reports that many fashion bloggers have been denied visas, and thus can't cover the event in person. The producers in charge of coordinating coverage are, according to Page Six, "on the verge of nervous breakdowns."China's banhanner also seemingly struck down Katy, 33, and Gigi, 22. Katy, who was rumored to make a surprise performance at the show, was reportedly denied a Visa after Chinese officials discovered she performed in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, in a dress covered in sunflowers. Sunflowers, as it turns out, have been adopted as a symbol by anti-China protesters. Perform in a dress covered in anti-China flowers? No visa for you, Katy!I'm so bummed I won't be able to make it to China this year. Love my VS family, and will be with all my girls in spirit!! Can't wait to tune in with everyone to see the beautiful show I know it will be, and already can't wait for next year! :) x- Gigi Hadid (@GiGiHadid) November 16, 2017Now, when Gigi announced she was pulling out of the VS Fashion Show (despite confirming in August that returning to the event was "a dream come true") she didn't say anything about visas, but sources told            Page Six she was among the group of models denied entry into China over offensive social media posts. Gigi, as fans may remember, appeared in a February Instagram video where she held up a biscuit shaped like the Buddha and seemingly squinted her eyes in an apparent racist gesture. Though           Gigi apologized, it seems that wasn't good enough.Well, as the saying goes, "The show must go on." Harry Styles,            Leslie Odom Jr. and Jane Zhang are set to perform at the show - that is, unless something elsegoes wrong.What do you think about this "chaos," HollywoodLifersLaunch Gallery: Gigi Hadid: Victoria's Secret Fashion Show Through The YearsRelated stories24 Hottest VS Fashion Show Looks Of All-Time: Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid & More5 Moves To Get A Tight, Toned Body Like Victoria's Secret Model Alessandra AmbrosioBella Hadid Shows Off Angelic Figure Preparing For VS Show After Gigi Reveals She's Not GoingLoad-Date: November 19, 2017End of Document

Gartner Says Worldwide Device Shipments Will Increase 2 Percent in 2018, Reaching Highest Year-Over-Year Growth Since 2015Targeted News ServiceOctober 17, 2017 Tuesday 4:56 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 692 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: EGHAM, UK BodyGartner, a information technology research and advisory company, issued the following news release:Worldwide shipments of PCs, tablets and smartphones are predicted to exceed 2.35 billion units in 2018, an increase of 2.0 percent from 2017, according to Gartner, Inc. This would be the highest year-over-year growth since 2015.The misconception persists that the world has gone mobile and relies solely on smartphones. "However, our latest online end-user survey* shows that users depend just as much on PCs or tablets as they do on smartphones," said Ranjit Atwal, research director at Gartner. "Forty percent of respondents said that they use mostly a PC/tablet for certain daily experiences, such as reading and writing detailed emails or watching videos, while 34 percent mostly use a smartphone for its convenience while on the move."Mr. Atwal added: "Users holding onto their PCs for longer remains a major issue for the PC market. In contrast, users continue to replace their smartphone quite frequently."Traditional PC shipments are forecast to decline 4.4 percent in 2018 while mobile phone shipments are expected to increase 2.4 percent (see Table 1).See the table here (https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3816763).Driven by Positive Business PC Sales, PC Market to Grow 0.8 Percent in 2018Business PC shipments are estimated to return to growth by the end of 2017, driven by faster Windows 10 replacement in many regions, especially in Western Europe. "Despite the fact that prices have been rising due to higher component costs, Windows 10 replacements have kept the PC market relatively stable through 2017," said Mr. Atwal. "We estimate that the PC market (desk-based, notebook and ultramobiles) is set to return to 0.8 percent growth in 2018."This upward trend is assisted by two factors. The PC market in Russia has been positively influenced by an upturn in the country's economic prospects, which has seen business spending on PCs increase by 5 percent in 2017. This growth will persist into 2018. Spending is primarily focused on desktop PCs, which are more aggressively priced than mobile PCs or hybrid devices.The second factor is China, where the move to Windows 10 has been delayed due to security and privacy issues, leading to slow PC sales in 2017. However, Microsoft is now working with a Chinese government agency to develop a government-approved version. "The features of Windows 10 could be particularly useful for the Chinese Government that is looking to move from desktops and notebooks to ultramobile premium devices," said Mr. Atwal. "We expect this development to positively impact the PC market in 2018."Smartphone Sales to Total More Than 1.6 Billion Units in 2018Mobile phone sales are expected to return to year-over-year growth in 2018, with shipments totaling 1.9 billion units. Smartphones will represent 86 percent of total mobile phone shipments in 2018, up 6 percent from 2017.Gartner expects Apple's iPhone X to be the sales driver in North America, China and Western Europe, despite its high price. "Given the late November availability of the iPhone X, we expect the iPhone's replacement cycle to flow more strongly into 2018," said Roberta Cozza, research director at Gartner.Component shortages could lead to the inability to meet smartphone demand in the fourth quarter of 2017, further favoring unit sales moving into 2018. "Decrease in total mobile phone demand in 2017 is also expected to come from a weaker lower end of the smartphone market," said Ms. Cozza. "For this segment, local vendors continue to struggle against the shift toward top brands, while component price increases affect the ability of some Android vendors to compete more aggressively on price." While this is expecting to limit smartphone growth in 2017, the 2018 growth rate is accordingly estimated to be higher than previously forecast.More-detailed analysis is available to Gartner clients in the report "Forecast: PCs, Ultramobiles and Mobile Phones, Worldwide, 2015-2021, 3Q17 Update."Document provided to Targeted News Service as a news release through an RSS feed.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6037011 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: October 18, 2017End of Document

Crowdz Selected for TechCode AI+ Accelerator Program; Enabling expansion and collaboration with ChinaPR NewswireSeptember 26, 2017 Tuesday 12:30 PM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 989 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Sept. 26, 2017 BodyTechCode, the Beijing, China, based global innovation & entrepreneurship ecosystem builder, has announced the selection of Silicon Valley-based technology startup Crowdz-The B-Commerce Company(TM) as one of only 12 participants in its Fall 2017 AI+ Accelerator Program. Integrating a wide range of global resources, the TechCode AI+ Accelerator supports exceptionally innovative startups with the intellectual capital-including mentorship, subject-matter expertise, supply-chain resources, and programming-they need in order to commercialize their technologies.At the same time, Crowdz is participating in TechCode's multi-city China-based TechCode "Cowboy Trip" road show, a nine-day event in which Crowdz and the other eight participating startups presented to and met in person with scores of leading Chinese industrialists, government officials, investors, and the press in some of China's most advanced technology centers. The road show was co-sponsored by the China Fortune Land Development Co., Ltd., (CFLD) a leading expert in investment and operation of New Industry Cities in China.Finally, on Sept. 22, Crowdz was asked to participate in the "Supply Chain & Logistics China Mini Expo" in Shanghai, China. The mini-expo was sponsored by the Silicon Valley-based Plug and Play Supply Chain & Logistics Innovation Platform, a globally-focused technology accelerator dedicated to the development of innovative technology solutions for the supply chain and logistics.Crowdz's triple recognitions follow upon its selection earlier this year as one of only 26 participants in Plug and Play's Spring Retail & Brand Innovation Platform and as one of only 16 participants in Plug and Play's first-ever Supply Chain & Logistics Innovation Platform. More recently, the Government of South Korea selected Crowdz as one of only 50 participants in its 2017 Grand Challenge Program, for which more than 1,500 companies from more than 110 countries worldwide applied.Revolutionizing a $25 Trillion MarketCrowdz, co-founded and led by 20-year Cisco supply-chain veteran Payson E. Johnston, is pioneering the digitization and automation of business-to-business (B2B) commerce, or B-Commerce, throughout the world. The global B-Commerce market currently accounts for $25 trillion in business transactions each year. And yet, unlike the heavily digitized business-to-consumer (B2C) E-Commerce market, less than 30% of all global B-Commerce is now digitized.Johnston, whose startup is initially targeting both large enterprises and small-to-medium-size (SMB) companies in the United States and Pacific Asia, explains that the need for B-Commerce digitization and automation is intense-and the resulting inefficiencies are enormous. All told, companies worldwide are suffering a combined $4 trillion in unnecessary costs and lost sales each year-in large part because nearly three-quarters of all global B2B commerce still takes place in highly manual fashion, such as via paper catalogs, telephone orders, fax, email, EDI, & sales representatives."If Crowdz can help eliminate even a small percentage of these inefficiencies by revolutionizing an antiquated B-Commerce system," says Johnston, "that represents billions of dollars in value for businesses worldwide. We believe that this provides enormous growth opportunities for leading technology innovators like Crowdz."Building the Leading Global Innovation & Entrepreneurship EcosystemBeijing, China, based TechCode, recently named a "Top Overseas Startup Accelerator" by Entrepreneur Magazine, is building the leading global innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem by providing incubation, acceleration, venture funding, and strategic consulting to forward-thinking startups throughout the world.TechCode is committed to breaking down geographic barriers and eliminating the potential inequalities in international cooperation. It has established incubation systems in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Gu'an, Silicon Valley, Seoul, Tel Aviv, and Berlin to provide innovators with a global support network aimed at efficient sharing of resources and access to essential value-added services.At each stage of development, TechCode's networked incubation system integrates key innovative elements from around the world. By combining global vision with local insight, TechCode enables entrepreneurs to develop together with governments, economic organizations, and R&D institutions in exceedingly effective win-win partnerships.For more information on TechCode, see:http://www.techcode.com.About CrowdzSilicon Valley, California, based Crowdz, is building the world's first fully-automated B-Commerce transaction networks. Applying cutting-edge artificial-intelligence principles as well as emerging digital technologies like smart contracts and blockchain to antiquated B2B commerce systems, Crowdz will allow brands, manufacturers, and other suppliers to quickly identify and engage the right customers with the right products at exactly the right time-accelerating buyer sourcing and purchasing, opening lucrative new market opportunities, and multiplying sales volume.Founded in 2014, Crowdz is headed by Payson E. Johnston, former B2B supply-chain senior manager for Cisco, and its executive team boasts more than 80 years of combined experience in B2B sourcing, supply chain, retail, and ecommerce.

Ford Motor Company (F), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Making a DealUSNEWS.comDecember 6, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: INVESTING; Stock Market News; Vol.; No.Length: 538 wordsByline: Wayne DugganHighlight: Ford and Alibaba are reportedly teaming up in China.BodyFord Motor Co (NYSE:            F) has taken a lot of heat from investors for arriving late to the game with            driverless and electric vehicle technology. Now, however, a new partnership with China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (            BABA) suggests Ford is open to new ideas when it comes to the future of auto sales. This week, Ford and Alibaba are expected to finalize a deal emphasizing online auto sales in China and a direct-to-consumer "auto vending machine" concept. [See: 7 of the Best Stocks to Buy for 2018.]Ford has confirmed executive chairman Bill Ford Jr. and CEO Jim Hackett will make an announcement on Thursday in Hangzhou, China, where Alibaba's headquarters are located. An unnamed source at Ford tells Reuters that the company will announce a new partnership with            Alibaba that involves a push to sell more automobiles online in China via Alibaba's massive e-commerce platform Tmall. The vending machine concept involves a multi-level parking structure with hundreds of vehicles ready for purchase. Customers can choose a car to buy or test-drive using an app on their phone and have it delivered to them on the bottom floor of the structure within minutes. Alibaba says buyers with good credit could then choose to make a 10 percent down payment on a vehicle and continue to pay off the balance on a monthly basis through Alibaba's Alipay affiliate. Alibaba stock has been hit hard in recent weeks over fears of a government crackdown on high-interest "payday loans." Alibaba's finance arm banned these loans in late November, and the stock has fallen 10.4 percent in the past two weeks. Ford has struggled in China in recent months, and its effort to partner with a domestic Chinese company like Alibaba is a familiar approach for U.S. companies that want the Chinese government on their side. Earlier this week, Ford announced it plans to roll out 15 electric and hybrid models in China by 2025. IHS Markit analyst Namrita Chow says Ford's new China initiatives demonstrate the automaker is serious about turning the tide. [See: Car Companies and the Race to Profits.]"Ford's new strategy highlights the importance of China in the company's growth plans," Chow said this week, according to USA Today. "Its new strategy to significantly ramp up its deliverables to the local consumer base in China comes at a much-needed point for the automaker in China." Ford's China sales dropped 5 percent in October and are down 5 percent overall in 2017. Wayne Duggan is a freelance investment strategy reporter with a focus on energy and emerging market stocks.

AP FACT CHECK: Trump on veterans' health care, economyAssociated Press InternationalNovember 13, 2017 Monday 9:04 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: WASHINGTON DATELINE; AP Fact CheckLength: 1988 wordsByline: By CALVIN WOODWARD and HOPE YEN, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - Veterans Day prompted President Donald Trump and his administration to take stock of what's been done to fix health care for those in uniform. They claimed more progress than has been made.That tendency to overreach extended to trade and the economy as Trump visited Japan, South Korea, Japan and then Vietnam, where he told U.S. veterans of the Vietnam War that the Department of Veterans Affairs has made "amazing" strides and already "is a whole new place."His remarks and a White House account of progress at the VA did not acknowledge old problems that persist. For example, a key effort to improve waiting times by revamping the VA's electronic medical record system may not be completed for eight more years - when Trump will be out of office.A look at some statements about the VA and other topics arising from his travels and over the past week:WHITE HOUSE: "President Trump signed the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017, taking action to streamline the appeals process for disability compensation claims within the VA. More than 470,000 veterans are awaiting pending decisions regarding their appeals."THE FACTS: Trump signed the bill in August, part of a bid to reduce a rapidly growing claims backlog, but its immediate impact is overstated, as it will have no effect on the 470,000 pending claims.Under the legislation, veterans will be able to file "express" appeals if they waive their right to a hearing or the ability to submit new evidence.While lawmakers hope the legislation ultimately could reduce average wait times to less than a year, it applies almost entirely to newly filed appeals.Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin has said the VA would need Congress to approve an additional $800 million for "hiring surges" of additional appeals processors if the VA hoped to clear its current backlog within 10 years.___TRUMP: "Right now, our trade with Japan is not fair and it's not open, but I know it will be, soon. We want free and reciprocal trade, but right now our trade with Japan is not free and it's not reciprocal." And: "Many millions of cars are sold by Japan into the United States, whereas virtually no cars go from the United States into Japan." - remarks to business leaders in Tokyo on Monday.THE FACTS: When Trump calls for reciprocity in Japan-U.S. trade, he might want to be careful what he wishes for.With autos, for example, Japan places no tariff on fully assembled vehicles that are imported. But the U.S. has a 2.5 percent tariff on most imported vehicles - 25 percent on pickup trucks. That imbalance - or lack of reciprocity - favors the U.S.It's true U.S. vehicle sales in Japan pale in comparison with Japanese sales in the U.S. Detroit has long complained about regulations that stop U.S. carmakers from opening dealerships or selling cars in Japan. But there are other reasons for the disparity in the auto trade, as well. For example, Japan uses right-hand-drive vehicles; the U.S. mainly makes left-hand-drive vehicles in its domestic industry.And Trump's point about Japanese vehicles pouring into the U.S. is somewhat off the mark. Made-in-Japan vehicles are a distinct minority of the vehicles sold in the U.S. by Japanese automakers.More than half the vehicles sold in the U.S. by Japanese manufacturers are built in the U.S., says the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. Three-quarters of them are built in North America.___WHITE HOUSE statement Thursday: "President Trump announced that the Department of Veterans Affairs will adopt the same Electronic Health Record as the Department of Defense. VA's adoption ... will ultimately result in all patient data residing in one common system, enabling the immediate availability of service members' medical records and seamless care between the departments."THE FACTS: While the administration did announce in June that it would overhaul the VA's aging information technology system, Shulkin admitted to Congress last month that the project to revamp electronic medical records won't be completed for seven to eight years. The full costs of the project also are not known and have yet to be budgeted.An upgraded IT system is central to the VA's effort to reduce wait times for medical care as well as to fulfill Trump's promise of increasing private care options for veterans. Under Shulkin's plan to expand the Choice private-sector program, the VA would outsource more routine veterans' care to private providers including MinuteClinics while treating more complex injuries. Success of that plan requires a seamless sharing of medical records not only with the Pentagon but also with private physicians, a capability the VA does not currently have.Shulkin also has yet to negotiate pricing for the no-bid contract with the company that designed the Pentagon's IT system, estimated to cost at least $16 billion. The big price tag has spurred bills in Congress to require regular updates from the VA on timeliness and cost projections, as well as risks such as breaches to patient privacy.___WILBUR ROSS, U.S. commerce secretary: "Today's signings are a good example of how we can productively build up our bilateral trade." - remarks Thursday in Beijing.XI JINPING, China's president: "During this visit, the two sides signed over $250 billion U.S. of commercial deals and two-way investment agreements." - remarks Thursday in Beijing.THE FACTS: Papers signed in China during Trump's visit were largely a packaging of previously worked-out deals, tentative investments, statements of intent and extensions of business with existing Chinese customers, with some new orders. They do not point to a turnaround in deep-seated trade tensions between China and the U.S.Such signing ceremonies in China are often just that, ceremonial. They typically represent purchases that Chinese customers already planned to make and held off on announcing. General Motors' $2.2 billion piece of the package, for example, consists mostly of selling parts to its existing joint venture with the Chinese government.Alaska, however, welcomed an agreement that could spur construction of a long-sought pipeline to ship natural gas from the North Slope to a port for export to Asia. Oil companies backed away from the project, but the agreement with Chinese interests means all parties will work toward a decision by the end of next year on whether to proceed.___WHITE HOUSE: "President Trump has ensured continued access to care in the Veterans Choice Program by signing the VA Choice and Quality Employment Act, authorizing $2.1 billion in additional funds for the Veterans Choice Program."THE FACTS: This statement glosses over one of several budget shortfalls by the VA. Congress was forced in August to approve $2.1 billion in emergency money to keep Choice running after the VA had repeatedly understated costs of the program, assuring lawmakers for much of the year that money would last until January. Shulkin subsequently revealed an emergency shortfall in June that threatened medical care for tens of thousands of veterans.The $2.1 billion was intended to last until February. But weeks after receiving the money, the VA acknowledged that money for Choice would again run out sooner than expected, requiring Congress to approve additional stopgap financing before the end of the year or face disruptions to veterans' health care.Lawmakers have yet to act, in part as the Trump administration sorts out longer-term costs to the private-sector program.___WHITE HOUSE: "The VA has launched its 'Access and Quality Tool,' allowing veterans to see online the wait times at VA locations."THE FACTS: An effort started by Shulkin when he was VA undersecretary of health in President Barack Obama's administration, the VA website www.accesstocare.va.gov provides data on wait times as well as on veterans' satisfaction ratings in getting timely appointments, something that no other health care system in the country does.Still, major veterans groups such as Veterans of Foreign Wars have faulted the data for being misleading and not depicting wait times the way a typical person would view it.The Government Accountability Office, for instance, has noted that the data for returning patients do not include the amount of wait time from when a veteran initially asks for care and when a scheduler reaches out to set an appointment, which it said could be lengthy. In addition, GAO earlier this year continued to find evidence that VA data can be unreliable because of schedulers recording wrong dates or changing dates outright, though the VA says it is implementing new checks and training to help identify "outliers" in scheduling.Veterans of Foreign Wars told Congress last month that its survey found only 67 percent of veterans said they had obtained a VA appointment within 30 days, less than the 93 percent that VA reports.___WHITE HOUSE: "The White House has opened a brand new VA Hotline staffed principally by veterans and direct family members of veterans to ensure that no complaint goes unaddressed."THE FACTS: It opened, but it did not get off to a smooth start. Trump pledged during the presidential campaign to create a "private White House hotline" answered by a real person 24 hours a day to take complaints from veterans, leading the VA to create a hotline beginning in June. Originally scheduled to be fully operational by Aug. 15, it has encountered some delays. In a letter to the VA last month, Sen. Jon Tester, the top Democrat on the Veterans Affairs Committee, complained, "The White House is frequently routing these calls back to local VA offices, which are often understaffed and do not have the ability to address the additional casework in a timely manner."Tester noted the VA already had several existing options for receiving complaints from veterans and urged better coordination to make sure no one falls through the cracks.___TRUMP: "Numbers are phenomenal over the last - since November 8th, Election Day. Our unemployment is at a 17-year low. We've gotten almost 2 million more people in the workforce in just that short period of time. I've reduced regulations terrifically, frankly, if I do say so myself." - remarks to business leaders in Tokyo, Monday. Tweet from previous weekend: "Unemployment is down to 4.1%, lowest in 17 years. 1.5 million new jobs created since I took office. Highest stock Market ever, up $5.4 trill."THE FACTS: His numbers are close to the mark. Trump can rightfully brag about the U.S. economy, but it's not quite as exceptional as he says, and he can't yet legitimately claim that his record on job creation is vastly superior to Obama's. Many of the economic figures he cites are advancing a recovery from the Great Recession that dates back to the middle of 2009.The unemployment rate did slip to 4.1 percent in October. But that was in part because many Americans gave up searching for work - one of the criticisms Trump made of Obama's record during the 2016 campaign.Trump also takes credit for helping create on average 168,500 jobs a month, but Obama in 2016 averaged about 187,000 jobs a month. Of course, hiring should slow as the unemployment rate declines because fewer people are searching for work. When someone stops seeking a job and drops out of the labor force, this person is no longer counted among the officially unemployed.As for the stock market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average returned to its previous peak in March 2013 and has been setting records ever since. The promise of corporate tax cuts by Trump has helped the stock market, but many of the gains rest on the foundations of an economic recovery that saw corporate profits climb.___Associated Press writers David Koenig in Dallas, Tom Krisher in Detroit and Joe McDonald in Beijing contributed to this report.___Find AP Fact Checks at https://apnews.com/tag/APFactCheckEDITOR'S NOTE _ A look at the veracity of claims by political figuresLoad-Date: November 14, 2017End of Document

Could Facebook Be Tried for Human-Rights Abuses?Atlantic OnlineDecember 20, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 3977 wordsByline: Ingrid BurringtonBodyIt's almost quaint to think that just five years ago, Mark Zuckerberg cheerfully took credit for major pro-democracy movements during Facebook's IPO launch. Contradicting his previous dismissal of the connection between social media and the Arab Spring, Zuckerberg's letter to investors spoke not just about the platform's business potential but also its capacity to increase "direct empowerment of people, more accountability for officials, and better solutions to some of the biggest problems of our time." 2012 Facebook promised a rise of new leaders "who are pro-internet and fight for the rights of their people, including the right to share what they want and the right to access all information that people want to share with them." Technically, that promise came true, though probably not how Zuckerberg imagined.Today, the company has to reckon with its role in passively enabling human-rights abuses. While concerns about propaganda and misinformation on the platform reached a fever pitch in places like the United States in the past year, its presence in Myanmar has become the subject of global attention. During the past few months, the company was accused of censoring activists and journalists            documenting incidents of and posting about what the            State Department has called ethnic cleansing of the country's Rohingya minority. Because misinformation and propaganda against the Rohingya            apparently avoided the community-standards scrutiny afforded activist speech, and because of the News Feed's tendency to promote already-popular content, posts with misinformation aiming to incite violence have easily gone viral. Experts describe Facebook's            role in the country as the de facto internet, which gives all of their actions and inactions on content even greater influence on politics and public knowledge.Platform entanglement in human-rights abuses isn't unique to Facebook. Earlier this year, YouTube deployed a content-moderation algorithm intended to remove terrorist content,            inadvertently deleting archives of footage that Syrian activists had been collecting as war-crimes evidence. Some have made similar criticisms of American platforms operating abroad, including Twitter's            compliance with Turkish government requests for censorship, and similar acts by platforms in China.The 2016 election has given platform regulation new traction in American policy circles, bringing debate in the United States closer to Europe's. But beyond Western electoral politics, there remain hard legal questions with far more human lives at stake. While the violence in Myanmar predates Facebook's presence in the country and absolutely can't be fully laid at their feet, the platform is a central source of online information, and in Myanmar            propaganda legitimizing crimes against humanity can have massive reach and influence. Dissident voices posting poems about the crisis have been declared in violation of vaguely defined community standards (and, while those decisions have sometimes been reversed, it's usually after receiving media attention, which not all incidents are likely to receive). There's been coverage and documentation of hate speech on the platform in Myanmar            since 2014, which is to say Facebook has been aware of the issue for quite some time.When asked about what resources the company has allocated to address misinformation and hate speech, Facebook spokesperson Ruchika Budhraja responded via email that "we have steadily increased our investment over the years in the resources and teams that assist in ensuring our services are used by people in Myanmar to connect in a meaningful and safe way." Projects like illustrated print copies of their            community standards translated into Burmese comics in 2015, partnerships with civil-society groups, and a            Facebook safety page for Myanmar with PDFs of the illustrated community standards and safety guide are among the digital-literacy campaigns that, Budhraja wrote, "have reached millions of people, and we listen to local community groups so that we can continue to refine the way in which we implement and promote awareness of our policies to help keep our community safe."This is encouraging, though Facebook still has no full-time staff on the ground in Myanmar. Regardless of past and ongoing good-faith efforts from Facebook to try to address what's happening now, the damage has been and continues to be done.While advocates and journalists made compelling moral and ethical arguments for Facebook to take action this past fall, legal liability remained conspicuously absent. There's no agreed-upon point at which a platform's automated actions at scale rise to a potentially illegal level of complicity in crimes against humanity, and seemingly little agreement about what is to be done after that point is reached.That's partly because it's extremely unlikely that Facebook (or the other big platforms) will ever be deemed legally liable or legally compelled to accountability for playing a significant role in human-rights abuses around the world. Even posing the question of a platform's legal culpability for human-rights abuses seems a quixotic pursuit, based on the reaction when I've brought it up with attorneys and human-rights advocates. The apparent absurdity of pursuing legal accountability seems to have less to do with the innocence or guilt of platforms and more to do with the realities of human-rights law, which has a poor track record with regard to corporations in general and which is uniquely challenged and complicated by tech platforms in particular.To assume one might hold a company legally responsible for human-rights abuses also assumes there's a jurisdiction that can hear the case. The International Criminal Court isn't really set up to try companies-and, even if it were, it can only bring cases against nations whose governments are signatories to the Rome Statute (the treaty that established the ICC). The United States signed but never ratified the treaty and formally withdrew its signature in 2002. The ICC technically can bring cases on behalf of member countries (as ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda argued this year when            requesting to investigate the United States on behalf of member state Afghanistan), but Myanmar isn't a member.Filing a case in the country where human-rights abuses take place is difficult, because an oppressive regime's court system is unlikely to actually offer a fair trial to victims. In the United States, noncitizens can file civil suits against American companies that have violated international treaties under the somewhat obscure 1789 Alien Tort Statute. But case law isn't exactly in the victim's favor with the statute. Companies tend to have more success, particularly in light of 2013's Supreme Court case            Kiobel vs. Royal Dutch Petroleum, which ruled that the statute technically doesn't apply to actions taken outside the United States (though, seeing as Facebook has no full-time employees in Myanmar and the News Feed is worked on by engineers in the United States, there might still be an argument here). Given the overhead and exhaustion of legal battles with well-lawyered companies, and given companies' preference to make bad PR quietly disappear, at best victims might settle out of court.Assuming one settles the thorny jurisdiction question, it's difficult to identify what crime Facebook has committed. Lack of foresight isn't actually a crime against humanity. Furthermore, "the persecution and discrimination against the Rohingya has been going on for quite some time, and it would be happening if Facebook was not there at all," pointed out Cynthia Wong, a senior researcher on internet and human rights at Human Rights Watch.Then again, Wong noted, "I do think in general Facebook has not fully grappled with the harms that its platform can contribute to" when it serves as a population's de facto internet and, therefore, central source for information. Acting as foundational communications infrastructure, of course, doesn't make the company responsible for the content on the site, hateful as it may be. The operator of German printing presses wasn't sentenced to execution at Nuremberg,            the editor of Der Stuermer was, and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act protects platforms from liability for content posted by users on the platform.But comparisons of Facebook to the printing press start to seem flimsy when considering the power and influence of the News Feed. "When they start taking that step of targeting information, I think there's an argument to potentially be made that they're no longer just like any other publishing outlet but that they're actually actively participating in who sees what and with what degree of impact," said Alexa Koenig, the director of UC Berkeley's Human Rights Center.Facebook doesn't make the content and isn't liable for it beyond its own community standards, but it does make, manage, and moderate the systems that move certain content to the top of a user's News Feed, in the service of keeping more users engaged with content on the platform and thus placing more eyeballs on ads. Algorithmic content curation and targeting, this argument goes, is still an act of curation and targeting. In this case, Facebook's curation (or lack thereof) gave a greater platform and credibility to misinformation and propaganda advocating ethnic cleansing. In the case of graphic content documenting atrocities against Rohingya that were taken down by moderators, the decisions about what not to publish and interpretation of takedown policies are also decisions that go beyond passively posting content.But is reverse-chron sorting or content moderation a particular right? Probably not. "You could say that they're violating the right to truth or information, but those rights are really limited in scope," explained Steven Ratner, a law professor at the University of Michigan. "There is no explicit right to accurate news in any [international human-rights] treaties."One term frequently invoked when platforms passively facilitate abuse or violence is Dictionary.com's            word of the year, "complicit"-which can be invoked in law, but not with the gossamer flourish of moral appeal. "Complicity" as a legal concept in international law tends to be used to hold accountable bureaucrats or underlings who were "just following orders" in a genocidal regime, and far harder to apply to companies. It requires proof that the accused knowingly aided and abetted (usually state, but possibly non-state) abuses, and in so doing either actively sought the abusive outcome or materially benefited from it.This is part of the argument in            recent lawsuits against platforms from victims of terrorist attacks and surviving families, which argue that platforms aren't liable for the existence of terrorist content on their platforms, but that they are liable for profiting from their promotion of that content on their platform. Protections against content liability, the argument goes, don't apply to automated advertisements.Material gain from rights abuses was also at stake in Xiaoning et al. vs. Yahoo, the lawsuit filed in 2007 following Yahoo's cooperation with the Chinese government's requests for user data that led to the imprisonment and abuse of two dissidents. In that case, the evidence of intent and benefit were much more cut-and-dried than trying to argue the subtleties of what is and isn't covered by Section 230. The case resulted in a settlement and the creation of a fund to support Chinese activists that recently became subject to a            new lawsuit.Even hard proof of complicity and material gain doesn't always translate into a successful suit depending on the time lapsed since the abuses and the jurisdiction of the lawsuit. To this day, IBM has never been successfully sued for its role in            the Holocaust, partly due to jurisdictional disputes and statutes of limitations. During World War II, several of IBM's European subsidiaries supplied the Nazi regime with punch-card technology that was used to facilitate the Final Solution in all its bureaucratic horror, from tracking the trains used to transport Jews to concentration camps to providing the rudimentary foundation for the infamous numbered tattoos at Auschwitz. (IBM has never disavowed these facts; it only disputes the claim that their New York headquarters had full knowledge of their subsidiaries' actions.)There are other legal concepts that might better capture Facebook's impact and potential liability. Koenig brought up possibilities in American civil tort law. "I could see lawyers arguing that there's been negligence due to these companies creating new vulnerabilities that give rise to a heightened duty of care." Duty of care is a concept more pedantic than its poetic phrasing suggests-it's a term for a person or company's legal obligation to reasonably act to prevent foreseeable harms. In addition to negligence, Koenig noted that "perhaps most interesting is the possible application of a recklessness standard-that the companies knew or should have known that they were creating dependencies that led to new vulnerabilities that allowed criminal activities and other harms to occur." The legal questions here would include whether or how Facebook understands itself as a form of core infrastructure in nation-states, what responsibilities infrastructural companies have to prevent or foresee harms, whether it can be reasonably argued that the infrastructure itself facilitates or enables harms, and whether Facebook's efforts to promote digital literacy and increase awareness of community standards demonstrated sufficient effort to mitigate them.Assuming that the laws currently on the books aren't being used or can't be used to hold companies accountable, what potential laws could? Approaches in the United States and Germany are more focused on specific platform dynamics in those countries-           campaign-advertising disclosure or            heavy fines for failing to take down hate speech.As the director of the            Dangerous Speech Project, the American University adjunct associate professor Susan Benesch understands the common reflex to try to use law to regulate online content-or to force platforms to do it-but believes there are a lot of good reasons for caution. For one thing, Benesch argued, laws against specific kinds of speech tend to be more often used against the marginalized than the powerful. For another, enforcement of censorship laws tends to be overzealous, especially when censorship is outsourced by governments to private actors.Benesch doubts that Facebook or any other company has software sophisticated enough to automate the kind of nuanced comprehension needed to understand the harms of specific kinds of speech in a variety of social contexts, and would be likely to take down too much content. "Laws that compel people to do things exert enormous pressure toward overregulation. The software just isn't ready to effectively discern at scale."Cynthia Wong at Human Rights Watch also expressed skepticism. "The challenge is that in many countries, governments themselves are part of the problem [of hate speech]. So the government is using Facebook to spread misinformation and hate speech against minorities. It's not something you can lay completely at the feet of Facebook-it's not their job to fix what governments are doing."Facebook's actual job is serving their shareholders, which usually means getting more people on Facebook and selling more advertisements. Like most platforms, it prefers self-regulation and making promises to be a better actor over government regulation that might undermine that primary mission. But Benesch also pointed out that Facebook's public-facing community standards for content moderation are pretty vague ("just like the Constitution," she cheerfully noted) and their internal guidelines for content moderation are generally opaque (or were, until someone            leaked them to ProPublica). It's the vagueness of those policies that leads moderators to flag posts documenting Burmese military actions while misinformation continues to be posted by the ultranationalist Buddhist monk Ashin Wirathu, who was banned from publicly preaching in Myanmar because the vitriolic nature of his speech was fueling ethnic cleansing.To be clear, it's not as though anyone has publicly stated they want to sue Facebook over its actions or inactions in Myanmar-as reporting from this past fall indicated, most activists and Muslims in the country are more concerned with the state enacting or passively letting violence spread than the platform, though there's definitely a desire to see Facebook do more and be more responsive and attentive. The reason to seek out a legal context for the company's actions is because at the end of the day Facebook's track record of being actually shamed into action by moral outcry is pretty weak, and in its idealized form law might be where such outcry can bear regulatory or financial consequence that might actually force the company to act. The reason to follow these legal dead ends to their utmost conclusion is to recognize that the formal and informal tools available (and the ones being proposed) are pretty ill-equipped for the actual task at hand.To leave the power to regulate speech in the hands of a self-regulating Facebook has proven untenable for preventing harm; to re-situate that power with government is an easy recipe for perpetuating it. In both cases, power and agency remain out of the hands of the citizens directly impacted by these systems. And while Facebook promotes its work with civil society and governments to improve digital literacy and content moderation in countries around the world, these efforts are a cold comfort to people who have already lost their homes, families, and livelihoods-which, again, is not directly due to Facebook but is a reality they're implicated in. Piecemeal additions of flagged terms and hiring more moderators to make dire judgement calls is better than nothing, but dwarfed by the scale and complexity of the problem.Facebook acting as an unwitting propaganda engine for ethnic cleansing (or at best knowingly trying, but still failing, to avoid being a propaganda engine) is perhaps the worst-case scenario of a larger systemic problem of the ease with which platforms can be manipulated in the service of hate speech and misinformation. How many more tragedies like it can societies afford while platforms work toward the promise of nuanced content moderation operating at the same scale as content propagation?The option of Facebook simply ceasing operations in areas where their platform is manipulated to enable human-rights abuses also seems an unsatisfying outcome. As Jonathan Zittrain of Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society put it, "[Facebook] abdicating feels weird because quite often (and this is sometimes reflected in the law) if you're in a position to do something, to alleviate a great harm-and you're profiting, you're not a bystander, you're implicated or involved-we tend to think you have a responsibility to do something." But no one can really agree about the "something" to be done. Zittrain compared it to the automotive industry: Instead of asking for a recall on defective cars that are known to cause crashes, "if a company could repair the car as it's crashing-that's what Facebook is being asked to do. Though tweaking speech on the fly, of course, has implications beyond improving product safety."To their credit, Facebook does seem to understand that it has a responsibility to address manipulation on the platform, and to its users in Myanmar, regardless of the fact that tensions between Rohingya Muslims and Buddhist nationalists have existed long before their market presence. "We are humbled by the many ways we see people use Facebook in Myanmar. Maintaining a safe community for people to connect and share on Facebook is absolutely critical to us," Budhraja responded when asked if Facebook believes they have a responsibility to address manipulation of the platform in settings where state-supported human-rights abuses are taking place.But when asked how the company frames that responsibility-as a moral, ethical, legal, or business concern-Facebook had no on-the-record response. The company's public language of "open platforms" and "social infrastructure" to support sharing make for great Zuckerberg chestnuts, but like many other major tech platforms the company doesn't seem capable of openly reckoning with or articulating what it means to be a powerful political actor in a major conflict-and this might have something to do with the fact that the only real consequences they face are bad PR and not loss of market share or legal liability.The incoherence of platforms' response to their very real public harms and the lack of imagination in accountability mechanisms might explain the doomed appeal of crafting a single coherent legal charge, something piercing and fixed like a diamond wrested from coal.The pursuit of a legal frame speaks to a naïve hope (against all rational understanding of humanity's irrational tendencies, against the absurdity of law itself) that if we can just construct a shared story of What Happened and Who's Responsible, perhaps we will find words that give clarity to the pain of unspeakable things and perhaps we'll stop those things from happening again. Of course, clarity isn't necessarily justice either-the            Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Tribunal may have convicted Tony Blair and George W. Bush for war crimes, but those convictions might be better understood as a critique of a human-rights law regime largely constructed by Western powers who rarely, if ever, have to be held to account for their own crimes. Which maybe points to the further absurdity of asking how to hold Facebook accountable for negligence or complicity in its foreign markets: In a time when the United States can barely            come to terms with its own foundational legacy of genocides and crimes against humanity, how can anyone even begin to pursue accountability or reparations for the passive programmatic violence enabled by a single company operating abroad?Yet to simply point at the unintentional automated wreckage or demand piecemeal repairs to the monstrous machinery of platforms feels like giving in to the fatigue and sorrow of a vacuous world in which everyone is sorry and no one is responsible. It is exhausting to live in a time when power is not only something companies abuse but a force inadvertently unleashed by well-intentioned engineering teams, as pure and innocent as Pandora faced with an irresistible box of technical puzzles or (depending on the particular hubris of the company in question) as benevolent as Pandora's doomed brother-in-law Prometheus, simply trying to bring lowly mortals treasures that they were wholly unprepared to wield. What laws can punish the innovation-nay, the generosity-of endowing the world with such accursed gifts? So we throw up our hands and post our discontent, we mourn, we attend to the next crisis, and the next, and the next, and the next. We muddle through knowing that the gods of Silicon Valley are doing the best to tame monsters of their own conjuring, but can neither contain nor answer for continued collateral damage.But at the end of the day, the corporate campuses of Menlo Park and Mountain View hold neither gods nor monsters. They hold merely, mostly, men-men who, for now, primarily answer to a court of public opinion for the violence and horror their platforms repeatedly enable. Men who will wax poetic about "community" and "social infrastructure" while essentially building a plausibly deniable advertising engine. Men who are, as they are in so many other sectors of public life right now, due for a real reckoning with real consequences.Load-Date: December 27, 2017End of Document

The price settled at around $3,300 this afternoon, down from around $4,300 early Tuesday morning, according to data from BTC Ticker.As of this afternoon, the price of bitcoin has dropped approximately one-third since Sept. 1 when it peaked at $4967.32 on the ticker.On top of developments in China, the virtual currency's value was also dinged by the comments of Jamie Dimon, chairman, president and CEO of U.S. banking behemoth JP MorganChase. At a conference on Tuesday, Dimon declared bitcoin a 'fraud' and said he would fire any JPMorgan trader found to be trading in the currency.A CNBC report quoted Dimon as saying, "It's worse than tulip bulbs. It won't end well. Someone is going to get killed," in a reference to the spectacular rise and collapse of tulip bulb prices in Holland during the early 17th century, an economic bubble that ruined some European investors.Load-Date: October 17, 2017End of Document

According to the indictment, the three men-Dong Hao, Wu Yingzhuo and Xia Lei-utilized malware and email phishing to conduct coordinated cyber attacks against several companies, accruing data such as employee email addresses and other personal, business and commercial information. At the moment, the whereabouts of the three men remain unknown, although it is suspected that they are in or near Guangzhou, China, where they run a cyber security firm. These charges come amidst an increase in U.S. attention to Chinese cyber attacks. In recent years, two other Chinese citizens have been found guilty of cyber-crimes in the U.S., including selling malware and deliberate hacking with intent of stealing and collecting sensitive information. These acts do not appear to have been sponsored by the Chinese government.Bali volcano eruption evacuees to be forced from homes        Mount Agung, a volcano in Bali, Indonesia erupted last Tuesday, Nov. 21, for the first time in over half a century. The eruption had been anticipated since initial tremors were recorded in late August. Roughly 140,000 people preemptively left their homes near the base of Mt. Agung in accordance with the initial reports. As of Nov. 27, approximately 70,000 more people have been instructed to evacuate to nearby villages that are a safe distance away from the volcano and have prepared to accommodate dislocated persons. Indonesia's National Board for Disaster Management raised the state of its volcano alert to the highest level on Nov. 27, insisting that people evacuate immediately, expanding the evacuation area and closing down the airport. The board issued a statement explaining its decision, saying that "the rays of fire are increasingly observed at night. This indicates the potential for a larger eruption is imminent." Responding to reports that several people are remaining in their homes due to a sense of safety or a refusal to leave their livestock behind, Indonesian authorities have warned that people who ignore the evacuation order might be "forcibly evacuated" by emergency personnel who are doing checks throughout the area.Bangladesh and Myanmar reach refugee agreement        Due to ethnic violence in Myanmar's western region this past August, over 600,000 Rohingya, members of a majority-Muslim minority group, have fled across the border into neighboring Bangladesh. After several months of negotiation between the two nations, it appears that an agreement regarding the handling of the Rohingya refugees is beginning to form. Some details of the deal, announced Thursday, Nov. 23 in a memorandum from a spokesman for State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi, outline a plan to repatriate hundreds of thousands of the Rohingya in Bangladesh back to the Rakhine state from which they fled. There will be no cap on the number of refugees that may return to the region. This contradicts earlier statements issued by Myanmar's military-the same group accused of targeting the Rohingya. Incomplete plans from the agreement propose that refugees be temporarily relocated to camps set up in the Rakhine state. Given the remaining fear that many of the minority group have of returning to the land from which they were brutally expelled, it is unclear how many will wish to return, especially as the details released in the agreement did not state how long refugees would be required to remain in camps. One refugee said, "We can't trust the government and military at all. No one should go back if they have to stay in a camp, if they are not allowed to live back in their original village."Trump ambiguous on Moore support        Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore stands accused by seven women of inappropriate advances, touching, harassment and molestation. At the time, he was in his 30s and they were in their teens. Several Republican senators still back Moore, while others, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have asked Moore to drop out of the upcoming elections if the allegations are true. President Trump's statements have been limited in this affair. While he has not proclaimed condemnation or support of Moore, he has stressed that Moore "totally denies" the claims of abuse against him. Over the weekend, President Trump tweeted criticism for Moore's Democratic competitor in the race, Doug Jones, writing that "Liberal Jones would be BAD!" Following this tweet, Lindsay Walters, the White House deputy press secretary, has insisted that this does not equate to support for Moore. According to Walters, Trump will not be making any appearances with Moore during his Senate campaign. She told The Hill at a press conference that when it comes to the president's travel plans, "there is nothing on his schedule at this time" for a venture down to Alabama.Load-Date: November 29, 2017End of Document

WILL ROBOTS STEAL HUMAN JOBS?States News ServiceAugust 17, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 1899 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: STANFORD, Calif. BodyThe following information was released by the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace:by David R. HendersonThursday, August 17, 2017In recent years, there has been increasing concern about the effects of artificial intelligence and robots on humans. Some people have worried that humans will be marginalized to the point of being put out of work. Why hire a human when a much cheaper robot can do the job without being distracted? Of course, we can never be sure about the future. But a look at technological revolutions in the past should make us more optimistic than pessimistic about the fate of human labor in the age of AI.In the past, the introduction of more and more machinery made people more and more productive. And since real incomeswages and salariesare closely tied to productivity, machinery caused people's real incomes to increase. The same will be true of robots, whether we define robots narrowly as human-looking machines that move purposely on a factory floor or more broadly as machines that involve artificial intelligence. The fear of robots is similar to the fear of automation that was common only a few decades agoand just as bogus.In 1930, British economist John Maynard Keynes, reflecting on the progress of technology, predicted that his generation's grandchildren would have a 15-hour workweek. Assuming that a generation is 30 years, we should have had that 15-hour workweek in 1990. Did we? Not even close. Twenty-seven years after 1990, we still don't. But why don't we? Where did Keynes go wrong?It wasn't in his assumption about increasing productivity. Rather, Keynes was probably assuming that people would work enough to get the same standard of living they had in 1930. If that was his assumption, then he was quite accurate in predicting our productivity per hour. In the four score and seven years since Keynes made his prediction, our productivity has doubled and doubled again. We could easily have what we had then if we worked 15-hour weeks now.MIT labor economist David Autor estimated that an average U.S. worker in 2015 could achieve his 1915 counterpart's real income by "working about 17 weeks per year." Seventeen weeks per year at 40 work hours per week is 680 hours per year. Spread over a 50-week work year, that's 13.6 hours per week. And that overstates the workweek required for a 1930 standard of living for two reasons. First, the quality of almost everything we buy that is not produced by government has increased. Second, we can buy things that were simply unavailable then. Cell phones, anyone?Why don't we work 14-hour weeks? The answer, briefly, is that we want more. We are acquisitive people. Consider cars. Those few families that had cars in Keynes's day usually had only one. Even 30 years later, when I was growing up, my father had one old Ford. And we were not poor: Dad's income was probably just below the median income in Canada. Now, many families have two or three cars. We could do without televisions and smart phones, but we don't want to. We could settle for being like most Brits or Americans in Keynes's time, never traveling more than 200 miles from home. But we've heard about places called Las Vegas, Disneyland, and Floridaand, we want to go there. Also, antibiotics and other life-saving medicines come in awfully handybut they cost money to get. The reality is that we want more and we will always want more.Fortunately, there's a way to satisfy this yearningwith technology. Specifically, far from taking away from our livelihoods, robots will actually give us more by increasing real output and real GDP. That's the whole point. If they didn't increase output, we wouldn't value them. The key to economic growth is increased productivityproducing more and more output with more and more efficient means. The usual way to do that is to increase the amount of capital per worker: more capital per worker makes workers more productive.This is not to say that there are no downsides to increased automation. But the downsides are likely to be small. We can get a clue about the effect of robots on productivity, wellbeing, and jobs by looking at the history of automation.In 1760, Richard Arkwright's cotton-spinning machinery was introduced. At the time, England had 5,200 spinners using spinning wheels and 2,700 weavers, for a total employment of 7,900. But by 1796, after Arkwright's invention had been well integrated into the production process, the number of spinners and weavers was 320,000, an increase of over 3,900 percent.Why? The answer is, in economist's jargon, high elasticity of demand. The invention crushed costs, and so prices for textiles fell a lot. Clothing was no longer a luxury. The lower prices caused many people to buy more clothing more often. Overall output soared.But consider another case in which the opposite happened: farming. In 1900, farm workers made up 41 percent of the U.S. labor force. By 2000, that was down to two percent. It's true that the U.S. labor force had grown substantially during the century, from 27.6 million to 142.6 million. But even in absolute terms, the number of farmers fell, from 11.3 million to 2.9 million. Virtually all of the increase in the labor force was due to technology. Compare pictures of farm machinery now to pictures of farm machinery then. The latter were known as horses. Farming became an order of magnitude more productive. So jobs were destroyed in farming. But were jobs destroyed on net? No. The number of jobs rose in line with the labor force.As noted above, people sometimes worry that robots will become too human-like and replace us altogether. But Autor has pointed out that journalists and even experts "tend to overstate the extent of machine substitution for human labor." In doing so, they "ignore the strong complementarities between automation and labor that increase productivity, raise earnings, and augment demand for labor." Automation, he argued credibly, raises the value of tasks that we workers uniquely supply.If you're still worried that robots will be too human-like, consider what happened to men's jobs when women, who not only are human-like but also are actual humans, increasingly entered the labor force. Men's jobs didn't decline; they increased. In 1950, before the large entry of women into the U.S. labor force, 43.8 million men and 18.4 million women were employed. By 2015, women's employment had skyrocketed to 78.0 million, while men's employment, far from shrinking, almost doubled to 84.4 million.The simple fact is that the amount of work to be done in the economy is unlimited. What's limited is the number of humans, which is why the late population economist Julian Simons called humans, in a book by the same name, the "the ultimate resource." There's a storyperhaps apocryphal but no less insightful for thatabout an American engineer visiting China in the 1960s, when the Chinese government was building a dam. The American, noting the large number of workers digging with shovels, told his Chinese host that the digging could be done more quickly if the Chinese used steam shovels. "Oh," answered the host, "but then there would be fewer jobs." "I didn't realize that was the goal," answered the American, "but if your goal is jobs, you might consider replacing the shovels with spoons."What this story illustrates is that although jobs are important for creating value, if we can create the same amount of value with less input, it's wise to do so. Who, for example, wouldn't want an innovation that allowed them to do their current job and be paid just as much, while working half the time? This is not a fantasy. Pay is closely tied to productivity. The hypothetical innovation would destroy "half a job." And we would love it. We would use that freed-up time for leisure, or, more likely given our unlimited wants, for doing other work that gives us pecuniary rewards. That is the story of economic growth.But won't such innovations such as self-driving vehicles replace a large percent of the approximately 3.5 million truck drivers? Yes. But there are two things to note. First, the average age of a truck driver is now about forty-nine. So, with the innovation taking at least a few years to occur and then, most likely, occurring gradually, many of the displaced truckers would have been retiring anyway. Second, and much more important, the vast majority of those displaced truckers will find other work, just as the vast majority of displaced farmers early last century found other work. Do we know what the work will be? No, and we can't know, just as we couldn't know what jobs those who left the farms would get in 1900. But they got them.As robots become more common and displace some people from their current jobs, is there any role for government policy? Yes. The government should not make it harder for people to find new jobs. So, for example, it should start tearing down government barriers such as licensing laws that make it difficult for people to enter as many as 800 occupations in the United States. And the higher minimum wages that many people are advocating now would make it even harder for less skilled people to find new jobs and acquire skills. Indeed, higher minimum wages would artificially hasten the move to robots.***Non-economists have two biases that distort their understanding of economics. One is what my co-blogger, George Mason University economist Bryan Caplan, calls the pessimism bias. It's easier for people to be pessimistic than optimistic, both about the future and about current affairs in the world. Therefore, it's reasonable to "adjust up" their predictions. If people are pessimistic about robots, we should be more optimistic.Here's the other bias. Non-economists tend to put undue weight on what the nineteenth-century economist Frederic Bastiat called "the seen," and too little weight on the "unseen." That matters here. It's much easier to point out jobs that have been destroyed due to robots than to the ones that have been or will be created. If we knew what industries would be created in the future, we could invest accordingly and become incredibly wealthy. Unfortunately, we don't know. What we can be highly confident of, though, is that there will be jobs.Think of it this way. Every time people predicted that automation and machinery would destroy jobs overall, they were wrong. Are they really likely to be right this time around?And there's more good news. If you disagree with me and are confident about your disagreement, you can make some real money. Another George Mason University economist named Donald Boudreaux recently offered to bet on the issue. Here's what he wrote to a job pessimist:I will bet you $10,000, straight up, that in not one of the next 20 years will the annual U.S. labor-force participation rate, as measured by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, fall below 58.1 percentwhich is the lowest rate on record at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (The labor-force participation rate hit this post-WWII low in December 1954. And because the unemployment rate does not count unemployed workers who are so discouraged that they've stopped looking for jobs, the labor-force participation rate is more likely than is the unemployment rate to capture any long-term job-destroying effects of technology.)If you strongly believe the opposite, take Boudreaux up on his bet.Load-Date: August 20, 2017End of Document

Pollution linked to 9 million deaths worldwide in 2015, study saysCNN.comOctober 18, 2017 Wednesday 9:52 AM ESTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: HEALTHLength: 1790 wordsByline: By Susan Scutti, CNNBodyThe fatal effects of pollution are seen across our planet.In 2015, nearly one in six deaths, an estimated nine million worldwide, was related to pollution in some form -- air, water, soil, chemical or occupational pollution, according to a new report published Thursday in The Lancet.Air pollution is by far the largest contributor to early death, according to the new research produced by The Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health. This form of pollution is linked to 6.5 million fatalities in 2015.Water pollution, responsible for 1.8 million deaths, and workplace-related pollution, which led to 0.8 million deaths, pose the next largest risks, the report noted.rThe overwhelming majority of pollution-related casualties -- 92% -- occur among people living in low- and middle-income countries. And, one in every four early deaths in nations trying to industrialize rapidly -- such as India, Pakistan, China, Bangladesh, Madagascar and Kenya -- could be connected to filthy air, water, soil or other contamination."Pollution disproportionately impacts the poor and the vulnerable," said Dr. Olusoji Adeyi, a commissioner and director of the health, nutrition and population global practice at the World Bank Group.In countries at every income level, disease caused by pollution is most prevalent among minorities and the marginalized."Children face the highest risks," said Adeyi. "It is important to translate awareness into action at the local, national, and global levels."Dr. Philip J. Landrigan, co-leader of the commission, said the problem is chemicals."There are thousands of chemicals out there and we know that people are exposed to them," said Landrigan. "We just didn't know enough about what chemicals are doing to people."Unlikely case studyIn the months leading up to the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China's air quality became a matter of international concern. Smog obscured the blue sky and distant buildings even on days the nation's Ministry of Environmental Protection reported excellent air quality.Quietly, the United States Embassy in Beijing acquired a stationary monitor to track particulates and later, three additional hand-held air monitors. Embassy officials "worked closely with the US EPA "to set up the rooftop air monitoring equipment, explained Noel Clay, a spokesperson for the State Department.To "put it gently," said Landrigan, people saw the US Embassy data as "unbiased" compared to the air quality data being released by Chinese officials. Embassy officials wanted the more reliable data to "make better daily decisions regarding the safety of outdoor activities," said Clay.Soon, though, the data gained a wider audience than intended."There's a lot of kids in China who are very internet savvy," said Landrigan. These kids figured out how to access the data, which was published online by the US Embassy, and once that hurdle was cleared, the Chinese citizens themselves "started buying monitors and doing their own testing and sharing their results over the internet."Accelerated by the US Embassy in Beijing, air quality data went viral across China."It became a very powerful bottom-up influence that I think factored into the Chinese government's decision to do something -- they're actually taking major strides in China to control air pollution now," said Landrigan.Now he's seeing the same thing happen again in other regions of the globe. With the cost of a reliable air monitor priced around $100, said Landrigan, "more and more people around the world are starting on their own -- citizen scientists if you will -- to collect air pollution data."Traditional versus modernThe data for this new report comes from "two very credible sources," noted Landrigan: The World Health Organization and The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which is based at Seattle's University of Washington and is funded by the Gates Foundation. Data is collected by satellites and other monitoring technologies, which, due to increasing sophistication, provide more information today than in the past."For the first time, we pulled out and collected in one place all of the information on deaths caused by all forms of pollution combined -- in other words, air pollution, water pollution, chemical pollution, soil pollution, occupational pollution in the workplace -- and put it all together," said Landrigan who is also a professor of preventive medicine and pediatrics at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.The very poorest countries have many fewer deaths from pollution than the people on the next rung up -- the lower-middle income countries, noted Landrigan. "This is not traditional pollution that is killing people in these rapidly industrializing lower middle-income countries, it's urban industrial air pollution -- chemical pollution," he said.Traditional pollution arises at the household level and is associated with profound poverty, said Landrigan. Household air pollution resulting from poorly ventilated indoor cook stoves and fecal contamination of drinking water are the major forms of traditional pollution.Modern forms of pollution are outdoor air pollution, chemical pollution, soil pollution and occupational pollution, all associated with modern industry, modern cities, modern lifestyle."All of those are going up," said Landrigan, adding that the number of deaths associated with modern pollutions have increased year to year.Regulation and economicsThe other thing that's new about this report is that economists on the commission's team developed a separate analysis to calculate the costs that result from diseases caused by pollution, added Landrigan."Just look at the experience within our country," said Landrigan pointing out a graph in the report that shows how pollution decreased by 70% from 1970 to 2015 following passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970. "In that same 45-year period, the GDP has increased by 250%," said Landrigan, who noted this does not support arguments suggesting pollution regulation stifles the economy.Nicholas Burger, senior economist and director of the Center for Research and Policy in International Development at the RAND Corporation, said the numbers look right but this type of economic analysis is "incredibly difficult." Burger was not involved in the Commission or its report."Simply saying we've observed this level of growth and we've observed this level of pollution reduction is not enough to make a strong statement that absent the pollution reduction we would have seen the same level of growth --- or lower growth or higher growth," said Burger.It is necessary to understand what would have happened absent those regulations, noted Burger. And that's not easy to answer on the macro level."There's pretty strong evidence that pollution control policy -- pollution regulation -- does not adversely affect growth by as much as people often argue that it does or that we might tend to think that it does," said Burger. He added there are even some instances where researchers believe pollution policy has not harmed economic growth or perhaps even "enhanced growth.""You put a scrubber on a power plant to remove the harmful pollutants coming out of the stack of that power plant that is going to make that power plant less efficient -- that's basic physics," he noted. But the question is how much less efficient? Industry often comes up with ways to exceed the efficiency requirements of regulators.One theme that comes out of the regulation research is to never underestimate the efficiency and innovation abilities of Western industries, said Burger.Even when regulations slow growth of one industry, then, other businesses providing goods and services to accommodate the new regulations may grow. Consider, though, that health care costs are also part of the GDP.It's extremely complicated trying to calculate "how the economy would reorient itself and reoptimize itself" with or without pollution regulations, said Burger.Still, Commission Co-leader Richard Fuller of Pure Earth, USA, an international non-profit, maintains that countries can have "consistent economic growth with low pollution" and he bases this opinion on the experiences of Western nations.Lessons from the West"If you just think about it, anecdotally in the West, we really did knock pollution on the head," Fuller said. The rules and regulations of the 1960s and 1970s made our water safe to drink and the air reasonably clean."It's certainly enormously better than it used to be," said Fuller. When you see pictures of Beijing filled with "nasty, gunky air, that's how it was in New York City and in Pittsburgh and in Los Angeles back in the '60s and even in the '70s," he said.Meanwhile, in lower income countries, ministers of finance believe that you need to "allow pollution to happen in order to become industrialized," said Fuller. "If you adopt green growth strategies it's more likely -- according to the literature -- you will actually grow stronger because you won't have people sick or dying before their time." Poor health and early death requires people to look after others and this "costs" societies wanting to grow."It's a key message in the report," said Fuller, who hopes the new report gets the development community to consider pollution "as an issue they should worry about it, an issue that should be on the global agenda."The pollution piece of the agenda has largely been forgotten because the planet is cleaner due to efforts made in the US and Europe, "but it hasn't had the same effort in the rest of the world," said Fuller.So what can people do?"People should go to www.pollution.org," said Fuller. While the data is not comprehensive, it's the best available for people to see what is happening in their own neighborhoods."If you're not seeing what you're feeling, you can add your story," said Fuller. These civic contributions will be brought into policy discussions happening in the concerned country, said Fuller. The website, then, is "a place for people to have their voice get heard in a non-confrontational way."Individual voices need to be heard, Fuller noted, because worldwide, children are vulnerable."The thing that worries me most in all this is the neurological damage that many of these toxins have," said Fuller. Heavy metals, including lead, damage kids' brains."My concern is if you release a toxin in China, it can end up in LA just as easily," said Fuller. Particulate matter travels, he said, with research demonstrating that carbon from burning coal in China is in air pollution in LA."We need to look after it because they're going to poison us as well."CORRECTION: This story has been corrected to say one in six deaths was related to pollution and to identify RAND as a corporation.Load-Date: October 21, 2017End of Document

Didi Chuxing Is 'An Emerging Autonomous Superpower,' Says Morgan StanleyBenzinga.comDecember 27, 2017 Wednesday 4:42 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Accretive Capital LLC d/b/a Benzinga All Rights ReservedLength: 476 wordsByline: Shanthi RexalineBodyChinese ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing, which offers commuting options for 450 million users across 400 Chinese cities, recently completed a new round of financing and raised $4 billion.The AnalystMorgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas termed the Chinese ride-hailing company, an Uber competitor, as "an emerging autonomous superpower" in a Wednesday note. The ThesisThe latest funding round propels the Chinese company into a trajectory where it is expected to see a sharp acceleration into AI driving and EV infrastructure in the international market, Jonas said in a Wednesday note. (See the analyst's track record here.) Over the last eight months, Didi has raised about $10 billion, for a total of $19.7 billion, the analyst said. Didi's post-financing valuation is $56 billion, more than Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and nearly as valuable as General Motors Company (NYSE: GM), according to Morgan Stanley. Didi's cash reserves are reportedly over $12 billion, Jonas said.Morgan Stanley said it hopes Didi uses its latest funding to further build up its intelligent driving and smart transportation capabilities.The investments in electric vehicle charging infrastructure Didi referred to in its financing announcement are the company's most direct reference to EV powertrains to date, "potentially reflecting recent Chinese government policy," Jonas said. See also: The Top 10 Most Valuable UnicornsDidi is using its market positioning in China to apply leverage in important global markets, the analyst said. The company has invested in a number of other foreign ride-sharing players, including Lyft in the U.S., 99 in Brazil, Careem in the Middle East, Ola in India, Taxify in Estonia and Grab in Singapore.This is in addition, the company's outright purchase of Uber's Chinese operations, Jonas said. Morgan Stanley also noted that Didi is pursuing a ride-sharing platform in Taiwan and is seeking to enter the Mexican market directly in 2018."We note that the acceleration of Didi's international and technological expansion efforts coincide with a number of setbacks for Uber over the past year." Any leader in ride-sharing must be a leader in autonomous technology to ensure its competitive moat and market position, Jonas said. DiDi Labs, which the company established in Mountain View, California in May, is focused on cloud-based security, deep-learning algorithms, human-machine interfaces, computer vision and intelligent driving technologies, according to Morgan Stanley."In our opinion, Didi should be counted amongst the world's largest, best-resourced and most aggressive players in shared autonomous mobility on a global scale," Jonas said. Related Link:Didi CEO Talks Apple Partnership, 'Huge' Market PotentialPhoto courtesy of Kevin26123/Wikimedia. © 2017 Benzinga.com.

ASIA REGULATORY ROUNDUP: CHINA STRENGTHENS SUPERVISION OF ONLINE DRUG, DEVICE SALESStates News ServiceNovember 7, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 1268 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: Rockville, MD BodyThe following information was released by the Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society:Nick Paul TaylorThe China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) has moved to strengthen oversight of online sales of drugs and medical devices. CFDA outlined its plans in a notice instructing its regional outposts to step up their monitoring of the internet and make it easier for the public to alert them of illegal activity.Regulatory officials laid out their strategy for stopping illegal sales of drugs and medical devices in a seven-point memo to the regional offices of CFDA. The memo tasks CFDA staffers with making enterprises with online activities key inspection targets and creating mechanisms for investigating the illegal trade of drugs and medical devices over the internet.CFDA expects its officials to use the internet effectively themselves to gather information and keep the public aware of the risks of buying health products online. In terms of data gathering, this means ensuring it is as easy as possible for people to provide information about online drug sales, either via the internet or telephone. CFDA expects local officials to use popular social media sites such as Weibo and WeChat to share information with the public.Officials at the state level will monitor the implementation of these orders.As with many of CFDA's recent actions, the publication of the plan follows an order from central government. The order came late in September when the government included online drug sales in a wide-ranging set of reforms. At the time, the government told CFDA to create a mechanism for monitoring online sales, simplify the whistleblowing process and create a "black list." The order also tasked CFDA with severely punishing organizations found to sell drugs online illegally.CFDA Notice, Government Order (both Chinese)CDSCO Moves to Stop Name Confusion From Holding up Device ImportsThe Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) has told its port offices to stop holding up the importation of medical devices on certain technical grounds. Port officials should now allow the importation of products covered by valid certificates and licenses even if some of the details on the consignment differ from other records.CDSCO sent out the memo after learning of three issues that are stopping medical devices and in vitro diagnostics from proceeding smoothly through ports. Some medical devices are being held up by slight differences between the names on consignments and on certificates and licenses. Other devices are getting stuck because the license holder is in the process of changing their details after a merger or acquisition. Finally, different expiry dates in multicomponent kits are causing delays.Joint Drugs Controller Dr. VG Somani wants ports to show flexibility when it is clear the importer and consignment are valid and supported by the appropriate clearances. In the case of confusion about names, Somani told ports to allow imports through if the authorized person shows the devices are covered by the registration certificate, despite the superficial differences.Somani is proposing a similar model for devices owned by companies that are going through a merger. Provided the courts or competent authority have endorsed the changes necessitated by the merger, the port should release the consignment.The final scenario covered by the memo is different. The problem in this case arises from the inclusion of components with different expiry dates in multicomponent kits. Somani wants port officials to use the component or reagent with the "lowest expiry date" in calculations of shelf life.Publication of the memo comes one month after the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) told ports to stop detaining products covered by import licenses and registration certificates that are in the process of being renewed.CDSCO MemoTGA Sets December Target for Expansion of Notification Process to Prescription DrugsAustralia's Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) will expand its automated notification process to cover prescription drugs next month. The expansion comes months after TGA began allowing manufacturers of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines to make minor changes using the online form.TGA expects to start accepting notifications from makers of prescription drugs on 4 December. The agency will spend the three preceding days preparing its IT systems for the go-live date. Over that period, TGA will restrict the ability of prescription and OTC drug companies to submit new changes or edit existing drafts.The work is intended to usher in a more risk-based approach to the management of variations to registered drugs, a change recommended in the expert review of Australian regulations. Under the scheme, companies can apply to make changes that will not affect quality, safety or efficacy using an automated online system. Once the company has filed a request, made legal assurances and paid a fee, TGA will automatically approve the change and update its records.Examples of the types of changes allowable under the automated scheme include revisions to batch sizes, implementation of new in-process control tests and deletions of manufacturing steps. Even these changes can only use the scheme if certain conditions are met. TGA also states what information companies must provide for each type of change to be processed under the new system.TGA NoticeIndia Sets Classifications of Medical Devices Ahead of Start of new RulesDCGI Dr. GN Singh has released a list stating how India will classify medical devices once new rules come into force at the start of next year. The 247-item list covers the category, name and risk class of different medical devices and IVDs, plus a brief description of their intended use.India, like Canada, the European Union and other territories, is implementing a four-tier system for classifying medical devices. The list shows high-risk devices, such as those used in the ablation of tumors, will go into Class D. India is putting the lowest-risk devices, including Y-connectors used to connect perfusion sets, into Class A.Publication of the list comes two months before the implementation of the Medical Device Rules, 2017, legislation that will end India's long wait for a distinct, comprehensive framework covering devices and diagnostics.The list shared this week is dynamic, and as such will undergo changes from time to time.DCGI NoticePakistan to Require 2D Barcodes on All Drug Products Made After 15 DecemberPakistan is pushing ahead with plans to require 2D barcodes on the packaging of medicines. The barcodes are part of the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan's (DRAP) attempt to crack down on fake drugs.DRAP signaled its intent to require 2D barcodes in a notification published over the summer. Now, in statements to local media published on its website, DRAP has confirmed the requirements will come into force on 15 December. After that, manufacturers must emboss barcodes that follow guidelines set by international standards organization GS1 on their products.Officials also expect companies to maintain a database covering the barcodes of their products and share the resource with DRAP. The agency will link these resources to its Drug Regulatory Information System, an online portal. DRAP is holding training sessions intended to ease the technical challenges of transitioning to the new system. The regulator held the first of first of these sessions late last month.Once in place, the system will provide a way to confirm the authenticity of products and track their path through the supply chain.Load-Date: November 8, 2017End of Document

Our transformation back to a technology-driven open platform is reaching its goals," said Vincent Mo, Chairman and CEO of Fang.com. "We expect to be back on track and profitable in the second half of the year."Second Quarter 2017 ResultsRevenuesFang reported total revenues of $110.1 million in the second quarter of 2017, a 61.6% decrease from $287.0 million in the corresponding period of 2016, primarily due to the decline in e-commerce services revenue by 166.7 million caused by the strategy change.   Revenue from e-commerce services was $22.9 million in the second quarter of 2017, a decrease of 87.9% from $189.5 million in the corresponding period of 2016, primarily due to the changes in revenue structure as a result of transformation from self owned and operated services to franchise business.Revenue from marketing services was $35.0 million in the second quarter of 2017, a decrease of 31.9% from $51.4 million in the corresponding period of 2016, primarily due to less demand from property developers for online advertising under government regulations in the real estate market of tier-1 and tier-2 cities.Revenue from listing services was $42.3 million in the second quarter of 2017, an increase of 57.4% from $26.9 million in the corresponding period of 2016, primarily driven by the increased number of paying members in lower tiers of cities.Revenue from Internet financial services was $2.7 million in the second quarter of 2017, a decrease of 75.7% from $11.1 million in the corresponding period of 2016, primarily due to the decreased secondary transaction volumes of Fang's own franchised brokerage services.Revenue from other value-added services was $7.1 million in the second quarter of 2017, a decrease of 11.2% from $8.0 million in the corresponding period of 2016.Cost of RevenueCost of revenue was $48.7 million in the second quarter of 2017, a decrease of 78.9% from $231.1 million in the corresponding period of 2016, primarily driven by the agent reduction and cost optimization under the newly adopted open platform strategy.Operating ExpenseOperating expenses were $67.4 million in the second quarter of 2017, a decrease of 23.9% from $88.6 million in the corresponding period of 2016.Selling expenses were $23.1 million in the second quarter of 2017, a decrease of 55.8% from $52.3 million for the corresponding period of 2016, primarily caused by the decrease of advertising and promotion fee, as well as the e-commerce cost decrease.General and administrative expenses were $43.6 million in the second quarter of 2017, an increase of 20.0% from $36.4 million for the corresponding period of 2016, primarily due to the increased bad debt and impairment of commitment deposits.Operating IncomeOperating loss was $6.1 million in the second quarter of 2017, compared to operating loss of $32.8 million in the corresponding period of 2016, primarily attributable to the agent reduction and effective cost control.Income Tax Benefits/ExpensesIncome tax benefits were $0.6 million in the second quarter of 2017, compared to income tax expenses of $8.7 million in the corresponding period of 2016, primarily due to the reversal of previously recorded ASC 740 (FIN 48) tax and interest liability.Net Income/Loss and EPSNet loss attributable to Fang's shareholders was $2.1 million in the second quarter of 2017, compared to net loss of $40.6 million in the corresponding period of 2016. Loss per fully-diluted ordinary share and ADS were $0.024 and $0.005 in the second quarter of 2017, compared to loss of $0.43 and $0.09, respectively, in the corresponding period of 2016.Unrealized Gain on Available for Sale SecurityUnrealized gain on available for sale security was $84.6 million in the second quarter of 2017, compared with 1.4 million in the corresponding period of 2016, primarily due to the fair value increase of World Union, a PRC listed company.Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA, defined as non-GAAP net income before income taxes, interest expenses, interest income, depreciation and amortization, was $1.3 million in the second quarter of 2017, compared to the loss of $24.3 million in the corresponding period of 2016.CashAs of June 30, 2017, Fang had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $547.1million, compared to $590.5 million as of December 31, 2016. Net cash generated from operating activities was $23.1 million in the second quarter of 2017, compared to cash flow generated from operating activities of $36.5 million in the same period of 2016. The decrease in cash flows generated from operating activities was primarily due to the decrease of change in loan receivable in operating activities compared to the second quarter of 2016.First Half 2017 ResultsRevenuesFang reported total revenues of $219.9 million for the first half of 2017, representing a decrease of 55.3% from $491.6 million for the corresponding period in 2016, primarily due to the decline of e-commerce services by 257.7 million caused by the strategy change.Revenue from e-commerce services was $62.8 million for the first half of 2017, an 80.4% decrease from $320.4 million for the same period in 2016, primarily due to the changes in revenue structure as a result of transformation from self owned and operated services to franchise business.Revenue from marketing services was $62.4 million for the first half of 2017, a decrease of 23.8% from $81.8 million for the corresponding period in 2016, primarily due to less demand from property developers for online advertising under government regulations in the real estate market of tier-1 and tier-2 cities.Revenue from listing services was $76.4 million for the first half of 2017, an increase of 49.8% from $51.0 million for the corresponding period in 2016, primarily due to the increased number of paying members in lower tiers of cities.Revenue from internet financial services was $4.9 million for the first half of 2017, a decrease of 77.2% from $21.7 million for the corresponding period in 2016, primarily due to the decreased secondary transaction volumes of Fang's own franchised brokerage services.Revenue from value-added services and other services was $13.4 million for the first half of 2017, a decrease of 19.2% in the corresponding period in 2016.Cost of RevenueCost of revenue was $109.5 million for the first half of 2017, a decrease of 75.2% from $441.0 million for the corresponding period in 2016. The decrease in cost of revenue was mainly driven by the agent reduction and cost optimization under the newly adopted open platform strategy.Operating ExpensesOperating expenses were $122.6 million for the first half of 2017, a decrease of 36.7% from $193.6 million for the corresponding period in 2016.Selling expenses were $46.5 million for the first half of 2017, a decrease of 59.2% from $113.9 million for the corresponding period in 2016, primarily caused by the decrease of advertising and promotion fee, as well as the e-commerce cost decrease.General and administrative expenses were $75.0 million for the first half of 2017, a decrease of 5.9% from $79.7 million for the corresponding period in 2016, primarily due to the effective cost control measures partially offset by the increased bad debt and impairment of commitment deposits.Operating Loss/IncomeOperating loss was $12.2 million for the first half of 2017, compared to operating loss of $142.8 million for the corresponding period in 2016.Income Tax ExpensesIncome tax expense was $4.2 million for the first half of 2017, a 69.3% decrease compared to $13.9 million for the corresponding period in 2016, primarily due to the reversal of previously recorded ASC 740 (FIN 48) tax and interest liability.Net Loss/Income and EPSNet loss attributable to Fang's shareholders was $14.1 million for the first half of 2017, compared to net loss attributable to Fang's shareholders $154.3 million for the corresponding period in 2016. Loss per fully diluted ordinary share and ADS were $0.16 and $0.32, respectively, for the first half of 2017, compared to loss per fully diluted ordinary share and ADS of $1.62 and $0.32, respectively, for the corresponding period in 2016.CashNet cash generated from operating activities was $12.1 million in the first half of 2017, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $30.7 million for the same period in 2016, primarily due to a $140.2 million decrease of net loss compared to the first half of 2016.Business OutlookThe Company is in its last stage of returning to a technology-driven open platform and expects to be profitable in the second half of the year.Conference Call InformationFang's management team will host a conference call on the same day at 8:00 AM U.S. EST (8:00 PM Beijing/Hong Kong time).

Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about Fang's beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Potential risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, whether the transactions contemplated by the restructuring of Fang's assets and businesses will receive the requisite approvals, whether such restructuring will be carried out as planned, the impact of such restructuring on Fang's assets and businesses, the impact of Fang's transformation from a pure Internet information platform to a transaction-oriented platform, the impact of Fang's implementation of a "zero tolerance policy" that has resulted in dismissal of employees, the impact of the slowdown in China's real estate market on Fang and the impact on revenues of our existing and new service fees reductions, the ability of Fang to retain real estate listing agencies as customers during challenging economic periods, the success of Fang's new business initiatives, the ability of Fang to manage its operating expenses, the impact of, measures taken or to be taken by the Chinese government to control real estate growth and prices and other events which could occur in the future, economic challenges in China's real estate market, the impact of competitive market conditions for our services, our ability to maintain and increase our leadership in China's home related internet sector, the uncertain regulatory landscape in China, fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, our continued ability to execute business strategies including our SouFun membership services and SouFun Online Shop, our ability to continue to expand in local markets, our reliance on online advertising sales and listing services and transactions for our revenues, any failure to successfully develop and expand our content, service offerings and features, including the success of new features to meet evolving market needs, and the technologies that support them, the quality of the loans we originate and resell and the performance of those loans in the future, our ability to successfully service and process customer loans for our own benefit and for the purchasers of those loans and, should we in the future make acquisitions, any failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses.About Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresTo supplement Fang's consolidated financial results presented in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), Fang uses in this press release the following measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission: (1) non-GAAP operating (loss)/income, (2) non-GAAP net (loss)/income and (3) non-GAAP basic and diluted (loss)/earnings per ordinary share and per ADS (4) adjusted EBITDA. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned "Reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP Results" set forth at the end of this press release.Fang believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information to investors regarding its operating performance by excluding share-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects, realized gain on available-for-sale security, interest income and expenses, income tax expenses, and depreciation expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016, which (1) may not be indicative of Fang's recurring core business operating results or (2) are not expected to result in future cash payments. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Fang's historical performance and assist its financial and operational decision making. A limitation of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that share-based compensation, interest income and expenses, income tax expenses, and depreciation expenses have been and will continue to be a significant recurring expense that will continue to exist in Fang's business for the foreseeable future. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The accompanying tables have more details on the reconciliation between non-GAAP financial measures and their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.For investor and media inquiries, please

He visited Ctrip headquarters and our CEO Jane Sun to discuss tourism opportunity for Israel. Afterwards, Ctrip and the Israeli Tourism Bureau held a strategic cooperation signing ceremony at the Shanghai Peace Hotel.According to Israeli Ministry of Tourism statistics, Israel in July 2017 ushered in 271,100 global tourists, an increase of 17% over the same period last year.

In addition, new direct flight to Israel has also played a vital role in the growth of the tourism market, and the rapid increase in the number of tourists in China has made great contributions to the Israeli economy and the job market. As the campaign continues to deepen, this trend of rapid growth will continue to rise and we hope to establish a good relationship with more partners in China. ""Tourism brings peace.

This cooperation with Ctrip, China's largest online travel agency (OTA), leverages Ctrip's advantages in travel products, big data, precision marketing and other aspects of deep cooperation.View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ctrip-and-israeli-tourism-bureau-strategic-cooperation-300518486.htmlSOURCE Ctrip.com International, Ltd.CONTACT: Leah Wang, (8610)6418 1616 ext. 23228, pr@ctrip.comLoad-Date: September 13, 2017End of Document

"Ctrip is playing an increasingly significant role as a "tourism development ambassador" in the global area."Given that visa accessibility is an important consideration for Chinese tourists in selecting travel destinations, Jane called upon Israeli government to introduce new policies on not only continuing to ease tourist visa access but also building more awareness of Israel as a travel destination to Chinese tourists and working with Israeli government to ensure Chinese tourists high quality and safe travel experience.The Ministry of Tourism is actively expanding its relationship with China's tourism industry partners and actively seeking opportunities for "cross-border" cooperation, in order to ensure the best quality travel service and experience for Chinese tourists visiting Israel. This cooperation with Ctrip, China's largest online travel agency (OTA), leverages Ctrip's advantages in travel products, big data, precision marketing and other aspects of deep cooperation.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from US Eturbo News.

Closing Bell: LIVE MARKETS BLOGRealMoneyNovember 8, 2017 Wednesday 4:04 PM EDTCopyright 2017 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1057 wordsByline: Tony OwusuHighlight: All three averages rose in trading Wednesday.BodyHere's what happened on Wall Street on Wednesday, Nov. 8.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq and S&P 500 all stumbled out of the gate Wednesday morning with each trading in the red. However, the major indices were able to recover from their earlier stumble to finish the day in record territory. The Nasdaq led the way higher, rising 0.32% while the S&P rose 0.14% and the Dow eked out a 0.03% gain. Time Warner Reportedly Told to Sell CNN as Condition of AT&T Merger Time Warner  will have to sell CNN if its merger with AT&T  is to receive Department of Justice regulatory approval, the Financial Times reported Wednesday.Earlier today, AT&T CFO John Stephens said that he isn't sure when the two companies would receive regulatory approval for their $85 billion merger to go through. "We are in active discussions with the [Department of Justice]. Those are continuing on. I can't comment on those discussions, but with those discussions, I can now say that the timing of the closing of the deal is now uncertain," Stephens said. House Republican Tax Bill to Add $1.7 Trillion to Deficit Over 10 Years Who knew cutting revenue would increase the national deficit?The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the amended Republican House tax reform bill will add $1.7 trillion to the country's deficit over the next 10 years. Under the plan, the debt level will increase to 97.1% of U.S. gross domestic product in 2027, up from the current 91.2% level. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Sells Fox Stake Embattled Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal has completely exited his stake in 21st Century Fox  , according to Bloomberg, after nearly 20 years of being one of founder Rupert Murdoch's staunchest supporters. Alwaleed was one of the largest buyers of Fox's Class B voting shares, but began trimming his position in Murdoch's News Corp. publishing arm three years ago. His stake in Fox was listed at just under 5% in the third quarter.Alwaleed, billionaire founder of investment firm Kingdom Holdings, has been in the news lately as one of the most visible members of a group targeted in a Saudi government crackdown on corruption. Ford Signs $756 Million Deal to Build Electric Vehicles in China Ford  announced that it has entered into a $756 million joint venture with Zoyte Auto to build and sell electric vehicles in China. The deal puts Ford closer to its stated goal of having at least 70% of the vehicles it sells in China feature electrified powertrain options by 2025. By 2030, the Chinese government wants at least 40% of new vehicles sold in the country to be electric as it looks to reduce pollution. Facebook Wants to Tag Your Nudes to Keep Them Off Its Website In its latest effort to combat revenge porn, Facebook  is experimenting with a program in Australia that allows users to upload their nude pictures on Messenger in order to let the company tag them and recognize if they appear on its website at a later time. The images themselves aren't saved, but the metadata behind the pixels is, allowing Action Alerts PLUS holding Facebook's algorithms to do their thing. AT&T CEO Doesn't Know When Time Warner Merger Will Close AT&T  CFO John Stephens told a conference in New York that the company is in talks with the Department of Justice over its proposed $85.4 billion merger with Time Warner  , but that he is uncertain of when the deal would be approved. "All approvals have been received but for the DOJ. We are in active discussions with the DOJ. I can not comment on those discussions. But with those discussions, I can now say that the timing of the closing of the deal is now uncertain," Stephens told a conference in New York, according to Reuters.AT&T shares were down 0.2%, while Time Warner declined more than 3%. Deutsche Bank Could Turn to Automation to Cut Costs Deutsche Bank  CEO John Cryan hinted that his bank could turn to automation to reduce its workforce as the company looks to cut around 9,000 jobs globally. The bank has already laid off 4,000 people.  "We employ 97,000 people. Most big peers have more like half that number," Cryan told the Financial Times. "We're too manual, which can make you error-prone and it makes you inefficient. There's a lot of machine learning and mechanization that we can do."  Ethereum Issue Could Cause e-Wallet Contents to be Erased Cryptocurrency and bitcoin rival Ethereum suffered a setback after a glitch with its e-wallet provider Parity froze hundreds of millions of dollars. The glitch could result in the contents of users' wallets being erased, according to TechCrunch. The issue is affecting a multi-signature wallet that was issued after July 20. Any ICOs that were held in the wallet after that date could be affected. This is the second time a bug has been discovered in the digital wallet Parity, which provides wallets for Ethereum. PwC Study Shows Decline in Black Friday Shopping Interest A new study by PricewaterhouseCoopers says that only 35% of Americans plan to do their holiday shopping the week of Thanksgiving, down from 59% two years ago. "We're definitely seeing a decreased significance in Black Friday. Consumers... know when the sales are. They're becoming more adept at their online shopping and walking into the stores on that particular day doesn't bear as much of a return in terms of pricing, which still is the number one driver," the firm said. Tencent Takes Stake in Snapchat  Chinese internet giant Tencent  took a roughly 10% stake in struggling social media entity's parent company Snap Inc  , according to the company's quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The news comes just hours after the stock tanked in after-hours trading Tuesday, when it reported a narrower-than-expected loss while also missing its quarterly revenue expectations. Snap shares were down nearly 10% premarket Tuesday. Premarket U.S. stock futures traded in the red across the board Wednesday ahead of the opening bell, indicating a lower open for the indices, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which reached a new record high the previous session. The Nikkei and Hang Seng fell in trading in Asia, while the Shanghai Composite rose 0.06%. In Europe, both the DAX in Germany and FTSE 100 in the U.K. were declining 0.07% while the CAC 40 in France fell more than 0.2% with more than four hours left in trading. Load-Date: November 9, 2017End of Document

SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY MNUCHIN ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT'S DECISION REGARDING LATTICE SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATIONUS Fed NewsSeptember 13, 2017 Wednesday 7:08 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 650 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, Sept. 13 -- The U.S. Department of the Treasury issued the following statement:As chair of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), Steven T. Mnuchin, Secretary of the Treasury today issued the following statement about the President's decision regarding Lattice Semiconductor Corporation.Today, consistent with the Administration's commitment to take all actions necessary to ensure the protection of U.S. national security, the President issued an order prohibiting the acquisition of Lattice Semiconductor Corporation (Lattice) by Canyon Bridge Fund I, LP (CBFI); CBFI's subsidiaries; CBFI's limited partner, Yitai Capital Limited (Yitai); and Yitai's parent company, China Venture Capital Fund Corporation Limited (CVCF) (together, the Purchasers). The order directs the Purchasers and Lattice to take all steps necessary to fully and permanently abandon the proposed acquisition of Lattice not later than 30 days after the date of the order.CVCF is a Chinese corporation owned by Chinese state-owned entities that manages industrial investments and venture capital. Lattice is a publicly traded company headquartered in Oregon that manufactures semiconductors for the consumer, communications, and industrial markets. Lattice's primary semiconductor product lines are programmable logic devices, which are general purpose semiconductors that customers can program to provide functionality similar to chips that are designed and produced for specific applications.The President took this action pursuant to section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended by the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007 (Section 721). Section 721 authorizes the President to suspend or prohibit certain acquisitions of U.S. businesses by foreign persons where he finds that there is credible evidence that the foreign interest exercising control might take action that threatens to impair national security, and where provisions of law other than Section 721 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act do not provide adequate and appropriate authority to protect national security in the matter under review.The President's decision took into consideration the factors described in Section 721's subsection (f), as appropriate, and the recommendation by CFIUS that he issue an order prohibiting this transaction. CFIUS and the President assess that the transaction poses a risk to the national security of the United States that cannot be resolved through mitigation. The national security risk posed by the transaction relates to, among other things, the potential transfer of intellectual property to the foreign acquirer, the Chinese government's role in supporting this transaction, the importance of semiconductor supply chain integrity to the U.S. government, and the use of Lattice products by the U.S. government.CFIUS is an interagency committee whose purpose is to review transactions that could result in the control of a U.S. business by a foreign person, in order to determine the effect of such transactions on the national security of the United States. CFIUS's detailed analysis of the proposed transaction took into account all relevant national security factors, as enumerated in Section 721. CFIUS also received a thorough analysis of the threat posed by this transaction from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, as required by Section 721.Consistent with the longstanding, bi-partisan U.S. commitment to open investment, the CFIUS process focuses exclusively on identifying and addressing national security concerns. This focused mandate reinforces our commitment to welcoming foreign investment, while at the same time reinforcing our commitment to protecting national security.

Now cybercriminals going after Hollywood's goodies have also put company plans and people's personal information at risk - a reputational risk that's difficult to calculate.___The real revolution in NKorea is rise of consumer culturePYONGYANG, North Korea (AP) - Three generations into the Kim family's ruling dynasty in North Korea, markets have blossomed and a consumer culture is taking root. The country had little choice but to accept the markets after enduring a devastating famine in the 1990s. But giving up a measure of control over the economy has consequences. So does growing dependent on Chinese imports. The North may be hitting an economic bubble and may face political instability.___Fox's James Murdoch slams Trump's Charlottesville responseNEW YORK (AP) - The CEO of 21st Century Fox has denounced racism and terrorists and expressed concern over President Donald Trump's reaction to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. James Murdoch also told friends in a personal email that he and his wife, Kathryn, will donate $1 million to the Anti-Defamation League. Murdoch is the son of media mogul and Trump ally Rupert Murdoch.___11 US states added jobs in JulyWASHINGTON (AP) - Hiring increased in 11 U.S. states in July, while the unemployment rate tumbled to record lows in two states. The Labor Department says that unemployment rates were relatively stable in most states. They fell in 15 states and rose in 23, but many of the changes were statistically insignificant.___Eclipse mania sends Americans scurrying to find safe glassesSALT LAKE CITY (AP) - Eclipse mania is building and so is demand for the glasses that make it safe to view the first total solar eclipse to cross the U.S. in 99 years. Complicating the rising demand from last-minute shoppers was a recent recall by Amazon that forced libraries and health centers around the country to recall glasses they gave away or sold.___China to limit overseas investments in real estate, sportsBEIJING (AP) - The Chinese government is moving to curb domestic companies' investments abroad in property, sports, entertainment and other fields. The move follows a series of high-profile, multibillion-dollar acquisitions by Chinese companies that have drawn heavy scrutiny. A document released Friday by the State Council, China's Cabinet, was the latest move by regulators to tap the brakes on a string of foreign acquisitions by Chinese conglomerates, citing concerns they might be taking on too much debt.___A midday rally fades as sporting goods stocks are penalizedNEW YORK (AP) - US stocks can't maintain a midday rally and finish lower as sporting goods companies sink. Foot Locker plunged in heavy volume after issuing a weak sales forecast. Farm equipment maker Deere also fell. Stocks were coming off their worst day in three months.___Hot stock tip: Chicken Soup for the SoulNEW YORK (AP) - "These are the times that try men's souls," was written more than two centuries ago, but given events this week, they could have popped up in any blog or tweet in recent days. What better time then, for a little Chicken Soup for the Soul? The provider of positive vibes is becoming a publicly traded company Friday.___Former Uber CEO lashes out at VC firm suing companySAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick is skewering a lawsuit filed by a former ally, describing it as a malicious attempt to sever his remaining ties to the ride-hailing service that he co-founded. Kalanick lashed out in legal documents filed late Thursday in response to a lawsuit filed against Uber last week by one of its major investors and a former Kalanick supporter, Benchmark Capital.___A sports rout on Wall StreetNEW YORK (AP) - Sporting goods retailers can't shake their losing streak. Shares of sporting goods stores plummeted Friday after Foot Locker and smaller rival Hibbett Sports reported a drop in sales. Both companies also offered gloomy outlooks for the rest of the year.___The S&P 500 lost 4.46 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,425.55. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 76.22 points, or 0.3 percent, to 21,674.55. The Nasdaq composite shed 5.39 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,216.53. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks gave up 1.15 point, or 0.1 percent, to 1,357.79. The index has fallen 6 percent since July 25.Benchmark U.S. crude oil jumped $1.42, or 3 percent, to $48.51 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, added $1.69, or 3.3 percent, to $52.72 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline rose 4 cents to $1.62 a gallon. Heating oil added 4 cents to $1.62 a gallon.

Sean, do you know?SEAN SPICER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This will be the largest audience to witness an Emmy's period.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The highlights and the lowlights from the 2017 Emmy Awards coming up this morning, Sean Spicer making an appearance there.And talk about extra sharp, the Atlantic Falcons opened their new stadium in a big way, trashing the Green Bay Packers. More from the big game coming up.All those stories coming up this Monday morning and joining me to talk all about it, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell. Rosecliff CEO, Managing Partner, Mike Murphy. And Rasmussen Reports Political Analyst, Amy Holmes. Good to see you.AMY HOLMES, RASMUSSEN REPORTS POLITICAL ANALYST: Good morning.BARTIROMO: Good morning.MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER: Good morning.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning. I just like watching the outrage on Twitter in response to Sean Spicer being there. From Paul Begala and all these lefties who were outraged."He lied to the American people and now they're making a joke about it." "And it's not funny." They have no sense of humor whatsoever.HOLMES: But you do. That was a great impression.MCDOWELL: I just thought it was funny.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: I mean by that same logic that you couldn't have Kate McKinnon portraying Hillary Clinton who's a known liar and winning an Emmy for it. So, again, you can't -- there's no humor in a liar. Well --BARTIROMO: I didn't think he was that funny. I mean, so what? Sean Spicer shows up at a podium, okay.HOLMES: Well I just think that he's going to redeem himself with that audience.BARTIROMO: Okay. So maybe that's it.HOLMES: They enjoyed laughing at him, I'm not sure it was with him.BARTIROMO: Well Melissa McCarthy was there in the audience watching, she had a funny expression when he came out. What about the U.N. General Assembly? Donald Trump speaking to the U.N. GA on Tuesday morning. This after all the things that he said about the U.N. on the campaign trail, it's going to be a must watch.MURPHY: And if you're in New York City, there's crazy traffic. We were stopped morning, searched with a dog in our car on the way here this morning.BARTIROMO: You were? At 4:00a.m.?MURPHY: Yes.BARTIROMO: Wow.MURPHY: Early this morning on 5th Avenue.MCDOWELL: An Uber driver I had over the weekend said that he doesn't drive at all when the U.N. is in town because people get so angry about the traffic that they give him bad ratings.BARTIROMO: Okay.MCDOWELL: Just because of the traffic.BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes, yes, yes.MCDOWELL: So he was like, "I'm staying in Brooklyn for a week."BARTIROMO: Probably a good move actually and we're talking terrorism this morning because that certainly one of the main topics on the discussion, agenda.We'll talk with Qatari Foreign Minister, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Al Thani coming up. Tennessee Congressman, Marsha Blackburn is with us this morning. Plus, the CEO and Founder of Overstock.com, Patrick Burn is here. A big fan of Bitcoin, he's got something to say about what Jamie Dimon has to say about Bitcoin as well, CEO of J.P. Morgan. WinView Executive Chairman and Former TiVo CEO, Tom Rogers is here. And Singer, Songwriter and Trump Campaign Advisor Board Member, Joy Villa will join us.We got a big show ahead, so just stay with us, keep it right here. And we kick it off here with our top story and that is President Trump taking the world stage this week. The president set to address the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations tomorrow.It will be the first time the president addresses the 193 member body as president. National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster said that the president will use the speech to promote his America First Agenda.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)H.R. MCMASTER, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: He thinks the speech is a tremendous opportunity obviously to reach so many world leaders at the same time and to emphasize really three themes.First is to protect the American people, the second is to promote American prosperity, and the third is really to help promote accountability and sovereignty. And those three themes will allow him to communicate his vision for America's role in the world.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: You know, it's interesting Dagen because a lot of the focus at the General Assembly will obviously be about North Korea, about Iran. But what do you want the president or what do people want him to say specifically about that? They're not all his friends in the room.MCDOWELL: They aren't. But particularly with -- we've seen all of these nations particularly with the additional sanctions that have been put on North Korea just recently even Russia and China getting on board with those.He's going to have to speak to those nations and say if North Korea does not pull back on these missile then you are going to have to step up even further. That we're going to expect more from all these nations in terms of putting financial pressure on North Korea, that we haven't gone far enough. And I think that that will resonate with everyone in the room and everybody around the globe.We'll see. We're talking about the pressure on China, that's going to be once again coming up this morning and so far, I don't know that China has done what the U.S. would like China to do.HOLMES: Well early reports says that they haven't and that they've been soft-pedaling these sanctions but getting back to what he's going to speak to the U.N., we had his -- Nikki Hailey the Ambassador to the U.N. saying he's also going to talk about reform and accountability.And I know for an American audience that will go over very well. And you have to understand this is also in the backdrop of the London bombing attack and he'll be talking I think about naming and shaming radical Islamic terrorism to this group.Now John Bolton, Former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. under George, he said that when George Bush went to talk to them, he would say it's like talking to a wax museum. So if he --BARTIROMO: Is that right? Wow, that's funny.HOLMES: Yes. So if he basically gets complete silence, that's a good thing.MURPHY: Well hopefully -- I hope he doesn't come across though that he's at the campaign trail. Hopefully he comes across as president of the largest most powerful country in the world and addresses people like that. I really think it's a great stage for him and a great opportunity and hope he ceases it.MCDOWELL: If he sticks to the prepared script and re -- and -- this is no knock on the president and sticks to the script, reads off the teleprompter and the prepared remarks, then he will do an admirable job.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: You saw it in the -- with the speech in Saudi Arabia, you've seen it time and again, when he needed to be serious, he's capable of doing that. It's when he's in front of his supporters that he tends to riff and run if he will.HOLMES: But I think we're going to see a real tone of shift from the previous eight years when you had a president who wasn't even willing to defend the first amendment at the U.N. I think is going to be a big change.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's true. Now let's talk about this story about the Paris Climate Agreement. Over the weekend "The Wall Street Journal" reported that the Trump Administration is considering staying in the Paris Accord under the right conditions.Here's what two of Trump Administration members are saying about that story this weekend.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REXT TILLERSON, SECRETARY OF STATE: I think under the right conditions the president said he's open to finding those conditions where we can remain engaged with others on what we all agree is still a challenging issue.MCMASTER: It's a false report. The president decided to pull out of the Paris Accord because it was a bad deal for the American people and because it was a bad deal for the environment.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: You know, it's interesting over the weekend when I saw that story, of course, with all of the sensitivity around him changing his mind on DACA, changing his mind on other issues, I tweeted out the story that the "Journal" was reporting that.Almost immediately, Sarah Sanders -- Huckabee Sanders responded and said, "No, the president has been very clear, we are leaving this Accord unless we get better terms."The Senior White House Advisor told the "Journal" that they will be meetings on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly to "assess" what is the real U.S. position. President Trump announced on June 1st that the U.S. would be leaving the Climate Accord. Do you think that's not the case now?HOLMES: You know, I couldn't quite understand these conflicting reports when you have the --BARTIROMO: They were very adamant denying the "Journal."HOLMES: They were, they were very adamant. And I agree with you that after DACA, particularly after it's seen that the president might be back pedaling on the wall which was a central campaign promise.And you saw his base and the right absolutely reject and go crazy over the notion he might me walking back from this. It just seem to me that the Paris Accord, he has to pull out of it. This was something that he would do on a campaign trail and certainly his voters want to see that happen.MURPHY: I mean we talk all the time about negotiations. So the president has a negotiator. So I think this is exactly what we wanted. This is why he was put in office, is to negotiate better deals and he said it straight out, America First so he wants to negotiate a better deal.Whether or not he gets it, if he has to pull out first, that's one thing, if he gets the right terms, I think he would consider staying in. So I like the idea that he's negotiating on behalf of the American people.MCDOWELL: It's Gary Cohn --HOLMES: Yes. I think though that one of the --MCDOWELL: It's Gary Cohn who's doing the negotiating. It is the White House -- we should point that out in terms of it's not the president at this meeting, it's a breakfast meeting that the Chief Economic Advisor is going to be participating in here in New York City.And what we do know is the terms that President Obama agreed to were unachievable without essentially destroying our economy. He guaranteed that we reduce our emissions by 26 to 28 percent by 2025.And we -- even with the most strict anti-carbon regulations we could only get to about 45 percent of that target. Meanwhile China doesn't have to step up, the biggest CO2 producer in the world didn't have to step up until many years down the road.BARTIROMO: But I think we should also point out that even putting the regulations and rules aside, the U.S. is still the cleanest country on the planet. The U.S. is still doing the best that it can do more so than -- and it's because of Corporate America, because of natural gas. So we're already making an incredible achievement here.MCDOWELL: And by the way, one -- and I've said this before, one thing that the left will never tell you in terms of carbon regulation is that you are essentially putting a tax on those people who cannot afford it.Whether it's low income Americans here in the United States, if you really want to roll back the amount of emissions from fossil fuels, you have to tax those very fuels.HOLMES: But President Obama said back in 2008 that electric bills would necessarily skyrocket if followed his plan.BARTIROMO: The U.S. is the only industrialized country to have reduced carbon last two years and we should not make promises for futures we cannot keep because we are already at a point that is much higher than so many others. That's the point that I'm just making here.Quick break. When we come back, two Oklahoma police officers were shot in the line of duty. Details on their condition, we are on it coming up.And then Slack, the latest startup to get a massive cash infusion, we'll tell you how much the technology unicorn is getting and how much it will boost its valuation. Stay with us, back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Two police officers were shot in Oklahoma while carrying out search warrant. Lauren Simonetti this morning on headlines, Lauren --LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi Maria. No official word on their condition but one of the officers reportedly in critical condition.Police say the shooting happened yesterday after 40 miles from Oklahoma City as police tried to serve a search warrant. The suspect barricaded himself inside the home before surrendering to authorities several hours later.Slack Technology's valued at $5.1 billion after raising another $250 million from SoftBank and other investors. Slack is a software startup, it makes the messaging app for the workplace. It says it now has $841 million in total fund as for an IPO. Well the company CEO reportedly saying that's not going to happen until after next year.Sunday night football, Green Bay's Erin Rogers and Atlantis Matt Ryan got back together for a rematch of the NFL championship game. It was the first regular season game in the Falcon's new home, Mercedes-Benz Stadium. The team seems to like the new dig, they beat up the Packers 34-23.Meanwhile, the Seattle Seahawk's Michael Bennett taking his protest to another level, before the game, Bennett took his usual seat on the bench during the national anthem. And later, he celebrated a stack with his fifth race, right there.Bennett claims he was (INAUDIBLE) racial profiling and excessive force when Las Vegas police detained him last month. So Maria, politics on the field and in Hollywood.BARTIROMO: Wow. Really. It's unbelievable this keeps happening. I mean "ESPN" been criticized for too much politics and yet we continue to see this happening on the football field.MURPHY: And it seems like it's getting more and more momentum and more and more people doing it. I think in this country you have a right to express your views any way you want to but I think also owners and sponsors have a right to agree with you or not have you on their team.BARTIROMO: Yes.If you're going to express your views, your boss should have the same right to not have you on the field. So -- I mean they can express their personal views but I don't know if owners necessarily have to agree with that.BARTIROMO: I would say, what does the viewer want, right? Why do you turn on to watch sports?HOLMES: Right. I was going to say, I thought football was supposed to be fun. I mean, I don't watch it but that's what I understand about it.BARTIROMO: Not a fight.HOLMES: And we know that actually NFL viewing has gone down 14 percent this year as compared to last year. Now it's the fractured media environment, it may have very little to do with these protests.But to your point, yes, every person has obviously in America the right to express their views. Not necessarily on TV, at work, on the football field and that might not be the best venue at least from the point of view of owners who are just trying to put on a good game.MCDOWELL: I just want one player to wear like a "Make America Great Again" hat.HOLMES: There was one.(CROSSTALK)HOLMES: What would happen then?MCDOWELL: And all the outrage.HOLMES: But I think there was one. A Tennessee player who wore these wonderful cleats on 9/11 with the towers and the American flag, it was great, it was fantastic.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: No. I meant -- I said "Make America Great" hat.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Runs the whole nine yards. The red hat --MCDOWELL: The 9/11 tribute is one thing. I mean just full on political statement. Yes.BARTIROMO: Full on. Well we'll hear it from Joy Villa coming up later on the program. Coming up first though, the mainstream media and why it's trying to prove that Facebook has more information about Russian meddling in the 2016 election and they are letting on.And then millennials are digital natives, they live on social media but is that where they are investing their money? We're taking the markets coming up, back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Does Facebook know more about Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election? Then it is telling us "The New York Times" is, "We're saying yes."This coming after the social media giant revealed a Russian firm with ties to the Kremlin created thousands of ads on its platform that ran before, during, and after the election. Facebook says that the ads were pushed out to specific parts of the country in an effort to influence the vote.Joining me now is Bustle.com Executive Editor, Julie Alvin. And Julie, thanks of joining us. Facebook has handed evidence relating to this ad campaign over to Robert Mueller. The Special Counsel investigating Russia's meddling, that's according to "The Wall Street Journal"When "The New York Times" asked Facebook why it could not share more information, the company said this:TEXT: Due to federal law and the ongoing investigation into these issues, we're limited as to what we can disclose publicly.What about that? Should the company be more transparent about the said campaign?JULIE ALVIN, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, BUSTLE.COM: I believe that the real question here is, are they being transparent enough with the FBI? That's kind of my primary concern because obviously that's the issue here.We really need to get to the bottom of this election meddling and I think that's kind of what I'm most concerned about, that's my primarily concern. Secondarily I'm certainly concerned as far as what they're meddling has been in the actual election, what these organizations have done.And in general, Facebook has had a terrifying impact on this election, they were suppressing conservative thought on the website, they were proliferating fake news and now we're learning that they were allowing for these sort of shadowy organizations to put this propaganda essentially out in front of the American people.So first step, make sure you're collaborating with the FBI as much as possible and then I would personally like to know what I may have been influenced by or what voters in general may have been influenced by when it came to this kind of information.HOLMES: And to the extent that it was deliberate. Like for example we know that Facebook has cooperated with China for example to sensor information that the Chinese government doesn't want their people to read.That is a deliberate business decision and that certainly has political impact. But I think there is kind of a tricky line here with just how much do you want Facebook meddling in what you post and whether or not they decide what you posted was hate speech or something that violates their policies, so more transparency is definitely needed.MURPHY: Yes. And I think we're just learning -- figuring out the whole internet thing and how you police it. But if Facebook gets too big, gets too powerful, you remember what happened when Microsoft got really big, the government got involved as far as antitrust concerns.So if Facebook is out there and suppressing one side or pushing one side versus another side, it could be grounds for the government to get involved also.MCDOWELL: Well both -- and we should point out both Facebook and Google last week said that they're disabling the ability to pinpoint users interested in anti-Semitic subjects and hate-filled content because they were essentially -- I mean according to this published report, you were able to buy advertising placement based on anti-Semitic threats.And the fact that this goes on and Facebook just says, "It's algorithm generated" is just appalling.BARTIROMO: Well even during the election, remember there were so many reports that when you research for things on Google, you search Hillary Clinton, it's all "Hillary is great," "Hillary is this," "Hillary is that."And then you couldn't find any of the negative stories about Hillary Clinton. Meanwhile when you search Donald Trump, it was all negative all the time. I mean, it's hard to make the case that that's just by coincidence, I'm sorry.HOLMES: Right. And we seem to be getting some stories from Google for example that it is not coincidental that there is a concerted effort to slant some of those search results.BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, one former "New York Times" labor reported getting slammed on social media for criticizing the White House.Steven Greenhouse slammed the administration for granting 11-year-old Frank Giaccio's request to mow the rose garden lawn. Remember when he joined us last week he was so excited about mowing the lawn. Here's what Steven Greenhouse tweeted:TEXT: Not sending a great signal on child labor, minimum wage, and occupational safety. Trump White House let's a 10-year-old volunteer mow the lawn and "What this kid wants to do is noble but sorry, I'm mindful of problems. I've written lots about child labor and kids being hurt by machinery.HOLMES: Like you can't mow your own lawn? What does he mean by that?BARTIROMO: It's too much. It's just too much. Julie, your thoughts here.ALVIN: Look, child labor in general is a concern. There's certain protections that have been rolled back in recent years that limits the kind of jobs that kids can work and the amount of hours they can work.And there are certainly examples in Kentucky, in Tennessee where kids are working six to eight hour -- 60 to 80 a week in the tobacco fields and experiencing the negative effects of that. That's not what this is. Like let the kid mow his lawn, let a kid have a paper route, it's voluntary, it's innocent.BARTIROMO: The kid mows lawns for a job. He wrote a letter to the White House saying, "I mow lawns, please can I mow the lawn?ALVIN: Frankly, I'm more concerned that this kid apparently idolizes Donald Trump, that's the problem I have with this story, not necessarily that he wants to mow White House lawn.BARTIROMO: So are we still allowed -- so you're not afraid of child labor though?ALVIN: No, I'm not -- I'm afraid child labor in general, I think that's a concern that can be talked about and regulations have been rolled back with regards to child labor and that is of concern. This is --HOLMES: Look, this is not a ghetto (INAUDIBLE) here. Oh wait, what are we talking about?ALVIN: -- not right and it's also -- when you call this child labor, then you're just diminishing the actual instances of child labor, then it is a problem.MCDOWELL: This manufactured outrage just gives me a headache and it is exhausting.BARTIROMO: Fake news.MURPHY: Completely agree. We're giving the reported who wrote this story way too much time. I think the kid's doing an awesome job, great for the kid, great for his friends.BARTIROMO: And he joined us last week and he was awesome.ALVIN: The kid joined you last week?BARTIROMO: Yes, yes. He was on me with this. Julie, good to see you. Thank you so much.ALVIN: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Julie Alvin there. Coming up, more than 80 people arrested in St. Louis as they protested after the acquittal of a former white police officer that shot and killed a black man after a high speed chase, the very latest violence erupts on the third night of protests.

Meanwhile, a bit of a merger Monday on Wall Street, Defense Giant Northrop Grumman acquiring Orbital ATK $9.2 billion dollars there. That includes debt, that's the total Orbital shares soaring on the news. Take a look at Orbital, up 20 percent on that Northrop Grumman acquisition. Markets are looking good. They are looking higher this morning.Dow Industrials set to open up about 50 points, that's a quarter of a percent higher, NASDAQ, S&P 500 also in the green. In Europe, stocks are also higher this morning. Take a look at the Indices there, live, FT-100 up almost a third of a percent, CAC Quarante also up a third of a percent, and the DAX Index higher by a quarter of a percent, 34 points higher. In Asia overnight, markets were in the green as well, up to close, Japan is closed for a holiday, the others higher across the board.And now, our top story this half an hour, a timeline for tax reform, House Republicans are expected to shed more light on their proposal next week. Speaker Paul Ryan says that they plan to release an outline on the legislation as early as Monday. I spoke about that yesterday, with House Ways and Means Committee Chairman, Kevin Brady on Sunday Morning Futures.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. KEVIN BRADY (R-TX), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE: We are unified around a very strong middle-class tax cuts. I want to lower the rates at every level, so people can keep more of what they earn and we can grow the economy. I just honestly believe watching takes too much of what people are in, frankly, they also waste too much of what they take while they've got it. And so, I think, for us to grow this economy, drive a major middle-class tax cut and really create jobs in a way we've not seen a long way, let's try to lower those rates, create that growth at every level.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Jay Jacobs, Global X-Funds' Vice President, Head of Research at Global X. Jay, good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.JAY JACOBS, VICE PRESIDENT, GLOBAL X FUNDS: Thank you.BARTIROMO: You say that, obviously, Global X is at ETF Firm, you say that you're not really seeing a big expectation in terms of tax reform based on ETFs.JACOBS: That's what we are seeing right now. I mean, you would expect some of those higher tax bracket companies to really start to reflect, you know, some sort of major rally if we are expecting tax reform to pass. It hasn't really separated from the market, though. We are just seeing kind of general positive markets across sectors. Meaning, you know, it's just not been priced into things like consumer discretionary which we would think will benefit --BARTIROMO: So where are you seeing most of the flows right now, what kind of ETFs?JACOBS: Well, we're seeing a lot of flows systematic ETFs right now, specifically technology-related ETFs on lithium and battery technology fund has quadrupled this year. As people are really kind of looking at the next decade and trying to figure out where growth is going to be coming from, we have high evaluations in the U.S. right now. We have kind of low GDP growth, so Future growth is really something that people are concerned about.MICHAEL MURPHY, FOUNDER & CEO, ROSECLIFF: Our firm owns some of the lithium ETF, you guys put together, and I think it's a great way for individual investors to look and say, I don't necessarily want on Tesla, because for whatever reason, evaluation, possibly, but I do want to own the shift from regular cars that we have now to battery-operated cars in the future. And this is a great way you guys put together something. So that theme is a way, and I think the assets on the management of the funds have really taken off in the last year, right?JACOBS: Well, we have seen a couple of trends that are really starting to take off for electric vehicles. If you go back a few years, this was really just kind of like affluent, early adapter kind of thing with Tesla, right? The people who had a lot of money thought they are cool, but it wasn't really a mass market, kind of, product yet. What's starting to change is battery cost, have fallen in half in the last three years. And regulators across the world are starting to make the electric vehicles a standard in 2030, 2040. You have countries like China, the U.K., France, India, and Norway that are banning combustion engines. So, you have these, kind of, two fronts that are really starting to make electric vehicles in the reflection point.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: One thing though, about tax reform, is anything that happens, is going to be gravy for these markets and you can disagree with me if you want to, but you have such a terrific fundamentals globally at this point, every single of the 45 developed nations in this world, every single one of those has an economy that's growing this year, and I think 33 percent of them have an economy that's growing even faster than they were last year, so first time, you've had that synchronized global growth in a decade.BARTIROMO: Fundamental backdrop.MCDOWELL: It's really incredibleMURPHY: I completely agree with you, earnings are supporting the market up here.MCDOWELL: Right.MURPHY: SO, if we do get some, sort of, tax reform, I also believe it'll be a push. I think you got that from me, actually.MCDOWELL: Let me ask you that.BARTIROMO: It's true. A lot of people have been saying that, that it's just, sort of, the icing on the cake.MCDOWELL: t's 6:36, I can't insult you yet. I cannot insult you yet.AMY HOLMES, FOX NEWS POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR: You know, we just heard Kevin Brady talking about middle-class tax cuts which of course, are popular with voters and I think, certainly long overdue, but does that really actually help in terms of growth? There's debate that the George Bush tax cuts didn't actually help grow the economy where you want to see those tax cuts is when it comes to corporate tax cuts.JACOBS: I think it really depends what happens with those tax cuts, right? If you cut from the middle class, it's probably going the boost consumption because you suddenly have more money in people's pockets than --HOLMES: But what we found with the Bush tax cut is, it's actually people use them to pay down debt.JACOBS: Well, you know, debt can hurt consumption over the long run, right, because people, you know, sort of get in the debt spiral and they start cutting back on their spending. So maybe it doesn't have immediate impact, but over the long run, I can, kind of, spur, you know, more consumption in the future.BARTIROMO: Who is your typical investor right now? We want to talk about the new generation of investors out there, the millennials, what millennials are doing, this is going to be an important segment of the market for financial services.JACOBS: Yes.BARTIROMO: I don't know. Do they have money right now or do you target them to hope to get some of their flows of money over the years?JACOBS: So, in terms of investable assets, millennials are pretty small right now, but really you have to look forward to the future and see how much money they are going to start to control. So in 2025, income is going to go from $2 trillion to $8 trillion for millennials.BARTIROMO: Wow.JACOBS: They're going to inherit $30 trillion dollars from the baby boomers. So, you know, most millennials are pretty young, pretty early in their career, but a lot of money's going to start being funneled towards this generation, and they're very unique consumer in how they spend that money. They spend it a lot on technology, a lot on health and wellness, a lot on experiences rather luxury goods. So we see that a lot of firms are trying to reorient how they're going to, you know, really cater to millennials rather than the baby boomers which just been their cash count for the last few years.MURPHY: And I think one thing millennials also are risk adverse, at least at this point in time, so they'll invest in something that they understand like lithium batteries or electric cars, but they don't necessarily want to take on big risks for big reward. They want to keep what they have.BARTIROMO: Well, I would say lithium battery is a big risk for big reward. I mean, you know, I don't know.JACOBS: We see there's a very tangible on prospect --BARTIROMO: That's a trend, right?MURPHY: No, I don't think it's a trend at all. I think that --BARTIROMO: You think that --MURPHY: We are going to have more electric cars on the road than regular cars in the future, right? I think that's, kind of, the country --BARTIROMO: But we have been expecting that for a long time and it hasn't gained traction yet.JACOBS: So, let me just say, true, OPEC, they should be, kind of, the least for electric vehicles, they just revised their estimates by five times more electric vehicles coming on the road. So even the people who you'd think would be the biggest attracters of electric vehicle are saying, this is happening.BARTIROMO: Good stuff, Jay, great to see you.JACOBS: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Jay Jacobs joining us there, Global X Funds.

Stay with us next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS, ACTRESS: Imagine if your President was not beloved Nazi.STEPHEN COLBERT, COMEDIAN: Unlike the presidency, Emmys go to the winner of the popular vote.Is there anyone who could say how big the audience is? Sean, do you know?SEAN SPICER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This will be the largest audience to witness an Emmys, period.LILY TOMLIN, ACTRESS: In 2017, we still refuse to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot.ALEC BALDWIN, ACTOR: I suppose I should say, at long last, Mr. President, here is your Emmy.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Wow. I hadn't watched that. They went all out. Politics really took center stage last night at the 69th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles hosted by comedian Stephen Colbert. Hollywood celebrated the best in television by throwing jabs at our President. Joining us right now, singer-songwriter, and Donald J. Trump for President's advisory board member, Joy Villa is with us. Joy, good to see you.JOY VILLA, SINGER-SONGWRITER: Good to see you, too, Maria.BARTIROMO: And we've talked about your support for the President and what that has gotten you --VILLA: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- from Hollywood. Did you watch the Emmy's?VILLA: I watched the Emmy's, unfortunately, only because I know everyone is going to ask me about it. Now, it's a bunch of Hollywood elitists, talking about Hollywood elitists, talking about how great Hollywood elitists are.(LAUGHTER)VILLA: Completely relatable to the American public. And, of course, they bashed Trump because they don't have humor. You know, if Trump was an actor, I think they'd actually love him. He's handsome, he hangs out with models, he's very confident, he dresses well.BARTIROMO: They just don't want him in the White House.VILLA: No, exactly. Now, he's enemy number one. But, you know, if Trump wasn't the President, they honestly wouldn't have anything to joke about, that's all they talk about.HOLMES: In years, I don't need to be hectored about my politics from multimillionaires, you know, dressed in all these gowns and jewels. I mean, I have to say I think Jane Fonda did look amazing.(LAUGHTER)HOLMES: Talking about the hair. And I just -- well, she's 79 years old. Can you imagine?MCDOWELL: Wow. Yes. That much --(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: She should -- she should instead be wearing a sandwich board thanking her team of surgeons over the years.HOLMES: OK.BARTIROMO: Oh, ouch. Ouch.MCDOWELL: And the women -- and the women who grew that hair for her.HOLMES: That's true.MCDOWELL: No, I'm serious. I'm actually serious, I tweeted this last night in terms of Jane Fonda. She's still promoting and perpetuating an ideal of feminine beauty at 79 that is completely unattainable. And I always found that to be at odds with her staunchly feminist stance about women's rights in this country, but this is what -- I mean, how about just aging gracefully.HOLMES: No, you can't. No more.MCDOWELL: She's 79. I mean, OK. That just looks great.HOLMES: And she's been cooled quite a bit. You're right.MCDOWELL: I know she's talked about it. I'm not revealing --BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes. Yes.HOLMES: I'm sure there's plenty of men in the audience who, you know, have their open tab at this surgeon as well.(LAUGHTER)VILLA: Oh, yes.BARTIROMO: You know, it's unfortunate because it does alienate people when you start -- everything is political. They just assume that everybody feels that way.VILLA: Right.BARTIROMO: So, they're just talking about what they all agree on.VILLA: And it's insulting, too. It's insulting to us. Yes.(CROSSTALK)HOLMES: But the thing is they don't realize that they are actually alienating a lot of the viewers? When you put on this show, it's actually broadcast. I don't know if they know that.BARTIROMO: Right, right, right.HOLMES: And a lot of people just don't tune in.BARTIROMO: Not just in the audience.MURPHY: We did watch it in our house. My kids are watching it and, you know, just everyone came across -- almost everybody there came across as bitter and childish, and even my kids picked up on it. Like, why do they keep making jokes about the President?VILLA: You know, what they seem like, to me, is a heartbroken teenager, you know, you're sitting home alone, he didn't call you so you're eating ice cream, you're calling your friend, you're saying how much you hate him, you're cutting out pictures. Well, America, I'm sorry, but we're just not that into you.HOLMES: Yes.MCDOWELL: I love these shows and I don't want the personal politics of these individuals and their rage at the President to affect my enjoyment of their work.BARTIROMO: Yes.MURPHY: Agreed.MCDOWELL: Like I don't need, you know what --BARTIROMO: How about celebrating their work?MCDOWELL: Exactly. This is -- that's why I didn't watch it because I knew -- I knew what you would get.(CROSSTALK)HOLMES: When you hire Stephen Colbert.BARTIROMO: That's true. That's true.MCDOWELL: Why I don't watch that show.BARTIROMO: Well, I'm surprised Sean Spicer made the appearance that he did, frankly. I mean, obviously, he's still trying to be liked by that community.VILLA: I thought it was kind of funny that he did it because he's making fun of himself amongst people who are -- they don't get irony. I think he was being sort of ironic in a way. I think more power to him, you know, I mean, he showed his face. We know what he really thinks. I think he -- I think they think that he's in with them but I think he's making fun of them more than anything. That's how I show --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Let me switch -- let me switch gears because you were just in Houston, Joy.VILLA: Yes.BARTIROMO: Two weeks ago, you were in Houston helping the victims of Hurricane Harvey. You've helped raise $3 million. That's terrific, Joy, thank you about that.VILLA: Yes. Thank you so much. Well, I was in Houston for two days, and on the grounds, first of all, we got offered, me and my friend, Kaya Jones, former Pussycat Doll, mercuryone.org said would you tweet about, you know, our Houston efforts? So, we started tweeting and we started raising a million dollars within the first couple of days. So, we went down to the grounds and we helped people in person, we fed them, we delivered food, clothing, everything they needed, and at the end of that -- those two days, we raised $3 million for those efforts. And I'll tell you, the people, when we met them, they were helping each other, all colors, all races, all different ethnicities, and they said, can you please tell the news that we're not racists.BARTIROMO: That's what you get from them. Wow.VILLA: Yes.BARTIROMO: What did you see on the ground in terms of the damage?VILLA: It was horrendous. I mean, people's lives are completely destroyed. You know, their homes are done, their photos, you know, you saw photo albums just completely drenched. And these people are going to have to rebuild for the next five to 10 years. It's really tragic, the smells, there's bodies in the water, there's animals in the water. It's a really rough situation.BARTIROMO: Joy, you got a new role, you are now part of the Donald J. Trump for President Advisory Board.VILLA: That's right.BARTIROMO: You took on this role, when? Just recently?VILLA: Just recently. Just a couple of days ago.BARTIROMO: What are you hoping to accomplish?VILLA: Well, I'm hoping to spread the real news about Donald Trump because a lot of people, you know, think the President is this way and that way, and they don't know what to believe anymore. Well, I'm getting the updates before most people are getting the updates. So, I'm able to say, you know, this is what he really thinks, this is what's really going on, and represent him in the media as much as possible, especially for 2020, coming up, campaigning.BARTIROMO: 2020. And I -- and that is definitely a major focus for the White House as well, right now, 2020.MURPHY: For sure.BARTIROMO: Who will be on the other side, do you think for 2020?VILLA: That's a good question.MCDOWELL: I'll lay money that they'll run Kamala Harris. I think that they almost certainly will run a woman.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: Elizabeth Warren.VILLA: Yes. Well, no, no. She's already been destroyed.MCDOWELL: -- like two Hillary.VILLA: Yes.MCDOWELL: She's too -- I mean, I don't want to say it, you know --HOLMES: They'll going to want Kamala.BARTIROMO: She's very left, I mean, Elizabeth Warren. And that's part of the issue with the Democratic Party, it's been hijacked by the extreme left, the Bernie Sanders and the Elizabeth Warrens of the world.VILLA: Well, Kamala Harris is black and female, so I think they're going to try to, you know, do that thing, put the race, put the femininity, say, well, if you wouldn't vote for a woman before, maybe you'll vote for our black woman. Try to shove it in our faces, I think that's what they're going to do.BARTIROMO: Well, we'll see about that. We've got to see some legislative victories, and that will certainly be a push for Donald Trump. We're talking about that, coming up. Joy, it's great to see you.VILLA: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Joy Villa joining us there. Still ahead, serving up a tall glass of nostalgia with a side of sugar.

The company described Smith's departure as a retirement. It comes after Equifax disclosed that hackers exploited a software flaw that the company didn't fix to steal Social Security numbers, birthdates and other personal data that provide the keys to identify theft.___Ivanka Trump's business ties shrouded in secrecy in ChinaSHANGHAI (AP) - The Chinese supply chains of Ivanka Trump's brand are more opaque than ever. That raises questions about who her company is doing business with in a country where it's hard not to bump up against the government. Among the few publicly identified companies that have previously shipped Ivanka Trump goods to the U.S., the AP found one owned by the Chinese government and another selected for special export subsidies - a possible violation by China of global fair trade rules.___US Senators grill SEC chair on disclosure of data breachWASHINGTON (AP) - U.S. senators from both parties on Tuesday grilled the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission - the agency responsible for policing Wall Street - on its handling of a 2016 data breach that was disclosed only last week. The hack breached the SEC's system for handling corporate filings intended for investors, known as EDGAR.___Adidas exec, 4 coaches charged in college bribery schemeNEW YORK (AP) - In one of the biggest crackdowns on the corrupting role of money in college basketball, 10 men - including a top Adidas executive and four assistant coaches - were charged Tuesday with using hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to influence star athletes' choice of schools, shoe sponsors, agents, financial advisers, even tailors.___Yellen: Fed is perplexed by chronically low inflationCLEVELAND (AP) - Chair Janet Yellen conceded that the Fed is puzzled by the persistence of unusually low inflation and that it might have to adjust the timing of its interest rate policies accordingly. Most analysts expect the Fed to raise rates in December, for a third time this year, in a reflection of economic gains. But the Fed has said its rate hikes will depend on incoming data.___Stocks edge higher as tech rebounds and cruise lines riseNEW YORK (AP) - US stocks move higher as small companies continue to rise and technology companies recover some of their losses from a day earlier. Cruise line operator Carnival is rising after a strong third-quarter report, as is open-source software company Red Hat. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said the Fed may need to change its interest rate plans in response to low inflation.___Republican leaders: Senate won't vote on Obamacare repealWASHINGTON (AP) - Facing assured defeat, Republican leaders decided Tuesday not to even hold a vote on the GOP's latest attempt to repeal the Obama health care law, surrendering on their last-gasp effort to deliver on the party's banner campaign promise.___Trump vows to 'fix the mess' as US targets North Korea banksWASHINGTON (AP) - The Trump administration is using new sanctions authority to punish eight North Korean banks and 26 bank workers living abroad. The sanctions rely on an executive order President Donald Trump signed last week to target North Korea's access to the international banking system. Trump says North Korea must no longer be allowed to "threaten the entire world with unthinkable loss of life."___Trump vows to cut taxes 'tremendously' for middle classWASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump is vowing to deliver on a major tax cut for middle-class Americans as the White House and congressional leaders prepare to release details on a tax overhaul proposal that would slash the corporate rate and simplify the nation's tax code. The grand plan to rewrite the nation's tax code would be the first major overhaul in three decades. It also would deliver on a Trump campaign pledge.___Macron: Europe is too slow, blind to dangers of nationalismPARIS (AP) - Calling Europe slow, weak and ineffective, French President Emmanuel Macron says the EU should embrace a joint budget, shared military force and harmonized taxes to stay globally relevant. With Brexit looming, Macron warned the rest of Europe against the dangers of anti-immigrant nationalism and fragmentation, saying that goes against the principles of a shared Europe born from the tragedy of world wars.___The Standard & Poor's 500 index added 0.18 of a point to 2,496.84. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 11.77 points, almost 0.1 percent, to 22,284.32. The Nasdaq composite gained 9.57 points, or 0.2 percent, to 6,380.16.

White House: Trump wasn't being literal when he tweeted he should've left UCLA players 'in jail'Business Insider USNovember 20, 2017 Monday 05:17 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 500 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Tyler Lauletta)Highlight: Sarah Huckabee Sanders clarified after theBody• The three UCLA basketball players who were arrested in China and charged with shoplifting returned stateside after President Trump met with Xi Jinping to ask for help in the case.• LaVar Ball, father of LiAngelo Ball, downplayed Trump's involvement with his son's release while speaking with ESPN.• On Sunday morning, Trump sent out a tweet suggesting Ball was ungrateful for his help and that he "should have left [the players] in jail!"• At the daily press briefing on Monday, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders clarified that Trump's comments were "rhetorical" and that he was pleased that the players were back stateside.The White House has clarified President's Trump tweet from Sunday morning, in which he said of the three UCLA Bruins who had been arrested in China, "I should have left them in jail!"At the White House daily briefing on Monday, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders clarified that the president did not regret intervening in the case when asked about the tweet, and that he was happy to see their release."The president was certainly very glad and thankful to see the release of the three UCLA athletes by the Chinese government," Sanders said.Sanders was then asked if the president really believed he should have left the players in jail, to which Sanders said, "No, I think if that was the case he wouldn't have taken the action that he did, and acted in order to help get those individuals released and brought back to the country."When asked why President Trump tweeted, "I should have left them in jail!" when he did not believe that he should have left the players in jail, Sanders said that his words were meant as "a rhetorical response to a criticism of the father."The father in question is none other than LaVar Ball, who downplayed Trump's involvement in the release of his son LiAngelo after            he was caught shoplifting with two of his UCLA teammates in China. Trump was in China at the time of the players' arrest, and            reportedly spoke with Chinese president XI Jingping and requested help with getting them released. After their safe return stateside, Trump had openly wondered on Twitter whether or not the players would give him credit for bringing them back,            which they did at a press conference, but LaVar Ball later went on to downplay the role Trump played in his son's release            while speaking with ESPN. It was this dismissal that drew the ire of the president and prompted his Sunday morning tweet, which we now know to be "rhetorical."You can watch the odd exchange below.NOW WATCH: I ate exactly like Tom Brady for a week and it made me feel betterSee Also:• Twitter users had fun reacting the war of words between Trump and LaVar Ball• 'I should have left them in jail!': Trump responds to LaVar Ball belittling his role in son's release from China• Trump got his thank-you from UCLA players in their first comments on China arrestSEE ALSO: Steve Kerr says the media should stop covering Trump and LaVar BallLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

LinkedIn is latest to push back on data rule; Company abandons Russia after it insists on use of local serversUSA TODAYAugust 15, 2017 TuesdayFINAL EDITIONCopyright 2017 Gannett Company, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: MONEY; Pg. 2BLength: 692 wordsByline: Roger Yu, @ByRogerYu, USA TODAYBodyLinkedIn recently threw in the  towel on operating in Russia.Unwilling to go along with  authorities' orders to store all Russian users' data on servers in the country, the social networking company chose to abandon the market rather than comply with the law.The site, which served about 6million Russian users, was blocked in the country in November shortly after a Russian court ruling sided with the government's communications regulator.The LinkedIn case is perhaps the most prominent example of an emerging legal and trade trend worldwide in which multinational companies are required to store and process country-relevant data locally.U.S. companies have lobbied and pleaded with foreign governments to relax data restrictions with little success. Most recently, the issue became a priority in the Trump administration's trade negotiations.  President Trump  listed the issue as one of his demands in the upcoming renegotiations for the North American Free Trade Agreement.Seeing data as a desirable currency and a tool in wielding economic and political power, dozens of countries, including China, Russia, Germany, Turkey, Belgium, Brazil and South Korea, have enacted data-must-stay laws in recent years with varying degrees of severity.Not surprisingly, U.S. companies, especially the ones that handle large amounts of data, are concerned. Cutting-edge tech firms worry about having their intellectual property, such as source codes, stolen. Having to store data locally is expensive for small-to-midsize companies that have to find local server vendors, said Josh Kallmer, senior vice president for global policy at the Information Technology Industry Council.More broadly, the measures stifle jobs and innovation, the rule's opponents say. Restricting data movement also can erode the Internet's vitality in the long run. For example, Americans can no longer look up prospective Russian suppliers or customers on LinkedIn."Part of what made the Internet always great and the reason why it's blossomed is because it was always decentralized and not subject to heavy-handed regulations," said Omer Tene, vice president of research and education at the International Association of Privacy Professionals. "The concern is that the Internet will be splintered into islands."Data flowing through international borders generated $2.8trillion in value in 2014, according to a study by the McKinsey Institute."Data needs to flow to create value," said Nigel Cory, a trade policy analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. The data restriction rules make U.S. companies "less efficient and less competitive."The rules also could hurt the countries that enact them. Australia requires all health data to be stored in the country. And that would discourage, say, IBM from selling its artificial intelligence platform Watson to hospitals in Australia."Australia is then cut off from the innovative services," Cory said. "IBM is not going to build supercomputers in every market."China's data-localization policies would cost the country as much as 1.1% of its gross domestic product, the European Center for International Political Economy estimated in 2014.China is seen as a particularly stringent enforcer and purveyor of the rule. Its blocking of some prominent American sites, such as Google and Facebook, and other sources that are critical of the Chinese government is well known.Still, in 2016, China tightened its data rules by enacting a new cybersecurity law that forces foreign companies in more sectors to store data in the country, said Courtney Bowman, a cybersecurity attorney at international law firm Proskauer.While cybersecurity might be a purported reason, the real motive of China and others is more mixed.Having data stored locally eases the governments' work of citizen surveillance. Companies fear having their local data used by law enforcement or political groups for illegitimate reasons."What they see as legitimate doesn't translate to any one of us in democracy," Tene said, referring to China's, Russia's and Turkey's data rules."If you think they're driven by privacy, security and human rights, no." Load-Date: August 15, 2017End of Document

The wide coverage and strict measures taken during the environmental inspections has instigated broader concerns in the fertilizer industry.During the 2016-17 environmental inspections, some fertilizer plants were found violating the environmental requirements and forced to shut down, unless they implemented improvements on environmental protection and fulfilled the requisite environmental regulations. The majority of fertilizer plants that were penalised by the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) have been approved to restart production after making necessary improvements in environmental protection.Read the full story:http://bit.ly/Chinas-environmental-regulations  Read more about CRU:http://bit.ly/About_CRUAbout CRU CRU offers unrivalled business intelligence on the global metals, mining and fertilizer industries through market analysis, price assessments, consultancy and events.Since our foundation in 1969, we have consistently invested in primary research and robust methodologies, and developed expert teams in key locations worldwide, including in hard-to-reach markets such as China.

These three countries are winning the global robot raceCNNMoney.comAugust 21, 2017 Monday 10:14 AM ESTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHNOLOGYLength: 743 wordsByline: Rishi IyengarBodyWhen it comes to making machines to perform tasks that humans have done for years, the United States, China and India are far ahead of anyone else, according to a top tech industry executive.The three countries are leading an artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, Malcolm Frank, head of strategy at leading outsourcing firm Cognizant, told CNNMoney in an interview.Frank is the co-author of a recent book entitled "What to Do When Machines Do Everything," on the impact artificial intelligence will have on the global economy in the coming years."I think it's three horses in the race, and that's probably the wrong metaphor because they are all going to win," he said. "They are just going to win differently."While AI is progressing quickly elsewhere too, Frank said the other development hotspots are mainly city hubs such as London and Stockholm, or far smaller economies such as Estonia."The big three [are] India, China and the U.S," he said.Here's why:AmericaSilicon Valley giants such as Facebook, Amazon, Google and Tesla are already investing billions in harnessing the power of computers to replace several human tasks.Computers are already beginning to substitute for people in sectors such as agriculture and even medicine, not to mention the race to get driverless cars on the road."With Silicon Valley, and the vendors and momentum that exists there... that's going to continue," Frank said.ChinaThe world's second largest economy is also betting big on artificial intelligence.Tech companies including Tencent and Baidu are competing with Silicon Valley to develop new uses for AI, and tech billionaire Jack Ma of Alibaba, one of China's richest men, has even said CEOs may eventually be obsolete.Unlike in the U.S., however, the biggest push towards this new world in China is coming from the government."You look at the playbook China has had very successfully, with state sponsorship around developing the [physical] infrastructure of the country," Frank said. "They're taking a very similar approach around artificial intelligence, and I think that's going to yield a lot of benefit."The Chinese government has already laid out an ambitious plan for a $150 billion AI industry, saying last month that it wants China to become the world's "innovation center for AI" by 2030.IndiaIn India, the main shift towards artificial intelligence is coming from companies that make up its $143 billion outsourcing industry -- a sector that employs nearly 4 million people.Top firms like Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro, which provide technology services to big names including Pepsi, Kellogg and AMD, are increasingly relying on automation in their operations."In India, you look at this remarkable platform that is in place now... of incredibly sophisticated skills that are focused on the needs of [global] companies," said Frank.In addition, India's startup scene also makes him "very optimistic" about the future of artificial intelligence there.Cognizant, which is based in the U.S. but has most of its workforce in India, is also making ever greater use of AI -- from online bots managing clients' finances to helping create automated systems for smart devices.Should we be worried?Many are worried about the potential pitfalls of artificial intelligence, including Tesla's billionaire founder Elon Musk. He has warned that the technology could pose "an existential threat" if not used properly, and published a letter this week with over 100 other industry experts demanding a global ban on using it to make weapons.Frank said that the development of artificial intelligence requires careful thought, by governments and companies working together to establish ground rules. The tech executive compared it to safety regulations for air travel and for cars, which have evolved several times over the years.The focus needs to be on creating a world "where AI is going to be safe and you get the benefits of it without the downsides," he said.As for the other pervasive fear -- that more robots will lead to job losses -- Frank argues that AI will not only create more and different kinds of jobs in the future, but also enhance many of the existing ones."That's what happened with assembly lines, that's what happened with the steam engine, that's what we think is going to happen with artificial intelligence."?

PINTEC launches Singapore-based PIVOT to offer digital wealth management technology services in Southeast AsiaPR NewswireOctober 11, 2017 Wednesday 10:00 PM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 727 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Oct. 11, 2017 BodyPINTEC Group ("PINTEC"), a leading fintech player in China, today announced the launch of PIVOT Fintech Pte. Ltd. ("PIVOT"), to offer digital wealth management technology services powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning throughout Southeast Asia from its base in Singapore. It's the first time that a Chinese robo-advisory company has developed its business outside of China.PIVOT will be PINTEC's first venture outside of China, and is in part backed by pan-Asian life insurer FWD Group and angel investors. "We are pleased to collaborate with an innovative and entrepreneurial financial group like FWD," said William Wei, CEO of PINTEC Group. "Through PIVOT, we hope to both tap the huge fintech potential in Southeast Asia, while also supporting the call of the Chinese government's One Belt, One Road Initiative."PIVOT will operate in Southeast Asia to offer PINTEC's proprietary dynamic, real-time wealth management and robo-advisory technology to financial institutions. Tracing its roots to 2012 when it first began operating in the digital credit analytics space, PINTEC has since grown to include AI and data-driven technologies such as robo advisory (POLARIS), digital lending (DUMIAO), online mutual funds (HONGDIAN), and online insurance broking (MYFIN)."With over 400 technical engineers, data analysts and staff, PINTEC will support PIVOT throughout Southeast Asia," said Zheng Yudong, Chief Executive Officer of PINTEC's POLARIS unit. "We want to offer a truly intelligent platform that mitigates risk by decreasing human interference and level the playing field for customers."A unique solution offered by PIVOT is "dynamic asset allocation" powered by machine learning algorithms. Every investment model portfolio is designed using predicted information and matched to the investor's personal investment risk profile - at the time when the investor enrolls. As investment markets change all the time, the model portfolios are machine-determined each new day without human intervention.Furthermore, any portfolio rebalancing at PIVOT is driven not only by market changes to the specific investor's portfolio, but also on machine-predictions of market trends, transaction costs, liquidity and other friction-related factors. The solution allows investors to sense the likelihood of rebalancing via a unique probability indicator on the mobile app.PINTEC launched its digital wealth-management and robo-advisory unit (POLARIS) in June 2016, and has successfully implemented the AI and machine learning platform for mainstream financial institutions in China, such as Minsheng Securities and Anbang Insurance Group. POLARIS is unique with completely machine-generated models based on latest market data and trends, adjusted in real time 24x7, and managed to the specified risk profile of the customer. POLARIS' asset allocation algorithms have passed rigorous testing and regulatory compliance standards to meet the growing demand for low cost, transparent and risk-managed long-term investment portfolios."PIVOT is an exciting opportunity for customers in the region," said Victor Lye, Co-Founder & CEO of PIVOT. "I will leverage my 25-year experience in investments, insurance and healthcare to deliver better value and transparency with our digital wealth management engine. PIVOT is off to a good start, being among 11 finalists selected from over 160 applicants from around the world to showcase our solutions at the FinTech Abu Dhabi Innovation Challenge in October 2017."About PINTEC GroupPINTEC Group is China's leading end-to-end fintech solution provider to businesses and financial institutions. It aims to leverage technology to advance financial services and level the playing field. With its "Powered by PINTEC" strategy, the company provides innovative digital financial services solutions to institutions and their customers.PINTEC's wholly owned subsidiaries include Dumiao, digital lending technology; Polaris, digital wealth-management and robo-advisory; Hongdian Fund, online mutual fund distribution; and Myfin Insurance, an online insurance brokerage.For more information, please visithttp://www.pintec.comView original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pintec-launches-singapore-based-pivot-to-offer-digital-wealth-management-technology-services-in-southeast-asia-300535324.htmlSOURCE PINTEC GroupCONTACT: Dian Shu, +86-156-2497-1226, dian.shu@pintec.comLoad-Date: October 12, 2017End of Document

Good Thursday morning, everybody. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, September 14th. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Surveying the damage. President Trump leaving the White House momentarily, headed to Florida to see the destruction left from Hurricane Irma. It comes amid a horror at a nursing home where eight people have died. Authorities are launching a criminal investigation into what went wrong at that nursing home yesterday.The president reaching across the aisle on immigration. He had dinner last night with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader later Nancy Pelosi at the White House. But the two sides have offered different accounts of exactly what happened last night especially when it comes to DACA and the border wall. We will get into it. Plus, pushing ahead on tax reform. Republicans are moving forward to roll out their plan in the coming weeks as the president brings in Democrats to try to reach a deal. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin telling Fox News' Bret Baier last night, the year-end timeline is on track.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES TREASURY SECRETARY: We are ready to go and I'm optimistic we got this done this year. This is about creating economic growth. This is about creating a business tax system that's competitive.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: We are taking a closer look at the tax plan just unveiled by Texas Senator Ted Cruz. He will join me straight ahead live, so stay with us for that. Markets meanwhile, a mix this morning. Take a look. Major indices hit all-time highs yesterday, and the sorting was seeing a bit of a pullback. The Dow Industrials are up about four points, fractional move there. But the S&P and the NASDAQ are fractionally lower.In Europe this morning, markets are under selling pressure as well. The Bank of England leaving interest rates unchanged. The FT-100 is down three-quarters of a percent now and the DAX index in Germany down a quarter of a percent. The CAC quarante in Paris is up, the Bank of England said that interest rates could rise in the coming months. It seems like that comment is what unnerved the FT because it's certainly is at the lows of the morning here.In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly lower, concerns about China's economy weighed on markets. Disappointing readings there on industrial activity among others. And then there's Equifax, playing the blame game now. The company says the server vulnerability led to the massive data breach which affected possibly have of the entire country. The stock is trading down again this morning after a massive selloff on that.Martin Shkreli wakes up behind bars. His bail was revoked after he offered money on Facebook for a piece of Hillary Clinton's hair. The judge was not amused. Strikeout for Denny's, the company's new mascot going viral for all the wrong reasons. What do you think that could be?All of those stories coming up this morning and joining me to talk all about it. Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, PwC Partner Mitch Roschelle, and former Republican presidential candidate, former Hewlett- Packard CEO, Carly Fiorina. We are happy you are here this morning.CARLY FIORINA, FORMER CEO, HEWLETT-PACKARD: It's great to be with you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us.FIORINA: Sorry I had to end on that last one.(CROSSTALK)DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR: I'm self --(CROSSTALK)FIORINA: I wonder who came up with that, a guy with a problem maybe. Who approved it? A bigger question.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, I wasn't expecting, when I saw it I was like, whoa. OK.MITCH ROSCHELLE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I am rarely speechless. And I am speechless.BARTIROMO: Yes. But we have a lot to talk about on tax reform, on the legislative calendar, and other things too. Are you going to crack up or - -MCDOWELL: No, no, no. I can't wait for your interview with Ted Cruz.BARTIROMO: All right. We got a big hour ahead. Do stay with us because Texas Senator Ted Cruz is here, is joining me coming up. He'll join the conversation just a few minutes. You don't want to miss that. We want to hear from Carly Fiorina as well. So we have a big hour ahead, stay right there. Let's kick it off right now because President Trump is moments away heading to Florida. This comes as he says no deal has been made on DACA following a dinner meeting at the White House with top Democratic lawmakers last night. Blake Burman is covering the story, he's at the White House right now with the very latest. Blake, good morning.BLAKE BURMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you as well. President Trump set to leave the White House here quite literally at any moment now. Let's see, we'll head down to the Naples and Fort Myers area in Florida later today to meet with first responders and those devastated by Hurricane Irma. Ahead of his trip this morning, the president is trying to clarify what may or may not have occurred last night here at the White House during his dinner with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.After the dinner last night, the Democratic leaders put out a joint statement saying that they and the president agreed to, and I quote here, "Ensuring the protection of DACA into law quickly." However, in a lengthy series of tweets earlier this morning, the president said, no deal was struck but he did go on to defend those who were commonly referred to as dreamers. The president said, and I quote here, "Does anybody really want to throw out good, educated and accomplished young people who have job, some serving in the military? Really? They've been in our country for many years through no fault of their own, brought in by parents at a young age, plus big border security." The last part there, Maria, potentially the president outlining a potential DACA and border security deal at some down the line. The president also, Maria, went on to say that he does want to see this wall built on the southern border.BARTIROMO: All right. Well, we'll that because this is a real discrepancy between both sides because of what went on, Blake, thank you. Joining me now from Washington, Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. And Senator, it's wonderful to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.SEN. TED CRUZ (D), TEXAS: Good morning. It's always good to be with you.BARTIROMO: Yes. I want to -- I have your tax principles in front of me, the tax plan that you have been working so hard on. I'm going to get to that in a moment. But what's your reaction to the president's bipartisan outreach? We know they -- he had dinner again last night with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and came up with a new agreement.CRUZ: Well, look, I think it's fine that he's talking to Democrats, that he's talking to whoever he wants. I talked to Democrats all the time. What matters is what comes out of it. We're hearing differing accounts from Schumer and Pelosi on the one hand and the president and the other. You know, what I think people really care about is substance. And if we have Democrats who are willing to help us on tax reform, on regulatory reform, on economic growth and unleashing jobs, fantastic.That's a great outcome. You know, I have to admit I'm a little skeptical. I'm working with the Senate Democrats every day, I have not seen much interest in jobs or economic growth or tax reform or tax reform or regulatory reform. But, you know, there is no harm in asking, but I wouldn't hold your breath waiting for any real progress from the Senate Dems.BARTIROMO: Well, this is why this is so important. I mean, does he not recognize that this is the same group that truly wants him impeached?CRUZ: You know, that's hard to dispute. I mean, listen, the Senate Democrats right now, they are captive of their far left base and their far left base is filled with rage and fury. The lessen the Senate Democrats took from the 2016 election was that Hillary Clinton in their view was too moderate and they need more Bernie Sanders, more Elizabeth Warren. That's today's Senate Democrats and so, it's hard to see a lot of common ground for the Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren of the Senate to want to do anything on tax reform other than jack up taxes even more and kill even more jobs. That's obviously not -- there is no middle ground there unless they make a fairly dramatic move.BARTIROMO: Yes. Let me ask you about tax reform. You laid this out very clearly, you have three objectives for tax reform, that's growth, simplicity, and fairness. I'm going to get into all of those but I have to start with tax cuts across the board which we have been hearing about, Senator, that the president wants to cut taxes on everyone. I'm looking at a report from the latest federal income tax data from the tax foundation and it says that the top one percent paid a greater share of individual income taxes than the bottom 90 percent combined.In fact, 50 -- the top earners pay more than 70 percent of all of the taxes. And yet, we're hearing from the Democrats, they don't want to cut taxes by a penny on the highest earners.CRUZ: Yes. Look, the Democrats or the tax-and-spend and borough party. They support more taxes, and then more taxes, then more taxes. Some of them long for the days of a 90 percent top marginal rate. My view is that jobs are number one. My top priority is jobs because that's the top priority of the Texans I represent and the best lever for job growth, for more jobs and higher wages is cutting taxes and simplifying taxes. I think every American, you ought to be able to fill out your taxes on a postcard.The nine billion hours a year we spent in tax compliance, that's wasted. And let me make a very important point that I tried to make yesterday as well. It is important, I believe, that Congress pass a tax cut. Not just tax reform. There are some Congressional Republicans who want this to be what's called revenue neutral. Revenue neutral means if you cut taxes here, you jack them up over here so that the net is zero. I think that's - -BARTIROMO: Right. Which is why they initially wanted border adjustment tax to get --(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Exactly.BARTIROMO: Yes.BARTIROMO: I think that's a mistake. The case that I'm making to the president, the president said yesterday he wanted a big beautiful tax cut, the biggest tax cut ever. I think that's exactly right. We need to cut taxes on individuals, on families, on small businesses, that's how we're going to create jobs and the only way to do that is to say this is not going to be revenue neutral, this is a tax cut because our priority is jobs.BARTIROMO: And you say, you know, scoring and looking over what this looks like of a 10-year period, I mean, not necessarily be appropriate, right? You say, why do we have to be married to not impacting the deficit over 10 years?CRUZ: And the reason for this, this deals with really a procedural rule in the senate. We're facing Democratic filibusters on just about everything. And so, we're trying to figure out, all right, how do we accomplish our promises to the voters even with the Democrats filibustering virtually every piece of legislation. The one exception to the filibuster is what's called budget reconciliation. And budget reconciliation is what we're using for tax reform. It says that it has to be budget neutral. It can affect the deficit outside of the budget window, so you remember the Bush tax cuts that they expired in 10 years?BARTIROMO: Right.CRUZ: The reason for that is that Bush use budget reconciliation to pass them so they had to expire the last year of the budget window. And so, if it's budget neutral, the tax cut can be permanent. If not, they have to expire at the end of the budget window. Well, what I'm arguing for is OK, that's fine, but there's nothing in the budget act that says the budget window has to be 10 years.BARTIROMO: Yes.CRUZ: That's not there. We should have a budget window of 20 years or 30 years, and if we had tax cut that expires 30 years from now, that's close enough to permanent. We can just be honest we're cutting taxes because we want jobs and economic growth because that's the only way to pay down our debt to get our economy turned around to get people working and have them expire 30 years from now and the Congress three decades from now can deal with it at that point.BARTIROMO: Well, you make a really good point because if your priority is growth and jobs, economic growth and jobs, you do want to be married to a- 10 year deal. You need to make sure you're looking at longer-term than that so that business can actually say, OK, I'm going to make this investment plan and I'm not going to worry about that it's going to change in 10 years. You're calling for a single flat tax. I'm reading through your ideas here, I know you want to simplify in terms of three brackets versus seven but you're talking about a single flat tax. What would that be?CRUZ: Look, that would be my preference, it's just a single flat tax that's fair in uniform for everyone. It's a big standard deduction and then everyone pays the same simple rate because I think there's power in bold simplicity. I think going to the postcard has power just because it has -- it's small. It means you have a lot more time in your life, a lot more money in your life to take care of your needs. And let me mention one of the most important ideas, Maria, that I talked about yesterday.Full expensing, when business invests in plant and equipment and new buildings, right now they depreciate those over a number of years. One of the most pro-growth tax reforms you can do is immediate expensing. What that means is that makes it much easier for a farmer to buy a tractor. If you're a steelworker, it makes it much easier for the company you work for to build a new steel factory. If you're a truck driver, it's much easier to buy a new truck or a taxi or Uber driver, much easier to buy a new taxi or Uber. If you want jobs here at home and not just jobs here at home but manufacturing jobs, blue-collar jobs, the kind of jobs, you got calluses in your hands.BARTIROMO: Right.CRUZ: Immediate expensing is powerful. Now, I will note in this debate in Washington, much of the debate is influenced by the financial services sector and they're important sector in our economy. Expensing is not that big of a deal in financial services.BARTIROMO: Certainly not for large companies, right? A smaller company is going to get impacted much more. We're talking to Jeff Brewer about this earlier and he totally agrees with you, he basically said, if I could expense right -- money goes out the door because I did all of these acquisitions of, you know, trucks or whatever you just said as a farmer. If I expense this over several years and have depreciation, if I do expensing instead of that, that's going to allow me to hire more people and invest more.But Senator, I want to know if you are actually on the same page with your colleagues because there seems to be a White House plan, I mean, Kevin Brady, House Ways and Means Chairman said he's going to come out with his new principles on the week of the 25th. But the deduction is sort of cloudy. What deduction stay, what goes? And I was just talking with the Democratic Congressman and Republican Congressman in the last hour and it was incredible to me, Senator, the conversation illuminated why this is such an incredibly tough subject. Listen to this. Got to get your reaction.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I will not support elimination of the state and local income tax reduction. You know, we've got the highest local property taxes in America in New York State, and we cannot afford to get rid of that deduction. Right now, New York State is a huge donor to the Federal government and this is one of the few things that protects our people in New York State is state and local income tax deduction.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: So there you go. I'm pushing them on, would you -- would you agree to this, would you agree to that? He would not agree to eliminating those deductions and he would not agree to a 15 percent corporate tax rate. So where are we on this sense, Senator?CRUZ: Listen, there's a lot of disagreement right now. There's not consensus within the House, there's not consensus within the Senate and the administration has a yet a third view. We're going to have to sit down and come together. That's what it's going to take in the Senate. We got to get to 50 votes, we have 52 Republicans, we need to find a plan that can bring together 50. That's going to take discussions; that's going to take some give-and-take.And the only way to do it is to have the players all sitting at the table to have conservatives, to have moderates, leadership. The administration says, all right, what's the heart of what you want? Let me give you one more example that I think will help bring people to consensus. We ought to repeal Dodd-Frank as part of tax reform, we have a big impact on the economy.BARTIROMO: Well, it's your party, though. I mean, some of these guys that you work with, I don't think they want the president to succeed or they don't care if he succeeds or not.CRUZ: Well, we've got to deliver our promises. That's what I'm working night and day on.BARTIROMO: Ted Cruz, thank you. We'll be right back.CRUZ: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Equifax blaming an unknown third party for the recent problems, that data breach which may have affected half of the country. Cheryl Casone with the details. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR: Yes. Half of Americans, Maria. Exactly. Equifax says that criminals exploited software on the web server to carry out the data breach that affected about 143 million Americans. Meanwhile, they are pointing the finger. The Equifax company not saying who may have been behind that attack. The CEO expected to testify over (INAUDIBLE) in front of the House panel about that breach. The stock is falling more than 30 percent since that breach was revealed. Shares also down in the premarket almost one percent.Well, President Trump blocking a Chinese government-backed private equity firm from buying U.S. chipmaker Lattice Semiconductor. The president saying the $1.3 billion-deal could risk national security. Experts say it's a clear signal to Beijing that Washington will oppose takeover deals that involve technology that could jeopardize the nation's security, especially when it comes to the military. Shares of Lattice Semiconductor down about 24 percent so far this year.And then finally, Maria, Denny's is standing by its new sausage mascot. The chain recently introduced the sausage length as the face of its grand slam breakfasts. Social media though pounced on it saying it looks like something else. And I can't show you any of the tweets because they're not just appropriate at 8:00 in the morning. Now, despite all of this, Denny's says they're going to keep it this way, they say, this is exactly how a sausage looks. I'll send it back to you with that.BARTIROMO: Thank you.CASONE: Yes.BARTIROMO: Thank you for that. Have fun. I don't know what to say.MCDOWELL: Denny's tweeted, I think it was yesterday, I'm just a sausage, I can't help the way I look.ROSCHELLE: Maybe it's intentional. Looks like a South Park character.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: I can't help it. Oh, that is funny.MCDOWELL: It looks exactly like a particular character from South Park.BARTIROMO: Yes. It's pretty incredible.ROSCHELLE: Dagen and I talked about that off-mic.BARTIROMO: So it's a story now. We don't know where to go with this, by the way. But we will say this. It's a big week and next week, the week of the 25th is when Dagen you say, Kevin Brady said that he's going to come out with his plan in terms of tax reform. You heard my interview with Ted Cruz who said he's working night and day on this.MCDOWELL: He absolutely is. I think one of the interesting ideas The Wall Street Journal has had editorials about it that he talked about it is like extending the budget window to 30 years.BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: In terms of dealing with this. But they still got to get a big budget done first before they can move on tax reform. And Betsy McCaughey was talking about making them retroactive. Let's just worry about getting it done this year.BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE) 18 at this point.MCDOWELL: Yes. Exactly.BARTIROMO: Carly, you've worked a lot on tax reforms and you do believe that reform and lower taxes would move the needle on economic growth.FIORINA: There's no question. And I agree completely with Senator Cruz and others who say that lowering rates is important but it's not enough. We also have to simplify the tax code dramatically because its complexity harms growth and competitiveness and the rates harm competitiveness and growth. So we need to do both.BARTIROMO: What I want to know is what these most recent bipartisan meetings mean about all of this. So we're going to take a break and talk about that when we come right back. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Tragedy at California Military Base, 15 marines at Camp Pendleton were seriously injured in a training exercise yesterday after their vehicle caught fire. Six were in critical condition this morning, another six are listed under serious condition. The marine corps say that the cause of the accident is now under investigation. Joining us now, Fox News Correspondent, former Navy Fighter Pilot, Lea Gabrielle. Lea, good morning.LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Good morning, Maria. You know, this is basically an Amphibious Assault Vehicle that was being used in a train -- training exercise. When you think of our military, one of the reasons that we are the strongest military in the world is because we can keep our enemies off our shores and we can take the enemy, we can take the punch to the enemy on their shores. And one of the ways that we do this is by using Amphibious Assault Vehicles that transport troops from the ship to the shore.Now, in this situation, you know, what we're seeing is an increase in these training incidences where people are big getting killed, where people are getting badly injured. And if you listen to what our military leaders are saying, if you listen to their testimony on Capitol Hill, they have been talking about since sequestration, first one into effect in 2013 because the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the problems that is created with military funding, the military is not getting the money it needs, it's not getting the modernization it needs, people are not getting the training that they need to train effectively and it needs to be fixed. And we've talked about that a number of times in our show, so I'm so glad that you bring your attention to this.BARTIROMO: We really have. And General Jack Keane joined us months ago and said that the majority of planes right now in the navy are not to be used. They cannot actually be used. I mean, Carly, you've talked about this throughout the campaign.FIORINA: Absolutely. Readiness takes money to have the finest fighting force in the world takes money. And so, it's one of the reasons I think people are so frustrated with politics. Politicians play politics with our military which is what has been going on for a long time now and then decry the loss of live. They need to look in the mirror. And this is why Senator McCain consistently yet again said, we need to quit playing politics with this issue and fund the military.(CROSSTALK)GABRIELLE: -- in the past three years, four times as many service members have died from training accident than from combat. Now, this is not something that public -- that there's a lot of public attention on and it's important for the public to be aware of this because when you look at our military, we have had all volunteer force since the 70s. We have been in the longest war our nation's history and yet our brave men and women are signing up to serve and to protect us and they're not getting what they need. Congress needs to fix this, people need to be aware of it because it all comes down to planning, being able to give them the training that they need.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm. But where does the money come from?GABRIELLE: Well, the money has got a come from Congress and they've got to stop using -- they've got to stop using continuing resolutions which basically makes the military rely on the last year's amount and they can't plan for the future, puts them in this big stop. I've had senior military leaders pull me aside and want to have off-the-record conversations because this is something that they don't want to project to the enemy that we're having these issues but look, it's clear when you look at people dying in training the way they are right now, dying in noncombat related incidents, it's clearly a problem and we've got to fix it.BARTIROMO: Maybe will change with Mattis, McMaster and John Kelly as chief of staff in the White House.GABRIELLE: I certainly hope so.BARTIROMO: You would think.GABRIELLE: If that goes back to Congress, they control the purse, they need to stop doing these continuing resolutions.BARTIROMO: Yes. Lea, thank you. Lea Gabrielle there. We'll take a break. When we come back, the timeline for tax reform. President Trump reaching across the aisle to bring Democrats onto the plan. Take a closer look at that. And then Boeing streamliner production is taking off. How investors are reacting to the big boost to the output, stock is up this morning once again. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it Is Thursday, September 14th. Your top stories right now, 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast. Surveying the damage, President Trump arriving at Joint Base Andrews, he is headed to Florida to see the destruction left from Hurricane Irma. He left the White House as he did, he commented on immigration saying that any deal on DACA will need to include border security. Plus, pushing ahead on tax reform, Republicans are moving ahead to roll out their plan in the coming weeks as the President brings in Democrats to try to reach a deal. Senator Ted Cruz waited on his plan earlier this hour with me.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ (R), TEXAS: A single flat tax that's fair and uniform for everyone is a big standard deduction and then everyone pays the same simple rate because I think there's power in bold simplicity. I think going to the postcard has power just because it has -- it's small, it means Congress can't go and stick a whole bunch of extra garbage on it. It means you have a lot more time in your life, a lot more money in your life to take care of your needs.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Markets are edging lower this morning, with this one, take a look. Dow Industrials down about 27.2. NASDAQ down a third of a percent, 20 points lower. The major indices yesterday closed at another record high but futures indicated a bit a pullback at the open. In Europe, markets are under pressure as well, the Bank of England left interest rates unchanged, but also warned rates could rise in the coming months.That took the FT-100 down, it's down about one percent right now. And the DAX Index in Germany is down a quarter of a percent. The CAC Quarante in Paris is up. In Asia overnight, markets mostly lower concerns about China's economy weighed on markets there after disappointing readings on industrial activity among other economic reports. Martin Shkreli waking up behind bars, his bail revoked after offering money for a piece of Hillary Clinton's hair. A little bit bizarre. The judge was not amused and he put him in jail.AT&T already launching a battle over the new iPhone. It unveiled a buy one get one free deal, but there is a catch and we've got it for you. Plus, breaking from star Selena Gomez, she revealed she had a kidney transplant and we will tell you who her donor was. First though, the GOP's big push on tax reform. Republicans are set to roll out their plan in the coming weeks as the President reaches out to Democrats to help seal the deal. Just moments ago, Texas Senator Ted Cruz told me his thoughts on the President's coalition building on tax reform.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CRUZ: What I think people really care about is substance. And if we had Democrats who are willing to help us on tax reform, on regulatory reform, on economic growth, and unleashing jobs. Fantastic. That'd be great outcome. You know, I have to admit I'm a little skeptical, I'm working with the Senate Democrats every day. I have not seen much interest in jobs or economic growth or tax reform or regulatory reform. But, you know, there's no harm in asking, but I wouldn't hold your breath.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And there you go. Carly Fiorina is with us this morning. Your thoughts on these meetings, Carly, with the Democrats?FIORINA: Well, first let me say, Ted Cruz has been saying exactly the same things about tax reform for almost five years now. He's been talking about the pat -- postcards, radical simplicity, and I absolutely agree with him that both are reduction in rates in simplicity are key. I think the issue with President Trump talking to Democrats, we all applauded by partisanship, but I think the issue is what does President Trump actually believe?What does he actually want in terms of tax reform? Will he do any deal or are there principles and a framework for the deal? And I think that's the question now being asked about the conversations about immigration. What is the deal he's willing to do? Now, in fairness for President Trump, he's been very clear what the American people. I'm a deal maker and I'm willing to be flexible, that was his word in my principles and unpredictable in my approach in order to get the deal.I happen to think that certain principles matter, that simplicity matters, that the tax cut matters. And I'm suspicious as is Ted Cruz that Democrats are going to play with those principles because, honestly, what they want is more government and they continue to lean to the left and more government always costs more money.BARTIROMO: And they keep saying that they don't want to cut taxes by one penny for the highest earners, I've said it multiple times this morning that the highest earners pay all of the taxes. So if you're not going to cut taxes on the highest earners, are you really cutting taxes??FIORINA: Well, and what's a high earner? You know, if you have --BARTIROMO: Yes, that's good question.FIORINA: You know, if you're a couple in Manhattan with a couple kids and you make $250,000.ROSCHELLE: Oh, you're a high earner.FIORINA: You're a high earner, but maybe you don't feel like you're a high earner.BARTIROMO: Exactly. Well, wait. Mitch, you have the numbers here in terms of what that top -- that top rate would be considered rich.ROSCHELLE: Right. And so the top 10 percent of tax payers, the last dollar of income is a $133,000, so --BARTIROMO: There you go.MCDOWELL: That's a school teacher.ROSCHELLE: So the poorest in the top, right.FIORINA: Yes.ROSCHELLE: That's union workers, that's, you know, that's middle America, you know, in many cases, right?(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: So you're not cutting tax?MCDOWELL: Remember that when he did it -- President Trump did an interview with the Wall Street Journal and he made that, that throwaway comment about, you know, my rich friends tell me that they'd be happy to pay more than -- more in taxes. But when you're talking about your rich friends, you're not talking about people who are -- no offense to the President, who are earning less than a $134,000 a year. This is critically important, but he keep saying this over and over, and over again.And I don't -- and the way my brain works is if you cut these low rates because we have a progressive tax system, you cut all the lower rate, he's talking about the rich paying the same if not more. Well, they get a tax break by all of those lower rates dropping because the first, you know, the first dollars they earned or tax in those low rate. So what are you saying? If you're going to make sure that the rich -- the wealthy continue to pay the same that they've been paying, then you're going to have to really rate -- raise the top rate in order to offset the cuts that you have in the lower brackets. Do you see what I'm saying?(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Especially, if you eliminate these deductions.ROSCHELLE: Right.MCDOWELL: Yes.FIORINA: I think there are three key principles, and I actually think the principles matter. Number one, the complexity is killing us. The complexity makes economic growth harder. And the complexity itself in the tax code favors Donald Trump's very rich friends. Complexity always favors big companies over little companies, rich people over not so rich people, why? Because big companies and rich people can hire accountants and lawyers to get through the 76,000 pages, so simplicity is key.BARTIROMO: Absolutely.ROSCHELLE: Right.FIORINA: Second, our tax rates are uncompetitive, they're uncompetitive on businesses, the middle class in particular needs more money in their own pocket, we don't need to be giving the Federal government more money, so we have to cut rates, we have to have simplicity, and we have to have fairness. Those principles actually matter. And I think the promise in bipartisan talks is maybe there is something in that package that everybody can agree on. The peril in these bipartisan talks is without a firm grasps with the principles that you have to have in order to agree to a deal. Any deal is OK. And in this case, I don't think any deal is OK.BARTIROMO: No. And so, what do you think he is doing? I mean, does he not know that this is group that he had dinner with last night that wants him impeached?FIORINA: Well, you would hope he would remember that, and on the other hand, all --BARTIROMO: They called his cabinet a swamp cabinet, I remember Chuck Schumer was all over the swamp cabinet, they first got elected.FIORINA: Yes -- no. In fairness, I think Donald Trump and Chuck Schumer have hurled insults at each other for months and months, and months. And maybe they're used to that and so now they're kind of saying, yes, yes, yes, we're just kidding, let's now sit down and do a deal and maybe that'll work. Maybe the only way to get a deal done in Washington now is to throw your principles out the window and say, let's just get down and dirty and see what we can get done. But I think it's why people are nervous about the outline, the foundation, the principles of this deal and tax reform is the single most important thing we can get done to get this economy really going.BARTIROMO: So is it -- is this then giving a message to the GOP? You know, you couldn't do -- you couldn't cross the finish line on health care, you couldn't cross the finish line in all of the stuff that I've -- well, I've pushed for, I'm going to the Democrats.FIORINA: And there's nothing with that signal. People expect results, One of the reasons, one of the principal reasons Donald Trump got elected is because people said, I'm sick of politics, I'm sick of politicians.(CROSSTALK)FIORINA: I want someone who can produce results, but they expect results.MCDOWELL: They expect certain results though, because he threw, you know, again, the Democrat solution to fixing Obamacare will be a much bigger step towards single-payer, you know, Medicare for all, more and more Democrats signing on that now.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: Or his -- or his supporters, Trump supporters going to back that because again, the Democrats really want the rich to pay more in taxes beyond what they already pay. Is he going to get on board with that? Because he's supporters are turning against him, particularly when it comes to immigration.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, let's talk about this because we've got breaking news right now, the President is speaking out, he spoke out as he left the White House moments ago on immigration. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well we're working on a plan, subject to getting massive border control. We're working on a plan for DACA. People want to see that happen, you have 800,000 young people brought here, no fault of their own, so we're working on a plan. We'll see how it works out, but we're going to get massive border security as part of that.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Congressional Democratic Leader Senator Chuck Schumer and Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi issued a new statement reiterating that no final deal was reached last night. But she said, we agree that the President would support and shrinking DACA protections into law and encourage the House and Senate to act. What remains to be negotiated are the details of border security. This just broke right now, so she just put out that tweet right now.Walking back their initial tweet that said, we have a deal the President and it doesn't include the border wall. Right there, they just exposed themselves that they came out of the White House meeting last night and they lied and they put out a tweet that said we did a deal with the President, he didn't include the border wall, they have to walk it back.FIORINA: I'm shocked. I'm shocked. The Democrats are dealing this way with the President. Of course, they did, hey, no one should be surprised by this. And it's also true that I think now people are wondering, OK, what kind of deal is he going to do on immigration? I didn't hear him talking about a wall. I happen to think, you know, you and I have had this conversation. I think massive border security doesn't necessarily include a 3000-mile wall.But that's not what he said and that's not what his supporters think they heard from him in the result he promised to deliver to them. And so, I'm not at all surprised but the Democrats are trying to use this moment to their maximum advantage. And President Trump as a deal maker should understand that as he walks into more and more deals with the Democrats, do not give them more leverage than they already have. They have massive leverage on DACA because it is an emotional issue that tugs at people's heartstrings and they will use that leverage to the maximum extent. Because Pelosi and Schumer are also pretty good dealmakers.BARTIROMO: Well, I seem to remember the crocodile tears a couple years -- a couple of months ago from Chuck Schumer. Remember that one? When this whole idea of deportation came up, it's crocodile tears.MCDOWELL: President Trump is tweeting support for the Dreamers this morning.BARTIROMO: Right, he is.MCDOWELL: And we've gone over those tweets as to -- tweets several times in and Coulter retweeting Donald Trump with the statement, at this point, who doesn't want Trump impeached? So, again, she has been a strong supporter of his, and not right now she is not.FIORINA: Right, yes.BARTIROMO: He's impacting his base with all of this. Because people are wondering what this means for the economic agenda that people believe he could actually move the needle on jobs.MCDOWELL: Yes.FIORINA: And could move the needle on immigration. And by the way -- look, you and I had this conversation the last I was with you.MCDOWELL: Yes.FIORINA: Ideas are great, it was talking about solar power for the wall.MCDOWELL: That's right.FIORINA: And I said ideas are great, results are better. So, now, people are waiting to see the result. What is the deal? What are the results?(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Where is the bill? Where is this bill? Since we have the principle, since April, and we know what they are trying to achieve. Where is the bill?FIORINA: Yes.MCDOWELL: It's something -- it's nothing better than something if that something comes from basically breaking bread with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, I'll raise that issue.ROSCHELLE: We'll see.MCDOWELL: Because again, with Obama -- fixing Obamacare with targeting the tax code, because if you work with those Democrats, you're going to wind up with a tax code that is much more progressive than it was already is.FIORINA: That's right. We know who Pelosi and Schumer are, let's just be clear. They have been clear about their principles.BARTIROMO: Yes, they have.ROSCHELLE: Right.FIORINA: Very clear and very consistent. And they're not changing to do a deal.BARTIROMO: All right. Coming up, President Trump reaches across the aisle to Democrats again, meeting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Stuart Varney has a thing or two to say about that. We are witnessing history, he says, he'll weigh in. And then breaking news, Selena Gomez reveals she underwent a kidney transplant due to lupus. The heartwarming story of her donor, coming up next. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. AT&T gearing up for the launch of the new iPhone. Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, looking at AT&T and other stocks -- Nic.NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. So now, the iPhone has been launched, everybody is waiting to get theirs, whether you want the 8, 8 Plus, or the X. Well, all the carriers are now coming out with their deals. The last round, they really actually got killed on too many deals. Jeffrey is saying that the latest round of deals are more rational. But AT&T has fired the first bullet here. The iPhone price war has begun, buy one, get one free, but there is a catch. You have to also subscribe to their Direct T.V. satellite service.And take a look at how Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile, and AT&T are all doing this morning. Some of the deals include T-Mobile 300 bucks, they will give you; Verizon 300 bucks as well, but you have to sign up for the unlimited plan; AT&T, I just told you about that, they're also offering an iPad along with that; and Sprint is giving you half off of the lease with a trade in of a 7. So, if you want to trade in, you probably can reel and deal and get some sort of deal here on this.Now, let's take a look at Boeing, Dow component, Boeing. Big news on Boeing today. The Department of Defense now and the Pentagon saying that they have a $600-million contract. There it is, Air Force One. They are going to design and work on two 747-8 aircrafts that will be used as the next Air Force One, as well as boosting the monthly output to 14 from 12 of the Dreamliner. And Maria, when I looked up the Air Force One now, 4,000 square feet offices, a conference room, a dining room, a private quarters for the President, and a medical operating room as well and a doctor on board. Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Nic. Nicole Petallides on the Wall Street. Let's turn to the White House, in a show of bipartisanship, President Trump continues to negotiate with Democrats. Last night, the Commander-in-Chief hosted a dinner with Senate and House Minority Leaders, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. They discussed DACA and border security. Joining us now to weigh in, the host of "VARNEY & COMPANY," Stuart Varney. Good morning, Stu.STUART VARNEY, FBN ANCHOR: Well, Maria, I think we're seeing the beginnings of something that could be or could have historic implications for our politics. I think this actually started back on September the 6th. The meeting right there in the White House, that's on the screen right now, September the 6th. The President is listening to the leaders of the Republican Party and the Democrat Party, and they're arguing for about 45 minutes about the debt ceiling. Along comes the President says, enough already. Let's make it three months. Deal done. Democrats win, Republicans lose. That was the start of the realignment of politics, where the President shifted to where he could get the votes to get something done.The implications of this are -- well, not exactly profound, but they're important. Look at the tax deal. We heard yesterday that the President might actually end up having richer people pay even more than they pay now. That is a revolution. That's completely opposite from the promises made during the election campaign. Why is he doing this? Because he has to get something done and the Republicans do not have the votes to get done what they want to get done. Result, a realignment of politics where we will see some real action. I think this is extremely important.BARTIROMO: To me, it looks like the Republicans are the losers in all of this.VARNEY: Yes, definitely.BARTIROMO: Yes.VARNEY: Definitely. They're not the governing party that they were supposed to be they're completely divided, and their division has opened the door to the Democrats. They've ruined the whole idea of Obamacare reform and now, I think they're in the process of just dropping the ball on tax reform as well. They -- I'm -- to say that they're a disgrace is far too strong, but you know where I'm coming from.BARTIROMO: Yes, I really do, Stuart. We'll see you in about 10 minutes. I know you have more on that. "VARNEY & COMPANY" begins top of the hour, right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Join Stuart at 9:00.Coming up, pop star Selena Gomez revealing that she underwent a kidney transplant due to lupus. The touching story of her donor and final thoughts from this all-star panel, back in a moment.BARTIROMO: And now this breaking news, Selena Gomez has undergone a kidney transplant. Cheryl Casone with the details -- Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR: Yes. So, Maria, Selena Gomez just confirming on Instagram that she had the procedure done over the summer. And get this, her best friend, television actress Francia Raisa was the donor. The Instagram post includes a picture of Gomez and Raisa holding hands while lying side-by-side in their hospital beds. The surgery was necessary because of Gomez's struggle with lupus.Well, Martin Shkreli is in jail this morning after a judge ruled that he violated his bail on a securities fraud conviction. The judge revoked former (INAUDIBLE) bail after Shkreli offered a $5000 reward on Facebook to anyone that could bring him a strand of Hillary Clinton's hair. Shkreli's attorney argued that the offer was at beast political satyr, maybe strange humor, but the government claims that the former drug company CEO is a danger to the public. Shkreli, we should say is due back in court for sentencing in that securities fraud case in January.And then, finally this, Maria, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer making his first television appearance since resigning from the Trump administration. He was on "Jimmy Kimmel Live" and he took several shots at the press.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEAN SPICER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: They need to understand that when they cross a line -- when a member of the press corps crosses the line, that they have a responsibility to help hold that in, and I've never seen a group of individuals who protect themselves like the press corps does, especially the White House Press Corps. They always have an excuse for why that story -- you know, we were going to correct it and we checked with the sources and now -- and it's never -- there's never an admission of guilt. Once in a while, you see a little correction that says, you know, we aired in -- you know, putting the period here or there.But I do believe that the healthier press corps that we have, the better democracy that we have. The press corps wants to attack Republicans, attack conservatives, undermine our attempt to have a constructive dialogue. And I think it's a two-way street. So, if we don't want to lump every journalist into the same thing, then don't lump every Republican or every conservative into the same box.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: All right. Well, there were some funny moments but that was the most really intriguing part of the interview.BARTIROMO: For sure. Yes, he got right to it. Thank you so much, Cheryl. And Carly Fiorina is with us today. Your reaction to all of that.FIORINA: Well, it's very hard to argue with what Sean Spicer just said. It's very hard to argue, and I think sometimes what journalists fail to acknowledge is the obvious. They're not just reporting the story, they're shaping the story. I think it's also true that they fail to acknowledge it while they get all high and mighty about independent journalism. It's a business, the media is a business. And a business requires revenue, and advertisers, and eyeballs, and guess what drives those things, controversy, conflict, you know, sensational headlines. And so, I think it would just help if sometimes people in the media would acknowledge, look, we're a business and we're under pressure, too.BARTIROMO: Yes. But it's not just the media on this front.FIORINA: But it's not just -- no.BARTIROMO: I mean, let's face it. Come on, you've got the Republicans talking about all of this stuff, health care, tax, they can't get anything done. You've got Democrats, you know, fighting over taxes. I mean, it's more than the media.FIORINA: Oh, of course. Look, the reason all of us are tired of politics and politicians is because nothing gets done. And what, I think, we're finding out again and again and I said this on the campaign trail --BARTIROMO: My thanks to Carly Fiorina and Mitch Roschelle. Great show! Dagen, I will see you tomorrow. That'll do it for us. "VARNEY & COMPANY" up next. Stuart, take it away.Load-Date: September 14, 2017End of Document

Tim Cook needs to take responsibility for Apple's battery scandal (AAPL)Business Insider USDecember 30, 2017 Saturday 09:00 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1172 wordsByline: kleswing@businessinsider.com,  (Kif Leswing)Highlight: Making a public apology seems like part of the job responsibility for a CEO. Cook made over $12 million in 2017.BodyAP• Apple made a rare public apology after the recent revelation that the company slowed down older iPhones through a software update.• Many Apple customers believe the slowdown is a violation of their trust. Apple says it is because of how older batteries work. • The apology is unsigned. It would mean a lot more to Apple customers if it came from CEO Tim Cook or another top Apple executive.  Apple is embroiled in one of its most dire scandals in years, as the company was forced to admit that its software updates slow down old iPhones, confirming a long-held theory by iPhone users.According to Apple, its software updates can make apps slow to launch, slow down the smoothness of scrolling through an feed, and take other performance hits.Apple made a rare public apology on its website on Thursday about the issue, saying the reason for the software slowdown was to protect phones with older batteries, which can suddenly shut down.The public apology is technically detailed, relatively candid, and comes with a year-long discount for replacement iPhone batteries.But one thing it's missing is a signature: The apology comes "from Apple," and it's not signed by of its high-paid executives, like Apple CEO Tim Cook.An apology like this one, which acknowledges a breach of trust with users, needs to come from a person, not a corporate communications department. There needs to be a human name on the apology, because humans behind the decision ultimately decided not to tell customers. To date, no Apple executives have publicly commented on the scandal. Here's one question for them: When Apple's elite "executive team" met to discuss the update that would slow down older iPhones, did anyone bring up the possibility that the move could increase iPhone upgrade rates? Making a public apology seems like part of the job responsibility for a CEO. Cook made over $12 million in 2017, and he flies on private jets furnished by Apple.It seems like attaching his name to an apology is the least he can do for Apple users who now feel betrayed.Not the first time AppleCook has signed letters on Apple's website before, so it wouldn't be unprecedented. In February 2016, he posted "A Message to Our Customers" on Apple's website. It's signed "Tim Cook." He felt that Apple users needed to hear from him why the company was resisting an order from the FBI to help it break the encryption on an iPhone used by a terrorist in the San Bernardino attacks. It was a fair use of Apple's megaphone to communicate its position on an issue that directly affects it. On the other hand, most Apple users weren't directly impacted by the San Bernardino case - but there are millions of people with older iPhones now slowing down that may have been tempted to buy a new iPhone instead of replacing its battery, as Apple recommended in its apology earlier this week. When Apple took away Google Maps on the iPhone and replaced it with the inferior Apple Maps for purely business reasons, not user experience reasons, Cook signed that letter apologizing for the fiasco. Although it's not on the Apple website anymore, you can still see the URL: "           letter-from-tim-cook-on-maps."Apple founder and late CEO Steve Jobs was also famous for writing lucid, jargon-free messages to Apple customers, which may have contributed to the closeness many early Apple users felt to the company.Take one of his last letters, "Thoughts on Flash," which is still on Apple's website. Users at the time were upset that iPhones weren't going to run Adobe Flash, which powered many interactive websites at the time.His writing is clear, direct, and honest. He acknowledges there are downsides to his decision, like the fact that iPhone users couldn't play Flash games. But ultimately, Jobs made a case that Flash didn't belong on mobile devices, an argument that's only seemed stronger in retrospect.Compare that to Apple's first statement on the slowdown issue, issued by a spokesperson, which has a lot of weasel words like the phrase "smooth out instantaneous peaks" for what it was really doing - throttling the top speed of older devices. When a millionaire executive takes responsibility for a piece of communications to its customers, you get more honest and direct writing. Instead, Apple's leadership is hiding behind its brand. 'There's been a lot of misunderstanding about this issue'Thomson ReutersAccording to Apple, the reason its newer software updates slow down older iPhones is directly related to battery issues, and any outrage from customers is because they don't understand the issue. "We know that some of you feel Apple has let you down. We apologize," someone at Apple wrote in its apology. "There's been a lot of misunderstanding about this issue, so we would like to clarify and let you know about some changes we're making."According to Apple, the misunderstanding relates to changes Apple made in early 2017 to prevent unexpected device shutdowns. Batteries get worse over time, and after awhile, some older iPhones were randomly shutting down with 30% battery life left. Here's a bit of perspective, though: Apple wouldn't have addressed the shutdown issue if it wasn't from pressure from the Chinese government. In late 2016, a Chinese consumer watchdog called the China Consumers Association started making noise about Apple's random shutdown issue.Eventually, Apple said - again unsigned - that the battery issue only affected a "very small number" of iPhones manufactured between September and October 2015, and offered battery replacements.In fact, when Apple gave additional details about this issue, it was posted            on Apple's Chinese website. But the Chinese consumer watchdog            continued to press the issue, and asked for Apple to replace all faulty batteries. Apple eventually made the software fix that slowed down phones with older batteries in early 2017. It didn't even tell customers that it had made the tweak, again, in an unsigned comment from an Apple spokesperson. Part of the reason why so many Apple customers feel betrayed by the revelations of the past two weeks, even going to far as to start over 15 lawsuits, is that it feels like Apple continues to hide things. Apple's traditional approach to public relations is only making it worse, and has made this entire narrative unclear dating back to 2016. I personally believe Apple's explanation - there are difficult choices that need to be made when batteries get old, and Apple chose one that would optimize for as few shutdowns as possible. I think a lot more Apple customers would buy that explanation, too, if they heard it coming from Tim Cook. NOW WATCH: What those tiny rivets on your jeans are forSee Also:• Here's exactly how your iPhone gets slower when you have an old battery - and how to replace it• Marco Rubio blasts Apple for its 'arrogance' in slowing down iPhones with older batteries• Apple's battery apology could be its most important everSEE ALSO: Apple fixed an annoying iPhone battery bug and didn't tell people for weeksLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

Other market indicators also reached milestones on Thursday. The market has been rallying this year because of a strong global economy, solid corporate profits and, more recently, improved prospects for a tax overhaul that would benefit U.S. companies.___Even with stocks at record highs, experts see 'Santa' jumpNEW YORK (AP) - Stocks are already at record highs as November comes to a close - but there may be room for more gains. Experts think strong investor optimism, economic data, and potential tax cuts could all contribute to a 'Santa Claus rally" in December, typically the strongest month of the year for stocks.___OPEC, allies extend production cut through 2018VIENNA (AP) - The oil ministers from the OPEC cartel and a group of non-OPEC partners have agreed to extend crude output cuts until the end of 2018 to keep supplies tight and bolster prices. The policy already has led to a significant uptick in oil prices over the past year. The 24-nation alliance also gave notice that it stands ready to revisit the move if further price hikes bring U.S. shale operators rushing back into the market. The extension created a rare consensus between Saudi Arabia and Iran.___Google's phones and other gadgets have had a bumpy rideSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Google prides itself on developing simple, intuitive software that seems to know what you want almost before you do. But it's in a very different world when it comes to its own phones and other gadgets. Its new Pixel smartphones, smart speakers and wireless earbuds have all suffered some early problems. Those hiccups served as a high-profile reminder of Google's inexperience in consumer electronics - a field where Apple has a 40-year head start.___GOP tax bill gains support; Senate leaders work on holdoutsWASHINGTON (AP) - Senate Republican leaders are wrangling with the last few GOP holdouts as they push toward passing the first major rewrite of the nation's tax code in more than three decades. It's a package that would impact rich and the poor as well as businesses big and small. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky says he expects a final vote late Thursday or early Friday.___GOP pressing plan to avert government shutdown on Dec. 8WASHINGTON (AP) - House Republican leaders are looking to pass a short-term spending bill to avoid a government shutdown next week and keep the government's doors open through Dec. 22. With the additional time, the GOP hopes talks with Democrats over spending and immigration could produce a longer-term agreement.___GM to launch self-driving vehicles in big US cities in 2019DETROIT (AP) - General Motors Co. expects to carry passengers and deliver goods with self-driving vehicles in big cities sometime in 2019, telling investors it's moving quickly and plans to be ahead of other automakers and tech companies.___US joins trade fight against China at WTOWASHINGTON (AP) - The United States is joining a fight against China at the World Trade Organization in a decision likely to ratchet up tensions between Washington and Beijing. The U.S. is supporting the European Union in a dispute over China's status at the WTO. The United States and EU contend that the Chinese government continues to interfere so heavily in the country's commerce that China remains a "non-market" economy.___Holiday shopping: Desire for deals, but some impulse buyingNEW YORK (AP) - Shoppers so far this holiday season look to be showing a desire for deals but also an inclination for some impulse spending. More than one-third of shoppers surveyed by a retail trade group planned to make all their purchases on sale over the big holiday weekend. But retail expert Marshal Cohen said based on what he and his team saw, "there's no question there was more impulse buying and self-gifting."___American says it has found pilots for most Christmas flightsDALLAS (AP) - American says it now has only a few hundred Christmas-break flights without pilots, but union says the situation appears worse. The pilots' union had said that a scheduling mix-up left 15,000 flights in late December lacking one or both pilots. American plugged the gap with on-call pilots and by paying overtime.___The S&P 500 index climbed 21.51 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,647.58.

Scott Walker's Department of Natural Resources insists that his proposal to streamline environmental permitting for Foxconn wouldn't lessen the state's commitment to uphold all standards for clean water, clean air and hazardous waste.But conservationists note that pollution/article_b4471e0f-538d-5a4e-938e-2972a65d071f.html" target="_blank">shortcomings in Wisconsin's enforcement of pollution laws have accompanied Walker's six-year push to make the DNR friendlier to businesses, and President Donald Trump's Republican administration has launched a broad effort to roll back environmental rules."There is a common thread in the water issues we're dealing with across this state, and it's unaccountable corporate power and the exclusion of concerns of ordinary citizens," said Raj Shukla, executive director of the River Alliance of Wisconsin, referring to loosened limits on groundwater withdrawals and persistent water quality problems."Foxconn has been touted as a boon to Wisconsin and I hope it is, but it's not worth it if it destroys the things so many people in this state find so valuable about living here," Shukla said.Walker has defended the massive tax break and streamlined environmental permitting by saying Foxconn's establishment of LCD television production here with up to 13,000 jobs would transform Wisconsin, and most regulations would remain in force.But Peter Adriaens, a University of Michigan environmental engineer whose research measures the financial risk pollution poses for businesses and investors, said Wisconsin's heavy investment in Foxconn's success could make it tough for the state to crack down."If Foxconn pollutes, are they going to be losing their permits?" Adriaens said. "Probably not, because there are so many jobs at stake and the state needs them to keep operating because of all the incentives that will have been paid out."Foxconn submitted a written environmental pledge on July 31 to a legislative committee considering Walker's proposed incentives package."In our discussions with Governor Walker and his team, we have committed to work closely with the relevant agencies, Wisconsin academic institutions, our own global experts, and others, to ensure that we establish policies and practices that comply fully with all relevant federal, state and local environmental regulations," the company said.Responding last week to concerns about its environmental record, Foxconn said Japan, China and Taiwan - where it manufactures LCD panels currently - have strong environmental regulations it is accustomed to following.But the company said until it selects a site and concludes talks with Wisconsin officials, it can't answer questions about the pollutants it would need to control, how much water it would use, or the expected cost of environment protections here compared to overseas.The incentives package awaiting a vote in the state Senate would exempt the company from a requirement for writing an environmental impact statement and obtaining four state permits designed to protect wetlands and waterways.Walker and the DNR point out that state wastewater, air pollution and hazardous materials regulations remain in place, federal regulations will protect most wetlands, and Foxconn could be held to a higher standard for creating replacement wetlands.The DNR has rehired an experienced agency administrator to oversee environmental permitting, but the department declined to describe any preparations it may be making or its current practices for regulating pollution that typically comes from LCD manufacturing.Such talk would be premature because the company hasn't said which pollutants will be byproducts of the four or more factories it plans on a 1,000-acre campus in southeastern Wisconsin, a DNR spokesman said."We have not yet had any communications regarding the company's manufacturing process, what's involved, what chemicals may be involved or ... waste materials there may be as a result of the company's process," said DNR spokesman Jim Dick.Top DNR officials insist that fines for environmental violations have dwindled because the department works informally with businesses to prevent and correct pollution problems.'Huge amounts' of water, gas, chemicalsA wide variety of pollutants would be expected from the Foxconn factories and an independently operated glass manufacturing plant that would be built next to the LCD facility to supply it with thin 10-foot by 11-foot glass sheets that are impractical to ship, industry experts said.An LCD plant coats the glass sheets with dozens of intricately patterned layers of thin material that conduct electricity.Repeated washing of glass as each layer is applied would require nearly 16 million gallons of water a day, according to an estimate by David Hsieh, a director of analysis and research at IHS Markit, a London-based market research company.An important question for Foxconn will be how to conform to U.S. environmental standards while consuming "huge amounts of water, gas, and chemicals" needed for the operation, which would create LCD panels bigger than any currently being produced, Hsieh wrote in a June blog post."Toxic byproducts from the manufacturing process, if not handled well, can have a catastrophic effect on the environment," Hsieh said. "Asian panel makers have learned much on how to handle waste or recycling in the course of many years of operations, and it will be necessary to replicate and transfer such know-how to the US for any (plants) built here."Because even a speck of dust can interrupt an LCD circuit, the panels are manufactured in sanitized clean rooms. Glass is washed with "ultrapurified water" that is recycled for repeated use, said John West, interim director of the Liquid Crystal Institute at Kent State University.The absence of specifics from Foxconn about its manufacturing process raises concerns the plant might not return as much water to Lake Michigan as it withdraws, said Jodi Habush Sinykin, an attorney and UW-Milwaukee professor of freshwater science who has served on several state commissions on water use.With the Legislature poised to exempt the company from an environmental impact statement, Habush Sinykin said she hopes to recruit independent scientists to provide answers.'How much you are willing to pay'Materials used to fabricate LCD screens are similar to those used by the U.S. semiconductor industry to coat computer chips with electrical circuits, West said.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lists a variety of toxic and hazardous materials associated with semiconductor manufacturing.Pollutants vary depending on the manufacturing process, but they can include cancer-causing heavy metals and organic solvents, and a potent, long-lasting greenhouse gas called perfluorocarbon.Technology - some of it costly - exists for removing contaminants from wastewater and for preventing hazardous dust and mist from endangering workers or escaping from smokestacks."The semiconductor industry has learned how to do it pretty safely," said Andrew Maynard, an Arizona State University physics professor whose work with nanoparticles led to recognition as a leading expert on emerging risks from technology. "But there's no such thing as complete safety."A company like Foxconn may need to build its own advanced system for removing metals from wastewater before it is piped to a municipal sewage plant unlikely to have such expensive equipment, Maynard said."It's often a matter of how much you are willing to pay, and how much you think you can get away with," Maynard said.Environmentalists have expressed concern about reports of air and water pollution, and an explosion in one facility, linked to Foxconn and other LCD panel manufacturers in China.China has well-known pollution problems, and some of them may be related to the practice of provincial governments investing money in new electronics plants and subsequently being reluctant to enforce environmental rules, Maynard said.But it's also true that when the central Chinese government becomes aware of gaps in enforcement it acts swiftly and decisively - with more unquestioned authority than the U.S. government, Maynard said."People may cut corners to increase profits, but then they have to face a heavy hammer coming down on them," Maynard said.'Sustainable ecosystem'In Wisconsin, the EPA has been urging state officials for a decade or more to remedy 75 deficiencies in clean water standards it enforces, and the state Legislative Audit Bureau last year found that the DNR seldom enforced its own standards for industrial water pollution.In a "Social and Environmental Responsibility Report" released in June, Foxconn said it was working to reduce waste and improve energy efficiency."In 2016, we made continuous investments in applying innovation to support the realization of our social and environmental responsibility goals and significant progress has been realized across our business and operations," founder and CEO Terry Gou said in an introduction to the report. "Looking ahead, we will continue to fulfill our promise to safeguard the interests of all our stakeholders and to build a sustainable ecosystem for Foxconn's development."In addition to the first LCD panel plant, Foxconn plans to build three factories to assemble the panels into finished products and it expects a glass manufacturer and other suppliers would also spring up.Load-Date: January 17, 2018End of Document

LONDON MARKET OPEN: Ladbrokes Leads Midcaps On GBP4 Billion GVC DealLive Briefs PRO Global MarketsDecember 7, 2017 Thursday 3:40 AM ESTCopyright 2017 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 1392 wordsBody London indices were in the green early Thursday, the FTSE 250 index outperforming the FTSE 100 as gains for mid-cap bookmakers Ladbrokes Coral and GVC Holdings on news of GBP3.9 billion merger talks supported the index.Ladbrokes Coral jumped to the top of the FTSE 250, up 28% at 173.20 pence, while GVC was up 4.4%.The non-binding proposal is for GVC to pay 32.7 pence in cash and issue 0.141 GVC shares for each Ladbrokes share, with a further potential payout of 42.8 pence structured as a contingent value right that will be payable if certain targets are met.Excluding the potential 42.8 pence deferred payout, the offer values Ladbrokes at 160.9 pence per share, or GBP3.10 billion in total. Including the maximum deferred consideration, the value rises to GBP3.90 billion. Ladbrokes shares closed on Wednesday at 135.70p.Ladbrokes shareholders would own about 46.5% of the enlarged group while GVC shareholders would own the other 53.5%. "Whilst the determination of the senior management positions will be finalised by the parties over the coming weeks, it has been agreed by the parties that [GVC Chief Executive] Kenneth Alexander would be the CEO of the enlarged group should the transaction proceed to completion," GVC said. Ladbrokes Coral was itself formed in its present shape only late last year by the merger between Ladbrokes and Gala Coral Group, and the amount of synergies delivered came in much higher than originally expected. "The proposed tie-up has been rumoured for a while. We see significant merits in the tie-up notably from cost synergies, a more diverse geographic footprint and reduces the risk around UK regulation and machines in particular," said Shore.The FTSE 100 index was up 0.1%, or 9.26 points at 7,357.29 early Thursday. The mid-cap FTSE 250 index was up 0.3% at 19,883.97. The AIM All-Share index was up 0.2% at 1,013.52.The BATS UK 100 index was up 0.1% at 12,497.43. The BATS 250 was up 0.2% at 18,054.68, and the BATS Small Companies down 0.1% at 12,371.16.Sterling was quoted at USD1.3373 early Thursday, soft compared to USD1.3379 at the London equities close on Wednesday and well down from its best levels of the week above USD1.35. Brexit uncertainty was continuing to weigh on the currency, and providing a lift to the dollar-earner heavy FTSE 100.UK Prime Minister Theresa May spoke to her Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, and to the leader of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party on Wednesday following this week's collapse of a deal on the post-Brexit Irish border.May discussed the border issue by phone with Varadkar and DUP leader Arlene Foster, with DUP sources saying afterwards that there was "still work to be done" to reach agreement, The Belfast Telegraph reported.The DUP objected at the last minute to Monday's draft deal on the Irish border, which would have given Northern Ireland a special status in relation to the EU, saying it had no prior chance to view the text.Back on the London Stock Exchange, FTSE 100-listed financial services firm Legal & General was up 0.4%, having reported "particularly strong growth" in recent weeks, and remains well-placed to deliver strong growth in its core markets.Legal & General Retirement has delivered total sales for 2017 to date of GBP6.2 billion, with the business showing strong momentum in the UK and US institutional pension risk transfer markets, as well as in individual annuities and lifetime mortgages.Legal & General Investment Management achieved total external net inflows of GBP38.1 billion to the end of October. Inflows were well-diversified by product line and geography, Legal & General said."L&G is on track for a record year for earnings and profits. Our core business divisions are generating formidable momentum. With yesterday's announcement of the sale of our closed book, in run-off Mature Savings business for GBP650 million, our business is now well-positioned," said Chief Executive Nigel Wilson.Coca-Cola HBC, up 0.6%, said it has appointed Zoran Bogdanovic as chief executive with immediate effect. He succeeds Dimitris Lois, who died in October.Bogdanovic is currently a regional director, responsible for operations in 12 countries and has been a member of the Coca-Cola bottler's operating committee since 2013.In the FTSE 250, Aveva Group was up 4.4% after Barclays lifted the engineering software developer to Overweight from Equal Weight.William Hill was up 3.8% after reaching an agreement with Scientific Games Corp to "unconditionally support" its proposed acquisition of Toronto-listed NYX Gaming Group in which it owns a stake.The gambling firm owns both ordinary and preference shares in its Canadian peer. William Hill's stake was acquired in 2016 for GBP80 million in order to support NYX's GBP270 million acquisition of software gaming company OpenBet.Mid-cap DS Smith - which will begin trading in the FTSE 100 effective December 18 following the latest index review - reported an increase in interim revenue but a slight fall in profit, due to acquisition costs. The corrugated packaging firm was up 2.0% early Thursday.Pretax profit for the six months to October 31 fell to GBP144.0 million from GBP146.0 million the same period the year before, mainly due to an increase in one-off costs to GBP40.0 million from GBP21.0 million last year. Adjusted operating profit, which excludes these costs and the amortisation of intangible assets, rose 6.0% on a constant currency basis and 11% on a reported currency basis to GBP251.0 million.Revenue for the period was up 14% at constant currency and 19% at reported rates to GBP2.80 billion from GBP2.36 billion the prior year. "The outlook remains positive as we begin our second half with good momentum. Our packaging proposition that delivers real value to our customers is reflected in our volume growth and, while input cost pressures remain, we continue to recover those costs as planned," said DS Smith.Iron ore miner and processor Ferrexpo, up 3.1%, said it will pay a special dividend of 3.3 US cents, doubling its total payout for the year so far after declaring its first interim dividend earlier this year. The 3.3 US cent interim dividend was paid in early September, and shareholders will now receive another 3.3 cent special payout.Investec was down 2.7%. The Anglo-South African bank went ex-dividend on Thursday.In mainland Europe, the CAC 40 in Paris was up 0.1% while the DAX 30 in Frankfurt was up 0.2%.The economic events calendar on Thursday has the third quarter reading of eurozone GDP at 1000 GMT. In the afternoon there is US initial jobless claims at 1330 GMT, which prelude nonfarm payrolls for November on Friday.Already released, Germany's industrial production dropped unexpectedly in October, data from Destatis showed. Industrial production fell 1.4% month-on-month in October, following a revised 0.9% drop in September. Production was forecast to rebound 0.9%.Elsewhere in Germany, the Social Democrats party will hold a conference opening Thursday to consider a call from the centre-left party's leadership to launch talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel so to end the nation's political gridlock following September's election.SPD leader Martin Schulz attempted on Wednesday to rally his party behind the talks with members torn between backing Merkel for a fourth term in power or going into opposition to regroup after suffering its worst result since 1949 at the September poll.In addition to rejoining a Merkel-led coalition, the SPD congress is also set to consider whether the party might agree to another way of backing the chancellor in office either by tolerating a CDU-CSU government in parliament or supporting a minority government headed by the chancellor.In Asia on Thursday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 1.5%. In China, the Shanghai Composite closed down 0.7%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong closed up 0.3%.China underperformed peers after the International Monetary Fund said in a report Thursday its soaring levels of corporate, government and household debt are threatening the country's financial stability, and urged the government to move away from credit-fuelled economic growth.The Chinese government is prioritizing "social stability" in the near-term, appearing "to rely on credit expansion to continue financing firms even when they are not viable," the report said.Load-Date: December 8, 2017End of Document

Branding news outlets as foreign agents won't make them any more transparentCNN.comNovember 29, 2017 Wednesday 7:52 AM ESTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: OPINIONSLength: 1168 wordsByline: By Suzanne NosselBodyRT -- the Kremlin-funded news channel formerly known as "Russia Today," frequently cited as a central gear in Russia's propaganda machine -- is nothing if not colorful. The network is known for declaring the Boston Marathon bombings a government plot, publicly shaming its own journalists if they dare defy the Kremlin line and for featuring American commentators known for conspiracy-mongering.Now RT can add another ignominious label to its long list: foreign agent.Following years of hue and cry over the network's overt pro-Kremlin bias, earlier this month the Department of Justice forced the channel to file under the "Foreign Agents Registration Act," or FARA, a 1938 law that was initially passed to counter pro-Nazi propaganda and subsequently retooled in the 1960s to publicly pinpoint those lobbying on behalf of foreign interests.Forcing RT to register as a foreign agent is justified, but isn't the best way to counter the propaganda the channel -- or any other source of disinformation for that matter -- puts out. While RT has howled its objections, the network may protest too much. Absent a far wider effort to incentivize and enable news consumers to distinguish serious news and analysis from agitprop, FARA registration or not, the influence of RT and other shady news sources may survive intact.The problem is that while RT's FARA registration may make members of Congress and administration officials feel as though they've landed a blow in the fight against Russian propaganda, RT's filing with the Justice Department may well never register with most news consumers. From the looks of things there is no easy way for a consumer of RT to learn that it has filed as a foreign agent. It is not mentioned in the "About Us" section of RT nor flagged on RT stories that appear in Google searches. The same is true of the China Daily News, a media outlet long registered under FARA as an agent of the Chinese government.News cognoscenti are already well aware of RT's lineage, but to get through to those who read and believe the network will require more than the fine print in a government filing.Former FBI Director James Comey put it bluntly in testimony last March before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, saying, "The Kremlin is waging an international disinformation campaign through the RT propaganda network which traffics in anti-American conspiracy theories that rivaled the extravagant untruths of Soviet era Pravda."In late October Twitter announced that it would "off-board" all advertising from RT and Sputnik, another Russian-controlled platform, based on its own investigation and on US intelligence agencies' conclusion that the networks had sought to influence the outcome of the 2016 election at Putin's behest.Whereas FARA contains an exception for bona fide media organizations, those state-owned entities that have qualified for it -- including the BBC and Germany's Deutsche Welle -- have strong layers of publicly visible and reputable independent governance that shield editorial decision-making from government interference.While critics have been hard-pressed to argue that RT does not meet the criteria for registration under the act, they have rightly pointed out that by enforcing its provisions against the network, the US will likely trigger a wave of retaliatory and copycat measures designed by governments to clamp down on media outlets considered unfriendly. Indeed, the Russian Duma, acting at Putin's behest, moved swiftly to pass its own version of foreign media registration requirements last week. Russia's Ministry of Justice has let US government-backed networks, including Voice of American and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) know that they may be required to register under the new act. Russia is also reportedly considering more sweeping bans on the availability of foreign print media.In some ways, these new measures are old news: US government-backed VOA and RFE/RL have been blocked from broadcasting in Russia for years. The more worrying prospect is that repressive regimes elsewhere in the world -- think the Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte or Uzbekistan's Islam Karimov -- are emboldened in acting to foster local distrust of credible international media outlets.With consumers accessing the vast majority of their news via Facebook and other social media feeds, the likelihood that news of RT's filing will color the reception of its stories among those who currently tune in seems dim. Tangible indicators of likely veracity -- including information about the news source, its track record, ethical guidelines and reporting methods -- can be ferreted out only through time-consuming research, if at all. A study earlier this year by the Media Insight Project revealed that consumers are far more likely to evaluate the veracity of a news article based on who shared it than what the source is.If anything, worries about RT's influence point to the fact that transparency in American news media consumption cannot come solely, or even primarily, through force of law. Rather, we need Americans to be trained and educated to expect and demand transparency about ownership, editorial control, potential conflicts of interest and internal checks and processes to preserve objectivity and accuracy from the news that we consume. And, if outlets insist on remaining opaque on these fronts, as has RT, we should know to reject those outlets as unreliable.We should prize voluntary transparency by news outlets, and should refuse to pay for, devote our attention to, do business with and share information from outlets unwilling to be transparent. As primary conduits for news, social media platforms have an essential role to play in equipping and empowering users to get the information they need to make sound judgments about what they're reading and sharing.In an open media ecosystem, especially as one as large and freewheeling as the internet, government regulation is never going to be a satisfactory answer for the scourge of fraudulent news or propaganda.Ultimately, the best defense against fake news and foreign propaganda lies in comprehensive public education on the uses and misuses of media. News literacy curricula in schools and workplaces, easier-to-use reference material tied to news shared online, transparent newsroom policies on subjects like conflicts of interest and corrections and rigorous methods of sourcing and crediting are all essential to enabling news consumers to navigate the information ocean in which many now drown.It is true that Americans are fiercely independent in choosing what media to consume and credit. But no one wants to be fooled. Rather than consoling ourselves that RT's motives and loyalties will now be laid bare, the network's belated registration under FARA is just one more reminder that absent more far-reaching action, purveyors of propaganda and fraudulent news will likely continue to work their will on a populace that is ill-equipped to defend itself.Load-Date: December 1, 2017End of Document

Analysts' Upgrades for September, 7th (AFG, APH, BVHMF, HDELY, MCHVF, MXWL, RH, SID, SORL, TIER)American Banking and Market NewsSeptember 7, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 American Banking and Market News All Rights ReservedLength: 2204 wordsBodyAnalysts' upgrades for Thursday, September 7th: American Financial Group (NYSE:AFG) was upgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research  from a hold rating to a buy rating. The firm currently has $109.00 target price on the stock. According to Zacks, "Shares of American Financial have outperformed the industry year to date. The company is well poised to benefit from impressive inorganic growth and restructuring initiatives. Better industry fundamentals, with strong pricing and a higher renewal ratio, should drive overall growth. Consistent price increase in property and casualty business, combined ratio that compares favorably with industry average, a strong balance sheet, low leverage cost, and disciplined capital management are positives. Based on strong operational performance, it raised core net operating earnings of $6.40 $6.90 per share in 2017. Estimates for 2017 and 2018 also moved north over the last 60 days.  However, American Financial s exposure to cat loss is a risk to underwriting results. A still soft interest rate environment is expected to weigh on desired upside in investment results." Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH) was upgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research  from a hold rating to a buy rating. They currently have $90.00 target price on the stock. According to Zacks, "Amphenol s top-line growth is benefiting from improved end-market demand in automotive, mobile networks and military markets. The company remains encouraged by its expanding presence in the fast-growing commercial aerospace market and is well positioned to capitalize on the proliferation of electronics content on next-generation planes. A sustained drive for geographic and market diversification has enabled Amphenol to extend its presence into new customers and new applications. A balanced organic and inorganic growth model, a lean and flexible cost structure, and an agile and entrepreneurial management team augur well for its long-term growth perspectives. Amphenol outperformed the industry year to date. However, bulk of the company s revenues comes from sales to the communications industry, demand for which is subject to rapid technological change." BOVIS HOMES GROUP GBP0.50 (NASDAQ:BVHMF) was upgraded by analysts at Numis Securities Ltd from an add rating to a buy rating.  HeidelbergCement AG (OTC:HDELY) was upgraded by analysts at Barclays PLC from an equal weight rating to an overweight rating.  MGM China Holdings (OTC:MCHVF) was upgraded by analysts at Deutsche Bank AG from a hold rating to a buy rating.  Maxwell Technologies (NASDAQ:MXWL) was upgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research  from a hold rating to a buy rating.

According to Zacks, "TransUnion is poised for impressive growth in several of its end markets, especially the burgeoning Big Data and analytics market, with an attractive business model, significant operating leverage, low capital requirements and strong and stable cash flows. Increased risk of identity theft due to data breaches and higher consumer awareness about the usage of credit information are propelling the demand for its consumer solutions. As emerging market economies continue to develop and mature, TransUnion is well-positioned to gain from the associated favorable socio-economic trends. The company has further increased its guidance on healthy growth dynamics. TransUnion has also outperformed the industry year to date. However, the company is vulnerable to the overall macroeconomic conditions, industry trends and adverse foreign currency translation effects, which limit its profitability to some extent." Tetra Technologies (NYSE:TTI) was upgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research  from a sell rating to a hold rating.

(AP) - Wisconsin's cranberry farmers are working to generate demand for the fruit overseas to alleviate an oversupply that's driving down prices.Food buyers, bloggers and social media influencers from China and India visited Wisconsin's cranberry farms as part of the U.S. Cranberry Marketing Committee's Reverse Trade Mission, Wisconsin Public Radio reported .About 20 people visited the Cutler Cranberry Co. farm near Tomah last week to see how the fruit is harvested, processed and packaged. Committee officials hope visitors will return home and spread the word about the fruit's uses and potential health benefits.The trade effort cost about $60,000 and was paid for by federal grants and fees paid on barrels of cranberries.A 2013 survey found that less than 4 percent of Chinese consumers were aware of cranberries as a fruit, said Mabel Zhuang, founder of M.Z. Consulting in Shanghai, which works with the committee."But after five years promotion, now the awareness rate has increased to over 50 percent," she said. "It's a huge increase in the past five years."Only sweetened, dried cranberries are currently allowed to be imported into China. The U.S. and Chinese governments are working to create an agreement to allow for fresh cranberries from the U.S. to be imported into China.There was a record harvest of the fruit in 2016 and a strong harvest of the fruit this year, said Tom Lochner, the association's executive director."Sales of cranberry products are growing. We see an increase each year, probably averaging 3 to 4 percent a year over the last five or six years," Lochner said. "The problem is we've been growing them faster than we're selling them. So, that's why we've seen an accumulation of inventories."The fruit's abundance caused the price of a 100-pound barrel to drop by 21 percent last year.___Information from: Wisconsin Public Radio, http://www.wpr.orgLoad-Date: November 4, 2017End of Document

The U.S. Ignores CRISPR and Genetic Engineering Issues to Its Own DetrimentUSNEWS.comAugust 21, 2017 MondayCopyright 2017 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Economic Intelligence; Vol.; No.Length: 964 wordsByline: Christopher Koopman, Jordan ReimschiselHighlight: Discouraging the use of CRISPR and genetic editing technologies won't make us any safer.BodyRecent American experiments with genetically edited embryos have reignited both excitement and consternation over the possibility of modifying human DNA. Some            scientists have called for extreme caution moving forward; others are responding by preparing kids for a new world that might soon include "Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats," or CRISPR for short, biotechnology that allows for precise genetic engineering. While it may sound like science fiction, this type of technological innovation is here to stay. China, for example, has been experimenting with genetic editing for some time. Thus it's important to take a proactive approach and equip the next generation with the tools to both use CRISPR appropriately and remain competitive in a changing world. Jane Powel, a longtime teacher and president of the science and engineering education company OmniLearn, runs a summer science camp for children at East Woods school, several miles east of New York City. Her team of scientists, educators, and PhDs teaches a wide variety of topics that curious students can explore, including biotechnology and CRISPR, 3D printing, robotics, and coding. Powel uses this program to            briefly introduce students in the biotechnology track to            CRISPR technology before setting them up with a series of hands-on experiments. Similarly, Michael Hirsch, a science teacher and lab manager at Acera School near Cambridge, Massachusetts, incorporated CRISPR into the curriculum he uses for his 6th through 8th grade classes. Both teachers encourage their students to discuss the ethical and technical issues that might come with the technology -- and the children's ability to foresee problems and consider ethical conundrums is astounding. When Powel recently asked her class if CRISPR might have some problematic issues, one young student immediately raised his hand and noted that the technology could easily damage parts of a person's DNA even while fixing the intended portion. Hirsch also asked his students to think critically about what circumstances would warrant using such powerful technology. Most of the kids agreed that doctors should use CRISPR to try to cure dangerous diseases, but there were myriad opinions when Hirsch asked them about applications beyond healing. These students demonstrate both an eagerness to learn and the ability to think through the broader implications of using such technology in a responsible manner. Powel understands the power and potential danger of genetic science, and says that is all the more reason for children to learn about it and consider its benefits and drawbacks. She argues that not only can teaching science give children the technical skills required to succeed as they get older, but it can also be a vehicle to encourage curiosity and problem-solving skills, and provide tools that will help them succeed in any career they choose. It would be a mistake to allow extreme caution and fear to prevent students from being exposed to CRISPR. Withholding knowledge not only inhibits their ability to develop a well-considered approach to technological change, but also places them at a future disadvantage. As personalized medicine and CRISPR quickly gain dominance, students exposed to these concepts at an early age will be more equipped to succeed in a shifting medical and tech environment. Allowing institutions to embrace these new technologies could harness the power of the brilliant minds of the next generation, leading to discoveries that might solve some of the moral issues we don't have answers for today. Already those students being exposed to CRISPR are showing the desire and capacity to think deeply about these things. It is not surprising that both of the schools mentioned above are located in the vicinity of some of the most forward-thinking institutions pursuing this research. On a global scale, extreme caution will only hinder our competitiveness with other countries. In March 2016 the Chinese government kicked off a 15-year, $9.2 billion push to establish itself as the uncontested king of genomics and precision medicine. While the Obama administration made similar efforts through the Precision Medicine Initiative, there has been little movement. In fact, Congress has explicitly banned federal funds from being used for the type of embryonic gene editing that has made recent news. It should come as no surprise, then, that Chinese scientists consistently precede U.S. researchers in pushing CRISPR to its limits. Earlier this year, the National Academy of Sciences expressed concern over the possibility that U.S.-based researchers might leave the country for more friendly jurisdictions like China if we continue to drag our feet. Losing such important work could harm more than American patients and aspiring scientists. It could also contribute to a less than ethical development of genetic science in a country with less will and ability to control the truly horrific cases that could potentially emerge. Instead of painting a terrifying picture of the future that only Aldous Huxley could dream up -- and using these fears to completely abandon new types of innovation -- scientists, policymakers and educators ought to seek out ethical ways to allow genetic science to improve people's lives. Discouraging these technologies in America will not prevent brilliant scientists from pursuing them. Instead, it will push them to less careful and less scrupulous jurisdictions, resulting in harm to American patients and an inability to shape the future in accordance with democratic ideals and principles.Christopher Koopman is a senior research fellow and director of the Technology Policy Program at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.Graphic Picture, Education is key., (asiseeit/Getty Stock Images)Load-Date: August 22, 2017End of Document

Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Lu Kang called the accusations "complete hearsay and groundless" and called on German officials to "speak and act more responsibly."NYTimes A1: Beijing Migrant Crackdown Affecting White-Collar Workers.In a front-page article, the New York Times (12/11, Buckley, Wee, Wu, Subscription Publication, 16.07M) reports Beijing is in the middle of its most aggressive effort in decades to eliminate unwanted migrants, and while the effort is affecting labors, educated and ambitious white-collar workers lacking residency permits are also affected. Attracted by tech, finance, and hospitality, jobs, tens of thousands of hopeful young college graduates are forced to live in the same neighborhoods as laborers from the countryside and are facing eviction as authorities condemn buildings. The crackdown has prompted debate not only on how the city will function without cooks, cleaners, and vendors, but how the tech sector will be affected. Such companies rely on migrant couriers to deliver goods and means, and already five delivery companies warned of delivery delays following the expulsions.Load-Date: December 12, 2017End of Document

BLINDED BY VIDEO GAMES? TRY SOMETHING MORE SERIOUSStates News ServiceOctober 18, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 763 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: ST. LOUIS, MO BodyThe following information was released by the American Optometric Association (AOA):When a Chinese woman's binge gaming session came to a blinding halt, social media quickly settled on a familiar pop culture diagnosis-but what actually happened is far more troubling."I can think of no correlation between device screen time and CRAO."Reportedly, the 21-year-old suddenly lost sight in her right eye after playing a popular multiplayer smartphone game, Honour of Kings, for hours on end. The woman admitted to spending the entirety of Oct. 1, a public holiday, playing the game until her abrupt loss of vision prompted a trip to the hospital. There, hospital staff diagnosed her with a central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), and that's when her story went viral.Social media users on the website, Weibo, were quick to draw a correlation, while others hearkened back to popular adages about too much TV and ruined vision. A comment in Chinese state media from hospital staff said that her CRAO "likely" resulted from excessive gaming.The comment raised flags not only for its dubious nature but also because China has a history with this smartphone game. In fact, the Chinese government recently suggested restricting children to no more than one hour of playtime daily after a rash of obsessive incidents involving the game. But the situation begs the question: Can excessive screen time cause blindness?The short answer is most likely not, says Leonard Messner, O.D., executive director of the Illinois Eye Institute and vice president for patient care services at the Illinois College of Optometry (ICO)."I can think of no correlation between device screen time and CRAO," Dr. Messner says. "The most common causes of CRAO are carotid atherosclerosis, cardiac arrhythmias and giant cell arteritis. That said, many have no known cause."Analogous to a stroke of the eye, CRAO is an ocular emergency whereby the blood vessel supplying the retina becomes blocked, resulting in sudden and painless vision loss. It's estimated to occur at a rate of 1:100,000 with approximately two-thirds of patients only recovering vision to 20/400. Given that CRAO is commonly correlated with other cardiovascular diseases, patients presenting with such a condition may be at future risk for cerebral stroke or ischemic heart disease, according to some studies. That, alone, makes this woman's diagnosis serious.While it's highly unlikely the etiology of this woman's eye problems was video game playing, that doesn't belittle other concerns prolonged screen time and device use can have on the eyes, says Dominick Maino, O.D., professor of pediatrics and binocular vision at ICO.Screen time takes toll on eyesThe Pew Research Center estimates that 60 percent of Americans, ages 18-29, play video games at least occasionally, while more than half of those ages 30-49 do, too. On top of that, the AOA's 2016 American Eye-Q study found that the average American spends seven hours daily using digital devices, with the Millennial generation spending an average of nine hours daily. All that time staring at a digital device can have repercussions, just not in the way social media thought here.High-energy, short-wavelength blue light-the kind of visible light emitted from digital devices-has been at the center of scrutiny. Researchers believe viewing such bright lighting at nighttime can disrupt circadian rhythms by suppressing melatonin production to keep people wakeful. This, in turn, can hinder natural sleep cycles and affect alertness. But blue light isn't the only concern.Digital eyestrain is another common occurrence from prolonged device use, and manifests itself in headaches, blurred vision, dry eyes, neck and shoulder pain, and general eyestrain. To counter the effects of digital eyestrain, the AOA recommends these five tips:Follow the 20-20-20 rule: Take a 20-second break every 20 minutes to view something 20 feet away.Keep a distance: Sit a comfortable distance away from any computer monitor or device, generally, keeping the screen 20 to 28 inches from your eyes.Consider the angle: Ideally, computer screens or devices should be 15 to 20 degrees-4 or 5 inches-below eye level as measured from the center of the screen.Decrease glare: Try a glare filter to minimize the reflected light bouncing off the screen or device.Blink often: Minimize your chances of developing dry eyes when using a computer or device by making an effort to frequently blink.Click here to read more about the good, bad and ugly of video games and eye health in the April 2016 issue of AOA Focus.Load-Date: October 18, 2017End of Document

JA Solar Sets New World Record of Output Power for 60-cell Modules Assembled by mono-Si PERC cellsPR NewswireDecember 12, 2017 Tuesday 11:34 PM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 532 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Dec. 12, 2017 BodyJA Solar Holdings Co., Ltd., one of the world's largest manufacturers of high-performance solar power products, today announces the output power of its 60-cell PV modules assembled by mono-Si PERC cells has exceeded 325W. The actual output power of 326.67 W measured and certified by TUV SUD sets a new world record for 60-cell mono-Si PV modules.As one of the largest PV product manufacturers in the world, JA Solar has been instrumental in developing advanced PV technologies through invention and innovation. In 2010, the Company filed an invention application for its industrial PERC cell structure and the method of production, the patent was granted by the Patent and Trade Mark Office of Chinese National Bureau of Intellectual Properties in 2012. In 2013, JA Solar was the first company to break the 20% conversion-efficiency barrier for the industrial version of PERC solar cells using screen-printing metallization process, and started mass production of PERC-based cells and modules in the following year. JA Solar also holds the intellectual property rights for bifacial PERC cells with a Chinese patent granted by the National Bureau of Intellectual Properties of China in 2016.PERC technology has increasingly become the mainstream approach for high-performance PV products in the past few years. According to SEMI PVITR, PERC products will account for 40% of total product shipments by 2020. The advance of PERC technology as well as the wide adoption of the technology have significantly impacted on the solar powered energy generation in terms the reduction of levelized cost of energy and grid parity. Currently, the average power output of the 60-cell PV modules assembled with mono-Si PERC cells JA Solar offers is 300W. This newly set world record is a result of JA Solar's unwavering commitment of continuous performance improvement, as well as its strong R&D effort and drive devoted for advancing PV technology. It is also a result in preparation to meet the technological challenge of the "Front Runner" initiative as a showcase for the PV industry set forth by the Chinese government. PERC has been the favored products for the initiative since it officially started. In 2016, JA Solar provided 422MW PV modules with 40% of them being mono-Si PERC for the first 1GW demonstration phase of this "Front Runner" initiative as the largest module supplier in the project."Setting a new world record of over 325W output power from a 60-cell mono-Si PV module is remarkable achievement enabled by PERC technology," said Dr. Wei Shan, Chief Technology Officer of JA Solar. "It is also a testament of the unrivaled efforts at JA Solar that focus on developing high-efficiency, cost-effective PV products meet the ever increased demand for clean energy through technological innovation and continuous performance improvement, as well as the commitment and the tradition of JA Solar to provide our customers high-performance PV products with high quality and reliability." View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ja-solar-sets-new-world-record-of-output-power-for-60-cell-modules-assembled-by-mono-si-perc-cells-300570510.htmlSOURCE JA Solar Holdings Co., Ltd.CONTACT: Xiaorui Sun, +86-10-6361-1888 x1698, bj.sunxr@jasolar.comLoad-Date: December 14, 2017End of Document

LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Ladbrokes Coral And GVC In Merger TalksLive Briefs PRO Global MarketsDecember 7, 2017 Thursday 2:36 AM ESTCopyright 2017 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 1414 wordsBody Shares in London are set to open higher on Thursday, extending the gains seen on Wednesday, with the market getting an early wake-up call from bookmakers Ladbrokes Coral Group and GVC Holdings saying they are in "detailed" merger talks for a deal worth up to GBP3.9 billion.The non-binding proposal is for GVC to pay 32.7 pence in cash and issue 0.141 GVC shares for each Ladbrokes share, with a further potential payout of 42.8 pence structured as a contingent value right that will be payable if certain targets are met.Excluding the potential 42.8 pence deferred payout, the offer values Ladbrokes at 160.9 pence per share, or GBP3.10 billion in total. Including the maximum deferred consideration, the value rises to GBP3.90 billion. Ladbrokes shares closed on Wednesday at 135.70p.Ladbrokes shareholders would own about 46.5% of the enlarged group while GVC shareholders would own the other 53.5%. "Whilst the determination of the senior management positions will be finalised by the parties over the coming weeks, it has been agreed by the parties that [GVC Chief Executive] Kenneth Alexander would be the CEO of the enlarged group should the transaction proceed to completion," GVC said. Ladbrokes Coral was itself formed in its present shape only late last year by the merger between Ladbrokes and Gala Coral Group, and the amount of synergies delivered came in much higher than originally expected. IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index of large-caps to open 3.07 points higher at 7,351.10 on Thursday. The FTSE 100 index closed up 0.3%, or 20.53 points, at 7,348.03 on Wednesday."The FTSE is pointing to a positive start, building on the gains from the previous session. Stronger commodity prices such as copper and oil, which are rebounding in the Asian session after a recent rout, are expected to support the FTSE on the open," said Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group.Sterling was quoted at USD1.3373 early Thursday, soft compared to USD1.3379 at the London equities close on Wednesday and well down from its best levels of the week above USD1.35."A softer pound could also prop up the FTSE on Thursday. Fears growing over a Brexit deal not being reached before next week's deadline are weighing on sentiment for sterling," Lawler said.UK Prime Minister Theresa May spoke to her Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, and to the leader of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party on Wednesday following this week's collapse of a deal on the post-Brexit Irish border.May discussed the border issue by phone with Varadkar and DUP leader Arlene Foster, with DUP sources saying afterwards that there was "still work to be done" to reach agreement, The Belfast Telegraph reported.The DUP objected at the last minute to Monday's draft deal on the Irish border, which would have given Northern Ireland a special status in relation to the EU, saying it had no prior chance to view the text.Back on the London Stock Exchange, FTSE 100-listed financial services firm Legal & General said it has experienced "particularly strong growth" in recent weeks, and remains well-placed to deliver strong growth in its core markets.Legal & General Retirement has delivered total sales for 2017 to date of GBP6.2 billion, with the business showing strong momentum in the UK and US institutional pension risk transfer markets, as well as in individual annuities and lifetime mortgages.Legal & General Investment Management achieved total external net inflows of GBP38.1 billion to the end of October. Inflows were well-diversified by product line and geography, Legal & General said."L&G is on track for a record year for earnings and profits. Our core business divisions are generating formidable momentum. With yesterday's announcement of the sale of our closed book, in run-off Mature Savings business for GBP650 million, our business is now well-positioned," said Chief Executive Nigel Wilson.Coca-Cola HBC said it has appointed Zoran Bogdanovic as chief executive with immediate effect. He succeeds Dimitris Lois, who died in October.Bogdanovic is currently a regional director, responsible for operations in 12 countries and has been a member of the Coca-Cola bottler's operating committee since 2013.FTSE 250-listed DS Smith - which will begin trading in the FTSE 100 effective December 18 following the latest index review - reported an increase in interim revenue but a slight fall in profit, due to acquisition and fibre costs.Revenue rose to GBP2.80 billion from GBP2.36 billion in the six months to October 31, but pretax profit fell to GBP144 million from GBP146 million.Input costs were substantially higher period-on-period, DS Smith said, reflecting a rise in fibre costs and in paper pricing. The corrugated packaging firm also said it was hit by higher amortisation and adjusting items related to acquisitions in the period."The outlook remains positive as we begin our second half with good momentum. Our packaging proposition that delivers real value to our customers is reflected in our volume growth and, while input cost pressures remain, we continue to recover those costs as planned," said DS Smith.Electra Private Equity reported a "strong" performance for the year ended September 30, with a total shareholder return of 21%, above the 14% return from the FTSE 250.Net asset value per share at September 30 was 1,981 pence, a total return of 9% for the year. However, this was down significantly from 5,149p at September 30, 2016.Due to the "exceptional level of special dividends" paid to shareholders over the past 12 months, the Electra said it has elected not to pay an ordinary dividend for its recently ended year.In the US on Wednesday, Wall Street ended mixed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending 0.2% lower, the S&P 500 flat, and the Nasdaq Composite 0.2% higher.The choppy trading on Wall Street came as traders expressed uncertainty about the economic impact of the Republican tax reform plan. While the Senate passed a USD1.5 trillion tax reform bill early Saturday, this must now be reconciled with the version passed through the House of Representatives.Concerns about the possibility of violence in the Middle East also weighed on the markets as US President Donald Trump announced he is officially recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel."Today we finally acknowledge the obvious - that Jerusalem is Israel's capital," he said in Washington, adding that he still supported a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said Trump's Wednesday announcement, which overturns decades of US policy and will see the US embassy move from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, was "reprehensible".Theresa May in response to Trump's decision said: "We disagree with the US decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem and recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital before a final status agreement. We believe it is unhelpful in terms of prospects for peace in the region."In Asia on Thursday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 1.5%. In China, the Shanghai Composite closed down 0.7%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is up 0.5%.Japan's leading index decreased for the second straight month in October, in line with expectations, preliminary figures from the Cabinet Office showed Thursday. The leading index, which measures the future economic activity, dropped to 106.1 in October from 106.5 in September. The figure also matched consensus estimate.Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund said in a report Thursday China's soaring levels of corporate, government and household debt are threatening the country's financial stability, and urged the government to move away from credit-fuelled economic growth.China's credit-to-GDP ratio now stands at around 25%, which is "very high by international standards" and "consistent with a high probability of financial distress," the report said.Corporate debt has reached 165% of gross domestic product while household debt has also risen quickly over the past few years, the IMF said.The Chinese government is prioritizing "social stability" in the near-term, appearing "to rely on credit expansion to continue financing firms even when they are not viable," the report said.The economic events calendar on Thursday has UK Halifax house prices data at 0830 GMT and the third quarter reading of eurozone GDP at 1000 GMT. In the afternoon there is US initial jobless claims at 1330 GMT, which prelude nonfarm payrolls for November on Friday.Load-Date: December 8, 2017End of Document

China lashes out at German ambassador over cyber securityAssociated Press Financial WireDecember 27, 2017 Wednesday 11:41 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 526 wordsDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - China's foreign ministry lashed out at the German ambassador on Wednesday after he said Beijing failed to respond to requests to discuss Chinese internet controls foreign companies worry will disrupt business.Ambassador Michael Clauss told the South China Morning Post newspaper of Hong Kong the two governments agreed in 2016 to set up a group to discuss cyber issues but it "has yet to see the light of day." He said requests for a "meaningful dialogue" about Chinese curbs on virtual private networks, which are used for encrypted communication and can evade Beijing's web filters, have "regrettably not yet received a positive response.""The remarks by the relevant ambassador are not constructive, and some of them are even wrong," said a foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, at a regular briefing.Hua said Germany had been invited to send delegations for consultation but was reluctant to do so."Instead, they accuse China of lacking sincerity for dialogue. It does not make sense," said Hua. "I hope the German Embassy and the people involved can refrain from unprofessional and irresponsible remarks and do something conducive to development of bilateral relationship and mutually beneficial cooperation."It is almost unheard of for the Chinese foreign ministry to criticize a foreign diplomat, but Clauss is unusually forthright in talking publicly about import curbs, internet controls and other sensitive issues.In June, Clauss called on communist authorities to release a detained bishop of the underground Roman Catholic church. He expressed concern about proposed changes in regulations on worship.Chinese authorities have banned use of unlicensed VPNs as part of a sweeping crackdown on technology to evade controls aimed at preventing the public from seeing material deemed subversive or obscene.China has the world's biggest population of internet users, with some 730 million people online. Estimates of the number of scientists, businesspeople, students and others who rely on VPNs for work and study run into the tens of millions.Foreign companies use VPNs to communicate securely with their offices abroad and to see news and other websites that are blocked by Chinese web filters.Companies already cite internet controls as among the biggest obstacles to doing business in China. Some have expressed concern being required to use only government-approved VPNs could weaken their security.The VPN crackdown coincides with a Cybersecurity Law that took effect on June 1 and tightens control over data. It limits use of foreign security technology and requires companies to store information about Chinese citizens within this country.Clauss's comments followed a warning this month by the head of Germany's domestic intelligence agency that Chinese intelligence was engaged in a "broad-based attempt to infiltrate" its government. The official said Chinese agents used social networks to try to cultivate lawmakers and other officials as sources and targeted more than 10,000 Germans.In the newspaper interview, Clauss said that issue could have been discussed by the German-Chinese cyber group but it has never met.Load-Date: December 28, 2017End of Document
