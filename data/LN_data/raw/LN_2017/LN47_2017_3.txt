Stories from SlateSlate MagazineMay 24, 2017 Wednesday 10:31 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive Company, LLC. All Rights ReservedSection: FUTURE TENSE; TechnologyLength: 828 wordsByline: Ian Prasad PhilbrickHighlight: China's Best Go Player Lost a Game to an A.I. The Chinese Government Censored It.BodyThere are trends, and then there are symbols: narrative inflection points that speak volumes. Tuesday became one of the latter when an A.I. called AlphaGo defeated Chinese national Ke Jie, the world's top-ranked player in the ancient Chinese strategy game Go. The program narrowly bested Ke in the first of a series of engagements that lasts until Saturday. Held in Wuzhen, China, the matches are taking place under Google's auspices as part of a conference called the Future of Go Summit.But the man-vs.-machine battle was barred from view in China. As China Digital Timesreported Wednesday, the Chinese government issued censorship reports decreeing that "this match may not be broadcast live in any form and without exception, including text commentary, photography, video streams, self-media accounts and so on. No website (including sports and technology channels) or desktop or mobile apps may issue news alerts or push notifications about the course or result of the match."Why was China so bearish on Ke's chances? One answer is self-esteem. As the Guardian's Alex Hern reported Wednesday, all signs point to the government's fears that its 19-year-old world champion losing on his home turf "would hurt the national pride of a state which holds Go close to its heart." Hong Kong-based New York Times technology reporter Paul Mozur            articulated another possibility: envy. AlphaGo is a product of DeepMind Technologies, a London-based startup founded in 2010. Four years later, Google-based, of course, in the United States' Silicon Valley-bought DeepMind            for a reported $625 million. AlphaGo's "victory took place in China, a rising power in the field of artificial intelligence that is increasingly seen as a rival to the United States," Mozur wrote.But defeating Ke was hardly AlphaGo's first rodeo. In February 2015, acover article in the science journal co-written by DeepMind's co-founder, Demis Hassabis, announced that the company's A.I. algorithm, christened the Deep-Q Network, had managed to "achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games"            including Atari's . Less than a year later, a second Nature article touted an even greater milestone: DeepMind's technology, now branded AlphaGo, had both mastered Go and defeated its thrice-over European champion, France's Fan Hui, five games to zero in a secret matchup months earlier-the            first time an A.I. machine had ever done so without assistance.Go, today played across China, Japan, and Korea, dates from at least the 6. The game is dizzyingly complex with more possible positions for the black-and-white game pieces-called stones-than there are atoms in the known universe. (           Seriously.) "AlphaGo plays in a very human style, because it's learned in a human way and then got stronger and stronger by playing, just as you or I would do," Hassabis, himself a former chess prodigy,            told the  last year.And AlphaGo didn't stop there. In March 2016, it faced off against Lee Sedol, an internationally ranked Go player from South Korea. Although experts (including Lee himself) were            bullish on a human win, AlphaGo dispatched the grandmaster with relative ease. Then, over a period of several days culminating in early January, AlphaGo            defeated scores of international Go experts in 60 anonymous online games.Expectations ran high ahead of Tuesday's match against Ke. As Quartz's Zheping Huang phrased the stakes on Tuesday, "the 19-year-old reigning top-ranked player is fighting against complete machine dominance over what is possibly the world's most complex board game." After AlphaGo's January online spree, Ke boasted on Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter, that he still had "one last move" in mind to compete with the A.I.'s exploits. He lost his first showdown against AlphaGo by a slim half-point.The program's victorious tear may have also cost it that human style of play Hassabis raved about. After his defeat, Ke noted, "Last year, it was still quite human-like when it played. But this year, it became like a god of Go." The Future of Go exhibition matches will also see AlphaGo partner up with a flesh-and-blood sidekick to take on two human players simultaneously and attempt to hold its own against five Go masters working together to unseat the A.I. kingpin, the Verge reported Monday. Ke still has two more chances to defend humanity's honor from the encroaching A.I. juggernaut.After Lee's loss, former Jeopardy! champion Ken Jennings-who famously lost to IBM's Watson A.I. in 2011-wrote in Slate, "in a very real way, your opponent isn't just a room full of servers or a few thousand lines of code. It's the Future, the possibility that your own individual talent, the thing that's made you special your whole life, can now be replaced by a sufficiently clever algorithm." Whether or not Ke's able to turn the tide against AlphaGo later this week, the Chinese people likely won't be watching as that future continues to bear down on us.Load-Date: May 25, 2017End of Document

China Launches New Poverty Reduction Case DatabaseTargeted News ServiceMay 26, 2017 Friday 2:18 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 453 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: BEIJING BodyThe World Bank issued the following news release:The Chinese government today launched a database of poverty-reduction cases, which aims to share innovative and successful approaches and solutions from China and other developing countries and contribute to the global fight to end poverty.The Global Poverty Reduction Online Knowledge Sharing Database works as a portal for South-South knowledge sharing. It presents cases in a user-friendly way, while also allowing users to upload cases, thereby creating a truly global poverty reduction database."There are still more than 700 million people living in poverty in the world today. Poverty reduction is a global strategy that calls for global action. Using ICT to enhance knowledge sharing is an important initiative to help reduce poverty and boost South-South cooperation. We should make good use of this platform to collect new cases and good practices from across the world, and help developing countries find solutions to poverty," said Guo Weimin, Vice Minister of the State Council Information Office.The database is part of the Global Poverty Reduction & Inclusive Growth Portal, an online platform for knowledge sharing initiated by the World Bank with support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and the private sector partners. It is managed by the China Internet Information Center and the International Poverty Reduction Center in China. A partnership has been established with more than 40 global think tanks and research institutions to contribute to the case database."China has achieved phenomenal success in reducing poverty, lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty between 1981 and 2015, the fastest rate of poverty reduction ever recorded in human history. China's experience in poverty reduction can offer useful lessons to other developing countries," said Bert Hofman, World Bank Country Director for China, Mongolia and Korea.The online case database was launched at the 2017 China Poverty Reduction International Forum held in Beijing today, which aims to share experience and discuss practical solutions to poverty. The event was jointly organized by the government, the World Bank, FAO and ADB."Invaluable poverty reduction policies and knowhow generated in China and elsewhere should be made available to the international community to help achieve Sustainable Development Goals. In that regard, the launch of the online case database is a key step forward, and innovation should be embedded in the sharing of policies and best practices," said Vincent Martin, FAO Representative in China and DPR Korea.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-5877151 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: May 27, 2017End of Document

CALIFORNIA AND CHINA TEAM UP TO PUSH FOR MILLIONS MORE ZERO-EMISSION VEHICLES NEW WORKING GROUP ESTABLISHED TO EXPAND COOPERATIONStates News ServiceJune 7, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 848 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING BodyThe following information was released by the Air Resources Board (ARB) of the California Environmental Protection Agency:Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr., California Air Resources Board Chair Mary D. Nichols and other state officials met today with China's leading automakers and battery manufacturers in an effort to expand cooperation and accelerate deployment of zero-emission cars, trucks and buses."In order to achieve California's climate goals, we need more electric cars and more hydrogen fuel cell cars that are charged with renewable energy," said Governor Brown."California and China have both seen what unchecked emissions can do to public health, the environment and our economies," said Nichols. "Building on these shared concerns and the progress we both have made in zero-emission and battery technology, we can work as partners to bring tens of millions of the cleanest possible vehicles to market over the next decade and a half."China and California are leaders in the rapidly growing market for zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), which this year surpassed two million cars, trucks and buses worldwide. China accounts for about 40 percent of the global market while California is responsible for more than 50 percent of sales in the United States. China's production of zero-emission vehicles has skyrocketed over the past two years.Furthering that leadership, California will establish a new working group through the China-US ZEV Policy Lab at UC Davis to expand cooperation with Chinese zero-emission vehicle and battery technology companies.

California, China Team Up to Push for Millions More Zero-Emission VehiclesTargeted News ServiceJune 7, 2017 Wednesday 12:03 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 848 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: BEIJING BodyThe California Air Resources Board issued the following news release:Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr., California Air Resources Board Chair Mary D. Nichols and other state officials met today with China's leading automakers and battery manufacturers in an effort to expand cooperation and accelerate deployment of zero-emission cars, trucks and buses."In order to achieve California's climate goals, we need more electric cars and more hydrogen fuel cell cars that are charged with renewable energy," said Governor Brown."California and China have both seen what unchecked emissions can do to public health, the environment and our economies," said Nichols. "Building on these shared concerns and the progress we both have made in zero-emission and battery technology, we can work as partners to bring tens of millions of the cleanest possible vehicles to market over the next decade and a half."China and California are leaders in the rapidly growing market for zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), which this year surpassed two million cars, trucks and buses worldwide. China accounts for about 40 percent of the global market while California is responsible for more than 50 percent of sales in the United States. China's production of zero-emission vehicles has skyrocketed over the past two years.Furthering that leadership, California will establish a new working group through the China-US ZEV Policy Lab at UC Davis to expand cooperation with Chinese zero-emission vehicle and battery technology companies. The lab is a unique partnership established in 2014 between UC Davis Institute of Transportation Studies and the China Automotive Technology and Research Center (CATARC), both leaders in zero-emission technology and policy.Today's meeting included officials from Chinese automakers such as BYD, Beijing Auto Group, Great Wall, Geely, Dongfeng Xiao Kang, Yangtze Motors and a half dozen other vehicle and battery companies.

China labor activist sentenced to 4 ½ years for subversionAssociated Press InternationalJuly 7, 2017 Friday 9:47 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 350 wordsDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Veteran Chinese labor activist Liu Xiaoming has been sentenced to 4 ½ years in prison on the charge of inciting subversion of state power after he published his personal account of the bloody 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protesters, rights groups reported Friday.Liu was sentenced by a court in the southern city of Guangzhou after having already spent more than two years in detention, Amnesty International said. He was taken into custody in May 2015, five days after publishing his account of the events of 1989 on an overseas website.A Guangzhou court docket listed a sentencing hearing on the subversion charge scheduled for Friday but gave no name or other details. Calls to the court rang unanswered.The same charge was leveled against Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, who was sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2009 and is now suffering from late-stage liver cancer.Liu Xiaoming's sentencing illustrates China's determination to pursue a relentless crackdown on lawyers, rights activists and workers' advocates outside the direct control of the ruling Communist Party.Liu had been a worker at a steel mill when he travelled to Beijing to join the mass demonstrations centered on Tiananmen Square. He became a member of an independent labor federation that sprang up as part of the pro-democracy movement. He was jailed for a year following the army crackdown, in which hundreds, possibly thousands were killed.In recent years, Liu had worked on behalf of migrant workers in the industrial heartland of which Guangzhou is the center. At his trial in April 2016, prosecutors claimed he had "engaged in rumor mongering and slander against state power and socialism" by posting writings on social media sites such as WeChat, QQ groups and Telegram, according to the group China Human Rights Defenders."The Chinese government needs to stop throwing in jail those who are only trying to peacefully remember the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown and instead take responsibility for the authorities' past wrongs," William Nee, Amnesty International China researcher, said in a statement.Load-Date: July 8, 2017End of Document

CypressFirst Sends Letter to Cypress Semiconductor Stockholders; Delaware Court-Ordered Delay of Annual Meeting Gives Cypress Stockholders Chance to Review New Evidence Regarding Bingham Conflicts of InterestPR NewswireJune 5, 2017 Monday 8:30 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2766 wordsDateline: SAN JOSE, Calif., June 5, 2017 Body Camillo Martino and J. Daniel McCranie, nominees for election to the Cypress Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ: CY) Board of Directors at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholder now scheduled to be held on June 20, 2017, and T.J. Rodgers, founder and former CEO of Cypress and the Company's largest individual stockholder, (collectively "CypressFirst") today mailed a letter to Cypress stockholders providing significant additional information regarding Cypress executive chairman Ray Bingham's ongoing conflicts of interest, as well as Lead Independent Director Eric Benhamou's failure to fulfill his duty to Cypress stockholders. The Cypress Board has now admitted that Bingham has repeatedly leaked highly confidential Cypress M&A information to his partners at Canyon Bridge, a Chinese government-funded private equity firm that seeks to acquire U.S. semiconductor companies in direct competition with Cypress's M&A activity.Addressing Cypress stockholders, the CypressFirst letter states, "The simple fact is that the Board and its Lead Independent Director [Benhamou] are either unwilling or incapable of managing Bingham's conflicts. This leaves it up to you to prevent those conflicts from damaging Cypress-which you can do by voting Bingham and Benhamou off the Board."The full CypressFirst letter, urging Cypress Semiconductor stockholders to vote theGOLDproxy cardFORthe election of Dan McCranie and Camillo Martino, can be found athttp://www.CypressFirst.comor on the website of the Securities and Exchange Commission (           http://www.sec.gov). The full text of the letter is reprinted below.June 5, 2017Dear Fellow Cypress Stockholders:This will likely be our final letter to you. We are grateful for your attention to our communications. When we last wrote to you, we were just days away from the June 8 Annual Meeting. Then, on June 1, the Delaware Court of Chancery ordered Cypress to delay its Annual Meeting until at least June 19 for two reasons: first, because the Cypress Board's latest set of disclosures was mailed so late that stockholders could not review them properly by June 8; and second, because even those disclosures failed to fully inform stockholders.  To provide you with only one example, we now all know that Ray Bingham leaked highly confidential Cypress M&A information to his partners at Canyon Bridge, a Chinese government-funded private equity firm that seeks to acquire U.S. semiconductor companies in direct competition with Cypress's M&A activity. To end this conflict of interest, please elect J. Daniel McCranie and Camillo Martino to the Cypress Board by voting on yourGOLDproxy ballot.The Court-Ordered Disclosures and Annual Meeting Delay Give You a Chance to Review New EvidenceThe Cypress Board has consistently tried to keep the full truth about Ray Bingham's conflicts of interest from stockholders, starting with its original Proxy Statement that was nothing more than a list of mundane activities that completely ignored Bingham's conflicts of interest and his multiple violations of Cypress's Code of Ethics.In response, T.J. Rodgers filed a second Delaware lawsuit, which asked for a delay of the Annual Meeting until stockholders received full disclosure. The Cypress Board responded on May 18 with a First Proxy Supplement that was once again a vacuous list. Under continued legal pressure, the Cypress Board produced a Second Proxy Supplement on May 30, this time a full five pages of new and often damning facts that it had not previously disclosed. But the Cypress Board played unacceptable games with this Second Proxy Supplement, first by issuing it just minutes after a major proxy advisory firm made its recommendations without the benefit of those disclosures, and then by continuing to hold the mailing of the Second Proxy Supplement to prevent, you, the stockholders, from having time to review it prior to voting.At the June 1 hearing, Rodgers' attorneys brought these games to the attention of the Delaware Court. The Court ultimately ordered the Cypress Board to issue a Third Proxy Supplement and to delay its Annual Meeting to allow you to receive complete information. Even this final Cypress Proxy Supplement contains only the legal corrective disclosures the Court specifically required, with no reference to the inaccurate information corrected or what it all means. Fortunately, much of the story came out in open court, so we are able to provide you with significant additional information in this letter.Bingham Has Repeatedly Leaked Sensitive M&A Information to His Canyon Bridge PartnersThe Cypress Board has now admitted that Bingham has repeatedly discussed highly confidential semiconductor M&A opportunities-including the acquisition of Cypress itself-with his Canyon Bridge partners. The Board's Second Supplement states that "in August 2016, during the early stages of [Bingham]'s discussions with Canyon Bridge, Mr. Chow informed Mr. Bingham regarding a 'rumor flying around in China about possible M&A plays surrounding [Cypress].' [Bingham] said, 'Nothing happening here.'" This means that months before Bingham notified any member of the Cypress Board of his Canyon Bridge activities, he was providing confidential information on Cypress's M&A status to Chinese financiers. This nonchalant "nothing happening" comment by Cypress's executive chairman could have been very costly to Cypress stockholders.  If Mr. Bingham really cared about maximizing stockholder value, would he have told a potential suitor there was "nothing happening here"?And it gets worse. In the Second Supplement, the Cypress Board finally disclosed-after seven months-that, "on November 4, 2016, an investment bank, at the investment bank's request, presented to the Cypress Board regarding the continuing consolidation in the semiconductor industry and listed a number of companies that Cypress may want to acquire. The presentation also speculated that Canyon Bridge might be one of 30 companies that could have an interest in Cypress." What the Board did not tell you-until it came out in the Delaware Court hearing-is that in this presentation, Canyon Bridge was in fact identified "as one of the four most likely potential acquirers of Cypress out of 30 potential acquirers of Cypress." We ask: what would be Bingham's duty in the case that Canyon Bridge tried to acquire Cypress-to drive Cypress share priceupto get the best deal for Cypress stockholders, or to drive Cypress share pricedownto get a better deal for himself and his Canyon Bridge partners?The Board further disclosed in the Second Supplement that on November 15, 2016, Bingham "messaged Mr. Chow and the other prospective Canyon Bridge principals regarding potential acquisition opportunities in the semiconductor space."  Even rookie executives know that a Company's list of potential acquisition targets is top secret.  What if Mr. Bingham had disclosed the name "Broadcom IoT Division" to his Chinese partners, while Cypress was scrambling to acquire that talented group?  An unsolicited high bid, as customarily comes from Chinese firms, could have derailed that critical Cypress acquisition.  It is astounding that Cypress's Lead Independent Director, Eric Benhamou, still claims there is no conflict of interest between Mr. Bingham's two simultaneous employers.  Mr. Benhamou should be looking out for your interests, not protecting Ray Bingham and his private equity firm.Mr. Bingham also disclosed the identities of Cypress customers and acquisition targets to Canyon Bridge. The Board disclosed in the Second Supplement that "on November 22, 2016, Mr. Bingham informed Canyon Bridge that he would be visiting certain companies in China and Japan on behalf of Cypress. During his trip, Mr. Bingham talked with Cypress employees, met with Cypress customers, visited semiconductor companies of potential interest to Cypress and met with private equity investors. Before his trip,Mr. Bingham asked his colleagues at Canyon Bridge for their advice and opinions of the various companies and investors he would be meeting with." [emphasis added]Mr. Bingham has given highly confidential Cypress information to a Chinese government-backed private equity firm for his own financial benefit and in violation of his fiduciary duties to Cypress stockholders.  He is not fit to serve as a director and should be replaced. That Cypress's Board has gone to such lengths to keep this information from stockholders speaks to the severity of the problem. The inexplicable failure of Cypress's Lead Independent Director, Eric Benhamou, to do anything about this breach of confidentiality also makes him unfit to serve as a director.Cypress Applied its Code of Ethics to Mr. Bingham's Executive Assistant but Not to Mr. BinghamThe Second Supplement to the Cypress Proxy disclosed that Mr. Bingham's executive assistant at Cypress was also receiving a salary from Canyon Bridge and that Cypress asked Mr. Bingham to discontinue this practice.  The full story came out in court on June 1 when the Cypress Board disclosed that: "Cypress management asked Bingham and Canyon Bridge to discontinue this practice because of a provision in Cypress' Code of Business Conduct and Ethics governing simultaneous employment of a Cypress employee." The Board has applied a double standard by not allowingMr. Bingham's executive assistant to be simultaneously employed by Canyon Bridge due to the Code of Ethics, while Mr. Bingham himself violates the Code and enjoys a second paycheck from Canyon Bridge.  In addition, by applying a double standard in this conflicted situation, the Cypress Board now employs an executive assistant who spends much of her time doing work for Cypress-competitor Canyon Bridge!The Oracle Board Removed Ray Bingham Because of His Canyon Bridge AffiliationRay Bingham was the Lead Independent Director and a member of the Board of Directors of Oracle for 14 years. But Bingham showed where his loyalties lie in March 2017, when Oracle forced him to choose between Oracle and Canyon Bridge. Oracle did not want to be connected with a private equity fund with direct ties to the People's Republic of China. Bingham, Benhamou and the Cypress Board never informed stockholders about Bingham's departure from Oracle. The Oracle Board protected its stockholders from public embarrassment, while the Cypress Board chose to try to protect a director whose loyalties to Cypress are as weak as were his loyalties to Oracle.Bingham is a Lame Duck Who Should Leave NowThe Cypress Board claims that Mr. Bingham is essential to the success of "Cypress 3.0." Yet, that same Board has never informed you that Bingham already has one foot out the door. We now know that Bingham intends to leave Cypress and join Canyon Bridge full-time once his term as executive chairman is over no later than the end of 2017, according to a Cypress statement. Why would the Board recommend the re-election of a conflicted, non-technical, lame duck over the CypressFirst board nominees J. Daniel McCranie and Camillo Martino? In addition to their impeccable ethics records and having held between them three semiconductor CEO positions and 12 directorships, both Dan and Camillo wereapplications engineersduring their early careers, selling not just chips, but full system solutions to customers-practicing the theory underlying Cypress 3.0, which they can support much better than any current Cypress Board member.Stockholders would be justified in thinking that, given Mr. Bingham's persistent quest for self-enrichment, he may be waging this proxy contest so that he can remain executive chairman long enough to vest the full three years of the $4.5 million in Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) that he negotiated for his part-time position. After all, under Bingham's direction, the Cypress Board changed the Company's stock plan in 2015 so that RSUs and options would fully vest for all officers in the event of acquisition. If Cypress were to be sold to Canyon Bridge before he leaves, it would be a perfect arrangement for him. Not only would he get all $4.5 million in his Cypress RSUs, but also his Canyon Bridge $1.2 million signing bonus, an ongoing $2 million in salary, plus his "carried interest" of 20% of Canyon Bridge's profits, including those from buying Cypress.Eric Benhamou Has Failed Stockholders as Lead Independent DirectorMr. Benhamou approved the Second Proxy Supplement, which declared to stockholders that, "Mr. Bingham's dual fiduciary role would not present an inherent conflict of interest," in a statement made by the Board on November 4, 2016.  Yet, a document released by the Delaware Court shows that in reality Benhamou was worried about Bingham's conflicts. On November 7, 2016, just three days after the statement above was made, Benhamou wrote an email to another Cypress director regarding Bingham's role at Canyon Bridge in which he said, "we will still need to manage this relationship very carefully because there is bound to be some overlaps. This is ripe for conflicts [of] interest."  We ask: what benefit do stockholders get from suffering through these conflicts of interest? Whose interests is Mr. Benhamou protecting, yours or Ray Bingham's?The Cypress Board has twice congratulated itself on creating "best-in-class" conflict of interest procedures, but Mr. Benhamou has admitted that the new procedures are ineffective because they do not address M&A conversations on the Canyon Bridge side of the fence.  In other words, if Canyon Bridge identifies an acquisition target, including Cypress itself, the new conflict guidelines do not require Bingham to report those conversations to Cypress, or to recuse himself.  The simple fact is that the Board and its Lead Independent Director are either unwilling or incapable of managing Bingham's conflicts. This leaves it up to you to prevent those conflicts from damaging Cypress-which you can do by voting Bingham and Benhamou off the Board.Leading Independent Proxy Advisors All Recognize the Need for Change on the Cypress BoardGlass Lewis called Cypress's situation "dubious" [emphasis added]:"What we do believe the current campaign centers on isMr. Bingham's dubious approach to informing the board of a clear conflict, as well as the board's subsequently dubious effort to manage and disclose that conflict to ordinary investors. Based on available disclosure, as well as the board's curiously ardent view that no actual conflict exists, despite a wealth of information to the contrary,we believe theelection of two independent, qualified candidatesprepared to directly assist the advancement of "Cypress 3.0"...represents a superior outcome."ISS faulted Benhamou [emphasis added]:Eric Benhamou "appears to bear direct responsibility for the board's suboptimal response to certain issues raised by [CypressFirst], as well as for the company's prolonged underperformance..." and "...it appears that Benhamou, as the lead independent director and longest tenured member of the board, could have done a better job overseeing the board's response to the issues raised by [CypressFirst]."Egan-Jones labeled the Cypress Board "extremely problematic" [emphasis added]:"We are compelled to recommend a vote FOR the CypressFirst nominees because of our beliefthe Company needs an urgent correction of what appears to be an extremely problematic Board. [Bingham]'s position as Executive Chairman, while simultaneously serving as one of the owners of Canyon Bridge, in our view, does not only manifest a clear conflict of interest, but alsoa deprivation of the shareholders in their right to have a Board and management with integrity and credibility."Cypress stockholders deserve better than Ray Bingham and Eric Benhamou. The only way you can end the governance crisis at Cypress is by voting TODAY on the GOLD proxy card FOR the election of highly qualified candidates Dan McCranie and Camillo Martino. If you agree with the independent proxy advisory firms that change is needed on the Cypress Board, you shouldNOTvote on the Board's White proxy card because it will ensure the re-election of both these unfit directors. Only by voting the GOLD proxy card, can you ensure Board change.Sincerely,/s/ J. Daniel McCranie                   /s/ Camillo Martino                        /s/ T.J. Rodgers   J.

Trump and Xi Jinping have a surprising amount in commonCNN.comApril 5, 2017 Wednesday 2:15 AM ESTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: OPINIONSLength: 944 wordsByline: By Michel HockxBodyIt is tempting to think of Trump and Xi as opposites -- in tweets, trade and otherwise -- but whatever divides these two men, what they share in common is both surprising and instructive: mistrust of the media, a longing to restore a nation's lost glory and conservative social views.They also share a Zodiac sign. Trump's birthday is June 14 and Xi's is June 15, making them Geminis, or "twins."So what twinning might we see in the leadership constellation when the two leaders meet later this week in Mar-a-Lago, and perhaps in the years to come?Mistrust of the media: When they meet in a casual setting in Florida, both men can perhaps strike up a conversation about "fake news" on the internet and how they feel it affects them and their countries. Given Trump's position, we are not likely to hear the US President express concern about limited press freedom in China. Xi's policies to prevent "spreading rumors" on the internet have been in place for several years already and, similar to Trump's tweets on the "dishonest" media, they seem to target any negative portrayals of government actions.Restoring a nation's glory: Many Western leaders share the Chinese government's desire to control the internet for the sake of national security. In an age of modern terrorism, governments want to be able to track militants across social media platforms, which often means compromising citizens' privacy. Western and Chinese leaders differ in how they implement this control, but it is a difference of degree, not of principle.Xi and Trump have both placed national security and national development at the top of their agendas, to the extent that Xi's main stated policy aim, "the Great Revival of the Chinese Nation," directly echoes Trump's promise to "make America great again."Xi has promised that this revival will be completed by the year 2049, the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic. Also referred to as "the Chinese Dream," this policy is all about China regaining its status as one of the world's wealthiest and most powerful nations and definitively erasing the negative memories of the country's treatment at the hands of Western imperialists from the mid-19th century onward. The policy is meant to inspire national pride and patriotism, and the kind of confident pose toward the outside world that Trump also tries to adopt, whether it's through executive orders or prolonged handshakes.Cultural and social conservatism: Xi's policies are similar to Trump's, not only in their appeal to a patriotic spirit and the revival of a glorious past, but also in their reliance on social and cultural conservatism. Trump has taken up conservative positions on a range of social issues, most notably abortion. He has also criticized those taking progressive positions, especially the media, for being un-American.For Trump and his followers, restoring America's greatness goes hand-in-hand with restoring traditional values. Under Xi, much state funding has been allocated to policies aimed at restoring traditional Confucian values in Chinese society -- an attempt to counterbalance the impact of globalization.Communist Party cadre training schools now devote as much of their curriculum to the study of Confucius as they do to the study of Marx. State propaganda across all media praises traditional Confucian virtues, most of which revolve around the notion of harmonious acceptance of predetermined, unchangeable hierarchies. Here, Marx and his emphasis on struggle and conflict has been left far behind.Generally speaking, Chinese people are more comfortable with Confucian than with Marxist values, and a return to "strong family values" lightens the burden on Xi's budget, since much of the cost of child care and elder care is borne directly by families.The policy especially emphasizes the Confucian concept of "filial piety," stressing children's responsibility to care for their aging parents, an expedient economic move given China's rapidly aging population. Despite the abolition of the one child policy, the replacement fertility rate is only 1.6, well below the 2.0 rate needed to replace each generation with an equally large new one.Conservative gender policy: But both leaders' conservatism isn't limited to the family structure; it extends to gender issues as well. Unlike his US presidential counterpart, whose denigrating remarks about women were widely aired and discussed throughout the presidential campaign, Xi has not been accused of disrespect toward women or misogyny. However, the cultural conservatism of his policies has had a negative effect on the status of women in Chinese society.The harmonious acceptance of predetermined hierarchies in Confucianism clearly favors men over women and husbands over wives, and this, too, has been a major about-turn in comparison with the Marxist past. Women's participation in the workforce in China has gone down from nearly 80% to 64%, although this is still higher than in most Western countries, including the US at 56%.The gender pay gap is also huge, according to figures from Catalyst, with Chinese women on average earning only 65% of what men earn for the same work. The US figure is slightly better at 77%.And an especially noticeable Chinese trend in recent years has been to discourage women from pursuing higher education, since 50% of higher-educated women are currently unmarried.To what extent the shared social and cultural attitudes of these "twins" will help them to find common ground remains to be seen. But we can expect Trump to visit China within the year, and hence the likely lifting, temporary or otherwise, of the Chinese ban on Twitter.Load-Date: April 7, 2017End of Document

Mainland China Semiconductor and Equipment Markets Report 2017 - Research and MarketsPR NewswireMay 29, 2017 Monday 8:00 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 449 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, May 29, 2017 BodyResearch and Marketshas announced the addition of the"Mainland China'S Semiconductor and Equipment Markets: A Complete Analysis of the Technical, Economic, and Political Issues"report to their offering.This report analyzes Mainland China's semiconductor and equipment industries, examining the technical, economic, and political issues that are shaping this nascent industry.China is by far the largest consumer of semiconductors; it accounts for about 45 percent of the worldwide demand for chips, used both in China and for exports. But more than 90 percent of its consumption relies on imported integrated circuits. Integrated-circuit companies in China entered the semiconductor market late - some two decades after the rest of the world - and have been playing catch-up ever since in an industry in which success depends on scale and learning efficiencies.The Chinese government made several attempts to build a local semiconductor industry, but none really took hold. Now, however, things are changing on both the business and policy fronts.Mainland China represents a huge opportunity for semiconductor manufacturers and equipment and materials suppliers. Massive investments in China's semiconductor industry is paying off as internal production is making inroads on demand. The emerging semiconductor market will exhibit growth far in excess of any other country.Key Topics Covered:Chapter 1 IntroductionChapter 2 Semiconductor IndustryChapter 3 Market AnalysisChapter 4 High-Tech SectorsChapter 5 High Technology Industry Development ZonesChapter 6 Economic Statistics And AnalysisChapter 7 Domestic Private Sector IssuesChapter 8 Foreign InvestmentChapter 9 Political IssuesCompanies Mentioned- Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing (ASMC)- China Resources Microelectronics Ltd- Fairchild Semiconductor- Grace Semiconductor Manufacturing- Hangzhou Youwang Electronics- He Jian Technology- Huayue Microelectronics- Intel- Ningbo BYD Semiconductor- SIM-BCD- SK Hynix- Semiconductor Manufacturing Int'l (SMIC)- Shanghai Belling- TSMC- Toshiba Semiconductor (Wuxi)- Wuxi China Resources Huajing MicroelectronicsFor more information about this report visithttp://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/869ztn/mainland_chinasMedia Contact:Laura Wood, Senior Managerpress@researchandmarkets.com For E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900U.S. Fax: 646-607-1907Fax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mainland-china-semiconductor-and-equipment-markets-report-2017---research-and-markets-300464492.htmlSOURCE Research and MarketsLoad-Date: May 30, 2017End of Document

Element 1 Corp Signs Equipment Supply Agreement with Synergy; Hydrogen Refuelling Stations for Fuel-Cell Buses in ChinaBusiness WireJuly 31, 2017 Monday 12:00 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business Editors; Energy EditorsLength: 569 wordsDateline: BEND, Ore. BodyElement 1 Corp (dba e1), a leading developer of hydrogen generation technology, is pleased to announce it has signed an agreement with Guangdong Nation - Synergy Power Technologies Co., LTD. (Synergy), Guangdong Province, China, to deliver a 100-kg-per-day hydrogen generator this year. The hydrogen generator, based on e1's patented technology, converts a mixture of methanol and water to high-purity hydrogen. Together, e1 and Synergy are targeting hydrogen refueling stations to support the rollout of fuel-cell buses.The collaboration with Synergy is expected to result in commercial hydrogen fueling stations ranging in capacity from 100 kg to 1,000 kg per day. The successful delivery of the first hydrogen generator is expected to lead to a license agreement between e1 and Synergy.Last November 8th, 2016, the Chinese government announced its commitment to facilitate the adoption of clean energy technology with plans to support the building of hydrogen infrastructure to support 1 million zero-emission vehicles by 2030. The China Hydrogen Infrastructure Development plan provides a clear hydrogen-growth roadmap and targets, and will require China to build at least 300 hydrogen refueling stations by 2025 and more than 1,000 by 2030.With fuel-cell buses already on the road in Southern China, Synergy is a leading player in China's ambitious plan to address environmental concerns with adoption of clean-energy urban transportation. Previously, Synergy licensed fuel cell manufacturing rights from Ballard Power Systems, and is poised to begin mass production of fuel-cell buses in the city of Yunfu, Guangdong Province. Presently, there are only five hydrogen stations in China, centered around Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.Element 1 is a leading supplier of economical hydrogen generators that are significantly less expensive to own and operate compared to electrolyzers. In addition, the e1 hydrogen generators overcome certain regulatory restrictions limiting bulk hydrogen deliveries.Dr. Dave Edlund, Chairman and CEO of Element 1 Corp, said, "Fuel cells have become a very important component of China's five-year plan to invest in clean energy, with Synergy playing a leading role in fulfilling the vision of China's Hydrogen Economy. With e1's proven hydrogen generation technologies, we are dedicated to help the country realize the scale-up and commercialization of hydrogen energy, and are very excited to collaborate with Synergy on this project." Dr. Edlund concluded, "This announcement follows e1's May announcement of a joint venture to commercialize fuel cell systems for China's telecom market, and further illustrates e1's commitment to China and their rapidly growing hydrogen economy."Element 1 Corp:Element 1 designs and develops novel processes to enable commercialization of clean-energy and alternative-energy technology. Through licensing our IP to strategic partners, our mission is to significantly reduce barriers to the adoption of fuel cells for a range of applications, and to reduce the waste and pollution associated with flaring natural gas.

But more than 90 percent of its consumption relies on imported integrated circuits. Integrated-circuit companies in China entered the semiconductor market late - some two decades after the rest of the world - and have been playing catch-up ever since in an industry in which success depends on scale and learning efficiencies.The Chinese government made several attempts to build a local semiconductor industry, but none really took hold. Now, however, things are changing on both the business and policy fronts.Mainland China represents a huge opportunity for semiconductor manufacturers and equipment and materials suppliers. Massive investments in China's semiconductor industry is paying off as internal production is making inroads on demand. The emerging semiconductor market will exhibit growth far in excess of any other country.Key Topics Covered:Chapter 1 IntroductionChapter 2 Semiconductor IndustryChapter 3 Market AnalysisChapter 4 High-Tech SectorsChapter 5 High Technology Industry Development ZonesChapter 6 Economic Statistics And AnalysisChapter 7 Domestic Private Sector IssuesChapter 8 Foreign InvestmentChapter 9 Political IssuesCompanies Mentioned- Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing (ASMC)- China Resources Microelectronics Ltd- Fairchild Semiconductor- Grace Semiconductor Manufacturing- Hangzhou Youwang Electronics- He Jian Technology- Huayue Microelectronics- Intel- Ningbo BYD Semiconductor- SIM-BCD- SK Hynix- Semiconductor Manufacturing Int'l (SMIC)- Shanghai Belling- TSMC- Toshiba Semiconductor (Wuxi)- Wuxi China Resources Huajing MicroelectronicsFor more information about this report visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/pgmsxt/mainland_chinasView source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170522005951/en/CONTACT: Research and MarketsLaura Wood, Senior Managerpress@researchandmarkets.comFor E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900U.S. Fax: 646-607-1907Fax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716Related Topics: Semiconductorhttp://www.businesswire.comLoad-Date: May 23, 2017End of Document

China Releases First Self-Developed Group Standard for the VR IndustryPR NewswireApril 11, 2017 Tuesday 7:45 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 933 wordsDateline: BEIJING, April 11, 2017 BodyHTC in cooperation with the IVRA drafts the groundbreaking standard under the guidance of MIIT, further driving sustainable development in China's VR ecosystemThe first VR Summit forum for International Cooperation: Opening Up Opportunities for Mutual Progress was held in Beijing on April 6, during which a pioneering group standard developed for VR head-mounted displays (HMDs) by important actors from within China's VR industry was announced. Under the guidance of the Department of Electronic Information of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) and the Industry of Virtual Reality Alliance (IVRA), the group standard entitled "General Specifications for Virtual Reality Head-Mounted Displays" was released. This new standard will play a crucial role in regulating and steering the design, production, inspection, and testing of both tethered and mobile HMDs in the market. It is also intended to help speed up technological advancement within the field as well as the commercialization process for its products. The IVRA Committee for International Cooperation was also formally established, which is charged with strengthening ties between the China VR industry to the global market.Eleven IVRA members including the Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT), the China Electronics Standardization Institute (CESI), HTC Vive, together with other research bodies and companies participated in the drafting and formulation of the standard. Feng ZHANG, Chief Engineer of MIIT, pointed out in his opening speech for the forum that "The release of the standard is fundamental to guide the VR hardware market, which is critical to driving the healthy development of the entire VR ecosystem. China's VR ecosystem is still in its early stages thus advancement and accumulation of core technologies and best practices are highly needed."IVRA provided two rounds of opinions and feedback during the process, and a total of 107 proposals were received. Of them, 29 were adopted directly while an additional 56 were approved after revisions were made. Indicators for other parameters were further refined according to the input of MIIT before the standard was eventually finalized and released. The parameters of the group standard included important factors that will affect user experience such as display resolution, system latency, field of view, tracking system, etc. The standard formulation committee started collecting suggestions and proposals from an extensive range of IVRA members since July 2016, and a large number of committee discussions and review sessions were held to formalize the released standard.Ning LIN, Party Secretary of the China Electronics Standardization Institute (CESI), said, "This standard provides an official designation to the definition of parameters, performance indices, and the measurement methods for three types of HMDs - tethered, all-in-one, and container-based. It will contribute enormously to helping regulate and guide the design, production, inspection, and testing for various types of VR HMDs.""As an industry leader in both China's VR industry and globally, we are honored to have been invited to play an integral role in the development of this VR standard," said Alvin W. Graylin, China Regional President of HTC Vive and Vice-Chairman of IVRA. "China is the first country to implement an official VR industry standard, showing how important the development of VR is to the Chinese government. The release of this standard will raise the quality bar for VR device vendors, provide more standardized specifications for content developers and ensure that end users will have a more consistently positive experience across VR devices."Detailed specifications for the Group Standard for the VR HMD will be available soon athttp://www.cesi.cn/.About the VIVE Virtual Reality SystemVive is a first-of-its-kind virtual reality system to deliver on the promise of high-quality VR developed by HTC.

The American dream: A costly endeavorThe California Aggie: University of California - DavisApril 21, 2017 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: FEATURES; Pg. 1Length: 979 wordsByline: Sahiti Vemula - features@theaggie.orgBodyMORGAN TIEU / AGGIEThe cultural, financial divide of studying in the United StatesThe American dream is an all too familiar concept. From its definition as the ideal suburban lifestyle to its deconstruction as a fallacious beacon of hope, this notion has evolved to mean different things to different people. Today, the American dream is still very much alive and endearing for many international students, but it can come at a cost - sometimes quite literally.Sergey Lyubyatinskiy, a fourth-year economics major, is an international student from Russia. Lyubyatinskiy pays for his tuition by wiring money across the seas - a process that can be quite cumbersome."In short, it's very expensive," Lyubyatinskiy said. "In Russia from this year on, they charge you 1 percent for a wire transfer. When transferring a good amount of money, 1 percent becomes a substantial amount. I take my debit card, go to a bank and withdraw money; the maximum amount of money you can withdraw at once is $800, [and] usually Bank of America only lets you withdraw three times. So after that, you just go from one ATM to another, or you spread it into a month, withdrawing like once a day."In addition to these monetary inconveniences, Lyubyatinskiy experienced a culture shock to which other international students can relate. He had to grapple with the transition from being surrounded by fellow Russians to not interacting with anyone with a similar background."Because I want to learn English, I tried to sort of guard myself away from [other Russians]," Lyubyatinskiy said. "From a learning perspective, it was definitely a good thing. You get rid of accent and everything [...] but sometimes you just miss your culture. I just sometimes want to speak Russian to someone. Locals don't really understand sayings that international [students] may have."This estrangement from a familiar culture, in addition to the financial burden of attending school out of one's home country, can cause some international students immense stress. Lyubyatinskiy's feelings of frustration in terms of financing a college education also resonate with Shambhavi Gupta, an international student from India."The tough part comes after you get in," said Gupta, a first-year economics and international relations double major. "You have to check if you have a medical insurance that matches with the college or not, and you don't want to miss any deadlines or fees. I don't get why international students - or for that matter any out-of-state students - have to pay so much tuition. We still have to buy books. We still have to pay for everything else. Then what are we paying extra tuition fees, $60,000 a year, for?"Gupta also found it stressful to convert the cost of an item between dollars and Indian currency. With the current exchange rate of 1 dollar to 64 rupees in mind, Gupta feels guilty and stressed when she thinks about her living expenses here in terms of rupees."If you're buying anything and you start converting, it's going to mess you up," Gupta said.  Regardless of the financial hoops they are forced to jump through, there are still many international students who continue to value studying at an American institution for a wide variety of reasons. These incentives range from economic opportunity in America to escaping government oppression in their native countries.Cunqiu Shao, a first-year psychology major, is an international student from China. She believes that America has served as her escape from China's administration. She has found that people in China considered "beautiful" often have easier avenues to making money, whereas earning money through merit, such as academic pursuit, is a much more difficult endeavor."If you are beautiful [in China] you can make money very easily," Shao said. "Using the Weibo app you just need to show the audience what you do everyday and the audience will send you gifts, and the gifts mean money."According to Shao, depending on where one lives in China, their potential economic growth is almost predetermined. With the same amount of hard work, someone in the bigger cities such as Shanghai, Beijing or Hong Kong can rapidly make progress, whereas someone in other smaller areas will not be able to see such success."I live in a not very big city in China," Shao said. "It's near Shanghai, but the price of a house [is worth more] in Shanghai. My mom thinks she did pretty hard work but she doesn't gain the money she wants to. She thinks it's unfair, [and that] I need to come to America."The Chinese government has a very tight grip on its people, closely monitoring their actions and controlling what media and news outlets say. This makes transferring money for student tuitions all the more difficult."The Chinese government asks people not to transfer lots of money from yen to dollars, because they think the economy of China is not very good," Shao said. "The government doesn't want us to take our money to America. My mother needs to change money from yen to dollars to give me the tuition, but the bank thinks it's a large number of dollars, so they will doubt the use of this money."There is a cap on the amount of money one can exchange or transfer, an amount that is insufficient for student expenses. In order to pay for her tuition, Shao's mother, father and grandparents all pitch in to transfer enough money.In addition to all these stresses international students deal with, the Trump administration has created further anxiety in some."Trump will decrease the number of H1B's - it's like the F1 Visa, so lots of international students, especially from China, cannot immigrate to America" Shao said. "The [Chinese international students] here are confused and worried. If Trump stays president, I think the number of opportunities will decrease for international students."Written by: Sahiti Vemula -features@theaggie.orgLoad-Date: April 21, 2017End of Document

Senators ask Trump to press China on steelDuluth News-Tribune (Minnesota)April 5, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 Duluth News-TribuneDistributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWSLength: 570 wordsByline: John Myers, Duluth News TribuneBodyApril 05--Eight U.S. senators representing steel and iron ore producing states on Wednesday called on President Donald Trump to press Chinese officials on illegal steel dumping when leaders of the two nations meet this week.The senators say government-subsidized Chinese steel has been dumped into the U.S. market in recent years below cost, hurting the domestic steel industry and the iron ore industry that feeds it.Trump is set to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in Florida on Thursday.The senators -- all Democrats, including Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken of Minnesota, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters of Michigan, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania -- called on Trump to raise the steel issue directly with the Chinese president.Klobuchar asked the President to continue strong enforcement of U.S. trade laws and to work with President Xi to stop China from unfairly subsidizing their domestic industries and reduce their overcapacity."You have consistently reaffirmed your commitment to supporting steelworker jobs, and Chinese steel dumping is a major contributor to American manufacturing job loss. As senators from leading steel and iron ore producing states, we have seen firsthand how this steel dumping has displaced American steelworkers," the senators wrote to Trump. "We hope that you will continue to strongly enforce our trade laws. In addition to building on the progress that has been made thus far, we respectfully urge you to make it clear to President Xi that Chinese steel dumping and illegal trade practices are unacceptable."China produces half of the world's steel supply and the senators claim that production is heavily subsidized.Moreover, the senators said a recent lawsuit filed against Chinese steel producers also raises more disturbing allegations such as illegal conspiracy to fix prices and control output and export volumes; the theft of trade secrets by industrial espionage; and the circumvention of hard-won duties ordered by the International Trade Commission and Department of Commerce by false labeling and transshipment."The impact of Chinese steel produced with these unfair methods of competition and other illegal practices has profoundly harmful impacts on our national economic health and our nation's national security interests," the letter noted. "We desperately need stronger enforcement against foreign competitors who cheat by dumping subsidized goods into the U.S. market."Domestic industries have filed a series of antidumping and countervailing duty cases with the United States International Trade Commission, resulting in tariffs as high as 522 percent against foreign steel companies. The Department of Commerce has significantly increased enforcement action against companies who break our trade laws. Currently, the Departments of Commerce and Homeland Security are enforcing 149 antidumping orders against foreign steel companies.Those efforts started under the Obama administration have been credited with a recent resurgence in U.S. steel production and increased production and employment at Minnesota taconite iron ore operations, most of which are back to full capacity after struggling in 2015 and 2016.___ (c)2017 the Duluth News Tribune (Duluth, Minn.)

Donald Trump, Xi Jinping arrive in Florida for summit meetThe Lion's Pride: Saint Leo UniversityApril 8, 2017 SaturdayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: PEOPLE; Pg. 1Length: 727 wordsByline: Lydia WallaceBodyChina, which alongside Russian Federation has repeatedly opposed United Nations resolutions against beleaguered Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.Shi says China wanted the summit because it was alarmed by Trump's campaign rhetoric, when he talked tough on China."China can be part of a new strategy to end North Korea's reckless behavior and ensure security, stability and economic prosperity in Northeast Asia", Tillerson said, according to the Washington Post.Gary Locke, former US ambassador to China, said, "He's not as cooperative and communicative as his father or grandfather".Trump made the decision to strike an airfield Syrian aircraft used to launch a chemical attack shortly before his dinner with Xi.If you examine the trade deficit between US and China, now at $347 billion, you'll see that it has remained stable as a percentage of gross national product in recent years. He also frequently disparaged global trade deals, and vowed to reevaluate such agreements.While he would not say what he wants China to do specifically, he suggested there was a link between "terrible" trade agreements the USA has made with China and Pyongyang's provocations and said the two issues "really do mix".The news of the United States strike on Syria appeared to be downplayed in Chinese news coverage, which led with the summit. But back home, policies undercut the rhetoric.Trade is one of the biggest hot-button issues, given Trump's charges in his presidential campaign that Chinese trade practices were killing USA jobs and his vow to impose 45 percent tariffs on Chinese imports. "And at the same time, in China, they're literally criminalizing VPNs to access Internet servers that are not based in China. But they also have a lot of personal reasons no to do so". But we have to do better because our deficit with China, as you know - $504 billion - that's a year. He says the two issues "really do mix".Last week, the president predicted in a tweet that his meeting with Mr Xi would be "very difficult". "But he can't tell them how to solve it". As China's role in the world economy continues to increase, it should play a bigger role in stabilizing economies, first in the Pacific Rim countries and then throughout the world. Climate change is another.However, Richardson pointed out that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is unpredictable, has nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, and doesn't seem interested in having a dialogue.And Trump talked about this with reporters on Air Force One when he was asked if the USA should try to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.In other areas, Trump administration policies have given China opportunities it may be incapable of seizing.The Chinese government recently canceled construction of more than 100 coal-fired power plants and is investing at least $360 billion in green energy projects by 2020.Trump, meanwhile, has vowed to bring back mining jobs that have been lost through automation and closure of USA mines, as the country has turned to the use of cheaper natural gas. He pledged to use American steel and he's using Chinese Steel.On the domestic political front, Xi is heading into a critical year. "It feels like it doesn't have to answer to anyone".Trump has threatened time and time again to challenge the current relationship the United States has with China, underscoring an "America First" approach to manufacturing and trading, one that he has repeatedly emphasized in speeches and on Twitter.The U.S. would also like the Chinese to minimize trade barriers. "This has substantially, though indirectly, strengthened the Communist Party's power in China". Speaking with Fox News in 2015, Trump balked at the idea of luxe state dinner in light of China's currency manipulation tactics, instead saying if he were president he'd serve the Chinese leader a double Big Mac."I would not be throwing him a dinner"."It is going to be very interesting".Instead, the effort will be led by oil magnate Rex Tillerson, sans staff, and son-in-law Jared Kushner."China has no other choice", he says.Just days before the meetings, a bipartisan group of 26 US senators sent a joint letter urging Trump to use the summit with Xi to bring an end to Beijing's retaliatory measures in an attempt to pressure Seoul to scrap the decision to have a THAAD battery. -China relations have faced a rather unsafe situation.Load-Date: April 8, 2017End of Document

Alibaba comes to Detroit in bid to woo U.S. businessesUSA TODAYJune 21, 2017 WednesdayFINAL EDITIONCopyright 2017 Gannett Company, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: MONEY; Pg. 3BLength: 616 wordsByline: Elizabeth Weise, and J.C. Reindl, USA TODAY NetworkBodyChinese online sales giant Alibaba is in Detroit this week working to convince American small businesses that China is a market for them -- and that Alibaba can create 1 million jobs in the U.S. over the next five years.The company's Gateway '17 conference is something between a rally, a training session and an old-fashioned variety show.One highlight was a keynote by Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma, a man with rock star status in his home country but someone who isn't a household name here. The company says it expects 3,000 entrepreneurs and business owners from across the U.S. to attend.The event has political overtones, as President Trump has made much of the trade imbalance between the United States and China. During his campaign, Trump called out China as a currency manipulator because of its past efforts to drive down the value of the renminbi to gain a trade advantage. He has since backed off that accusation.Despite a recent turning away from the idea of globalization on the international stage, U.S. small businesses are still eager to get their products out to the world. Cross-border shopping is a promising area of growth for online retailers, and Alibaba aims to provide the knowledge and tools necessary to make it  simple."For U.S. merchants, a lot of that cross-border traffic is being driven by online shoppers in China. And Alibaba, having both a marketplace and a cross-border offering for non-Chinese merchants, is hoping to be those merchants' gateway to e-commerce in China," said Lily Varon, a business strategy analyst with Forrester.Alibaba has been struggling to get a foothold in the U.S. market. In 2014 it opened 11 Main, a boutique online site, but quietly closed it a year later.While Alibaba is omnipresent in China and across Asia, it's little known here. It acts as an online sales platform, but unlike the Amazon model Americans are familiar with, it doesn't sell directly to consumers. Instead, it operates marketplaces that connect buyers and sellers. It's hugely popular with Chinese consumers and has 443 million customers there.But Alibaba is more than simply a place to buy things. It's also a payment system, a chatting platform and a place to play games. Given its outsized footprint and the time Chinese consumers spend on it, Alibaba has deep insight into the things consumers there want -- and a lot of them come from America.China represents a potentially enormous market for U.S.-produced food, cosmetics, vitamins and other items. Chinese consumers don't trust the safety and wholesomeness of Chinese-grown foods and Chinese-made beauty products, and they're especially worried about anything that touches their or their children's skin. In China, American food and products have a very high reputation.The devil will be in the details, according to Christopher Balding, an economics professor at Peking University's HSBC Business School in Shenzhen, China."China simply does not have a professionalized regulatory agency like the FDA with clear standards. The FDA operates overseas offices for companies in major markets that wish to get certified to export to the US. China does not have a remotely comparable degree of professionalization that would allow a predictable process to get products approved," he said.The numbers Alibaba is quoting, creating 1 million jobs in the U.S. in five years, seem impossibly large to Balding because the Chinese government would be unlikely to allow it. China still has enormous protectionist tendencies across the entire range of economic and financial ministries, he said."Any large increase in imports to China, even via Alibaba, would be met with a swift crackdown."Weise reported from San Francisco Load-Date: June 21, 2017End of Document

Hong Kong marks 28 years since bloody Tiananmen crackdownAssociated Press InternationalJune 4, 2017 Sunday 2:58 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 617 wordsByline: By KELVIN CHAN, Associated PressDateline: HONG KONG BodyHONG KONG (AP) - Thousands of Hong Kongers attended a candlelight vigil on Sunday to commemorate victims of the Chinese government's 1989 brutal military crackdown on protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, while Taiwan's president called on Beijing to "face up" to the history.Hundreds if not thousands of unarmed protesters and onlookers were killed late on June 3 and the early hours of June 4, 1989, after China's communist leaders ordered the military to retake Tiananmen Square from the student-led demonstrators. Commemoration of the events, whether public or private, remains taboo in mainland China.Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen said in posts on Facebook and Twitter that 28 years ago, the actions of students and citizens who challenged the political system in China "inspired a generation."She appealed to Beijing to "face up to June 4 with an open mind" and said Taiwan was willing to share its experiences of transitioning to democracy in the late 1980s to ease the pains of such a transition in the mainland."For democracy: some are early, others are late, but we will all get there in the end," Tsai wrote on Twitter.While mainland Chinese are only dimly aware of what happened at Tiananmen Square nearly three decades ago, the subject is openly discussed in Taiwan, a self-governing island, and Hong Kong, a special Chinese region with much autonomy and legally entrenched freedom of speech and other civil rights unseen on the mainland.The annual evening vigil in Hong Kong is the only large-scale commemoration on Chinese territory of the Tiananmen bloodshed. Some 110,000 people attended on Sunday, according to organizers, while police estimated the turnout at 18,000. Last year, the numbers were 125,000 and 21,800, respectively.People held up their lit cellphones - some with pictures of candles showing on the screen - as a band played upbeat songs to rally the crowd and activists gave speeches about the importance of getting young people to attend."I don't want this part of history to become blurred," said office worker Emily Yu, 42, who attended the gathering in Victoria Park. "It was really a massacre of people. Those young people came out and did all they could for freedom and democracy but didn't achieve it."Eloise Wu, 36, who works for a nongovernmental organization, said: "We don't want to let people think we've forgotten, as if with the passing of time it's like, 'Oh, this never really happened.' No. Every year we remember."In Taiwan, dozens of people gathered at Taipei's Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall on Sunday night, observing three minutes of silence as they remembered the victims of the crackdown.In her posts, Taiwanese President Tsai also called on Beijing to allow a pro-democracy activist from Taiwan who was detained in the mainland in March to "come home." Lee Ming-che, detained on suspicion of conducting activities harming China's national security, has previously conducted online lectures on Taiwan's democratization and managed a fund for families of political prisoners in China.Relations between Beijing and Taiwan have been near an all-time low since Tsai, whose Democratic Progressive Party has advocated for Taiwan's formal independence, took over as president a year ago. Since then, Beijing has cut off contacts with Taiwan's government and discouraged mainlanders from visiting the island as tourists.The authoritarian Communist Party rulers in Beijing insist that Taiwan and the Chinese mainland are part of a single Chinese nation and have vowed to take control of the island by force if necessary.___Associated Press writer Louise Watt in Beijing and videojournalist Johnson Lai in Taipei, Taiwan, contributed to this report.Load-Date: June 5, 2017End of Document

Stories from SlateSlate MagazineJuly 31, 2017 Monday 12:11 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive Company, LLC. All Rights ReservedSection: THE SLATEST; briefingLength: 510 wordsByline: Daniel PolitiHighlight: Apple Helps Out Chinese Censors by Removing VPN Apps From StoreBodyChina's censors suddenly have a much easier job of keeping the country's residents in line now that software designed to get around the country's Internet restrictions vanished from Apple's App Store. Apple removed all "virtual private network" (VPN) apps from its store in China over the weekend, handing a big boost to Beijing's efforts to combat tools that help users get around what is known as the country's "Great Firewall." Although this is hardly the first time that China has targeted VPN providers,            it does mark the first time Apple has complied with a request to remove software made by foreign companies from its store.ExpressVPN, one of the companies affected, posted an email it received from Apple saying its app was taken down from the China App Store "because it includes content that is illegal" in that country. "We're disappointed in this development, as it represents the most drastic measure the Chinese government has taken to block the use of VPNs to date, and we are troubled to see Apple aiding China's censorship efforts," the company said in a statement. "ExpressVPN strongly condemns these measures, which threaten free speech and civil liberties."Golden Frog, another company that saw its software vanish from the App Store in China also criticized Apple for the move. "We view access to internet in China as a human rights issue, and I would expect Apple to value human rights over profits," Sunday Yokubaitis, the company's president, said. Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor, also criticized the move, writing that making it easier for Chinese censors to do their jobs "recalls corporate collaboration with the apartheid regime."Apple confirmed the removal of the apps, saying it is merely following the law. "Earlier this year China's ministry of industry and information technology announced that all developers offering VPNs must obtain a license from the government," Apple said. "We have been required to remove some VPN apps in China that do not meet the new regulations. These apps remain available in all other markets where they do business."Some, however, say Apple will face unwanted consequences at home for the way in which it seems to have so easily given in to Chinese censors. "Apple has clearly decided to put its business before the interests of the population, opposition leaders and activists," writes Mike Butcher at TechCrunch. And that suddenly means it has less power to stand up to censors elsewhere. Butcher explains:  How will Apple now argue against the Trump administration effectively, after cow-towing to China in this fashion?   When next Apple must face-off with this intransigent White House over criminality or terrorism attacks at home, any protestations they make will be empty after their capitulation in China.   There is really only one way out: Apple should have stood its ground.   ...   In sticking to its principles, Apple would have been able to hold its head high in the US and globally. It could have maintained its brand values amongst its devoted user-base around the world. Load-Date: July 31, 2017End of Document

Trump: America doesn't need Chine to solve North Korean problemMichigan Tech Lode: Michigan Tech UniversityApril 7, 2017 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 572 wordsByline: Johnathan JaehnigBodyPresident Trump has expressed confidence in America's ability to control North Korea without the aid of China days before a scheduled meeting with the Chinese president.The international community has expressed skepticism and concern over the president's willingness to alienate allies in the volatile situation. - Photo courtesy of flickrThe United States has been relying on China to help maintain the uneasy peace in Asia, as China remains one of the only nations left to maintain diplomatic ties with North Korea.While China has shown some interest in cooperation with America when it comes to North Korea, China-U.S. relations are strained as well. A recent example occurred earlier this month when the Chinese government called America's deployment of defensive missile technology an South Korea a threat to their national security. President Trump will be meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping this week at his Mar-a-lago resort, and North Korea will certainly be a topic of conversation.Ahead of the meeting Trump told an interviewer for the Financial Times that "if China is not going to solve North Korea, we will."Trump has long expressed concern over China's commitment - or lack of commitment in preventing North Korea from developing nuclear weapons, as the international community has been attempting this primarily through economic sanctions and China is North Korea's largest trade partner.China may become more reliant on trade with North Korea, however, as America continues to levy sanctions against China. Furthermore, Trump's plans to increase the cost of foreign products to spur U.S. production could make China more economically reliant on North Korea.In Trump's interview with the Financial Times he refused to elaborate on his comments, leading many to draw their own connections, including linking Trump's recent comments with those made by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who suggested that America would not be beyond launching a pre-emptive strike on North Korea.While North Korea has not yet developed nuclear weapons capable of reaching the U.S. mainland, BBC defense and diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus recently pointed out that North Korea is very capable of launching nuclear attacks on South Korea, including U.S. military bases.Other world leaders and experts have expressed varying levels of concern regarding Trump's statements.Robert Kelly, an associate professor of international relations in South Korea told the Telegraph "people are probably concerned that it is more Trump erratic posturing, empty bluster."U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May, however, has expressed approval with the United Nation's work with China and China's influence on North Korea, and has recommended maintaining the pursuit of diplomatic relations to solve the problem rather than threatening to work around certain parties.One of the only methods left open for the United Nations to control North Korea is through canceling aid, as the population of the country relies almost exclusively on food donated from other countries. Cutting this aid has not historically proven effective in coercing the leaders of North Korea into complying with regulation on their nuclear program, and it is unclear whether cutting aid further or even completely would convince the North Korean government to participate more willingly in bargaining, or whether it would lead them to hostility.Tags• International news• NewsLoad-Date: April 10, 2017End of Document

Action Alerts PLUS: Stocks Start to Recover From Recent SetbacksRealMoneyJune 4, 2017 Sunday 10:00 AM EDTCopyright 2017 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 2477 wordsByline: Jim Cramer and the AAP TeamHighlight: Trump's decision on climate accords and May jobs report present new obstacles.BodyThis commentary was excerpted from the Weekly Roundup sent to subscribers ofAction Alerts PLUS, a charitable trust co-managed by Jim Cramer and the AAP staff.            Click hereto learn about this actively traded stock portfolio.Markets were relatively subdued following last week's selloff in oil and the worst one-day drop since September the week before. Even so, stocks managed to find the strength to power higher to close out the week, pushing again toward all-time highs. Driving conversations this week were: President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement and Friday's monthly nonfarms payroll report (more below). Some lagging earnings reports also drifted through the headlines.Looking ahead, with earnings season all but complete, investors turn their focus to the Federal Reserve, which will meet in the coming weeks to decide whether to raise interest rates. While the Fed is largely expected to move on rates at this month's policy meeting, we will be keying more so on Fed Chair Janet Yellen's commentary following the FOMC's decision to get a better idea of the outlook for the economy moving forward.For this week, Treasury yields trended sideways before a rush to safety put bonds in demand on Friday following a disappointing jobs report for May. Gold also pushed higher on the report as investors attempted to decipher an uncertain economic outlook. The dollar weakened against the euro throughout the week and oil continued its decline, stemming from last week's OPEC Vienna summit.First-quarter earnings are nearly complete and have been relatively positive versus expectations, with 73.3% of companies reporting a positive EPS surprise. In the portfolio, Hewlett Packard Enterprises  reported earnings this week.HPE reported a top-line beat after Thursday's close while matching consensus on the bottom line. Total revenues of $9.9 billion were surprisingly not as pressured as expected and beat consensus expectations of roughly $9.6 billion. Adjusted EPS of $0.35, on the other hand, was in line with prior guidance of $0.33 to $0.37 and equaled consensus. Digging deeper, revenues from continuing operations -- which include Enterprise Group, Financial Services and Software (to be spun off later this year to merge with Micro Focus) -- came in at $7.4 billion, down 13% year over year due to pressures in the key EG group as well as foreign currency and divestitures headwinds. In total, revenues from continuing operations were lower by 5% year over year when excluding these headwinds.As for the broader macro, despite the shortened holiday week, we received several key economic indicators that will help frame the outlook moving forward.On Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that both personal income and spending rose 0.4% in April, in line with expectations. The rise in income came primarily because of increased private wages and salaries, while the 0.4% rise in personal spending marked the largest monthly rise since December. In addition to the April rise, spending for March was revised up to 0.3% (from a flat reading previously reported).Importantly, the PCE price index increased 0.2% month over month after falling 0.2% in March. Core PCE (which takes out food and energy to reduce month-to-month volatility) also rose 0.2% in April (following a 0.1% decline in March), beating expectations for a 0.1% rise. More importantly, on a year-over-year basis, the core PCE price index is up 1.5% (down from a 1.6% year-over-year rise in March). This measure is closely followed given that it represents the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, which comprises one portion of the Fed's dual mandate when determining the outlook for rates (the other being maximizing employment).Recall that the Fed ideally targets a 2% rate of inflation -- the core PCE has generally run below this target in recent years -- and despite some strength in prior months, investors must balance rate hike expectations this year with the declines in core PCE in March and April. Even though the month-over-month beat in core PCE is a welcome surprise, the year-over-year numbers are generally followed more closely. We will be watching the Fed policy meeting later this month to determine how recent data have affected the committee's outlook for rates moving forward.On Tuesday night, the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics reported that the Chinese manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) was 51.2 in May, beating expectations of 51.0 but flat month over month. On a year-over-year basis, the index is up 2.2%. Recall that anything over 50 represents expansion while anything below 50 indicates a contraction. The increase can be largely attributed to China's steel sector (steel PMI rose to 54.8 from 49.1 in April. according to the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing), which saw its fastest rate of growth in a year on the back of healthy infrastructure investments.Importantly, the May PMI showed the 10th consecutive month where activity levels improved from a month earlier, indicating that conditions across China's all-important industrial sector may be gradually improving after a prolonged period of weakness in 2015 and early 2016. Recall that markets sold off during this period as investors had a tough time grappling with potential headwinds facing the global economy. Although China was still growing at a fast clip, the deceleration from the government's initial expectations served as a wake-up call for investors at the time.While these fears appear to have abated for now (as evidenced by the strong economic performance of late in the country), questions still remain: According to IHS Markit, its PMI on China (released later in the week) came in at 49.6, below the 50.3 level reported in April and worse than expectations for a smaller decline to 50.1. Markit conducts an independent survey different from the official PMI, raising doubts regarding the trustworthiness of the Chinese government and the veracity of the country's internal data.Also on Tuesday night, the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry reported that industrial production rose to 103.8 (the highest level since 2008), a 4% increase from April and a 5.7% increase on a yearly basis. The reading follows a 1.9% decline in April. Despite the jump (the largest one-month gain since June 2011), the rise fell short of estimates calling for a 4.3% monthly increase and 6.1% yearly increase.Further, the ministry noted that the top three industries leading the rise were (in order): transport equipment; general-purpose production and business-oriented machinery; and electronic parts and devices. The three industries that most offset the increase were (in order): information and communication electronics equipment; pulp, paper and paper products; and petroleum and coal products. Importantly, production is likely to remain solid with demand largely driven by exports to Asia, the U.S. and Europe. With increasing protectionism movements emerging across the globe, however, reports like these from Japan and China (as well as other foreign economies) will be important to watch.On Thursday, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) reported that the May manufacturing index came in at 54.9 (as explained above, anything above 50 represents expansion while anything below 50 indicates a contraction), up marginally from April's 54.8 reading. The reading was a welcome surprise compared to expectations for a month-over-month slowdown to 54.4. Positively, May marked the 96th straight month of expansion in the overall economy and the ninth straight in the manufacturing sector.Digging deeper, of the 18 manufacturing industries covered, 15 showed growth in May. The new orders index increased 2% (indicating a faster rate of growth) month over month to 59.5, production fell 1.5% to 57.1 (indicating expansion at a slower pace), employment grew 1.5% to 53.5 (indicating a faster rate of growth) and prices plunged 8% to 60.5 (increasing at a slower pace).According to ISM Manufacturing Business Survey Committee Chair Timothy Fiore, "Comments from the panel generally reflect stable to growing business conditions, with new orders, employment and inventories of raw materials all growing in May compared to April. ...The slowing of pricing pressure, especially in basic commodities, should have a positive impact on margins and buying policies as this moderation moves up the value chain." The strong reading and positive outlook could be ammo for the Federal Reserve when it meets later this month to a) determine whether to raise interest rates and b) analyze economic prospects moving forward.Also on Thursday, the Department of Labor reported that initial jobless claims for the week ending May 27 were 248,000 (a five-week high), an increase of 13,000 claims from the prior week's revised numbers (revised up to 235,000 from 234,000 previously reported) and 9,000 claims higher than expectations. Importantly, the four-week moving average for claims (used as a gauge to offset volatility in the weekly numbers) increased by 2,500 claims from last week's revised number of 235,500 (from 235,250 previously reported). Despite the rise, the trend for the labor market continues to be strong and suggests, at least in part, that the economy has perhaps picked up momentum in the second quarter. Importantly, this week's data were not included in the survey period comprising the nonfarm payrolls report released on Friday (more below).As a reminder, the government had updated jobless claims in a prior report, going back five years, as it does annually, to consider more accurate seasonal adjustments. The updates show layoffs have remained extremely low but were a bit higher than previously reported, mostly when considering data from 2016. Claims have remained below 300,000 -- the threshold typically used to categorize a healthy jobs market -- for an astounding 90 straight weeks (compared with 117 weeks under the older seasonal-adjustment process, according to the updated data), the longest streak since 1970.On Friday, the Labor Department reported that the economy added 138,000 jobs in May, below expectations for an addition of around 184,000. Although the headline number was weaker than expected, the underlying numbers appear strong enough to support a Fed decision to raise interest rates -- the question now perhaps becomes whether the economy can sustain a pace that will warrant an additional hike in September. Fed funds futures, a tool for wagering on rate shifts, were pricing in about 94% probability for a rate hike in June, whereas expectations for a second rate hike by September sit at only 24%.Positively, the unemployment rate dipped again, to 4.3%, down from 4.4% in April (March was 4.5%). Unemployment is now at its lowest level since March 2001 -- a big accomplishment for the Fed, which tracks unemployment when making decisions regarding whether to raise interest rates. Although the lower unemployment rate is encouraging, we note that a smaller share of Americans participated in the labor force this month -- the labor force contracted sharply, with the number of Americans in the labor force falling by 429,000, suggesting that many able-bodied Americans are remaining on the sidelines despite what appears to be growing optimism within the economy.Overall, the report was certainly short of spectacular, but is likely enough ammo for the Fed to move later this month (as suggested by the CME Group's Fed watch tool). The bigger focus will now be on the longer term, questioning whether we are beyond peak employment and if the labor market can continue to carry the economy. In the immediate term, the report is unlikely to have much impact on the market, other than on financials (which are negatively impacted by declining yields), as strong earnings reports continue to fuel optimism regarding improving fundamentals for companies moving forward. You can read our full analysis of the report   .On the commodity front, oil trended lower this week after failing to break above $50 over the weekend. Recall that oil initially sold off last week following OPEC's Vienna summit. While the committee announced a nine-month extension to current production cuts (as expected), investors were disappointed, hanging onto hopes for deeper cuts and/or a longer extension. Adding to the pressure, Libya (which along with Nigeria continues to be exempt from the cuts) has recently increased oil output (back to near three-year highs) while U.S. producers continue to increase shale production.On a brighter note, according to a Reuters report published on Thursday, OPEC held discussions last week at the Vienna meeting regarding increasing production cuts by an extra 1% to 1.5%. While we must be wary of such reports given that Saudi Arabia has tended to squawk when needed (i.e., when oil prices dip into the mid-$40s), the article at least provides some hope that OPEC could revisit deeper cuts should the current extension not live up to its intended purpose.The commodity also got a boost on Thursday when the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that U.S. crude inventories fell by 6.4 million barrels last week, beating estimates for a drawdown of around 2.5 million barrels and confirming the bullish report from the American Petroleum Institute (API) the night before.Given oil's failure to break above $50 a barrel, consistent with our view that oil will trade in its established range, we would not be surprised to see oil prices drop lower into the mid-$40s in the short term. For now, we will be keeping an eye out for any news related to a potential deepening of production cuts and indications that OPEC members are complying with the enacted policy. For our view on how we intend to play the current oil volatility and how we expect it to impact our portfolio holdings, see our post from earlier in the week  .Moving on to the broader market, as we mentioned, first-quarter earnings are winding down and have been relatively positive versus expectations, with 73.3% of companies reporting a positive EPS surprise. Total first-quarter earnings growth is up roughly 14% year over year versus expectations for an overall 14.11% increase throughout the season; of the 429 non-financials that reported, earnings growth is 13.3%. Revenues are up 7.2% versus expectations throughout the season for a 7.11% increase; 73.3% of companies beat EPS expectations, 20.4% missed the mark and 6.3% were in line with consensus. On a year-over-year comparison basis, 73.28% beat the prior year's EPS results, 24.7% came up short and 2.02% were virtually in line. Information tech, health care and industrials have had the strongest performance to kick off the year versus estimates, whereas consumer staples and telecom have posted the worst results in the S&P 500.Load-Date: June 5, 2017End of Document

Good Thursday morning everybody. Thank you so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, May 4th. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Sealing the deal, it is finally feeling the deal, it is finally happening. The house is set to vote on repealing and replacing Obamacare, later today. It is a show of confidence the republicans have enough yes votes. The democrats are still railing against the process.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JIM MCGOVERN, CO-CHAIRMAN, HUNGER CAUCUS: I think the whole process and the way this is being handled is an insult to this institution. And more importantly, it's an insult to the to the American people.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: We have the very latest coming up this morning. Turning to technology, Facebook reporting proficient and revenue surge from a year earlier, driven by strength and mobility. The company is also, however, warning about slower advertising growth. The stock is under pressure this morning by a fraction, down a quarter of a percent. Broader market is higher, take a look. Dow Industrial is expected to be up about 60 points at the opening of trading this morning.NASDAQ up a third of a percent, that's 20 points higher. And in Europe, gains across the board as well, take a look at the Eurozone indices big debate last night in France ahead of the French election. FT 100 in London up a third of a percent. The CAC Quarante in France up better than one percent right now. In Asia overnight, markets were mixed. Japan was close for a holiday but the other majors as you see little movement there.A fireball in the sky, unbelievable video of a small plane crash, take a look at this. We have the very latest on this investigation. What went wrong, coming up. Then Texas approved this controversial sanctuary city legislation, the bill now heads to the governor's desk. And a massive phishing scam hits Google. What you need to know if you got an invite from Google docs, do not open it. It is a scam. Plus, May The Fourth be with you, it's Star Wars Day." How are going to celebrate the force, coming up this morning? All those stories coming up in fact.Joining us to talk about it all, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell. Former Chrysler CEO and former Home Depot CEO, Bob Nardelli with us. And Maslansky and Partners President, Lee Carter. Great to see you.LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: Great to see you.BARTIROMO: Big day.BOB NARDELLI, FORMER CEO, HOME DEPOT: A lot going on.BARTIROMO: Healthcare.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Let's see if they can move it. No. It's not easy going once it heads to the senate, but it will certainly be a legislative for the republicans.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: And the GOP needs victory.MCDOWELL: They need a victory for the American people for businesses that have been burden with all these Obamacare regulations for businesses and individuals who had been burden with all the taxes and better than it. Individuals who had been paying a lot for buying health insurance under government fiat, you name it. And like in Iowa for example. The last health insurer on the exchange is there, is poised to drop coverage. Right. So the people who -- people need the government to step in.BARTIROMO: No choice and cost are out of control.NARDELLI: This is what you do in business, your market focus, customer back. And that's what this is, Dagen, exactly what you said. Responding to the needs of the citizens of this country.BARTIROMO: We're talking about that this morning. And joining the conversation is the chairman and CEO of Strategas, Jason Trennert is with us this morning. Plus entrepreneurship on the table, nextdoor.com co- founder and CEO, Nirav Tolia is with us. Good story there next. So do stay with us for that. We want to kick it off this hour though with a showdown over healthcare, house republican leaders now say that they have the votes to repeal and replace Obamacare. Democrats however including Massachusetts Congressman Jim McGovern continue to rally against it. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MCGOVERN: I got to ask you, this process to put plum is a goddamn mess. I mean, it really is. And it -- I don't know how anyone can defend it. Fixes upon fixes, to fix the fixes, to fix the fixes, and it's going to be brought to the floor tomorrow and we're going to have a debate, and, you know, and that's how we're going to serve our constituents.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And that, of course, is minority leader Nancy Pelosi, this is what she said, she's criticizing the bill as well. She writes this in a statement. House republicans are going to tattoo this moral monstrosity to foreheads. Pelosi says her caucus plans to rally against what they call Trumpcare. Today, we want to bring in Texas Congressman who supports the current replacement bill, Brian Babin. Congress, good to see you. Thanks very much for joining us.REP. BRIAN BABIN (R), TEXAS: Good morning, Maria.BARTIROMO: So you got the votes without the democrats, you're not getting any support from the democrats.BABIN: Absolutely not, and, you know, I just heard your -- the quotes from my democratic colleagues, you know, the biggest joke is Obamacare and the American people are overwhelmingly opposed to it. And we're finally going to get our act together today and I'm confident we're going to pass it. Probably with a small margin but nevertheless, we're going to pass it and get some choice and freedom to the American people on healthcare.BARTIROMO: Do you think it resonates with the public when you see all of this obstruction? Do you think, you know, when Chuck Schumer says it's a swamp cabinet and Nancy Pelosi calls health care bill a monstrosity and you just heard McGovern say, it's a mess. Do people really believe that?BABIN: I can tell you, most of my constituents don't. I think the American people, I mean, they had an overwhelming turn and out of revolution at ballot box.BARTIROMO: Right.BABIN: And they wanted to go on a different direction. So I don't think it's registering with the American people as being truthful and out front. Elections have consequences, Maria, and they got to just get with it, Mr. Trump has got an agenda, we do too in the house and senate and we must get these things passed and if we don't get past the healthcare, we don't get on to tax reform, and reg reform and the rest of the agenda. So they have to do it today.CARTER: So, Congressman, I'm curious. I've been trying to understand exactly what's in this healthcare bill. It's really hard to find the information, Dagen did a really great job of summarizing it for us. But can you tell me the three things that you want everyone to know about this health care bill that you're proposing today?BABIN: Well, I think -- I think, probably the first thing is that we're not going to dump a whole bunch 24 million people off of health care because this is a -- simply -- just simply not true, this is not true whatsoever. We're going to give people choice, I tell you they left their own Obamacare, they don't like it and they choose to drop off, that's their business. This is -- this is what America is all about. We don't believe in -- government knows best and everything. A top-down program, like what we've seen.We're going to give choice, we're going to have health savings accounts, we're going to allow waivers for states to take up the slack and the federal government back off. So that individual states who like the Obamacare type policies in their healthcare, they can -- they can keep that. If not, like my state of Texas and several other good states, that we will have the freedom to choose what we want, tailor our policies to individuals and families and lower the premiums and the deductibles that have been just killing working class Americans now for seven years.MCDOWELL: Congressman, I'll push -- it's Dagen McDowell. I'm going to push back on what you were just saying because the democrats have gotten a big leg up on you guys and gals in the Republican Party in terms of talking repeatedly about pre-existing conditions issue. And you need to message better that people will be covered of -- for pre-existing conditions under this bill that it might be handled differently at the states want to. But again, over and over again this is a small part of the population, it is a relatively small issue but the democrats time and again hammer you guys on it.BABIN: Well, I can't argue with that. I think our messaging has -- could have been a lot better over the -- over the weeks, and months. And quite frankly I think people with pre-existing conditions are going to be fairly placed with the -- with the results of this thing. You know, the obvious thing is that Obamacare is unsatisfactory completely, has to be gotten, Maria, of, and we've got to get back to freedom and choice and that's what this thing does. Is it perfect? No, it is not. But yes, we could always message better, Dagen. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about the spending bill, this is another area where the messaging wasn't right on, congress is taking steps to avoid the government shutdown, obviously yesterday passing that $1 trillion spending bill, sir, the senate expected to quickly follow suit, both President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan held it as a victory but you voted against the spending bill. Why?BABIN: I absolutely did. I feel like that, you know, it's about 1750 pages long. We didn't get to see what was in it until Monday. And it quite frankly funds a lot of things that we campaigned against and I think the American people went to the polls and voted against these types of policies, it continues to fund Obama era policies. There are some good things in it, believe me, I'm a -- I'm a military veteran myself, I think there were some good things in there for military but it was far outweighed by the amount of money and the types of policies that is going to continue.For instance, sanctuary cities, planned parenthood, not funding wall, it does fund some fencing but it doesn't fund the wall, you know, the president and most of us in the republican conference campaigned on voter security. So, you know, with that kind of spending, I just felt like this is something I could not support, progressive type policies that we are all -- excuse me, we are all against.BARTIROMO: So what happened? I mean, the other thing is you wanted a decrease in domestic spending, you're absolutely looking at an increase in domestic spending. Did you get rolled over again by the democrats?BABIN: Well, you know what, as long as they have a filibuster rule in the United States Senate, where we have to have 60 votes, that's how -- that's -- we essentially give the veto pen to Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer with a -- with a 60-vote filibuster rule.BARTIROMO: Yes.BABIN: And unless we're doing something with reconciliation and with -- quite frankly, it's a real problem, we wouldn't have Judge Gorsuch sitting on the Supreme Court now, had we continued with the filibuster rule, so I particularly believe that that this is something that the senate is going to have to address, if we want to get a large percentage of the agenda of Donald Trump and most of us in congress through into law.BARTIROMO: And you wonder -- you said earlier elections have consequences, you wonder if the American people are going to remember all of the obstructionism going on right now. I mean, you know, I was complaining earlier in the program, the American people want business to get done.BABIN: They do.BARTIROMO: So all of this obstructionism from the left even on sanctuary cities, right? A Texas Senator approved the controversial sanctuary cities ban that would make it a crime for law enforcement to refuse cooperation with federal immigration officials. So, Governor Greg Abbott is expected to sign the measure into law, what are your thoughts, Congressman?BABIN: You know, I know Governor Abbott well, and he's a -- he's a kind conservative gentleman, a great leader in the State of the Texas and I feel certainly he will sign this law. It's necessary. You know, Texas is a conservative state but we have some sanctuary areas. Notably, the biggest is Austin, Texas and Travis County when we -- when the Homeland Security Department was releasing their name and shame list of the thousands of offenses that criminal aliens were committing in the country, the last one I say, 13 pages for Travis County Texas,And it's amazing to me that elected officials would put their own citizens at risk for political correctness, and diversity, et cetera, et cetera, and, you know, at first do this elected officials is to poll the safety and national security of our own constituents and our own country and constituencies.BARTIROMO: You are absolutely right. Yes.BABIN: That's right. So --BARTIROMO: I mean, look at MS-13, this is gang murdering people here in Long Island, Bob Nardelli, and these illegal immigrants, part of the gang.NARDELLI: Every time we have an issue like this, it just continues to justify President Trump's position on immigration, two or the three individuals that were, you know, convicted here or arrested were illegal, unregistered.BARTIROMO: Congressman, thank you so much for weighing in this morning. We appreciate it.BABIN: You bet. Good to be with you.BARTIROMO: And to you, Congressman Brian Babin joining us there. We'll take a break. When we come back, hackers go phishing for Google. The massive new scam to watch out for the next time you check your e-mail. Do not open this document. And then, May The Fourth be with you. It is Star Wars Day today. How you can get in on the celebration. We're back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Federal investigators are taking a closer look at what cause this spectacular plan crash. North of Seattle, Tuesday. Cheryl Casone with the details now. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Maria. So, the investigations focusing on the possible mechanical cause in the crash. Watch this. The small plane crashes on a busy road in Mukilteo. This crash -- it really is unbelievable. The pilot was attempting to land on the road but it clipped power lines and then struck a traffic light. A fuel leak ignited, that sent burning gas on the cars on the road. The pilot not hurt, two people on the ground did have minor injuries though.Well, let's turn to earnings this morning. Viacom quarterly results coming in better-than-expected. Thanks in part to the success of its latest movie, XXX: The Return of Xander Cage. CBS Also owns MTV, Comedy Central, and Nickelodeon, there is the stock of the premarket, down a little bit. But the earnings are pretty decent for Viacom. IAC/InterActive Corporation better than expected revenue for that company. An approved results coming from match group that helps offset, declines, and pays search. IAC also announced it was buying Angie's List earlier this week.That stock down almost three percent on the premarket. And then Fitbit is rallying in the premarket. The maker of, of course, all those fitness tracking bracelets posted better-than-expected results, good news, the stock has been kind of a -- had a rough ride over the last year. That stock up is 9 1/2 percent on the premarket.Well, another headlines for you this morning. The emission scandal has not dented Volkswagen's sales of diesel cars. The automaker resumes selling diesel in the U.S. last month and they accounted for nearly 12 percent of their April sales numbers. Volkswagen barred by U.S. authorities in 2015 from selling about 11,000 diesel golf, beetle, Passat cars, of course, after that German automaker admitted to using secret software to exceed basically break emissions testing rules here in the U.S. That scandal cost the company about 30 million in fines and settlement. Plus, this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBI-WAN KENOBI, A FICTIONAL CHARACTER IN THE STAR WARS: The force will be with you, always.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Guess what today is. Star Wars fans are celebrating today, it's May 4th, it is Star Wars Day. This started back in 2011 in Canada with the first organized Star Wars event in Disney which purchased Lucasfilm in 2012, started officially observing the holiday in 2013. They're going to be celebrating in the theme parks today, by the way, Star Wars fans are also celebrating on social media. Here's one tweet, hashtag -- wishing everyone a very happy Star Wars Day, #StarWarsDay. As always, #MayThe4thBeWithYou. Got it? May The Fourth be with you. No. I'm not trying.Anyway, there's a lot of deals today, by the way, in the stores for fans, Lego is offering a promotion, you could build your own R2-D2 game stock, has a six-inch R5-D4. And then build a bear, they already had a Star Wars Bear, Maria, but I don't think it will light favor for your bear.BARTIROMO: I like it.CASONE: There's all kinds of stock out there.BARTIROMO: A lot of celebrating. And of course the big -- the big story comes in December when actually the next version comes out.CASONE: I know. I can't wait.BARTIROMO: Yes. Thanks, Cheryl. Still ahead Obamacare on life support, the house set to vote today on the republican plan to repeal and replace the troubled legislation. Today is the day with a hard-fought win would mean to President Trump. And then easing investor anxiety on Wall Street. The markets' fear gauge is falling with stocks and bomb soaring. Take a look at the rally, should you be putting new money to work right here? Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Well, the fear gauge on Wall Street, the volatility index hitting a 10-year low on Monday, not a lot of volatility, that's why trading is under pressure. Bonds and the stock market off in lockstep. Joining us right now is the chairman and CEO of Strategus, that's Jason Trennert. Jason, good to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.JASON TRENNERT, CEO, STRATEGUS: Good to see you. Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: So much to talk about today. First off, the health care bill, today is the day, the GOP is going to vote in the house on this healthcare bill. How important is this?TRENNERT: I think it's very important to the extent to which it gives -- it will give investors some sense that the relationship between congress and the administration isn't so dysfunctional that they can't get bigger things through. As a republican frankly, I don't know why they started with healthcare. I know that that -- if I give the --BARTIROMO: You wanted them to start with tax reform.TRENNERT: I did, but I know it's from a scoring point of view, this gives them a lot more money if they were able to get this through to get big tax reform through but in my opinion, I rather had single and home runs.BARTIROMO: Right.TRENNERT: And there's a tendency to make the perfect, the enemy of the good here but all that being said, if they get the health care bill passed through the house today, I think it's a good marker for -- the amount of -- the amount of things they can get done together like around this year.BARTIROMO: So the reason that they did healthcare first is because apparently, they were saving a trillion dollars by, you know, reversing the Obamacare taxes and then trillion dollars will go towards paying for the tax cuts.TRENNERT: If I say.BARTIROMO: How important is the -- are the tax cuts and tax reform, to markets? Markets up 14 percent since Election Day. Is this a showy market at this point?TRENNERT: Not quite. I mean, the good news I think is that corporate province are going to be up about 14 percent in the first quarter.(CROSSTALK)TRENNERT: We have a republican suite portfolio that we've created and I would say also good news is that the Trump trade has largely been priced out of the market. The market is going up for reasons, that are completely unrelated to President Trump's economic agenda.BARTIROMO: It's the fundamentals.TRENNERT: It's the fundamentals. The good news is that gives you a big chance for a positive surprise later in the year and we're very much of the view that you're going to get that positive surprise that -- first of all, financial and energy deregulation is happening regardless if whether congress is on board or not, that's already happening. I also think that you are going to get even if the house has to or the administration has to scale back its expectations for tax reform and just get tax cuts, that is extremely meaningful. The 2003-2004 tax cuts in the -- in the Bush administration were enormously stimulator for economic growth.MCDOWELL: Yes.TRENNERT: So, again, I think there is a tendency -- what I'm worried about is there's so many guys in congress who shall remain nameless are, you know, they're the smartest guess in class and the dumbest guys on the bus. You know, they're missing the fact that you basically just want to put some points up on the board. The last time you had major tax reform was in the second term of President Reagan.BARTIROMO: '86.TRENNERT: Where he won 49 states. So he had an enormous amount of political capital, the president right now doesn't have that kind of capital. I would just rather see them set their sights a little bit lower. The market --BARTIROMO: Well, that's the thing, I mean, the republicans have, you know, they say their very principle. So they stick to their principles and they can't vote for something that they don't believe in. The democrats, they all get in line and, you know, they show victory even if they don't love the -- I mean, look at Obamacare, it's absolutely collapsing and they all got in line.TRENNERT: Right. The thing is, would you rather win, you know, I mean, it's, you know, driven what your time horizon. You're trying to win over the long term. I would rather just put some points up on the board.BARTIROMO: Yes. I --TRENNERT: And as supposed to giving into this baroque social engineering, even though it's conservative social engineering, it still searched my engineering the tax reform they're trying to do. As a businessman myself, I think small business companies up a lot.BARTIROMO: Yes.TRENNERT: And that's because the direction is better. People have been so -- I guess businesspeople in general, I think have been so beaten up over the past eight years that anything marginal -- marginally good I think is quite positive, so I wouldn't get too hung up on the details.BARTIROMO: You said that the fundamentals are strong, so then what's going on in the bond market because we talk a lot about what the 10-year yield is doing. We're talking about two percent, 2.3 percent or so, is that telling as a different story about fundamentals. Look at the GDP up 1.7 percent, it was horrible.TRENNERT: Yes. I -- listen, I think it is. I don't -- personally, I wouldn't run the U.S. government money at 230, given what I think about what is going to happen as far as the Trump economic agenda which I think will get through. I think nominal GDP growth will probably be more like five percent next year.BARTIROMO: Wow.TRENNERT: So three percent real and two percent plus in inflation. And I think 10-year treasury holds are going to be higher. They're also -- I would say they're also geopolitical -- there are other things going on that are affecting the bond market. I don't want to say that economic activity has been universally good, that's obviously been part of the reason why 10- year treasury yields are not as high as they once were but I also think there are other things going on that are creating a bid for treasury bonds that have nothing to do with economy.BARTIROMO: It sounds like you would put new money to work in this market right here.TRENNERT: I would, I absolutely would.BARTIROMO: You still think market goes up?TRENNERT: Oh, I do. I think, you know, in the sectors we like the most are financials, industrials, and technology. And when I say technology, I don't know if I really go with go with FANG, I go with the more kind of prosaic may be --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: FANGing Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google.TRENNERT: Amazon, Netflix, Google, Alphabet. Whatever they're calling it now.BARTIROMO: So those stocks are already up a lot?TRENNERT: Those stocks are up a lot and clearly their -- it's just evaluations I think are hard to stomach in my -- at this point in my opinion. I would rather go with the kind of prosaic, you know, the Ciscos and the Microsofts, and the IBMs and the more kind of old tech companies at this point.BARTIROMO: Real quick in Europe. Markets going to erect to the French election.TRENNERT: I think at this point unless Le Pen wins, I don't think it's going to react too much. I think they -- I think the first round of French election was where you saw the big impact. If Le Pen wins I think that is a meaningful event and it shows that populism isn't dead.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, we'll be watching that. That's going to be important this Sunday. Jason, great to see you.TRENNERT: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much.TRENNERT: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Jason Trennert from Strategus. Taking a short break. Puerto Rico makes history not in a good way. Puerto Rico is filing the largest bankruptcy ever. The uncertain future ahead for the island. And then Verizon scores the right to air an NFL game. The staggering amount the company paid to lock down the streaming deal. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Good Thursday morning! Welcome back, everybody. Thanks, so much being with us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, May 4th, your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on East Coast. President Trump returns to New York today, for the first trip back since moving into the White House. Ahead of that, he will sign an Executive Order on religion on this National Prayer Day today. Another big earnings day today and that's driving markets. After the closing bell, we will hear from Shake Shack. Investors are watching the stock this morning, it is down but a quarter of a percent lower.The broader market looks good though, we're expecting a higher opening for the Broader Averages. Take a look, Dow Industrials on, on pace to open up about 50 points this morning. This is near the highs of the morning right here. NASDAQ composite up 20 points, that's a third of a percent higher; a quarter of a percent higher on Dow. In Europe, gains across the board as well. Take a look at the Eurozone indices right here, with the FTSE 100 up a third of a percent, CAC 40 up better than one percent in Paris. That's after that debate last night ahead of the French election, Sunday. In Asia, overnight, mixed performances. Japan was closed for a holiday, the other majors as you see, a fractionally moving there.A final face-off in France, presidential candidates Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, going head-to-head in a fiery debate last night. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARINE LE PEN, FRENCH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (through translator): Mr. Macron is the candidate the, the wild globalization, social brutality, and the war of everyone against everyone.EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (through translator): You are the real inheritor of fear of - the party over a name that goes against France.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The very latest ahead of Sunday night's vote, coming up. Puerto Rico makes history, it is seeking bankruptcy protection. We are looking at the implications of the largest bankruptcy ever, Puerto Rico under pressure this morning. A massive fishing scam, meanwhile, hits Google. Do not this email if you get. What you need to know if you got an invite from Google Docs. Plus, Ringling Brothers making its curtain call later this month, and it is going out in 21st-century style. We'll play all about it. But first, a busy day for Washington this morning. House Republicans plan to vote on health care, while President Trump is set to sign an Executive Order on religious liberty before heading to New York today.Blake Burman is live at White House right now with all happenings. Blake, good morning to you.BLAKE BURMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you as well. That was a pretty big proclamation last night on Capitol Hill by the number two in the House, Kevin McCarthy, saying that they feel - Republican leadership feels that they have the votes to get the AHCA forward. The moment of truth though, we will happen later this afternoon as health care bill will indeed hit the house floor for a vote. The final hurdle that appears ended up being some $8 billion as it relates to a pre-existing condition for those who live in states that might seek a waiver, and here at the White House, they were making the argument that that is a very small segment of patients.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEAN SPICER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: If someone chose not to have coverage for 63 days or more, and they were in a state that opted out, and they had preexisting condition, and they were put into a high-risk pool, then we've allocated additional $8 billion over five years to help drive down those costs.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: However, Democrats say that fix is worse than a band-aid. Chuck Schumer, yesterday, acquitted it to giving cough medicine to someone with cancer, and here was Nancy Pelosi.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), MINORITY LEADER: No. It doesn't improve the bill, and don't let the - this is an insult to the intelligence of the American people. But worse than that, it is an assault on the good health of the American people.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: Of course, Maria, if this gets to the floor, if it passes the house, there is still a long way to go as senate republicans will likely take a scalpel to it, and then have to send it back to the house. As for here at the White House, it will be a busy morning for President Trump. He will sign an Executive Order, in the name of expanding religious freedoms. Among the items in the Executive Order, would be giving houses of worship, greater ability to engage in political activity. And then, Maria, the President heads your way, President Trump, for the first time, heading to the Big Apple as President of the United States, there on the agenda for him, he will meet with Prime Minister of Australia. Maria, back to you.BARTIROMO: All right. We will be watching that. Blake, thank you. Blake Burman with the latest. President Trump, meanwhile, returning to New York as you just heard. The first time he's coming back home, since taking office. The President will meet with Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, on the USS intrepid, that's to commemorate the 75th anniversary of World War II: Battle of the Coral Sea. This comes after the two shared a heated phone call in a late January, you may remember, that was over the U.S. accepting refugees from Australia.Joining us right now is former Commander of the USS Cole, Kirk S. Lippold. Commander, good to see you. Thanks very much for joining us this morning.KIRK LIPPOLD, USS COLE FORMER COMMANDER: Good morning, Maria.BARTIROMO: What do you think this messages that the President is meeting with the Prime Minister of Australia. What is he trying to communicate here with this meeting?LIPPOLD: I think he is very clearly trying to communicate that the nations may have differences but that doesn't mean that a long and enduring relationship between two countries is going to be jeopardized because we have neutral national security interests, that both of us are pursuing.NARDELLI: So, Commander, just to change the subject a little bit, thank you for your service in the military. I had the pleasure of spending three days out in the Pacific on the Nimitz, as they were going through a shakedown before they were going to be deployed. One of the things I heard is that the Department of Defense is now going to - not have a gap in coverage out there. But what's your thoughts about then, what does the implications of that mean?LIPPOLD: I think, you're seeing the strategic shift where we used to not have gaps in the Middle East with aircraft carriers, it's now going to shift, obviously, into Southeast Asia. When you look at the threat North Korea's presenting this day, plus our strategic interests in the region, we're making it very clear, specifically, to China that their nine-dash line in the South China Sea is not going to be acceptable even with a ruling in International Court says, it's illegal. Plus, we want to start applying that pressure on to China to make sure they understand that their continuing aiding and abetting of what is going on in North Korea cannot be tolerated. And they need to be part of the solution, not the problem when it comes to the nuclear weapons and the ballistic missile program.NARDELLI: Do we need to increase the fleet? We got 10 carriers out there now. I know it's being talked about in Congress, you think we will increase that to 11, 12.LIPPOLD: Well, even if we did, to build an aircraft carrier takes five to seventh years to do that. And so, I think that we need to push out, it would be good to have another aircraft carrier out there. We have looked at deploying one further that Hawaii, going out and actually basing an aircraft carrier in Guam. I think there is a lot of merit in considering and potentially doing that. It's going to send a strong signal. Especially, to our allies in the region. We're willing to invest billions of dollars, because our strategic interest lies out there with you, not just starting at the West Coast to the United State or Hawaii.BARTIROMO: Yes. But is China doing enough? I mean, Rex Tillerson is cracking down on pressure on China for North Korea. The Secretary of State called on China to implement existing United Nations sanctions, in order to target North Korean business. Listen to this, I want to get your reaction, Sir.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REX TILLERSON, SECRETARY OF STATE: We've told them we're watching what you're doing when we see you're not implementing, we see companies, or we see individuals that are violating these sanctions, I'm going to contact you and ask you to take care of it. If can't take care of it, or you simply don't want to take care of it for your own internal political reasons, we will. We'll sanction them through third country sanctions.BARTIROMO: This pressure working, Commander?LIPPOLD: We don't know yet, Maria. I think what you're going to see is, this is absolutely the right message. For several years, now, I've advocated, stop looking at North Korea, look at the country that has aided and abided their programs through financial institutions, technology, and others. It is time to begin to hold China accountable for what they have allowed North Korea do. And when Secretary of State Tillerson, comes up with a statement like that, he is finally laying it on the line and the U.S. government is getting serious about the threat to the United States and our allies in the region.MCDOWELL: What should we watch for in terms of evidence that China is cooperating? Is it the even enforcement of existing sanctions because trade between China and North Korea has increased ten-fold in the last 15 years. Is what China say and does about the missile defense system, that the United States is placing in South Korea which even in recent weeks they have sent signals that they're opposed to it.LIPPOLD: Action speaks stronger than words. And I think we're going to very closely start to monitor those companies and those institutions that are involved with the Chinese government, and we are going to hold them accountable. It is time to stop the talk and start to say, China must start obeying these national or these United Nations resolutions, to a T. And then we must look beyond that to see if they're continuing to do it.While you look at the troops amassed on the border, while you look at the shipments of coal being one step in the right direction, there is a lot more that China can do to bring pressure. And I think you're seeing that in the North Korea even lashing out against China, but that's just talk. Again, actions are going to be where it gets measured and where with rubber meets the road in this instance.BARTIROMO: Well, at least they are really showing that they're going to be watching the accountability. I mean, what Rex Tillerson just said.LIPPOLD: Perfect. Absolutely.NARDELLI: The only thing that would have been better on the coal thing was when they refused to take it from North Korea, would have been to say we're going to buy from the U.S., would have been consistent with this administration's, you know, commitment to the coal miners.MCDOWELL: But Bob Nardelli, in the first quarter, China's trade with North Korea was up almost 40 percent compared to a year ago. There we talk about the rejection-BARTIROMO: How much do they really want change.MCDOWELL: Exactly.NARDELLI: And one of the concerns is that China is terrified of North Korea becoming destabilized because they'll end up with a massive refugee problem. They also don't want a nuclear problem because the wind's directly blowing to their territory first. So, they've got a vested interest in solving this on their doorstep before we have to engage, especially, militarily.BARTIROMO: Right. And add on their terms. Commander, good to see you, sir. Thanks very much for weighing in this morning.LIPPOLD: You as well. Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Commander Kirk S. Lippold, joining us there. We'll take a break. When we come back, Shake Shack, trying to shake out of a slump down five percent since the start of the year. What analysts are expecting from the burger chain's first quarter earnings, that's due out after the bell tonight. And then the curtains coming down. The greatest show on Earth, how everyone can watch the last Ringling Brothers' performance later this month. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back 45 minutes away from the opening bell. We are expecting a rally at the start of trading today take a look. Dow Industrials set to open up about 50 points, definitely had a bid under this market. NASDAQ up a third of a percent, that's 17 points higher. A couple of names on the move, Shake Shack, set to report first-quarter earnings after the close tonight. The burger chain has struggled to find a recipe for success since its IPO back in 2015. The stock down five percent this year on slow sales growth, and also expecting earnings of eight cents a share.Verizon reportedly paying the NFL $21 million for the rights to a single game this year. Critics at the Wall Street Journal this morning, the deal is for the September 24th game in London between the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars. Verizon wireless customers will be able to watch the matchup on the NFL mobile app. Verizon shares up quarter of a percent right now in the premarket.Well, the two candidates vying to be France's next President, taking the gloves off last night in heated debate. Cheryl Casone on the story now, Cheryl.CASONE: No or something else. Maria, good morning far right candidate Marine Le Pen and Independent Centrist Emmanuel Macron argued for more than two hours as the moderators of France's final Presidential debate struggled to gain control. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MACRON (through translator): The party of business is not my party, it is your party.LE PEN (through translator): Be careful what you are saying, Mr. Macron. I hope that we will not learn anything next few days and next few weeks. You give lectures to the others, but you are the one who was least qualified to give lectures.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Well, then it gets better. Macron went on the call Le Pen a liar and accused her of spreading hatred while she was - while she said that he was soft on terrorism. Le Pen, of course, wants to leave the European Union, NATO, and close French borders. Macron, however, represents continuity in current French policy. 63 percent of viewers found Macron more convincing in the debate as according to the Snap Opinion polls. Another poll, one of the last big surveys before the election Sunday saw Macron getting 59 percent of the vote to Le Pen's 41 percent.Well, Puerto Rico filing for bankruptcy protection. The U.S. territory now under court protection and would announce the largest ever U.S. municipal bankruptcy. The island's governor making that announcement after negotiations with bondholders failed. Puerto Rico owe 73 billion to creditors, dwarfing Detroit's infamous bankruptcy just a few years ago and this action could mean deeper losses on bonds. Analysts have even anticipated yet is going to ripple through guides to major U.S. hedge funds, mutual funds and bond insurers for sureWell, Google says is it caught a phishing e-mail. The scan asks users to open a link to a Google doc probably came from somebody that you recognize and trusted, well, it's going to give hackers access a to your e-mail, your contact list and your documents. Google says it shuts down the attack but it's possible unread versions of the bad e-mails are still floating out there. Be careful especially if you have a Gmail account.Well, the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &Bailey Circus about to fade in the history but it hopes to go out with a huge audience anyway. Final performance at the circus is on May 21st and they are going to go stream it on Facebook live and on the Web site of the circus. Earlier this year, the company announced that it was folding its circus tent for good, this may. The final show is going take place in Uniondale, New York. Anybody watching online will get to see the show in its entirety, the circus shutting down because of declining attendance, high operating costs, change in public taste and of course several battles that they had, Maria, with animal rights groups over the last several years. More than a 100 years we've had the circus in this country but end of an era.BARTIROMO: Wow. Yes sure is. Thanks, Cheryl. Coming up next, a friend of thy neighbor, we will talk to the CEO of Nextdoor. Entrepreneurship on the table. We're talking with him about the social media network and bringing neighborhoods together across the country. Nextdoor Founder, coming up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The private social media network Nextdoor is changing neighborhoods from organizing garage sales to reducing crimes. Nextdoor makes it easier for neighbors to share information. Joining us right now is the founder and CEO the Cofounder is Nirav Tolia. Good to see you, Nirav. Thanks very much for joining us.NIRAV TOLIA, CO-FOUNDER, NEXTDOOR: Thanks so much for having me, Maria.BARTIROMO: Well congratulations on this company. More than 136,000 neighborhoods use Nextdoor. What are the top reasons people are on this site? Tell us the value of Nextdoor.TOLIA: Well, Nextdoor is a free and easy way for you to work with your neighbors, to create a stronger, and better local community for everyone. It's a way to stay in the know, a way to get things done, and a way to be a good neighbor.NARDELLI: Nirav this is Bob Nardelli. Your data shows at about 20 percent of your users are using it for crime and safety, tell us our viewing audience how they should use that, how that could help on crime prevention, does it talk about will sexual offenders in the neighborhood? Give us a little bit more on that aspect of your site.TOLIA: Sure. It's about 10 percent of the conversation on Nextdoor related to crime, and also safety issues, like natural disasters, tornados, hailstorms et cetera. But when it comes to crime, you can almost think of Nextdoor as a virtual neighborhood watch. This incredible tool that makes it super easy for you to keep track of everything that's going on in the neighborhood and if any of your neighbors see something suspicious or potentially criminal they can easily report it so that everyone in the neighborhood stays safer. We do take privacy and security very seriously and so if there are registered sex offenders in your neighborhood, they cannot join the network.When you join Nextdoor, you have to enter your physical home address and if that home address corresponds to a sex offender, then it's blocked. So you won't actually have any of those people on the network, but you will be able to help your neighbors talk about the things that matter, and if those things are criminal or potentially suspicious, you will all be better informed.CARTER: You've got 136,000 neighborhoods. Are they geographically all over the place or there's some scenes that you're seeing that is getting picked up by? Where are the most popular communities?TOLIA: When we started the company, we were wondering if this was a concept that would work equally well on the coast as well as in the middle of the country whether it would be in rural neighborhoods or suburban neighborhoods. What we found now with these 136,000 neighborhoods that are using Nextdoor, they are in all 50 states. That represents over 70 percent of the neighborhoods in the country, and, so we've got them everywhere. It turns out that it doesn't matter what kind of neighborhood we're talking about, neighbors want to connect, they want to bring back a sense of community, they want to use technology to make their lives better.MCDOWELL: Nirav, you were talking about the privacy issue. But what about neighbors invading the privacy of others? Do you worry about legal liability of that? That if one neighbor accuses another of saying something, on your service, that they find is a violation of their rights?TOLIA: Well, it's really important to think about all social networks in the context of how the members are using those social networks. Nextdoor is about utility. It's about staying in the know, getting things done, being a good neighbor and so the kinds of conversations you see are recommendations for babysitters, asking for help finding a lost cat, selling a used sofa, warning folks if there are wildfires in the area so you don't get the kinds of conversations that really create this kind of strife that you're talking about. It's not personal attacks, it's not status updates, it's not self-expression. It's about coming together as a community to make the better neighborhood for everyone.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's an interesting concept. What's the business model, Nirav? How are you going to make money?TOLIA: Like all social networks, the service is free for consumers to use and we believe there is a tremendous opportunity to connect our members to local businesses, and so the business model is to show advertising. Hopefully, very relevant and helpful advertising to our members, so that they can patronize the great local businesses in their area.BARTIROMO: And you think you could be a billion dollars advertising business?TOLIA: Well we certainly hope so. We've been very fortunate with investors. We've raised a couple hundred million dollars the last round of financing valued the company at over a billion and so we have those expectations, yes.BARTIROMO: Nirav, congratulations we'll be watching the developments, thanks so much for joining us.TOLIA: Thank you for having me.BARTIROMO: Co-Founder of Nextdoor, we will be right back.BARTIROMO: All right. Just enough time to say thank you to our awesome panel this morning. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day "VARNEY & COMPANY" begins right now.

GRASSLEY PUSHES FOR QUICK EXECUTIVE ACTIONS TO CURB EB-5 VISA ABUSEStates News ServiceMay 11, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 1420 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Iowa Senator Charles Grassley:Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley called on the Homeland Security Secretary to expedite proposed regulations targeting abuse and national security concerns in the EB-5 investor visa program, and to clarify that the department is processing EB-5 applications in a fair and transparent manner. The request follows a recent extension of the EB-5 program without any reforms and a reported pitch by Kushner Companies implying that potential investors should invest soon to avoid changes in program rules.The EB-5 program, which has been riddled with well-documented fraud and national security vulnerabilities, was extended last week without any reforms, despite efforts by Grassley and others to restore integrity in the program. Regulations proposed by the Obama Administration and under consideration by the Trump Administration would address some of the program's weaknesses. Investors typically face a two-year wait for the limited number of EB-5 visas. In a letter to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, Grassley pointed out that, given the backlog of applicants, new investors would be subject to the program's rules at the time their visas become available, despite the comments made by representatives of Kushner Companies."As you know, EB-5 applicants ordinarily wait at least two years for a petition to be processed and for visas to become available. Ms. Meyer's statements, however, could seem to imply that foreign nationals who invest with the Kushner Company will receive special treatment and expedited approval. It is appropriate for the Department to clarify and affirm that no foreign investors will receive preferential treatment, that applications will be processed in the order in which they are receivedsubject to any existing backlogand that future applications will be subject to the proposed regulations, when approved," Grassley said in the letter.In the letter, Grassley called on the Trump Administration to continue moving forward with the regulations in an open and transparent manner.Senior White House Advisor Jared Kushner, the previous CEO of Kushner Companies, has divested from Kushner Companies, in compliance with Office of Government Ethics requirements.May 10, 2017VIA ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSIONThe Honorable John KellySecretaryU.S. Department of Homeland SecurityWashington, D.C. 20528Dear Secretary Kelly:I am writing to request clarification of the Department's position regarding the processing of EB-5 petitions in light of recent statements by Nicole Kushner Meyer, and that you move expeditiously to approve the proposed regulations that correct serious flaws in the EB-5 program. I'm sure you're aware that Ms. Meyer recently made a pitch to potential real estate investors in Beijing at an event hosted by a Chinese company working with the Kushner Company to raise funds for a luxury apartment complex in New Jersey. In her speech, Ms. Meyer touted the EB-5 "golden visa," which permits investors of $500,000 or more to obtain a U.S. green card, and alluded to her brother Jared Kushner's White House position in a manner that some say was improperly suggestive.[1] One of Ms. Meyer's colleagues urged attendees to "invest early, and you will invest under the old rules."[2]As you know, EB-5 applicants ordinarily wait at least two years for a petition to be processed and for visas to become available. Ms. Meyer's statements, however, could seem to imply that foreign nationals who invest with the Kushner Company will receive special treatment and expedited approval. It is appropriate for the Department to clarify and affirm that no foreign investors will receive preferential treatment, that applications will be processed in the order in which they are receivedsubject to any existing backlogand that future applications will be subject to the proposed regulations, when approved.As I have noted on many occasions, the EB-5 program desperately needs to be reformed. Numerous sources have documented rampant corruption, fraud, and national security risks. For example, the FBI recently raided a California regional center that defrauded investors out of millions of dollars while facilitating dozens of fraudulently obtained green cards, including several procured for investors who are on a Chinese government list of most-wanted fugitives.[3] Others "invested" money loaned to them for a fee by the regional center, and "[n]o real construction took place at any of the proposed project locations[.]"[4] About 30 of the investors received some or all their money backamounting to about $10 millionbut concealed the refunds from U.S. officials and have continued to pursue legal permanent residence. Among many other examples, over the past five years the Securities and Exchange Commission has pursued cases involving hundreds of millions of dollars in fraudulent investment schemes, and in 2013 ICE's Homeland Security Investigations unit warned of serious national security and technology proliferation concerns.[5] These abuses are amplified because investment levelswhich have remained static since 1990and egregious gerrymandering of Targeted Investment Areas, rob the U.S. economy of billions of dollars each year.[6]The American people are relying on you to prevent fraud, promote security, and protect the homeland. DHS's efforts in implementing new regulations to that effect are integral to strengthening program integrity and benefitting the U.S. economy. I strongly support the proposed regulations, and support the Trump administration's efforts to move forward with implementing these necessary changes in an open, and transparent manner.Thank you in advance for your cooperation with this request. If you have any questions, please contact me or Katherine Nikas or Brad Watts of my Judiciary Committee staff at (202) 224-5225.Sincerely,Charles E.

Sen.

In a letter to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, Grassley pointed out that, given the backlog of applicants, new investors would be subject to the program's rules at the time their visas become available, despite the comments made by representatives of Kushner Companies."As you know, EB-5 applicants ordinarily wait at least two years for a petition to be processed and for visas to become available. Ms. Meyer's statements, however, could seem to imply that foreign nationals who invest with the Kushner Company will receive special treatment and expedited approval. It is appropriate for the Department to clarify and affirm that no foreign investors will receive preferential treatment, that applications will be processed in the order in which they are received--subject to any existing backlog--and that future applications will be subject to the proposed regulations, when approved," Grassley said in the letter.In the letter, Grassley called on the Trump Administration to continue moving forward with the regulations in an open and transparent manner.Senior White House Advisor Jared Kushner, the previous CEO of Kushner Companies, has divested from Kushner Companies, in compliance with Office of Government Ethics requirements.May 10, 2017VIA ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSIONThe Honorable John KellySecretaryU.S. Department of Homeland SecurityWashington, D.C. 20528Dear Secretary Kelly:I am writing to request clarification of the Department's position regarding the processing of EB-5 petitions in light of recent statements by Nicole Kushner Meyer, and that you move expeditiously to approve the proposed regulations that correct serious flaws in the EB-5 program. I'm sure you're aware that Ms. Meyer recently made a pitch to potential real estate investors in Beijing at an event hosted by a Chinese company working with the Kushner Company to raise funds for a luxury apartment complex in New Jersey. In her speech, Ms. Meyer touted the EB-5 "golden visa," which permits investors of $500,000 or more to obtain a U.S. green card, and alluded to her brother Jared Kushner's White House position in a manner that some say was improperly suggestive.[1] One of Ms. Meyer's colleagues urged attendees to "invest early, and you will invest under the old rules."[2]As you know, EB-5 applicants ordinarily wait at least two years for a petition to be processed and for visas to become available. Ms. Meyer's statements, however, could seem to imply that foreign nationals who invest with the Kushner Company will receive special treatment and expedited approval. It is appropriate for the Department to clarify and affirm that no foreign investors will receive preferential treatment, that applications will be processed in the order in which they are received--subject to any existing backlog--and that future applications will be subject to the proposed regulations, when approved.As I have noted on many occasions, the EB-5 program desperately needs to be reformed. Numerous sources have documented rampant corruption, fraud, and national security risks. For example, the FBI recently raided a California regional center that defrauded investors out of millions of dollars while facilitating dozens of fraudulently obtained green cards, including several procured for investors who are on a Chinese government list of most-wanted fugitives.[3] Others "invested" money loaned to them for a fee by the regional center, and "[n]o real construction took place at any of the proposed project locations[.]"[4] About 30 of the investors received some or all their money back--amounting to about $10 million--but concealed the refunds from U.S. officials and have continued to pursue legal permanent residence. Among many other examples, over the past five years the Securities and Exchange Commission has pursued cases involving hundreds of millions of dollars in fraudulent investment schemes, and in 2013 ICE's Homeland Security Investigations unit warned of serious national security and technology proliferation concerns.[5] These abuses are amplified because investment levels--which have remained static since 1990--and egregious gerrymandering of Targeted Investment Areas, rob the U.S. economy of billions of dollars each year.[6]The American people are relying on you to prevent fraud, promote security, and protect the homeland. DHS's efforts in implementing new regulations to that effect are integral to strengthening program integrity and benefitting the U.S. economy. I strongly support the proposed regulations, and support the Trump administration's efforts to move forward with implementing these necessary changes in an open, and transparent manner.Thank you in advance for your cooperation with this request. If you have any questions, please contact me or Katherine Nikas or Brad Watts of my Judiciary Committee staff at (202) 224-5225.Sincerely,Charles E.

China convicts Christian lawyer of subverting state powerAssociated Press InternationalApril 28, 2017 Friday 9:25 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 276 wordsDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - A Chinese court has convicted a prominent Christian human rights lawyer on charges of subverting state power and sentenced him to three years in prison, with the sentence suspended for four years, the court said Friday.Li Heping was one of hundreds detained in July 2015 in a crackdown by Chinese authorities on rights lawyers and activists. He is among four lawyers and a number of activists still in detention. According to law, he will not have to serve the three-year sentence if he doesn't commit any other offenses during the four-year suspension period, although he has already been detained for almost two years.As a lawyer, Li defended dissidents, victims of forced evictions and members of the banned Falun Gong meditation sect.The Tianjin No. 2 Intermediate People's Court said in an online statement that Li's trial was held Tuesday behind closed doors because the case involved state secrets.It said that since 2008 Li had repeatedly used the internet and interviews with foreign media to discredit and attack state power and the legal system. It said he had also used unspecified foreign funds to intervene in high-profile legal cases and colluded with unnamed "illegal religious activists," some lawyers and other people with the aim of making citizens feel dissatisfied with Chinese institutions.President Xi Jinping has spearheaded a crackdown on civil society under which some lawyers have been labeled threats to national security. Critics say the crackdown is aimed at snuffing out any potential opposition to the ruling Communist Party. Western governments have urged Chinese authorities to release the lawyers and activists.Load-Date: April 29, 2017End of Document

Vinda 4D-Deco Tissue Wedding Dress Showcased at Paris Fashion WeekPR NewswireJuly 6, 2017 Thursday 9:07 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 760 wordsDateline: PARIS, July 6, 2017 BodyOn the afternoon of July 5 (local time), leading Asia-based hygiene products and services provider Vinda showcased its 4D-Deco Tissue Wedding Dress at Paris Haute Couture Fashion Week, in cooperation with Chinese online retailer Tmall Supermarket and Chinese fashion designer Lan Yu. Designed by Lan Yu, founder and design director of the LANYU brand, the Tissue Wedding Dress was exclusively made of Vinda DELUXETM 4D-deco Tissues. The unique wedding gown became one of the highlights at the fashion event. This is the first time the gown has been showcased in an international setting since the Chinese government listed brand building as a national strategy in 2017. Vinda, through the 4D-Deco tissue wedding dress, has raised the visibility of China's facial tissue art and thus shown how high quality of a single piece of tissue could be. Tissue art is another example of the new level of the quality of goods and services that are being produced in and exported from China today.As a premier event in the fashion community, the annual Paris Haute Couture Fashion Week attracts the world's top luxury brands, with Dior, Chanel, Valentino and Fendi as leading examples. LANYU 2017 Fall and Winter Haute Couture Show, themed "Graceful Girl", was inspired by the artistic renditions of The Twelve Beauties of Jinling, the leading female characters in the Chinese classical novelDream of the Red Chamber. Isabelle Huppert, winner of the Best Actress at Cesar Awards 2017, was among a host of global celebrities who watched the event."The Vinda 4D-Deco tissue wedding dress was inspired by the unique and unrivaled lifestyle of Paris, with the aesthetics that are part and parcel of the 4D-Deco embossing technology combined with the comfort delivered by the strong yet soft tissues coming together to embody the romance and grace of Paris."Using Vinda 4D-Deco tissues as the basis for a wedding gown represents not only a bold attempt by a courageous designer in the world of fashion but also a whole new and transformative twist in the selection of materials for bridal attire. In recent years, haute couture designers have become increasingly demanding in terms of materials, with those that are friendly to the skin increasingly favored. Vinda's next-generation DELUXETM4D-Deco series of tissues are notably non-irritating, with a feel that is especially comfortable to the skin, thanks to the world's leading 4D-Deco embossing technology. Lan Yu, the designer, selected the tissues as the yarn of choice for the wedding gowns, offering the ultimate in a skin-friendly experience.The 4D-deco tissue wedding dress demonstrates both Chinese classical beauty and western modern elements through the combination of a skin-friendly and comfortable soft Oriental texture and the exquisite and elegant 4D-Deco embossing technology in the design and production of the dress, said insiders from the fashion community.Vinda marketing director Zhong Feng said, Vinda's tie-up with Lan Yu, a top-level designer within the haute couture industry, and Tmall Supermarket, a brand actively advocating the concept of an "ideal life", made it possible to have a presence of Vinda's exclusive tissue wedding dress and DELUXETM 4D-deco Tissue at the world's top fashion event. With the two partners, Vinda was able to showcase the 4D-Deco artisan quality to the world in a well-recognized international setting, while, at the same time, highlighting the combination of a new fashionable form and a more skin-friendly experience.This is not the first time that Vinda and Lan Yu have cooperated in the roll out of a tissue wedding dress. In 2016, the Vinda brand and Lan Yu jointly launched a tailored tissue wedding gown, and made a stunning appearance with Taiwanese actress and international star Lin Chi-ling as the model. The successful experience laid a solid foundation for the continued cooperation between the two parties and become an important factor contributing to the launch of tissue bridal attire in Paris.The transformative technology and the unusually comfortable texture come together to raise the expectation that the 4D-Deco will become an epoch-making fashion item and a leading industry trend. Through Lan Yu's exquisite handmade tailored technology and the support of Tmall Supermarket, China's facial tissue art and quality has taken front and center on the stage in Paris.To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vinda-4d-deco-tissue-wedding-dress-showcased-at-paris-fashion-week-300483998.htmlSOURCE VindaCONTACT: Huang Runying , +86 18825150826, queenie.huang@targetuni.comLoad-Date: July 7, 2017End of Document

MINISTER ZHONG SHAN ATTENDS AND ADDRESSES THE 23RD APEC TRADE MINISTERS' MEETINGStates News ServiceMay 22, 2017 MondayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 553 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China:On the morning of May 20, the 23rd APEC Trade Ministers' Meeting was held in Hanoi Vietnam. Chinese Minister of Commerce Zhong Shan led delegation of Chinese government to attend the meeting and delivered a speech on issues such as promoting sustainable, inclusive and innovative growth.Zhong said that realizing an inclusive, sustainable and innovative growth marks the common goal of the APEC economies. One week ago, China has just successfully held the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. Chinese President Xi Jinping put forward the silk road spirit of "peace and cooperation, openness and inclusiveness, mutual learning and mutual benefit and win-win result", defining the firm stand that China supports the multilateral trade system and promotes the economic globalization. Xi also put forward building an open world economy and jointly constructing a human destiny community, winning positive response and was widely applauded by the participants and international organizations. This is totally consistent with the open and inclusive regionalization cooperation concept of the APEC as well as the silk road spirit.Zhong pointed out that innovation is an important strength to promote development, as well as a significant way to realize economic inclusiveness and sustainable growth. China appeals the APEC economies to jointly a better develop an innovative environment for the Asia-Pacific region and maintain the innovative advantage of the APEC. The innovative environment of the APEC should regard an open and free trade investment system as a basis so as to further conduct structure reform, encourage enterprises to innovate strength and promote common sharing of innovative experience and achievements.Trade minister of the APEC economics, heads of relevant international organizations and representative of the APEC observers attended the meeting. Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen participated in the meeting. The meeting will conduct discussion on topics such as improving competitiveness and innovative strength of medium, small and micro-sized enterprises, supporting multilateral trade system and the WTO, promoting regional economic integration and the "post 2020" vision of the APEC.anBig Medium-sized SmallanMinistry of Commerce Website Copyright and Disclaimer StatementAll articles marked with "Article type: Original" posted on the website of the Ministry of Commerce and its sub-sites are copyrighted by this Website and its sub-sites.

3 QUESTIONS: HOW URBANIZATION AND REVOLUTIONARY INNOVATION ARE SHAPING GLOBAL REAL ESTATEStates News ServiceMay 3, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 1176 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. BodyThe following information was released by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT):Around the world, more and more people are moving to cities. The increase in urbanization is paralleled by revolutionary advances in digital technology, innovation in the built environment, and new modes for how real estate is transacted and conducted. This combination has created significant opportunities as well as challenges for the global real estate industry. The MIT Center for Real Estate (CRE) will host its annual World Real Estate Forum on May 18-19, bringing together MIT faculty and researchers and industry thought leaders from more than 20 countries. This year's agenda will delve deeply into issues related to the intersection of innovation and urbanization and their implications for cities and real estate markets worldwide.Albert Saiz is the director of CRE and the Daniel Rose Associate Professor of Urban Economics and Real Estate. He also leads the MIT Urban Economics Lab, which studies real estate economics, urban economics, housing markets, local public finance, zoning regulations, global real estate, and demographic trends affecting urban and real estate development. The School of Architecture and Planning recently asked Saiz to share his insights into developing trends around the world in the built environment, housing, and commercial real estate, and where global capital is likely to be deployed in the near future.Q: With the trend toward urbanization, what kinds of innovative approaches to housing are being developed to meet the increasing demand in cities?A: Quite frankly, I think a lot of what is going on is business as usual. If you look at China or some of the other developing economies that are growing Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia you see the same models of development, ones that are based on very large multifamily buildings that are built in isolation and separated by parks or roads, instead of adjacent buildings in high- density areas such as you find in Europe or Boston. The lack of contiguity is not good because it generates sprawl and is based on car usage, which is increasing in those developing economies.On the positive side, we can talk about 3-D printing construction and stackable units, but what is actually more exciting is the very low hanging fruit innovations that are sort of mundane but can really reduce construction costs, such as building more concrete factories in sub-Saharan Africa. I very much like the ideas of Chilean architect Alejandro Aravena and his firm Elemental. He constructs "incremental housing," where half of a house and just the shell for the other half is constructed using government funds. As the families who move into these houses save money, they can progressively build out the other, incomplete half of the house using sweat equity.Because we have to house so many new people worldwide, especially at the low end, a lot of the advancements are going to be geared toward producing housing typologies that are cheap, versatile, and customizable. I like the Skanska-IKEA model, called BoKlok, which uses Skanska's construction expertise with a typical IKEA interior design to produce pre-designed homes. It's a very streamlined industrial process aimed at minimizing construction costs.We are also watching innovation in microunits, modular housing, new construction materials, and a lot of advancements in architectural modeling and Building Information Modeling, or BIM. Many of these things are going to crystallize globally for use in the lower to middle end of the market.Q: What are some of the trends that are happening globally in terms of commercial real estate development?A: In terms of industrial real estate, the innovation is going to be in new logistics facilities. We're seeing a revolution in the way that people do logistics more automatization, more multifunctional spaces that can adapt to different users, and a much greater need for flexibility. I also think you're going to see more fabrication space, with small, local factories focused on design or products that can be pre-printed because 3-D printers are going to be so much better in 20 years. We're going to have a lot of production by small artisans, with increasing customization, and it's going to bring more production back to the cities. This trend will be amplified by growing consumer demand for things that are organic, environmentally sensible, and produced locally, not shipped 10,000 kilometers using fossil fuels.The other trend that is emerging is the repurposing of existing buildings for other uses. For instance, industrial space around the world is now being transformed into technology space in places like London, Barcelona, Turin, Glasgow, and the U.S. We're going to see more flexible use of space, where a retail space might become an internet app lab after a few years, and then 10 years later, may take a different use.Many cities now have central amenity districts, areas that are devoted to the live, work, and play concept. You see it not only in Europe but in places like Oklahoma City, where a real vibrancy is provided by this type of infill redevelopment. These developments are often very expensive, with a lot of public use, so we're going to see an increase in public-private partnerships.Q: The past few years have seen a significant influx of capital entering the U.S. commercial real estate market. Looking ahead, where else is capital likely to be deployed?A: Some of the trends depend on what's going to happen with China and other countries with current account surplus or with economic and political instability. Although China's economy is still growing quite fast, it is decelerating. If it slows any more, or stops, there could be a slight correction in the pricing of commercial real estate assets. I certainly think the U.S. is still very attractive for real estate investment, and we're seeing the appreciation of the dollar.I think foreign investors are not being as cautious about the current U.S. administration as we may have expected. Despite the current administration's "America first" rhetoric, Donald Trump's businesses have partially been based on investing abroad and on using foreign capital. Trump's policies are therefore unlikely to hurt the interests of major global real estate investors. In parallel, a healthy appetite for core assets from global investors is driving down yields in major cities around the world, and not only in the U.S. We're still the safe, stable refuge for capital, despite the relatively low yields, and there is growing appetite for U.S. secondary markets.There is also an interesting phenomenon occurring recently in China. China has been tightening the outflows of capital because they want to keep their currency relatively stable. I think that's one of the uncertainties in the market right now. A lot of Chinese investment capital, however, was already offshore or in Hong Kong. The ability of the Chinese government to stop those investors and keep the dollars in China remains an unknown.Load-Date: May 3, 2017End of Document

Trump's critical Cuba policyPolitico.comMay 23, 2017 Tuesday 9:36 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1366 wordsHighlight: Russia and China are battling for influence in Havana just as the Trump administration considers undoing Obama's historic opening to Cuba. Here's why that would hurt U.S. national security.BodyOn May 10, a tanker with a full load of Russian crude oil made its way across the Atlantic Ocean and docked in Cuba - the largest petroleum shipment from Russia to Cuba since the Cold War. The previous October, Russia's defense minister announced Moscow was considering reopening military bases in Cuba - its first official return to the island since 2002. The Chinese are getting in on the action as well: China is both Cuba's largest trading partner and the largest holder of Cuban government debt. The Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei is in direct competition with Google to provide internet access throughout Cuba - a high-stakes commercial battle that could determine whether Cubans have access to an open internet or one controlled by the government. The Cold War might not be back, but Cuba has returned as a national security battleground as Russia and China increasingly engage with Havana and seek influence on an island less than 100 miles from the U.S. mainland. But since Donald Trump took office, the U.S. has been sitting out this fight. Former President Barack Obama's historic opening to Cuba didn't just create an attractive market to American companies. It also enhanced America's national security, reshuffling regional geopolitics in our favor, increasing border security and expanding access to counterterrorism intelligence. In fact, the past two years of direct engagement with Cuba have had more success in protecting our border, bolstering our influence in the region and preventing adversaries from threatening our security than the six previous decades of attempted isolation. But since Jan. 20, all engagement with the Cuban government has been halted as the Trump administration conducts a review of its Cuba policy, potentially rolling back the Obama-era reforms and closing off all diplomatic communication with Havana. Such a move wouldn't just set back U.S. policy goals with Cuba; it would also make the U.S. less safe, allowing foreign adversaries like China and Russia to gain a foothold in our backyard and making our border less secure. For a president committed to an "American first" agenda who is willing to spend billions of dollars on a border wall, closing ourselves off from Cuba would be a shockingly dangerous decision. We should know: We both served in the American armed forces for over three decades and always kept a watchful eye on Cuba. Looking back on our long careers, it was with some surprise that we found ourselves in Cuba in March as a part of a delegation led by the American Security Project, a nonpartisan national security think tank with which we both are affiliated. The trip's goal was to gain insight into U.S.-Cuban relations and build confidence between our countries. If someone had told us as young officers we would someday be in Havana, we would have expected to have been a part of an invasion force, one that the Pentagon had long planned as a contingency during the Cold War. Instead, we were peacefully welcomed by the government and people of Cuba. We have spent our lives guarding America's national security in every corner of the world and have seen firsthand the policies and initiatives that worked and those that did not. What we saw in Havana was that the U.S. embargo, blocking all trade and investment with Cuba for the past 55 years, has not worked. It has failed to isolate the Cuban government, failed to regain any nationalized property and succeeded in giving an excuse to the Castro government for its abuses and economic mismanagement. The embargo continues to impoverish a people who are naturally drawn to the United States. Yet, this failure extends beyond the backwardness of the regime in Cuba. The embargo has also weakened U.S. national security because it prevents almost any business that wants to work in the United States from trading with Cuba. In other words, if you want to do business in America (and are not in select industries like farming or medicine), you have to avoid the Cuban market. That has given a huge opening for our adversaries to gain influence in Cuba, starting with the Soviet Union's aid to the Cuban government. Since the Cold War ended, Venezuelans and Chinese have propped up the Cuban economy by providing subsidized oil or buying distressed Cuban government debt. This support has allowed the Castro regime to survive U.S. sanctions. On a more tactical level, the embargo prevents the Cuban government from buying the most sophisticated airline security equipment for its airports, meaning that screening procedures for flights from Cuba to the United States may not meet our high standards. Of course, Cuba is no longer as big a security issue as it was during the Cold War. But Russia and China still view it as an important theater, a place to gain influence and access near the U.S. coast - just as the U.S. seeks influence with countries near Moscow and Beijing. Obama's opening to Cuba, which re-established diplomatic ties between the countries, expanded Americans' ability to travel to Cuba. It also gave U.S. companies limited ability to do business on the island and demonstrated that the U.S. was turning the page on a long history of American intervention, reassuring other Latin American countries and pushing back on Russian and Chinese incursions. Engagement with Cuba was already paying dividends for America's security, even without the end of the embargo. Prior to Jan. 20, our two countries signed 22 individual memoranda of understanding on everything from how to re-establish direct mail to how to work together on cancer research. Of those 22 agreements, nine directly addressed national security, including on air travel security; countering narcotic smuggling; cross-border law enforcement; and maritime borders and security. This engagement was only going to grow stronger, with several government-to-government meetings on security-related issues scheduled. Furthermore, since diplomatic relations were re-established in July 2015, the Cuban government claims to have provided information in support of more than 500 U.S. counternarcotics operations and identified 34 human smugglers. At a June 2016 Counterterror Working Group Meeting, combating terrorism in the Caribbean region - from which hundreds of foreign fighters have traveled to join ISIS - was the key focus. During our trip, we saw firsthand the Cuban government's commitment to cooperating with the U.S. on security issues. The delegation met with various departments and ministries across the Cuban government and discussed in detail specific areas for U.S.-Cuba cooperation in support of shared security including counterterrorism, cybercrime, combating human trafficking, and immigration and border security. While we may not share governing philosophies, we share the goal of a more prosperous, healthful and peaceful world. Make no mistake, the Cuban government is in firm control of the nation, and we are clear-eyed about Cuba's history on human rights. However, its willingness to engage with the United States on equal terms can only motivate and encourage transformational social and economic thought over the long term. A key reality we and many of our former colleagues have come to learn is that imposing our norms and processes on other societies detracts from our strategic interests. The terms "freedom" and "prosperity" have different meanings and generate different expectations across societies. Trump has promised to put America first and to secure the U.S. borders. But there can be no such security if he rolls back the opening to Cuba. Our elected leaders must continue the process of normalization with Cuba and not let the momentum fade. America can become stronger, safer and more prosperous by means other than military force. The rapprochement between Cuba and the United States has been a great lesson in how effective diplomacy can build national security in the 21st century. Maj. Gen. Paul D. Eaton served in the U.S. Army for 33 years, including operational assignments in Iraq, Somalia, Bosnia and Albania. Brig. Gen. David L. McGinnis served in the Army and New York National Guard for 29 years, including two combat tours in Vietnam.Load-Date: June 7, 2017End of Document

For a president committed to an "American first" agenda who is willing to spend billions of dollars on a border wall, closing ourselves off from Cuba would be a shockingly dangerous decision. We should know: We both served in the American armed forces for over three decades and always kept a watchful eye on Cuba. Looking back on our long careers, it was with some surprise that we found ourselves in Cuba in March as a part of a delegation led by the American Security Project, a nonpartisan national security think tank with which we both are affiliated. The trip's goal was to gain insight into U.S.-Cuban relations and build confidence between our countries. If someone had told us as young officers we would someday be in Havana, we would have expected to have been a part of an invasion force, one that the Pentagon had long planned as a contingency during the Cold War. Instead, we were peacefully welcomed by the government and people of Cuba. We have spent our lives guarding America's national security in every corner of the world and have seen firsthand the policies and initiatives that worked and those that did not. What we saw in Havana was that the U.S. embargo, blocking all trade and investment with Cuba for the past 55 years, has not worked. It has failed to isolate the Cuban government, failed to regain any nationalized property and succeeded in giving an excuse to the Castro government for its abuses and economic mismanagement. The embargo continues to impoverish a people who are naturally drawn to the United States. Yet, this failure extends beyond the backwardness of the regime in Cuba. The embargo has also weakened U.S. national security because it prevents almost any business that wants to work in the United States from trading with Cuba. In other words, if you want to do business in America (and are not in select industries like farming or medicine), you have to avoid the Cuban market. That has given a huge opening for our adversaries to gain influence in Cuba, starting with the Soviet Union's aid to the Cuban government. Since the Cold War ended, Venezuelans and Chinese have propped up the Cuban economy by providing subsidized oil or buying distressed Cuban government debt. This support has allowed the Castro regime to survive U.S. sanctions. On a more tactical level, the embargo prevents the Cuban government from buying the most sophisticated airline security equipment for its airports, meaning that screening procedures for flights from Cuba to the United States may not meet our high standards. Of course, Cuba is no longer as big a security issue as it was during the Cold War. But Russia and China still view it as an important theater, a place to gain influence and access near the U.S. coast - just as the U.S. seeks influence with countries near Moscow and Beijing. Obama's opening to Cuba, which re-established diplomatic ties between the countries, expanded Americans' ability to travel to Cuba. It also gave U.S. companies limited ability to do business on the island and demonstrated that the U.S. was turning the page on a long history of American intervention, reassuring other Latin American countries and pushing back on Russian and Chinese incursions. Engagement with Cuba was already paying dividends for America's security, even without the end of the embargo. Prior to Jan. 20, our two countries signed 22 individual memoranda of understanding on everything from how to re-establish direct mail to how to work together on cancer research. Of those 22 agreements, nine directly addressed national security, including on air travel security; countering narcotic smuggling; cross-border law enforcement; and maritime borders and security. This engagement was only going to grow stronger, with several government-to-government meetings on security-related issues scheduled. Furthermore, since diplomatic relations were re-established in July 2015, the Cuban government claims to have provided information in support of more than 500 U.S. counternarcotics operations and identified 34 human smugglers. At a June 2016 Counterterror Working Group Meeting, combating terrorism in the Caribbean region - from which hundreds of foreign fighters have traveled to join ISIS - was the key focus. During our trip, we saw firsthand the Cuban government's commitment to cooperating with the U.S. on security issues. The delegation met with various departments and ministries across the Cuban government and discussed in detail specific areas for U.S.-Cuba cooperation in support of shared security including counterterrorism, cybercrime, combating human trafficking, and immigration and border security. While we may not share governing philosophies, we share the goal of a more prosperous, healthful and peaceful world. Make no mistake, the Cuban government is in firm control of the nation, and we are clear-eyed about Cuba's history on human rights. However, its willingness to engage with the United States on equal terms can only motivate and encourage transformational social and economic thought over the long term. A key reality we and many of our former colleagues have come to learn is that imposing our norms and processes on other societies detracts from our strategic interests. The terms "freedom" and "prosperity" have different meanings and generate different expectations across societies. Trump has promised to put America first and to secure the U.S. borders. But there can be no such security if he rolls back the opening to Cuba. Our elected leaders must continue the process of normalization with Cuba and not let the momentum fade. America can become stronger, safer and more prosperous by means other than military force. The rapprochement between Cuba and the United States has been a great lesson in how effective diplomacy can build national security in the 21st century. Maj. Gen. Paul D.

It also gave U.S. companies limited ability to do business on the island and demonstrated that the U.S. was turning the page on a long history of American intervention, reassuring other Latin American countries and pushing back on Russian and Chinese incursions. Engagement with Cuba was already paying dividends for America's security, even without the end of the embargo. Prior to Jan. 20, our two countries signed 22 individual memoranda of understanding on everything from how to re-establish direct mail to how to work together on cancer research. Of those 22 agreements, nine directly addressed national security, including on air travel security; countering narcotic smuggling; cross-border law enforcement; and maritime borders and security. This engagement was only going to grow stronger, with several government-to-government meetings on security-related issues scheduled. Furthermore, since diplomatic relations were re-established in July 2015, the Cuban government claims to have provided information in support of more than 500 U.S. counternarcotics operations and identified 34 human smugglers. At a June 2016 Counterterror Working Group Meeting, combating terrorism in the Caribbean region - from which hundreds of foreign fighters have traveled to join ISIS - was the key focus. During our trip, we saw firsthand the Cuban government's commitment to cooperating with the U.S. on security issues. The delegation met with various departments and ministries across the Cuban government and discussed in detail specific areas for U.S.-Cuba cooperation in support of shared security including counterterrorism, cybercrime, combating human trafficking, and immigration and border security. While we may not share governing philosophies, we share the goal of a more prosperous, healthful and peaceful world. Make no mistake, the Cuban government is in firm control of the nation, and we are clear-eyed about Cuba's history on human rights. However, its willingness to engage with the United States on equal terms can only motivate and encourage transformational social and economic thought over the long term. A key reality we and many of our former colleagues have come to learn is that imposing our norms and processes on other societies detracts from our strategic interests. The terms "freedom" and "prosperity" have different meanings and generate different expectations across societies. Trump has promised to put America first and to secure the U.S. borders. But there can be no such security if he rolls back the opening to Cuba. Our elected leaders must continue the process of normalization with Cuba and not let the momentum fade. America can become stronger, safer and more prosperous by means other than military force. The rapprochement between Cuba and the United States has been a great lesson in how effective diplomacy can build national security in the 21st century. Maj. Gen. Paul D.

As the Chinese government publicly opposed the missile defense, the number of Chinese tourists visiting South Korea withered and sales of South Korean cosmetics, cars and other products in China dropped.But the latest growth figure showed that some exporters, especially semiconductor makers, had a great quarter defying what many South Koreans saw as China's revenge over THAAD.Samsung Electronics, the world's largest memory chipmaker, announced its best quarterly result in nearly three years while SK Hynix also reported the highest quarterly profit in its history.

Annual vigil honors Tiananmen dead; Thousands gather in Hong Kong to recall event Beijing blots outUSA TODAYJune 5, 2017 MondayFIRST EDITIONCopyright 2017 Gannett Company, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 2ALength: 399 wordsByline: Kelvin Chan, The Associated PressBodyThousands of Hong Kongers attended a candlelight vigil Sunday to commemorate victims of the Chinese government's brutal military crackdown on protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989, and Taiwan's president called on Beijing to "face up" to the history.Hundreds if not thousands of unarmed protesters and onlookers were killed late on June 3 and the early hours of June 4, 1989, after China's communist leaders ordered the military to retake Tiananmen Square from the student-led demonstrators. Commemoration of the events,  public or private, remains taboo in mainland China.Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen said in posts on Facebook and Twitter that 28 years ago, the actions of students and citizens who challenged the political system in China "inspired a generation."She appealed to Beijing to "face up to June 4 with an open mind" and said Taiwan was willing to share its experiences of transitioning to democracy in the late 1980s to ease the pains of such a transition in the mainland."For democracy: some are early, others are late, but we will all get there in the end," Tsai wrote on Twitter.While mainland Chinese are only dimly aware of what happened at Tiananmen Square, the subject is openly discussed in Taiwan, a self-governing island, and Hong Kong, a special Chinese region with  autonomy and legally entrenched freedom of speech and other civil rights unseen on the mainland.The annual evening vigil in Hong Kong is the only large-scale commemoration on Chinese territory of the Tiananmen bloodshed. About 110,000 people attended on Sunday, according to organizers, while police estimated the turnout at 18,000. Last year, the numbers were 125,000 and 21,800, respectively.People held up their lit cellphones -- some with pictures of candles  on the screen -- as a band played  songs to rally the crowd and activists gave speeches about the importance of getting young people to attend."I don't want this part of history to become blurred," said Emily Yu, 42, who attended the gathering in Victoria Park. "It was really a massacre of people. Those young people came out and did all they could for freedom and democracy but didn't achieve it."Eloise Wu, 36, who works for a non-governmental organization, said: "We don't want to let people think we've forgotten, as if with the passing of time it's like, 'Oh, this never really happened.' No. Every year we remember." Load-Date: June 5, 2017End of Document

Happy Friday everybody, thanks so much for being here.I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Friday, July 21.Your top stories right now at 7:00 on the East Coast.President Trump says ISIS is falling fast. The Commander-in-Chief met with military officials yesterday at the Pentagon to assess the fight against the terror group.Meanwhile, YouTube is doing its part to help on the war on terror. The new actions that the company has taken to fight extremism online. More on the fight against ISIS coming up this morning.Tragedy hits the music world -- the details behind the death of Linkin Park lead singer, Chester Bennington.Plus America tunes in for O.J. Simpson once again.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. Simpson, I too, vote to grant parole (inaudible).O.J. SIMPSON, FORMER NFL PLAYER: Thank you, thank you.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The very latest as the NFL hall of famer is granted parole after nearly nine years in prison.Earnings the story on Wall Street once again, among them General Electric. The company has topped expectations for the second quarter earnings. The stock is up two-thirds of a percent after revenue and earnings were above estimates.Futures indicating the markets are mixed though this morning at the open. Take a look. We've got some selling underway. Dow Industrials down 28 points right now. The Nasdaq down about eight points.In Europe, mixed performances to report. Take a look at the indices there with the worst performers in Paris and Germany. The CAC 40 down three- quarters of a percent. The DAX index same thing. This is the low of the morning for those two indices. The FT 100 is flat.And in Asia overnight markets are mostly lower as you see there. Worst performer, the Nikkei average in Japan down just a quarter of a person, so it was a fractional move.Holographs hit the gridiron -- how the Baltimore Ravens are using technology to get a leg up on the competition. That's coming up this morning.All those stories coming up this morning. And joining me to talk all about it: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, former army intelligence officer Andrew Peek, and Bulltick Capital Markets head of research and chief market strategist Kathryn Rooney Vera is here. Good to see you.KATHRYN ROONEY VERA, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, BULLTICK CAPITAL MARKETS: Good to see you too.BARTIROMO: Good morning.ANDREW PEEK, FORMER ARMY INTELLIGENCE OFFICER: Lots to talk about.BARTIROMO: Yes, lots to talk about in politics and business this morning.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST: I know -- where do you start? Where do you start? How about starting with health care reform -- Republicans? And some tax reform, Republicans? Where are you? You're controlling Congress.I cannot wait for you to talk to Ted Cruz this morning.BARTIROMO: The President has been in power for six months-and we still don't have a health care bill and we are obviously looking toward tax reform. Do you think they get any legislative victories this year?MCDOWELL: Maybe tax reform. Maybe -- it seems like that there is a more coordinated, really detail-oriented effort coming out of the White House on that.BARTIROMO: I think you're right.MCDOWELL: And not to blame President Trump for the lack of action on the health care reform bill but again, he left it up to the Republicans. They had seven years to work on it and they have failed him quite frankly.But one other thing -- like when I open the paper every morning, I think we read it the same way that everybody across this country reads it. I don't care about the noise --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: -- the shenanigans or whatever that's going on in Washington and in the mainstream media. I care about action and change that will make a difference in everybody's life.BARTIROMO: What did Jamie Dimon say? Enough of the stupid -- I'm not going to say the last word -- ok. Enough of the stupid stuff. Let's get to the substance. He was right on -- spot on -- Jamie Dimon.Coming up Tennessee Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn is with us this morning. We will get into health care and tax reform with the congresswoman coming up as well. The counselor to President Trump, Kellyanne Conway is with us this morning. The CEO and president of the Cleveland Clinic, Dr. Toby Cosgrove is here. And Texas Senator Ted Cruz has a good idea as far as an amendment for the health care package. We're going to talk about that -- what that means for the states with Senator Cruz.Our top story right now: the Trump administration cracking down on ISIS. The President met with his national security team yesterday at the Pentagon to talk about Afghanistan and the fight against the Islamic state in the Middle East. President Trump told reporters after the meeting that ISIS is falling fast.Joining me now is former White House National Security Council staff member under President George W. Bush and President Obama, and Fox News contributor Gillian Turner. Gillian -- good to see you. Thanks so much for joining the conversation.GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning -- Maria.BARTIROMO: What do you think? Do you think the U.S. is making significant progress on the war on ISIS?TURNER: So, the situation remains similar, I would say virtually the same to what it was during the campaign which is there is incremental progress against ISIS on the grounds where it exists in the Middle East.At the same time it continues to make tremendous strides, ideological strides around the globe and it's sort of sinking its tentacles ever more deeply into new areas of the world like Africa, like Western Europe. And that remains the key challenge.Meaning ultimately, we'll defeat then militarily where they exist. The Trump administration, the Pentagon is doing a good job on that. The Obama administration was doing a good job on that in the waning years of the administration. But what we really need to see is an ideological solution to the remaining problem.Gillian -- Andrew Peek. What do you see as the future of the Syrian- Kurdish area where we have all our forces in Syria? I mean it seems like stopping the armament of the Arab rebels against Assad doesn't necessarily mean that Trump has given up on removing Assad eventually. But it just seems like he's putting all his chips in with the Syrian Kurds in the eastern part of the country. Do you think that's about right?TURNER: It does. I would agree with your assessment of what he is trying to accomplish there.Senator McCain was very critical yesterday. It made national and international headlines. He was critical about the President's decision to stop arming some of the more moderate Kurds. The problem is again, we have no the broader strategy -- or we have no broader strategy that the administration has presented for the region.And that's something -- the Trump administration is still on the dime for this. They owe a plan to Congress. They owe a plan to the American people. And I think the sooner they get it out there and open it up for discussion the better.And again, we are not looking for battle plans here, we are looking for a strategy. Because people always push back against me and say well, the Trump administration doesn't want to broadcast its military plans. And that is fine but they do need to broadcast their strategy and the way that they see the United States vis-a-vis the region, the way they see the region's role in the broader world. And that's what we're waiting for.BARTIROMO: We just put up a tweet from John McCain. Did you see that on air? We just put that up on air.TURNER: Yes. Correct.BARTIROMO: Let's put that back up. Andrew -- you've got to speak to this because look what John McCain is saying. The reports that the administration an ending the program to assist Syrian opposition is irresponsible, shortsighted, and plays into Russia, Assad's hands.PEEK: Yes, I just don't think that's right. I mean we are still arming the Syrian Kurds. And there is no situation I see where we allow the Syrian Kurds to be overwhelmed by the Assad forces if for no other reason than it would also -- they'd be attacking our forces as well. So I am not sure McCain's got it entirely right.Gillian -- but just to your point about the strategy, wouldn't you say the engagement with Saudi Arabia over the past six months and the other Sunni Arab states in the Gulf point to a strategy of pushing back Iranian influence and that is kind of the overall Trump administration strategy for the Middle East?TURNER: To engage with the Saudis to hedge in the coalition. The GCC coalition, I guess to hedge against Iran --PEEK: Yes.TURNER: Maybe but they need to say that. I think it's not enough to just do piecemeal, meaning already that strategy has run into some difficulty because Secretary Tillerson made it clear that he wasn't -- he's not happy with what the coalition has done in icing out, freezing out Qatar.So if it is a strategy, there's already areas of disagreement between -- or not disagreement but areas where the United States is not entirely comfortable with what Saudi is doing. And so I don't -- maybe that is the strategy but it needs to be more clearly delivered and executed I think.VERA: Gillian -- Kathryn Rooney Vera here. With regard to North Korea, Americans are largely concerned and a majority think that we may need to go to war with North Korea.China is the great enabler here. What is your view of the Trump administration on dealing with China to deal with North Korea? And can we even really negotiate with someone like North Korea in terms of, you know, mutually assured destruction policy or the like?TURNER: Well, the problem with North Korea -- the problem with dealing with North Korea is that really the only options on the table are some kind of combination of economic sanctions, diplomacy and sort of the increasing military pressure.The option -- the problem is once we go past that in the military realm, what does it look like? Like-- a nuclear holocaust? I mean there's no real -- the idea of going to war with North Korea is sort of off the table in my book, in my opinion because it is too potentially catastrophic at this point.BARTIROMO: By the way, the government is apparently banning its citizens from traveling to North Korea, tourists, starting next month according to two of the biggest travel companies that bring western tourists to the isolated western country.And Dagen -- obviously that comes after that poor Mr. Warmbier came home in a coma and then died.MCDOWELL: Right, absolutely.BARTIROMO: They're banning tours to North Korea.MCDOWELL: But Gillian -- every --TURNER: That's good policy.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: Year after year, for multiple administrations, we have been talking about North Korea using the same rhetoric but it has never gone anywhere. And I wonder, we always point to China but how hard do we need to hit China in terms of economic sanctions, secondary sanctions in order to get that nation to step up and do something about the Hermit Kingdom?TURNER: So the problem with -- another problem is that the United States and North Korea -- the relationship always goes through China. All roads to North Korea go through China and that is because China is the economic powerhouse that sort of sustains the North Korean economy.And as much as the United States wants China to fall in line with our precise interests they just don't. Our national security interests when it comes to North Korea are a little bit divergent.They don't want to see a nuclear rise to North Korea but at the same time a sort of worst-case scenario for them is one in which the North Korean economy collapses, people flee the country. There's a refugee crisis.They're dealing with them being a proximate regional neighbor where the United States isn't. And so they're never going to step up as much as the United States whether it is President Bush, President Obama or President Trump pressuring them as much as we would like them to.And so I think all we can do is try and sustain what is there and build some momentum which is what President Trump is doing. I think he is, you know, he's pushing the gas pedal as hard as he can. He's been talking to the Chinese government weekly since he has been in office but it only is going get him so far.So I think creating a system that keeps the North in check, a regional system is kind of where we are, working with China, working with South Korea, exerting our own economic pressure on them. That's what's in the works now.BARTIROMO: Gillian -- great insights. Thanks so much.TURNER: Thanks -- Maria.BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon. Gillian Turner there.We'll take a break.When we come back O.J. Simpson, he got parole yesterday. The notorious former NFL star could be a free man as soon as October. But where will he go next? We will take a look at his options.And then a jolt for GE, General Electric delivers a double beat in the second quarter. Stock is off of its earlier highs. It is better than 1 percent right now. What is the focus for GE? And what about its guidance? Next -- we will check out the numbers.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.YouTube putting its plan to combat extremist content into action.Lea Gabrielle with the details. Lea -- good morning.LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Maria.Well, YouTube is now redirecting ISIS recruiting clips to antiterrorist videos. The move following an initiative by the video-sharing site and its parent company Google to combat online extremism content.Well, many advisers pulled their business from YouTube after discovering that their ads were played on videos that were actually promoting terrorism.Some sad news in the music world, the front man for the band Linkin Park, Chester Bennington has died.(MUSIC)GABRIELLE: Bennington was found dead in his California home yesterday morning due to an apparent suicide. He was 41 years old. Linkin Park was one of the most successful bands of the 2000s. Rising to the scene with a rock-rock sound that helped to sell them more 70 million records. The band was set to kick off their "One More Light" tour next week.And O.J. Simpson's time in prison is nearing an end. Nevada officials granting parole to the 70-year-old former football star. Simpson could be released as early as October after serving nearly nine years for the armed robbery of sports memorabilia from a Las Vegas hotel room. Simpson was famously acquitted in the 1995 murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ronald Goldman -- Maria.BARTIROMO: All right. Thank you so much.O.J. -- I felt like it was a deja vu yesterday. We were all focused on what was happening. I will say this. I thought he handled himself very well in the parole hearing. Did you watch any of this?MCDOWELL: I did. I watched a better portion of it but that line about I have led a conflict free life.BARTIROMO: Well, that was really creative.MCDOWELL: I mean can we all get some of that self-delusion?BARTIROMO: Weren't there calls about, you know, from Nicole Simpson Brown that, you know, she was getting beaten up all the time?MCDOWELL: Yes. He beat her mercilessly before he murdered her and Ron Goldman.BARTIROMO: But as a lot of lawyers have said -- as the letter of the law, he was arrested for what he did in terms of stealing and, you know, armed robbery, taking his property back.MCDOWELL: People talk about what --BARTIROMO: He was not convicted for the murder.MCDOWELL: Right. What's his next step? What is he going to do? Any money that he makes at this point goes to pay the settlement that the Goldman family won in the civil lawsuit. It's tens of millions of dollars, north of $30 million. But he gets a pension from I believe the Screen Actors Guild, but primarily the NFL that runs into the NFL pension according to one report is $25,000 a month. That is untouchable under law -- under pension law.BARTIROMO: So he's still getting it.MCDOWELL: He still gets his pension and the Goldman family can't lay claim to that. So he's got a good amount of money coming in even if he does nothing --BARTIROMO: Wow, that's interesting.MCDOWELL: -- even if he does nothing.PEEK: I have to say, I thought he came off terribly, you know.BARTIROMO: You did.PEEK: I don't know why in that situation you would say anything other than I am sorry, I feel terrible and I'm a reformed prisoner.Why is he relitigating the facts of the case before the parole board? They are not the judge, they are there to assess his behavior.BARTIROMO: He said it was my property, trying to defend his action. Yes. All right. Well, He is probably going to be a free man come October. This is what happened -- this is what took place yesterday.We'll take a break. We want to show you the violence in Venezuela that has kicked up again. Look at these pictures. Tensions are flaring. Millions are joining in opposition strike against the Maduro regime. The fallout from the crisis coming up.And a bright spot for GE -- General Electric delivering a double beat in the second quarter, earnings and revenue above estimates. But look at this. It's been up, down, up -- now it's up half of a percent. Investors are not sure how to digest this quarter. We're going to look at it when we come right back.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Take a look at General Electric this morning. The company's second quarter earnings topped expectations. Stock is up a quarter of a percent. That's off of the highs but it's off of the lows as well.Joining us right now is Glenmede director of investment strategy Jason Pride. Jason -- good to see you.JASON PRIDE, DIRECTOR OF INVESTMENT STRATEGY, GLENMEDE: It's nice to see you. Thanks for having me on.BARTIROMO: Yes. So 13 Dow components set to report earnings this week. It's a big week obviously for earnings. Next week is an even bigger week for earnings. Characterize the backdrop for investing in the stock market right now.PRIDE: You know, the backdrop is this earnings season is pretty good. It's actually not as good as the first quarter. The first quarter felt a lot stronger. We saw 14 percent headline number. We're seeing about, you know, 6 percent to 8 percent. I think probably --BARTIROMO: On profit growth. Profit growth.PRIDE: -- the upper end of profit growth at the end of the quarter. But still that is a lot better than we were seeing last year and even kind of, you know, a year and a half ago. So decent earnings growth, I think the thing that investors are dealing with and we hear all the time from our clients is valuations are a little bit high, feels a little extended.Should we be playing defense more than we are, how do you deal with it at this point in the economic cycle? And you know, we are cautioning investors on don't get over your skis but at the same time really don't bail on equities just because the valuation numbers on the higher end of the range.BARTIROMO: Yes. Because profits are up and so are valuations.MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly. And in terms of like your fixed income, what do you do with fixed income? Because I always watch the 10-year treasury and we're looking -- it is still at 2.26 percent.(CROSSTALK)PRIDE: Yes, I think at this point --BARTIROMO: That says a lot.MCDOWELL: But that still is -- that yields at a level that at least bond investors being the worrywarts that they are seem to suggest that there is weaker growth down the road.PRIDE: I think there's a pretty simple answer to that. The yields are low, your return expectations from that should be low, you underweight it. You know, fair and simple.Now the thing that you do have to do is when you're keeping the whole --MCDOWELL: But you knew the overweight --PRIDE: Well, no -- there are other things to do. You can build on alternatives, you can have a slightly higher equity waiting. Alternatives is our primary way to kind of deal with that underweighted fixed income.But the fixed income itself is kind of interesting. We are saying you want to underweight it. You want to be careful not to take it too far, right. Because if we have one of these market corrections and we have kind of done the analysis, looked back at it historically through time.On average we see one 5 to 15 percent market correction every year. And when you have those environments, invariably you get 10 percent or more market correction the bond portfolio independent of the starting point of yield goes up when the equities go down.You're going to really want at least a portion of the portfolio doing exactly that to give you something to harvest on one side in order to buy on the other side and make you feel like your portfolio is not all in this area that is dropping like mad.And that's really important to kind of have that balance. We are saying have a little bit less of that balance right now because the return availability there is not that good but still have some of it.BARTIROMO: You also want to have some exposure not just to stocks in the U.S. but international -- right.PRIDE: We think that's where you're going to get your growth. So when you're taking risks you need to think about where is our risk dollar better placed? We think our risk dollars are better placed internationally. The valuations are better.The European, Japanese economy, the emerging markets economy -- they are all actually dealing kind of similar -- it's kind of a global, synchronized economic expansion at this point in time. And the discounts are sitting over there. So you know there's more upside and you know, something goes wrong, well, you know, maybe their economy is correct but the markets here are overpriced and can correct more just on valuation basis.So we're kind of saying ok, expose your self on that side of the equation and then add a couple things to you. You know, emerging-market particularly the consumer story, the growth is alive and well in Asia. That consumer growth story has been there. We have been playing it for like, I think it's six years now. And we still think it is alive and well.And the Japan reform story is monstrous I think. It's a big change in the way corporations are operating. And I don't think --BARTIROMO: So you want to buy Japan.PRIDE: I don't think the investors have caught up on it. I remember, you know, for the past 20 years or so investors have been saying don't touch Japan. All you get is 4 percent return on equity. They are not using their capital correctly. Well, now, you are getting 8 percent return on capital.It's growing. Every year I feel like that number, every time I look at it the return on equity it's another percent higher. Corporations are buying back stock. They're paying out dividends. They are not following -- they're not taking their money and spending it on lucrative projects that do nothing for their businesses. They are actually acting like, you know, a more developed market, efficient market place that is shareholder friendly. We like that.BARTIROMO: Sounds like you're going to keep putting money into this market even though valuations are where they are.PRIDE: You just got to be picky. You've got to be pickyBARTIROMO: Jason -- great to see you. Thanks so much.PRIDE: Nice being on.BARTIROMO: Jason Pride joining us there.Coming up tax reform takes center stage. House Speaker Paul Ryan sheds new light on the Republican plan to overhaul the tax code. His message next.And then holograms hitting the gridiron. I will talk with a high-tech startup that could revolutionize the way NFL teams practice.Stay with us. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Friday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Friday, July 21st.Your top stories right now at 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.Pushing forward on the agenda as the Senate looks to vote to repeal Obamacare. Many are asking when tax reform will come. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan weighed in yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Our plan is really simple. It is to get businesses competitive again. We are going to slash the corporate tax rate to level the playing field and the business tax rate for all businesses to level all the playing fields for companies like this.We got to get these tax rates down because when we're taxing our businesses at much, much higher tax rates than our foreign competitors are taxing theirs, we're not going to win in that exchange.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: More on the battle on Capitol Hill coming up this morning. Meanwhile, the chaos continuing in Venezuela, at least three people were killed as protesters clashed with police. The very latest on the escalating tensions coming up.Ford eyes our heroes in blue, the details behind the automaker's new truck made for police.And earnings, the story once again on Wall Street, among them General Electric, the company's top expectations for the second quarter, stocks has been all over the map now, now it's trading down a fraction, $26.66 on GE even though earnings and revenue above estimates.Futures meanwhile shows the markets look like this this morning and we are looking at some selling. DOW Industrial down about 20 points, Nasdaq down about 10 points.In Europe, mixed performances to report, take a look, their too earnings are driving the story as well as the ECB. The CAC Krones is down two- thirds of a percent, the DAX Index down almost one percent. Right here is the low of the morning in Europe. In Asia Overnight, markets were mostly lower, as you see there fractional moves.Plus, technology hitting the field, how the Baltimore Ravens are using technology to prepare for the upcoming NFL season, pretty cool stuff and we've got it here.Our top story this half an hour right, first, a path to tax reform. House Speaker Paul Ryan visited the new Balance Factory yesterday in Lawrence, Massachusetts where he told reporters that republicans are more united on tax reform compared to healthcare. He also said the tax reform could get done as early as this year.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RYAN: We're going to get this done in 2017. We're going to get this done because we have to get this done.The competitiveness of our economy, the viability of our jobs, making sure that we can be competitive, that we can grow, that we can create, that we can raise families and have faster growth and not just the economy but our wages, our standard of living.We cannot miss this once in a lifetime opportunity. This is a once in a generation moment, it is time to cut taxes and simplify the code. It is time to create jobs and grow our economy.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Let's talk about that. And bringing in Congressman Marsha Blackburn. Congressman, it's good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.REP. MARSHA BLACKBURN, (R) TENNESSEE: You too. Sure.BARTIROMO: I know that you agree with Speaker Ryan. You've talked about this before on this program but I kind of ask you to talk to us about a path to see this happening congressman because, I don't know, I've been asking this question today and yesterday, is it time to ask the question if the GOP is really wanting this president to succeed?I mean, here we are six months in congressman, how do you get to tax reform?BLACKBURN: And the way you get to tax reform is for us to say, yes, this president deserves to succeed because the American people deserve to succeed.And what we want to do is see productivity, there are a lot of innovative companies out here that have been waiting on tax reform, waiting on healthcare reform for a couple of reasons, they want to add employees and they want to grow their businesses.They are looking for export market and they want some certainty, some stability and Maria, one of the things I think is so important and the reason we have to look at the business side of this tax code is with technology and utilization of technology, if you're going to do upgrades or reposition or change manufacturing processes, and that involves technology, you want to be able to write that off sooner rather than later.It's not going to be 15 years, it's going to be closer to two years that you want to have that write down. So getting in there, looking at the environment as it is and saying, "How do we make this competitive so that these new companies, new starts have the opportunity to grow to be global entities, we have to get this done.BARTIROMO: Yes. You're speaking to the choir here congressman. We understand all the reasons why you've got to get tax reform done. We got it, we understand the economy and what business needs right now.BLACKBURN: Yes, you do.BARTIROMO: But how are you going to get there? I mean the fact is that you had all of these debates on healthcare, are you going to have the same debates on tax reform when it comes to what the corporate rates should be, what the deductions are that should stay and what should go, border adjustment tax?And also, who's holding back progress congressman? It's time to start calling those people out, who's standing in the way in the president's agenda? American voters want this to be executed.BLACKBURN: You're exactly right. And I think that individuals need to be holding their senators and representatives accountable to taking action.They want to see things done. They want the "Get it done" caucus to rule the day and for people to come together and I tell you what, I have heard from so many people yesterday at a Farmers Market here in my district, people were saying, "Why can't democrats and republicans work together?"I went to a meeting with innovators, technology innovators last evening and they were asking the same question and I think the best way to do that is for the voters to weigh in, individuals to weigh in and say, "We expect you to get to the table to negotiate --"DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX CORRESPONDENT: Congressman, they did that. They elected -- the republicans have a majority --BLACKBURN: I'm with you.MCDOWELL: -- in the senate and you all aren't doing anything. Now, to your credit, the republicans in the house did at least move the healthcare reform bill.BARTIROMO: Yes, they did.MCDOWELL: You did at least move that but somehow the republicans in the house with all their desperate ideas did something that the senators couldn't but with regard to tax reform, what is the biggest stumbling block?Is the border adjustment tax off the table? Do we not -- can we get past that and say, "We're not going to use that" is that off the table, what is the biggest stumbling block?BLACKBURN: Dagen, I do think the border adjustment tax is off the table. The reason for that is you have to say, "What is the value-added there? And nobody can seem to give a definitive answer on the value-added.When it comes to tax, timing is part of the process, making certain that a budget is there so tax can go through on reconciliation. I agree with what many have said, let's look at the way this was approached.When Reagan did his tax reform and did it on a bipartisan basis, that is going to be important to democrats many times are not wanting to work on anything. Now as far as productivity in the house, yes, we passed over 300 bills out of the house and we want the senate to catch up with us.I think they've done about 120 bills and it's important for them to begin to take action, some of these rules, regulations, bills we're passing that deal with efficiencies that are embedded in the economy.Rolling back regulations, those things need to get across the finish line and I will say, on some of those smaller measures, yes, we have seen bipartisan support on the big measures, healthcare, tax reform, so far we're not seeing that bipartisan support. And this is where constituents need to be weighing in with their elected representatives.MCDOWELL: You're already running for next year congressman, that's the way that it sounds is that you're asking voters to go out there and vote the democrats out next year when in fact if the republicans don't get something done, all of your jobs are on the line.BLACKBURN: I agree with you on that. But constituents weighing in with those congressional offices and saying, "I would like to see something get done" those offices pay attention to that.And if members are hearing from their constituents that they want them to come to the table and work for the good of the country, that has a bearing and at this point when you have some who were saying, "We're not going to come to the table" I think hearing from their constituents that there is an expectation that for the good of the country you're going to get this done.Look at what just slowing the marginal rates would do, if people could go back and reset their withholding, what is coming out of their paychecks? Increase that take home pay, just being able to do that because all of our tax reform will be retroactive to January 1 of 2017. That is --BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes. But you know what, you're talking about cutting taxes on individual rates which is, of course, what everybody wants you to do. But then you've got some people in the caucus that say, "Well, if you're going to cut taxes that much, we need revenue somewhere," right?I mean Speaker Ryan did not mention that border adjustment tax at all yesterday even though, of course, we know he championed it in the past. But Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan had real opinions about this yesterday.He joined us yesterday congressman, I want you to hear what he had to say about this whole fight on taxes, it doesn't sound like it's going to be easy. Here's Jim Jordan.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. JIM JORDAN (R) OHIO: This idea that it's going to be revenue neutral, we're opposed to that. Many of us conservatives, we think that's just a fancy way of saying that the tax burden stays the same.But we're all for tax reform and lowering the tax burden on families and creating a tax code that's conducive to economic growth but we don't want this border adjustment tax which is a whole new tax code on the American economy. We don't want that in the plan.So show us the plan then we'll pass the budget. If we're actually achieving the savings we need to and putting together the right kind of tax plan.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Not on the same page, huh, congressman?BLACKBURN: Well I think that what you're doing is working out some of those finishing details. Revenue neutral, people want tax reform to be a net positive not only to their personal economy but to the nation's economy.And as Mike Mulvaney said yesterday, sometimes you're going to see that the deficit will tick up or the CBO's estimate on the deficit are going to tick up because you're going to lead to growth in revenue, an economic growth.It would be great to have a GDP growth at 3.5 percent. And then that is going to give you more revenues and CBO gets these numbers wrong a lot of times and you all know how they do. They don't utilize the dynamic scoring and they don't take into consideration that a change in policy is going to lead to a change in action which leads to a change in revenue.KATHRYN ROONEY VERA, BULLTICK CAPITAL MARKET HEAT OF RESEARCH AND CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST: Congressman, my fear is that this reform can be revenue neutral but that could not happen and tax could end up just like the healthcare bill did.Reforming social welfare programs or eliminating the vast deductions. Every year we have $1.5 trillion of deductions but these are politically very difficult. So we have the most backward tax system in the developed world. There's massive incentives to take profits offshore, keep them there, inversions, et cetera --BARTIROMO: Well they want that $5 trillion back.ROONEY VERA: We want the $5 trillion back and there's such a clear incentive to small businesses, let are the ones that pays the tax.BARTIROMO: Well she knows that. Yes.ROONEY VERA: So my question then congressman is, if we -- if you can't get it through consideration -- reconciliation, is there any chance that Mitch McConnell will consider basically nuking the nuke which means that you don't get into reconciliation but you ram it through just -- on the similar lines that we do with the Supreme Court?BLACKBURN: I hope he does.BARTIROMO: You want to see that?BLACKBURN: You know, I got to tell you, I would love to see the nuclear option use for healthcare and for tax reform so that we can move on to things like infrastructure, broadband expansion.Some of the items that the American people want to see done and I think that it may be time to declare the nuclear option and say, "Let's get the wheels turning, let's get the economy back on track."ANDREW PEEK, FORMER INTELLIGENCE OFFICER: Congressman, Steve Bannon suggest raising the tax rate up to perhaps 40 percent for the top personal income tax bracket. Would you support a tax reform package that kept the top personal rate stable or increased it?BLACKBURN: I would rather say that rate come down because you're going to see more growth in innovation and if you do that.We all know that the formula, less regulation, less litigation, less taxation leads to more innovation and job creation and if you have some of those top income earners and they are looking for the opportunity to do innovation in new starts, that is jobs growth.And that is where people are going to be able to increase their wages because there's more competition for that labor and you all know that cycle very well. So the lower the rates on those marginal rates, the better it is.I do think doing the marginal rates sooner rather than later has the benefit of allowing families to go in there and reset that withholding and to take home more of that paycheck which means they're going to be spending that for kids, for schools, for activities, for meals, for consumer goods. And that has an impact. Those consumer economics count.BARTIROMO: So is that going to get any traction, the Bannon comment about the highest rate staying all the way up 40 percent, is that going to gain any traction do you think?BLACKBURN: I --BARTIROMO: I know you're not for it but what about your colleagues?BLACKBURN: I'm not sure you're going to see a lot of people for that. That may have the popularity of the VAT tax.BARTIROMO: Okay. All right. Congressman, good to see you. Thanks so much.BLACKBURN: Good to see you.BARTIROMO: I think that's your best joke ever. Congressman Marsha Blackburn, good to see you. Have a great day. We'll be right back, stay with.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A Deadly clash between police and protesters in Venezuela, millions of people joining a nationwide strike, it is chaos there. Lea Gabrielle with the story, Lea.LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning Maria. Well that's right. At least three people were killed and hundreds of others were arrested during the general strike.The opposition called the nationwide strike against the government's plan to rewrite the constitution but President Nicholas Maduro pledged to go ahead with reshaping the government.Now Cleveland Brown Stadium, get this, may have been constructed using material that could be responsible for last month's deadly apartment fire in London. Promotional brochures for Revenant aluminum panels which are made by Arconic say the panels were installed on the stadium.It isn't clear whether the stadium was actually built with the panel because building records are incomplete. The London apartment fire killed about 80 people.And check this out, Ford taking the wraps of the first pickup trucks specifically designed for use by the police. The Ford F150 Responder all trick out to chase criminal off road has a 375 horsepower turbo charge, V6 engine, special brakes and suspension and can hit 100 miles per hour on the street. Well shares of Ford are under pressure in premarket trading.And get this, a bag of moon dust from NASA's Apollo 11 mission has sold for $1.8 million at a Sotheby's Auction this week. A Chicago woman purchased the bag at a federal auction for just under $1,000. Well NASA said it was a mistake and then tried to get it back after realizing what it actually was.But the woman won a court battle and she now has scored an out of this world return on her investment. Maria, I guess you could say she's over the moon about it.BARTIROMO: Yes. But what she going to do with it?GABRIELLE: Well she's selling it and making money.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, okay. Then the person's buying it, what are they going to do with it, the bag of moon dust? I don't know.MCDOWELL: I don't know, put it in a shake?BARTIROMO: But you're right, it's a good term.MCDOWELL: Put it in a smoothie.BARTIROMO: A smoothie? Okay.MCDOWELL: Magical healing property.PEEK: This is just recreational moon dust though. There's no -- not medicinal.ROONEY VERA: (INAUDIBLE) put it on -- somebody's going to pay a fortune for it.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll take a break. When we come back, high-tech blips on the company that's bringing holograms to the football field, this is very cool. It's helping NFL teams train, we'll show it to you next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The Baltimore Ravens have five more days to go until the team heads to training camp and their first opponents will be holographic NFL players.The team will be using an interactive program called pre-game prep to make up for the lost time in the field created by the new tech startup, Mixed River. The program helps develop animated 3D plays and opponents for the Raven to tackle.Joining us right now is the CEO of Mixed River, Jim Pietila. Jim, good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.JIM PIETILA, CEO, MIXED RIVER: Well thank you for having me. It's a pleasure to be here, absolutely.BARTIROMO: We've been -- yes. We've been talking about this technology all morning, it looks great. The players I guess will be wearing Microsoft HoloLens headsets to use this program.PIETILA: Yes. Yes, something like this.BARTIROMO: Explain how this works. The -- wait, show that again? Show that again Jim?PIETILA: Sure.BARTIROMO: Yes.PIETILA: Sure. This is the HoloLens, this is what generates the 3D animated holograms.BARTIROMO: And tell us how it works.PIETILA: You put -- yes, you just put it on your head like that and then the players appear right in front of you. So the -- how does it work? Well you have to start from the beginning, you got to create a couple of plays.And once you've got some plays created, you create some pretty snap movements, you create some post snap movements and what that allows you to do is you put jerseys on the players, you put skin tone, you put numbers.And once the players are created, from there you have the ability to project the players up on to either a large computer screen, a large projection wall, or in the case of the holograms, you project it up to the holograms and -- I mean the HoloLens.And the HoloLens then creates the field, not only does it create the players but it creates the fields, creates the markings and can create both sides of the ball too. You're can have the offense and the defense.ROONEY VERA: This is really fascinating. I think artificial intelligence and virtual reality is the new industrial revolution and beyond.How have you quantify the gains and productivity and efficiencies in savings monetarily from, for example, entry-related issues on the practice field?PIETILA: Well that's something that we're going to figure out over this next year is what does the off field time versus the on field time, is there any impact?Right now we honestly do not know. The idea is that when you take these -- either the HoloLens or use the projection version of our product, you increase the player's mental edge. You give them the visualization and the cues that allows them to hopefully see what they're going to see in the upcoming week.And so with regards to player injury and things like that, this is all a noncontact environment, you're in a classroom, you're in an auditorium, you're in a gymnasium, you're somewhere other than on the football field without somebody across from you.So you do have the ability to move and that's one of the beautiful things about the Mixed Reality application is you're not encapsulated purely in a virtual reality world, you can move around.As you saw from the clip I saw earlier that you had -- you can actually walk around the field, you can walk around the holograms and you can interact with them. Tackling them, maybe not but definitely have the ability to watch what they do and react to them.PEEK: Jim, I have to ask you, if I had equipment that could create holographic NFL players, I would just hang out with them all day. How is that not a problem for you?PIETILA: Well our holographic players don't talk too much, at least right now and they're kind of boring. So they just do what we tell them to do, sorry.PEEK: Give them a few beers.BARTIROMO: Pretty incredible. You founded this company --PIETILA: Yes, absolutely.BARTIROMO: -- a year ago and already you're changing the way things are done with the -- in the NFL. Congrats Jim, good to see you. Thanks so much.PIETILA: Again, thank you for having me, it's a pleasure to be here.BARTIROMO: We'll be watching Mixed River. Jim Pietila joining us there. Still ahead, look like a Mac, McDonald's is cooking up its own clothing line, how you could snag a piece of the free merchandize, next hour of MORNINGS WITH MARIA right here.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Happy Friday everybody, good Friday morning. I'm Maria Bartiromo, thanks for joining us. It is Friday, July 21st. Your top stories right now 8:00a.m. on the East Coast.The battle to repeal and replace ObamaCare rages on this morning, a new report from the Congressional Budget Office says that the senate's latest bill would leave 22 million fewer people insured over the decade but it would also save $420 billion.Senator Ted Cruz says it is time for the GOP to make good on its promise of reform.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, (R) TEXAS: It is simple, what do we stand for and who are we? And the message that I'm conveying to my colleagues is real simple, let's do what we said we would do.For seven years we've campaigned on repealing ObamaCare, we got the chance to do it. We're either going to step up to the bar and keep our word or we're going to look the voters in the eye and break our word.(END VIDEO CLIP)Load-Date: July 22, 2017End of Document

Welcome back, everybody. Thank you so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. It is Wednesday, June 7th. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Breaking news this morning, President Trump has selected his pick for FBI Director, he just tweeted moments ago he will nominate Christopher Wray to replace Jim Comey. This comes a day ahead of Comey's testimony before the Senate Intel Committee tomorrow.Markets are near the flatline right now in addition to the Jim Comey testimony tomorrow. Investors are also waiting on the European Central Bank decision will there be more stimulus, what's happening with interest rates, and of course the British election. That vote is also, we're going to take you there live. I'll be covering that all day tomorrow. Futures indicating a fractionally higher opening for the broader averages. Dow industrials up six, NASDAQ up seven.In Europe, markets are little changed, very similar situation, but the banks are stronger today, that's because there was a deal in Europe, Spain's Santander is acquiring Banco Popular, saving that bank from collapse. Santander will look to raise $8 billion to cover cost of bolstering Banco Popular's balance sheet. In Asia overnight, mixed performances, take a look. Best performer was China, Shanghai Composite up one and a quarter percent.Breaking news this morning. Terrorism in Tehran. ISIS has claimed responsibility for a pair of attacks in the capital of Iran. Iran state media says 12 people had been killed. Gunmen targeted Parliament and the shrine to Ayatollah Khomeini.Uber takes action after the harassment probe, the company has fired 20 employees, it's planning to make another change other workplace changes, we will be watching for any new information coming out of Uber.And a special tribute to Old Glory. The image of a young boy saluting the flag goes viral. We've got those details. All those stories coming up this morning. And joining me to talk all about it, Fox Business Networks Dagen McDowell, Recon Capital Chief Investment Officer Kevin Kelly, and Maslansky and Partners president, Lee Carter. Breaking news right in the middle of the show, guys. Big story.KEVIN KELLY, RECON CAPITAL CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER: Just when we thought this week was busy enough with tons going on in the market and politics.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: And he's doing this ahead of the Congress testimony.KELLY: Of course.MCDOWELL: So, again, it says that he is on the job, to at least announce his nominee for the --to replace Comey.LEE CARTER, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS PRESIDENT: But I'm really surprised at his choice. I really am still reeling from this choice.MCDOWELL: Why?CARTER: Because I was so sure it ways is going to be a policeman, it was somebody -- he talked so much about national security getting a harder on terrorism protecting the people. I would have expected any more than that than a litigator. I think it's a fascinating choice and I can't help wondering why.BARTIROMO: Let's get to Blake Burman. He's got more details on this. The president just tweeted this that he is going to be nominating Christopher Wray. He says the man of impeccable credentials to be the new director of the FBI. He says details to follow. Blake Burman is at the White House right now with more. Blake, good morning.BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you. Two notes on Christopher Wray this morning. He was the lead of the Department of Justice criminal decision in 2003, `04, and '05. The main case that he was known for during his tenure in the George W. Bush administration was his involvement with Enron, after that or at least in the most recent years, he has gone into private practice.He is a litigator here in Washington, D.C., and in his private days, he is known for representing the New Jersey Governor Chris Christie for his involvement or at least the questioning of Christie during the Bridgegate Scandal. Now he is President Trump's nominee to lead the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the process from here for Wray will play on out. Of course, this announcement comes the day before Jim Comey comes to Capitol Hill to testify about what the president may or may not have said in their private conversations.When you step back here, Maria, and you look at how he got to this point, of course, it all began with the president firing Jim Comey earlier this year. And then the search was launched by the Department of Justice. The president had interviewed several candidates. The president had identified himself before he went on to his first foreign trip that Joe Lieberman was the lead candidate. It seem like we were just potentially hours away from that announcement.However there was big pushback from Democrats, many people saying they didn't want anybody too political, Lieberman pulled his name out and then there was a new search that was launched, it was John Pistole and Christopher Wray who were then identified potentially as the top two and now we have the announcement, Maria, of Wray.BARTIROMO: All right. We - all right. Thank you so much. Blake Burman is at the White House. I want to bring in House Majority Leader Congressman Kevin McCarthy right now. Congressman, good to have you on the program. Good morning to you.KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: Good morning. Thanks for having me back on.BARTIROMO: Your thoughts, Congressman on this naming of Christopher Wray, obviously the president saying that he's going to nominate him, he is the former assistant attorney general in charge of the U.S. Department of Justice's criminal division. What are your thoughts?MCCARTHY: I don't know him personally but he's a well-qualified. You look at his background from the U.S. attorney and others, he is qualified to run the agency, he's been confirmed before by the Senate unanimously. So I think there's a great opportunity here.BARTIROMO: Was there a - was there a pressure on the president to make a nomination announcement right before Jim Comey goes to testify tomorrow? We know that that's going to really be the focus of so many attention tomorrow.MCCARTHY: I don't believe so. He's been going about this, looking at individuals, interviewing I know. Different individuals throughout, so I think just when he felt that he found the right person, that he would - he would nominate him.BARTIROMO: Yes. We were - we were all surprised on panel because he's talked so much about law and order, we thought it would be a law and order candidate like a Ray Kelly or somebody who has police background and yet it's a lawyer.MCCARTHY: Well, you also have to understand, you've got to run the entire agency, you've got to have experience with it. And I think this is probably a very good selection for him to make sure this agency comes back together. This agency has had some real challenges internally, so I want to see it build and be even stronger.BARTIROMO: All right. Congressman, let me move on to the domestic agenda. I know you've been working hard on this and yesterday you had a meeting with the president. Can you tell us about that meeting in terms of what you talked about in terms of the domestic agenda?MCCARTHY: It was a very good meeting. Now, it was bicameral with the Senate leadership and the House leadership. Now, remember we have been able to pass the health care bill out of House, the Senate is working on that. So we're getting an update there, talking about where we will move next on to -- one the budget, and then tax reform, we had Secretary of Treasury Mnuchin in the room as well. So it's really getting on a regular basis back together, analyzing and just measuring the metrics, where we currently are, where we're moving forward and where we can constantly improve.BARTIROMO: Well, you couldn't have timed it better with the news flow, that's for sure, the -- one of the lead stories ensures Ohio exit ups the ante for the GOP, one of the headlines in the journal today. We know that Anthem, the insurance company has now pulled out of Ohio, one more insurance company to pull out. Now we've got almost another insurers stepped up. 25 counties in Missouri also facing the same situation after Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City pulled out. What are your thoughts on Obamacare right now?MCCARTHY: You have Iowa that 94 out of 99 counties will not have the insurance. This is continual basis every single week that's happening, that Obamacare has collapsed and then think about what the premiums of those that actually do have the insurance, Health and Human Services came out with a study that premiums have increased more than a hundred percent, doubled in this timeline. So this is really been a major failure and that is why we have focused on being able to repeal and replace Obamacare to provide the healthcare for those people who need it. I think it has been lost in this debate that a lot of people are just focusing on the bill but they need for it and I think that's going to continue to happen week over week.BARTIROMO: But because you have been focused on this and working on a replacement bill for some time now, a lot of people say now the Republicans own it, right? And the Dems are trying to turn this around and say the reason that Obamacare is failing is because uncertainty. Let me read you a line from Anthem CEO who basically said we're pulling out, citing uncertainty surrounding key issues including federal cost sharing payments that help reduce cost for low-income ACA enrollees.Now we know that the house Republican health bill did not even include any appropriation for those payments for next year, President Trump has threatened to stop them. So how much responsibility should the GOP take on Obamacare failing even further right now?MCCARTHY: Well, let's just put in perspective, no bill has passed and changed Obamacare 18 of the 23 co-ops have collapsed, your premiums had doubled, they want to increase again next year, the insurance companies have pulled out without a bill passing, before we even got here, so I think that's a lot of smoke and mirrors, to me it's almost laughable that the Democrats would even bring that forward. I think they're embarrassed of their votes for Obamacare.We're actually going to save the process in the - in the Republican bill, we would continue those payments, we would have a smooth transition for the next two years and then put the new system up and running for the individual. So I think that's a very weak argument. I think it's a place that the Democrats are just trying to stretch too because they cannot answer the question about their vote for Obamacare and how bad it is failed the American public.BARTIROMO: And we know that now 32 percent of all U.S. counties are down to one health exchange insurer at this point. So you said a moment ago, you talked to the president with your about colleagues where we stand right now. Where do we stand, Congressman? Tell us what you're looking at in terms of healthcare reform, getting a will be from Senate and then on to tax reform.MCCARTHY: We that's a great question. If I could first put it, remember the first thousand - first hundred days, what's interesting there's this company called Quorom. It's a - I think a couple of Harvard students retired or graduate and created this company. They're all about measurements. If you take the first 100 days from H.W. Bush forward on Congress, the number of bills passed, you know which Congress is the most productive, the one we're currently in with more than 103 bills passed in those first 100 days.Then if you look at the president's the same time period, the number of bills signed, President Barack Obama signed 15 bills in his first 100 days, President Trump has signed 30. So we dealt with the regulatory, we've moved out of the house, the healthcare bill, it is now in the Senate, we expect them to get that done before we leave on August break. We will then move into tax reform, we're having those hearings right now in the house.Which is the appropriate place, because remember the constitution, article one, section seven, all tax reform starts in the house, once we get that done, then that will move to the Senate, and then will move on to infrastructure. I think we've got a very full plate before us, we're going to get this done and this will continue to be one of the most productive Congresses we've had in quite some time.BARTIROMO: Well, you certainly have had a lot of productivity in terms of the rolling back regulations, and all that you have just outlined but you can understand the concern on the part of the American people given that you only have 42 scheduled work days left, between now and the end of the fiscal year and 42 days is when you and your colleagues in Senate are both working, the House Freedom Caucus is saying they want to cancel August Recess to continue working. Would you cancel August Recess if it's not done?MCCARTHY: Look, what I think is let's do the work right now, people aren't even talking about what's on the floor this week. The choice act, repealing Dodd-Frank, getting capital back into the market, making our community banks actually able to work again. We're very productive as we go, I don't want to worry about the future. I'm actually going to get everything done right now and make it happen.BARTIROMO: But do your members understand the severity of this timeline that if you don't get something done in terms of tax reform, I feel like that's what America voted for. They want tax reform, they want jobs, they want movements on economic growth. If you don't get that done in fiscal year 2017, you're going to lose - you could lose the house next year, are you prepared for that?MCCARTHY: Look, I am well aware of this, the public put their trust into us and we have to get the job done. And we will not stop working until we get this job done.BARTIROMO: So, in other words, you would cancel the August Recess then if you don't get it done?MCCARTHY: I will make sure we get our job done and make sure we get everything moving forward, we focus on jobs. This election was about those individuals that have fallen back in the last eight years. When you look at last eight years of the past administration, and you take their highest growth year, that is still lower than the lowest growth year under Bill Clinton. The middle class has fallen behind in this process. We've got to get America working again and that has been the focus of this president.It's always continuing about jobs. When you look at the Congressional Review Act where in the history of America only one has been signed into law. He has now signed 14 of those, getting a number of billions of dollars off the back of business in America, growing again.BARTIROMO: Right.MCCARTHY: Healthcare, we look at the collapse, we've got that through the house, it's now in the Senate, tax reform, so we could actually be competitive, that is what we want to do. I always bank on America. If we have a level-playing field we will win.BARTIROMO: Congressman, let me ask you about tax reform for a second before you go.MCCARTHY: Sure.BARTIROMO: What's the low-hanging fruit? What are the easy things that you think that you've got common ground on with the Senate? Because everybody is saying, look, they're going to have the same battle that they had in healthcare, over tax reform and he's going to stretch out and he's not going to get done. So where is the low-hanging fruit that you can agree with your colleagues on Senate on?MCCARTHY: Well, the very first low-hanging fruit is that we work - we learn from the lessons of healthcare and we work closely together. And remember, the administration didn't have everybody appointed yet even, Tom Price wasn't appointed when we were moving through healthcare at the very beginning. So we have everybody together, working in the process, so we all have synergy. Corporate rate is too high. It's the highest rate in the world.We have to lower that to make it competitive. It is too confusing why do we have seven individual rates, why don't we just have three of those. Why don't we actually lower the rates to make it more competitive for people to keep more of what they earn and have greater investment in America? Change the structure of tax where they actually don't benefit you to import or give you the benefit to export where you create more jobs in America.BARTIROMO: All right. We leave it there. Congressman, we are watching, obviously, we're rooting for you and colleagues that you get something done this year. Good to see you, sir.MCCARTHY: Always great to see you.BARTIROMO: Thank you. Congressman Kevin McCarthy joining us and we will be right back.BARTIROMO: Breaking news for those of you who are just joining us, President Trump has nominated a new FBI Chief, the president tweeted this morning. I will be nominating Christopher A. Wray, a man of impeccable credentials to be the next director of FBI. Details to follow. Now, Christopher Wray worked in President George W. Bush's Justice Department as former assistant attorney general in the criminal division. He also oversaw the Enron task force. We will bring you any developments that come in on the potential FBI Director to take the helm next.Meanwhile, ISIS is claiming responsibility for two deadly terrorist attacks in Tehran, Iran. Cheryl Casone with the details. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. We've been following getting some new details on this one, Maria. Gunmen stormed Iran's Parliament in the shrine of Ayatollah Khomeini in Tehran this morning. Killing at least 12 people, wounding dozens more. Four people also reportedly have been taken hostage in the Parliament, four of those attackers are dead according state media. We're trying to get new details on that.Iran state T.V. also says one of the attackers at the shrine was a suicide bomber on the fourth floor. This marking the first attack in Iran which as been claimed by ISIS. They are at war with Iranian-backed forces in Syria and in Iraq.Well, back here at home. Uber confirming its fired 20 employees over sexual harassment claims. Harassment, bullying, discrimination are just some of the reasons these 20 managers and lower-level workers were fired from the company as a result of an ongoing investigation. Uber has been under pressure to address its corporate culture after former software engineer wrote a blog post accusing managers of ignoring complaints of discrimination and sexual harassment at the company.Well, it's normal for parents to worry about kids' actions when they're not around. And Jamie Warner of Utah was no different. But imagine her reaction after she saw her seven -year-old son Wyatt on security camera riding his bike to a neighbor's house reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: All right. Well, after reciting the pledge, Wyatt rang the neighbor's doorbell. His mom shared this on Instagram to show other parents. Do you think your kids aren't listening to you but sometimes they are. She said they try to teach their kids how lucky they are to live in this country.All right, coming up. Caesars Entertainment taken a two-billion-dollar gamble on renovations. We're going to talk to the CEO about the ambitious upgrades and the cards for the casino giant. And Obamacare on life support. Another major provider pulling out of Ohio. Why Anthem is leaving the states' marketplace. Mornings with Maria will be right back.MCDOWELL: Breaking news right now. President Trump just tweeting getting ready to leave for Cincinnati in the great state of Ohio to meet with Obamacare victims and talk healthcare and also infrastructure. We will have more straight ahead on that. Let's talk about -- can we talk a little bit quickly with the panel about what -- with Lee and Kevin about what's happening with - because President Trump is going to have to talk about this Christopher Wray -- Christopher Wray nomination to run the FBI.But I want to get to our next guest. High stakes in the business of leisure, Caesars Entertainment's largest unit nearing an exit from bankruptcy and the casino giant is posting record growth and investing billions in development and renovation. Let's bring in Caesars Entertainment CEO, Mark Frissora. Mark, how is company looking to expand? We were talking in the break -- and Maria is back, by the way. We were talking in the break about how busy you guys are in Las Vegas.MARK FRISSORA, CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT CEO: Yes. It's been a strong market for us in the last couple years and we're excited obviously to come out of bankruptcy. It looks like September will finally be out but - and finally being able to talk our investor's story company but the company has done really well, we've improved our EBITDA over $756 million the last two years and 800 basis point improvement in margin. And our growth has been about 13 percent over the last two years. So we feel really good about the prospects of the company going forward.BARTIROMO: For so many years, we were talking about how Macau was subsidizing Vegas, right? Where are we in that? Because, you know, for the longest time Vegas was not doing well.FRISSORA: Right.BARTIROMO: And you saw how well the Chinese were operating in Macau, is that still going on?FRISSORA: Yes. Well, what's going on right now is there's a big crackdown from the Chinese government obviously on money leaving the country, so what's happened is that even in Macau there's been a crackdown on that and it's caused a lot of depression in the sales there, however, Macau is a really good place to still be because again --BARTIROMO: But that was your cash cow.FRISSORA: Yes. We actually aren't in Macau, so a good news is 66 percent of our EBITDA comes from the strip. So from an investor standpoint today, that actually is very appealing because of the vagaries of the -- what goes on in China in terms of the government and what could happen policy-wise there. So, we do get some advantage on that right now but long term it would be nice to have a foothold there and we have a Korean project right now where we're going to get a license in Korea and Incheon, Korea.KELLY: And now, a lot of investors in a lot of these stocks that are publicly traded are talking about Japan as the next wave of growth. You just talked about Korea. What do you think the impact will be and on the growth that you're looking at? You mentioned the vast majority is coming from the strip. How do you see that shifting over time?FRISSORA: You know, I think Asia is always going to be a good place of growth for us to have a foothold and again, the Incheon, Korea is great but also Japan, I was over there and I'm meeting with the foreign officials and they love the fact that actually, we're not in Macau because that ends up being an advantage somewhat. Caesars has got a great brand name over in Japan and they love our compliance program which is very robust because we're licensed in more states than anyone else, and we've got more locations than anyone else in the United States.So that allows us to have a little bit strategic advantage in applying for someone of the 11 or 12 licenses if they are now going to put forward over the next couple years in Japan.BARTIROMO: And - go ahead, Lee.CARTER: So if two-thirds of your growth is coming from Vegas, what do you explain the turnaround of the strip? And - like, what do you attribute turnaround to?FRISSORA: Well, the turnaround was due to a lot of both efficiency initiatives that we've had, we've ended up becoming much smarter in our marketing dollars, so we're always have had a really good total rewards program. We have a 55-million membership in total rewards, that's - that was a big driver, labor productivity improved almost 800 basis points as well, so that was -- that was improved. In addition to that, our hotel business has really caught on. We're up almost 11 percent in ADR, Average Daily Rate which is your pricing and that's doubled what the strip average was but that's due to the fact we referred a lot of rooms.So, this year we're doing 7,000 rooms, we have 24,000 total on the strip, we're doing 7,000 this year, we did 5,000 last year. By 2020 will be at 90 percent of all the strip being renovated. That drives a higher average daily rate. You typically get $20 to $40 more in room night on a refurbed room. So we started doing that in couple years ago and that's driving our cash business in the hotel up. And cash business in hotel is actually more profitable than the gaming business, believe it or not.BARTIROMO: How's the president doing? Is it funny for you to see one of your former colleagues in the hotel business in Vegas run the country?FRISSORA: Well, yes. So that's great. I mean, in terms of, you know, there's -- we've got a lot of questions about housing impacting our business and I think it's too soon to tell as far as I'm concerned, you know, I mean, the - as the early days in right now, so hard to draw any conclusions on that but hopefully GDP growth continues, that drives our business model.BARTIROMO: Sure. Mark, we'll be watching the development. Thank you so much for joining us.FRISSORA: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Appreciate it very much. Mark Frissora joining us there. Coming up. Batting the opioid epidemic. How the country's largest pharmacy benefits manager is fighting addiction before it even begins.

I am Maria Bartiromo, it is Wednesday, June 7th. Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.Breaking news this morning, President Trump says he will nominate his FBI Director. He tweeted who he will nominate Christopher Wray to replace James Comey. This is his pick for next FBI Director. It comes a day ahead of Comey's testimony before the Senate. I spoke with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy about the decision earlier this hour.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KEVIN MCCARTHY, HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: I don't know him personally but he is well qualified. You look at his background from the U.S. Attorney and others. He is qualified to run the agency. He has been confirmed before by the Senate, unanimously, so I think there is a great opportunity here.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: More on the President's decision coming up, the announcement coming as President Trump moves on to next phase of his economic proposal that is the infrastructure rollout. He will head to Ohio today to discuss the next part of his plan on infrastructure. He tweeted on the visit saying this, "Getting ready to leave for Cincinnati in the great state of Ohio to meet with Obamacare victims and talk health care and also infrastructure." We will take you to Ohio coming up.Futures indicating a mixed market this morning. Take a look. Dow Industrials, NASDAQ and S&P 500 higher but fractionally so.In Europe, markets are also close to the flat line as you see here. FT-100 down a fraction. Although the CAC Quarante in Paris up almost one percent in the DAX Index in Germany up a third of a percent.In Asia overnight, mixed performances as you will see, the Shanghai Composite best performer up one and a quarter percent.

Wait until you see what is on tap.First, breaking news. President Trump, tweeting this morning, this, "I will be nominating Christopher A. Wray, a man of impeccable credentials to be the new director of the FBI. Details to follow." This is the President heads to Ohio today where he is expected to promote his trillion dollar infrastructure plan. Jeff Flock is in Cincinnati right now with the latest on the President's agenda. Good morning, Jeff.JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Another -- hey, Maria. Another day perhaps this infrastructure thing would be headlined of the day but obviously, we have been watching. You know there are plenty of headlines as you alluded to the President himself tweeting a short time ago, that he is getting ready to head here to Cincinnati where he will talk health care because of the pullout of anthem of the health care exchanges, more people left without health care. So that is part of the story today as well as the other breaking news. But a back to the subject of infrastructure, as you know the President earlier in the week talking about the air traffic control system and privatizing that, that's point one.Today, point two, wax, dams levels like the Ohio River. That's -- part of it back out here behind me the President promising a trillion-dollar in infrastructure spending. That would be $200 billion worth of tax breaks to leverage another 800 billion in private investment. The levies part as well the problem with that in some regards when you get private money involved is it leads to then user fees and tolls. The barge folks that operate barges tows up and down rivers don't like to get hit with those extra costs. If that is what it comes down to him so we will see how that goes as well? But the President will be here, not spending a whole lot of time with river town Marina on the Ohio River.Perhaps you see police officers already getting boats in the water out there behind me, and ready for the President here in Ohio to talk about something that -- promised during the campaign which was an upgrade of the infrastructure. Hopefully, it won't be overtaken by all the other news of the day.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, there is a lot of it. That's for sure, Jeff. All right, thanks very much. Beautiful shot there behind you. Jeff Flock in Cincinnati. And communities across the country, opioid addiction is taking a devastating and deadly toll. More than 90 Americans are dying every day from opioid overdoses. The largest pharmacy benefits manager in the country announcing a comprehensive solution and reducing abuse. Joining us in fox business exclusive is the President CEO of Express Scripts, Tim Wentworth. Tim, good to see you again. Thanks so much for joining us.TIM WENTWORTH, EXPRESS SCRIPTS PRESIDENT AND CEO: Thanks for having me, Maria.BARTIROMO: Well, we know all about this. We have been talking about opioid crisis for some time. Tell us about your latest effort to help fight this deadly crisis in America.WENTWORTH: You are right. It is a crisis and it's something we believe we can make a major step forward in helping to prevent. So today, we have 600 major employers and health plans that we got together. We are launching a program that is specifically aimed at patients that are newly prescribed opioids bringing together, you know, data analytics bringing together behavioral science things that we are very uniquely positioned with. And then importantly a direct line to a specialist pharmacist in neuroscience for every one of these patients to help the front end ensure they use products appropriately and understand the products. When we ran a trial with two different groups over 100,000 folks, we saw a 40 percent reduction in emergency room visits, a 38 percent reduction in hospitalizations, and an up to 20 percent reduction in the amount of drugs that actually the patients had on hand we were taking by virtue of this program. So we are very excited based on those results to now be launching it nationally.KEVIN KELLY, RECON CAPITAL PARTNERS CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AND MANAGING PARTNER: Tim, last year in 2016, Cleo Pharma, actually quintupled one of the drugs had to do with the opioid epidemic. What are price protection rebates and how does it play out when it comes to PBM'S?WENTWORTH: Sure. Price protection rebates are something that we put into place to try to prevent frankly pharma companies from escalating price unreasonably. When they do that, those rebates come back to us and go back to our clients to help lower their net cost to providing the care to patients.BARTIROMO: But explain this to us, Tim. You and I had this discussion in the past, we have had, CEO of Mylan basically getting rolled over coals because of increased that she -- her company did for the EpiPen. She blames Express Scripts. She blames the pharmacies benefit managers. How much are you taking out of the EpiPen increase?WENTWORTH: Next to nothing, I mean the irony, you know is, Heather is, in that argument, pointing to everyone but herself for her precise increases. I have heard every excuse named and I think the important piece is from our standpoint, we are in business to get patients their medicine at an affordable price and keep employers and health plans in the game of providing benefits. We hear employers pulling out or health plans pulling out of different exchanges and things, we are in the business of keeping them in, and when companies like Heather's raise their prices without concomitant value, it puts a real job for us to bring prices down and that is what we're doing.BARTIROMO: What about Anthem? Let's talk about the latest news in terms of insurers pulling out. Anthem is pulling out of the Obamacare marketplace in Ohio, citing low enrollment there. This decision leaves 20 counties in its state without a single insurer willing to sell a plan on its exchange for 2018. 32 percent of all counties in the U.S. are now down to one insurance company. What is your reaction?WENTWORTH: Yes. I mean my reaction is you know we are in business to help patients get medicine and it is when I hear about that, you know is a shared with you at a point, we just launched something for the purpose patients who don't have insurance to get essentially the same rebates you referred to, at the point of sale for them if they're paying cash so that we can buy down, 40, 50, 60 percent the price they are paying as cash payers. We don't people to be without insurance but when they are, we needed to have a solution, we built that solution.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Tim, talk about -- it's Dagen McDowell, can you talk at all about the use of this novel breakthrough therapies to treat cancer like immunotherapy drugs and the price-benefit analysis that you're saying?WENTWORTH: Sure. So it is early in the game as far as drugs. So, we are not seeing lots. I think that market is you know, very, very I'm amateur in terms of where it will end up. What we know is this, you know, one is there are patients that need those therapies and the only way that the system is able to afford them is if we, Express Scripts, and our industry, as well as health-care providers, can drive down the costs in as many other places to create that headwind. That's what we did last 20 years with all the generics that we were able to get to market. Now, about 90 percent of prescriptions are generic, creating room for first specialty wave. This needs to be accompanied by a bio-similar wave to pay for these patients while ensuring best care in a much lower price.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll be watching, Tim. Thanks very much for your efforts and we will be watching the situation.WENTWORTH: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Appreciate you joining us this morning.

Everything you need to know about the nominee, Christopher Wray, that's next.We are watching Netflix shares this morning. The company stock is up a quarter of a percent as it approaches a milestone. The staggering amount the giant could have according to a new report. Back in a minute.KRIS BUDDEN, FOX BUSINESS TENNIS CHANNEL COURT REPORTER: Hey, guys. Welcome back to another Tennis Channel Report for Fox Business, I'm Kris Budden. Tuesday was a frustrating day. There were three and a half hours of weather delays, but between showers, two women took spots in the semifinals.Play resumed, broke friend's heart as he took out opponent to reach final four after taking the opening set, 6-4. The Swiss star managed to keep her concentration despite the weather breaking five times and firing 25 25uz winners on her way to victory.To face breakout, star Elena Oscar take over a place in the final after the teenager took care of business against former world number one. And how about reaching semi-finals as an early birthday present?And don't forget our extensive live coverage from Paris continues Wednesday at 5:00 a.m. Eastern.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Breaking news this morning. President Trump nominating new FBI Chief tweeted this, this morning, "I will be nominating Christopher A. Wray, a man of impeccable credentials to be next director of the FBI. Details to follow." Joining me now, the host of "VARNEY & COMPANY" Stuart Varney weighing in on this. Good morning, Stu.STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK VARNEY AND COMPANY HOST: Good morning, Maria. I am not sure what I have to add about Mr. Wray other than he was Chris Christie's lawyer during the bridge gate affair, what that means for his future as FBI Director, I really don't know. I prefer to save my comments for what Mr. Comey will say. The former and now fired FBI Director, James Comey, what he is going to say tomorrow? The headline to me is he will not charge that President Trump obstructed justice. That is a big deal to because that is an impeachable offense. That is what the Democrats wander to lay on our President. If Comey is not going to say he tried to obstruct justice I think the wind is out of the impeachment sails. That is why I think the market is dead flat around historic levels.BARTIROMO: I did not want to become clear to the left or the Dems who are against the President, that he was not going to push obstruction. They bring out this other issue from the former NSA Director, right, Dan Coats? So now you got that.VARNEY: Yes. And then that is refutes and we'll hear more about that this morning. It is more of this noise, this political noise, this turmoil from the swamp. I agree it is important in many, many ways I got that. But it is not important to people's everyday lives. What we report is important to people's everyday lives. Taxes, health care, jobs, wages, money, the markets, what we do is of concern to everybody, not what goes on in the swamp.BARTIROMO: And that is what we will be there in about 10 minutes, Stu.VARNEY: Oh, yes.BARTIROMO: We will see you at the top of the show. Thanks so much. "VARNEY & COMPANY" begins 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Join Stuart in 10 minutes time. Tesla is selling shareholders. The company is, quote, "Bursting at the seams." It could need 20 more factories to keep up with storing demands. That's just one of the many announcements CEO Elon Musk made last night. Nicole Petallides covering the story from the New York stock exchange this morning. Nicole, good morning to you.NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. Tesla is looking higher today. It hit all-time high yesterday; it has been soaring this year up 65 percent. Elon Musk spoke to shareholders yesterday. He talked about the fact that they're bursting at their seams in the California factory. Maybe 10 worldwide and maybe even 20. Also noted that model three will be the production will begin in July and you have two choices, color and wheel size. They can't get too many other choices because they really failed those too many choices so that is what they said on the model three. I will note that the Wall Street Journal heard on street that Elon Musk had a glaring omission and that was the strategy on China.Moving on to Netflix which obviously is a real a darling on Wall Street up over 30 percent this year. Guess what? If you didn't think enough viewers, they're going to be soaring according to one report saying they are going to 128 million subscribers. It will bring in about $15 billion by year 2022. Asia Pacific is on the rise and that's good news for Netflix which is looking higher today. That is latest on two hot names that could hit new highs once again.

There are some brands that you can really trust.BARTIROMO: All right. Next thing, we want to look at older kids. Getting them outside this summer could be tough but the Quad Coaster could be really helpful.DIBARTOLO: This can actually fly up to 320 feet away. They have ones that you can see if you crash them; it's not a big deal. There is super lightweight tons and tons of fun.BARTIROMO: They do look like a lot of fun. And they do have a little battery there.DIBARTOLO: Yes. And the battery is totally rechargeable. You get about like 8 to 12 minutes of flight time on a single charge.BARTIROMO: Is that considered a drone?DIBARTOLO: It's not a drone. These are just quadcopters. Pretty cool.BARTIROMO: We got a new take on a parachute. Let's look at that. This is a classic game but a new twist.DIBARTOLO: This is our twist time parachute Simon Says game. Parachute is the best part. This comes as gamepad that will give kids all those prompts that they need. All that good stuff.BARTIROMO: Are you having fun with that? Yes, you like that? OK.

I like these crayons. It's fun. Look at that crayon. It's so thick.DIBARTOLO: It's thick, it's square, which is awesome so that means it won't roll around your driveway and get lost.BARTIROMO: Yes. I like that.DIBARTOLO: So many colors for kids to choose from.BARTIROMO: That is a good crayon right there. All right. On to the next thing here.

TIBETAN SELF-IMMOLATOR'S FAMILY HARASSED, VISITORS RESTRICTEDStates News ServiceMay 10, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 495 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Authorities in northwestern China's Gansu province have imposed restrictions on the family of a Tibetan self-immolation protester, preventing them from holding prayer services and blocking visits by relatives and friends, a source in the region says.The move has upset and distressed the parents of Chagdor Kyab, a 16-year-old student who set himself ablaze on May 2 in Gansu's Bora township in a challenge to Beijing's rule in Tibetan areas, a resident of the area told RFA's Tibetan Service."Chinese police have moved away from the site of the self-immolation itself, making it seem that things have returned to normal," RFA's source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "But security personnel and other officials have now gone to Chagdor Kyab's family home, causing them much inconvenience.""Authorities are not allowing the family to invite monks to perform religious rituals for Chagdor Kyab, and they are also preventing friends and other people from the village from visiting the family [to offer their condolences]," he said.Kyab's May 2 protest near Bora monastery in Gansu's Gannan (in Chinese, Kanlho) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture brought to 149 the total number of self-immolations by Tibetans living in Tibetan areas of China since the wave of fiery protests began in 2009.As he burned, Kyab called out for Tibetan freedom and the return to Tibet of exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, sources told RFA in earlier reports.He then tried to run toward Chinese government offices in Bora township but collapsed in the street, sources said.Chinese authorities immediately imposed a strict clampdown on communications in the area, making it difficult to obtain further information. It is not yet clear whether Kyab has died of his injuries, and his whereabouts have not been verified.Travel, phone use restrictedRestrictions imposed in the wake of two earlier self-immolations in neighboring Sichuan have meanwhile been tightened, with residents outside Kardze (Ganzi) county required to obtain special permits for travel to the Kardze county seat, a Tibetan source says."Once the Tibetans have their documents ready, they again have to seek permission from the authorities before they can proceed," a Tibetan living in exile told RFA, speaking on condition of anonymity and citing contacts in the region.Clampdowns are also in place on Tibetans' use of mobile phones and social media, and political reeducation courses are now mandated in the county's monasteries, schools, villages, and towns, RFA's source said."Tibetans are being warned that they can be sentenced to 15 years in jail if they are caught sharing photos or video of self-immolations with outside sources. And this has deterred many Tibetans from sharing stories outside their areas," he said.Reported by Kunsang Tenzin and Dawa Dolma for RFA's Tibetan Service. Translated by Dorjee Damdul.

Stories from SlateSlate MagazineJuly 6, 2017 Thursday 8:58 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive Company, LLC. All Rights ReservedSection: FUTURE TENSE; TechnologyLength: 407 wordsByline: Angelica CabralHighlight: Turns Out That "Car-Eating Bus" From China Might Be a ScamBodyRemember that viral video from last summer showing a bus breeze by traffic by driving right over it? It was supposed to revolutionize traffic in the notoriously congested urban areas of China and help with the issue of smog.Well, on Sunday, the Chinese government took to the social media site Weibo to announce the whole thing is a scam. It wasn't fake news, exactly-the video itself was real, not doctored. But the video didn't correctly portray how well the bus would work in real life.On Aug. 2, 2016, China Xinhua News unveiled the bus to the world. According to China Xinhua News, the bus had just begun its maiden drive in Qinhuangdao, a city east of Beijing with a population of about 3 million. The bus purportedly operated by following a predetermined route and could carry about 300 people. The bottom was 7.2 feet off the ground, so cars under that height could go under it and keep driving (unless it was turning, in which case cars reportedly had to wait for the bus to finish). The internet loved the videos that emerged and labeled it a "car-eating" bus.But the tide quickly turned.Soon after the test run, called into question the validity of the project, noting that China's state media had questions about the project, including how well it would actually perform, considering the test run was only 300 meters long and didn't factor in a wide variety of details. Then in December 2016            CNN reported that the bus had been abandoned on the special tracks built for it and it was causing, not fixing, traffic issues. On June 21, the bus was finally relocated, and officials announced plans to remove the special tracks on which it ran by the end of June,            according to .Now the project is running into legal troubles with its investors, 72 of whom have filed lawsuits against two people who run an online investing platform, Huaying Kailai and Bai Zhiming, according to , a Chinese language newspaper.The two raised about $1.3 billion for the project, with potential investors having to pay a minimum of $150,000 as a buy-in. The investors were promised a 12 percent return on their contribution. Police in China have arrested Zhiming, who also bought the patent for the design, along with 31 of his employees, NPR reports.But rather than running from the scene of the crime, Zhiming said the bus would be relocated to another city after being moved from its abandoned post,  reported. This guy doesn't seem to know when to quit.Load-Date: July 7, 2017End of Document

FOCUS ON AGRICULTURE IS KEY TO ENSURE THAT BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE PROMOTES SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTStates News ServiceMay 15, 2017 MondayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 536 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: Beijing BodyThe following information was released by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO):FAO Director-General praises China's support for South-South CooperationChinese Agriculture Minister Han Changfu with FAO Director-General Jose Graziano da Silva.The Belt and Road initiative linking China and the Eurasia region can help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, provided it addresses the needs of millions of farmers and fisher folk in the countries involved, according to FAO Director-General Jose Graziano da Silva."Agriculture is a crucial sector. It accounts for more than 25 percent of GDP, as well as for more than 40 percent of employment in many countries involved in the Initiative," he said in Beijing on Sunday.Graziano da Silva made the remarks at the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. The event, he said, provided a unique impetus for an international concerted effort to promote "a more balanced, equitable and inclusive development along the Belt and Road".Leaders from 29 countries were participating in the May 14-15 Forum which, under the initiative called "One Belt, One Road", focuses on expanding development and trade links between Asia, Africa, South America and Europe, as mentioned by the Chinese President Xi Jinping in his opening remarks.The FAO Director-General underscored that agriculture is not only important for generating and promoting sustainable livelihoods, but it is essential for ensuring food and nutrition security, preserving natural resources and biodiversity, and for promoting rural development.FAO has been the first international organization to develop a specific framework to reinforce policy coordination in the implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative with relation to the agriculture sector.The framework seeks to promote four flagship programmes: i) one health approach for sustainable agriculture and trade; ii) sustainable food production and value chain development; iii) science and technology for agri-food innovation to combat climate-change; and iv) smart agriculture and information and communications technology (ICT) application in the food industry.China - a leading role in South-South CooperationThe Belt and Road, according to the FAO Director-General, opens a "great opportunity" among all countries involved to engage in South-South Cooperation, a FAO-promoted model of development which has proven effective in creating jobs, building infrastructure and promoting trade among developing countries across the "global South"."Let me take this opportunity to thank the Chinese Government for playing a leading role in the support of FAO's South-South cooperation programme. It has benefitted over 30 countries and produced strong impacts in developing countries," Graziano da Silva said.President Xi's keynote speech indicated that China will provide an additional one billion US dollars to support international organizations to implement a series of projects to benefit countries along the Belt and Road. This will allow linking the Overseas Development Assistance, already provided with policy advice, trade and long-term investments, and what is particularly relevant for developing countries' deprived rural areas.Load-Date: May 15, 2017End of Document

CypressFirst Sends Letter to Cypress Semiconductor Stockholders; Reveals New Information on Executive Chairman Ray Bingham's Conflict of InterestPR NewswireMay 11, 2017 Thursday 8:30 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3043 wordsDateline: SAN JOSE, Calif., May 11, 2017 BodyCamillo Martino and J. Daniel McCranie, nominees for election to the Cypress Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ: CY) ("Cypress" or "the Company") Board of Directors at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholder scheduled to be held on June 8, 2017, and T.J. Rodgers, founder and former CEO of Cypress and the Company's largest individual stockholder, (collectively "CypressFirst") today mailed a letter to Cypress stockholders regarding the upcoming election of directors. The letter provides new information regarding Cypress executive chairman Ray Bingham's ongoing conflict of interest, and the Cypress Board's failure to take corrective action.The full CypressFirst letter, urging Cypress Semiconductor stockholders to vote theGOLDproxy cardFORthe election of Dan McCranie and Camillo Martino, can be found athttp://www.CypressFirst.comor on the website of the Securities and Exchange Commission (           http://www.sec.gov). A copy of the letter follows:May 11, 2017Vote the Enclosed GOLD Proxy Card to Elect Two Highly Qualified and Experienced Directorsto the Cypress Semiconductor BoardTo My Fellow Cypress Stockholders:By now you have probably received materials from both CypressFirst and the Board of Cypress Semiconductor Corporation for its June 8, 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. I believe that the members of the current Cypress Board, who have a fiduciary duty to protect the interests of all Cypress stockholders, are less concerned with that duty than they are with protecting two incumbent directors, Messrs. Ray Bingham and Eric Benhamou, the only ones we are challenging in this election. Here's why.On December 9, 2016, I sent a private letter to the Cypress Board, titled: "Canyon Bridge: An Unnecessary Threat to Cypress, Its Stockholders and Board," which carefully pointed out to the Board that executive chairman Ray Bingham's simultaneous employment with Cypress competitor Canyon Bridge was a black-and-white violation of seven rules in the Cypress Code of Ethics, one of which says,"It is a conflict of interesttoserveas a director of any company that competes with the Company [Cypress]."I also wrote, "This letter is about investors.  We don't want to wake up one morning, read a surprise Wall Street Journal article (like the Congressional letter story this week) and see that our stock has dropped to $6. I respectfully remind you that the board's primary duty is to its stockholders, not to its own members."The Board should have simply followed its own Code of Ethics regarding conflicts of interest, but it ignored my letter, forcing this proxy contest and the filing of the first lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery, which demanded that the Cypress Board stop stonewalling and produce information on the Bingham-Canyon Bridge conflict of interest.  And, if the Cypress Board had not misled investors in its recent Proxy Materials, including misrepresenting its loss in the first Delaware lawsuit, there would have been no need to file the second Delaware lawsuit, which I believe will demonstrate that the Board attempted to mislead stockholders in its 2017 Proxy Materials.CypressFirst Board candidate, J. Daniel McCranie, stated, "Instead of addressing the actual issues, the Board has chosen to turn stockholder communications over to an outside team of lawyers, who have failed to even discuss these obvious problems.  Their focus remains on T.J. Rodgers, and their assessment of his motivations for this Proxy Contest. That's unfortunate, because this election is not about T.J. Rodgers. He is not running for the Cypress Board. Camillo and I are running.  Nor is this election about the Board's lawyers' overblown and inaccurate descriptions of T.J. Rodgers' accomplishments and personality.  Cypress's new CEO, Hassane El-Khoury, should be focusing on breaking Rodgers' track record of returning $4.1 billion to stockholders and winning 29 consecutive proxy elections-not on traveling to defend the irrelevant 'hit pieces' written by the Board's lawyers."CypressFirst Board candidate Camillo Martino, added, "I have never seen a conflict of interest as glaring as this one.  Cypress can achieve excellent returns for its stockholders.  I have little doubt about that.  But, it cannot do so in a culture created by a top executive who prioritizes self-enrichment over the stockholders' interests and a Board that lets him get away with it."The New InformationThe primary purpose of this letter is to provide stockholders with new information on the ongoing Bingham-Canyon Bridge conflict of interest story-including new evidence that the Cypress Board was aware of but failed to disclose to stockholders, as well as new disclosures on the extraordinary $36 million in "management fees" that Chinese investment funds have transferred to Canyon Bridge Management Corp., which isownedby just three people, Benjamin Chow, Hong John Kao and Ray Bingham-who remains on the Cypress payroll as executive chairman.Cypress Lost the First Delaware Lawsuit Relating to Canyon BridgeThe Board's lawyers have "spun" my efforts to get at the truth on behalf of all Cypress stockholders as a "personal vendetta" against executive chairman Ray Bingham.  However, after the Delaware Court of Chancery heard my direct testimony and cross-examination by the Cypress Board's lawyers it made the following statements in its Post-trial Opinion:"Judgment will be entered in Rodgers' favor and Cypress will be required to produce the documents Rodgers sought in his demand letter dated January 19, 2017 (the "Demand")...""Rodgers has demonstrated, through documents, logic, and testimony, a credible basis to infer potential wrongdoing by Bingham.  Specifically, Rodgers has established a credible basis to infer that Bingham may have violated Cypress' Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code")...""The dual hats Bingham wears suggest that his interests with respect to Canyon Bridge may well conflict with the business interests of Cypress.""Based on Rodgers' testimony, which I generally found to be highly credible, and the other evidence of record, I am not convinced that Rodgers' actual purpose is to pursue a personal vendetta against Bingham."So, why does the Board keep repeating the "vendetta" mantra? I believe it's because it desperately needs a diversion from the most important issue: The Board has not only turned a blind eye to Mr. Bingham's serious conflict of interest, but it has also compounded the problem by failing to disclose the facts to Cypress stockholders concerning Bingham's involvement with Canyon Bridge. These facts include Bingham's involvement with Canyon Bridge earlier than the Board claimed to stockholders and the details of his very lucrative financial arrangements, as outlined below.Why is Mr. Bingham's ownership stake in Canyon Bridge Management Corp. such anirreconcilable conflict?  It's because Canyon Bridge, in its own words:*"focuses on acquiring interests in companies in the technology sector (specifically, companies in the semi-conductor industry)."Without the 32 acquisitions performed during its lifetime, Cypress would not exist, because those M&A efforts now account for well over 50% of Cypress's current revenue and stock value. Cypress should not be forced to compete in M&A against its own chairman.*SEC Form ADV Part 2 Brochure: "Canyon Bridge Management Corp.," 1/26/17The New Information on Canyon BridgeStockholders have aright to knowWhat the facts showWhen did Ray Bingham become involved with Canyon Bridge?Cypress's CFO and CEO were shocked by a November 3, 2016 Canyon Bridge press release, which stated that Mr. Bingham was a "Founding Partner" of Canyon Bridge, a new PE firm that was acquiring Lattice Semiconductor.  The Board changed its mind and now claims in its Proxy Materials* that the press release was wrong: that Mr. Bingham joined Canyon Bridge in December 2016, that "Bingham was not involved in Canyon Bridge's efforts to source the Lattice transaction, perform due diligence or negotiate terms," and that "Cypress Lead Independent Director [Eric Benhamou], with outside counsel, confirmed these facts."      The Board's Proxy Materials claims are directly contradicted, however, by a new February 16, 2017 written statement from Canyon Bridge to Reuters that was just unsealed in our Delaware 220 lawsuit.  It reconfirms everything Canyon Bridge said in its November 3 announcement about Mr. Bingham's early involvement in Canyon Bridge:  "The partners had reached an understanding in October 2016 about how they would work together, and have been working together on that basis since.  All public announcements and regulatory filings made by Canyon Bridge regarding the Canyon Bridge and Lattice transactions were reviewed and approved at the relevant time by all named parties and individuals, and Canyon Bridge stands by all such statements."        Canyon Bridge has no motive to mislead-and it is the Cypress Board that first agreed with the Canyon Bridge story and then changed its story.How much funding from China Reform Holdings did Canyon Bridgereceive?The Canyon Bridge SEC filing* and a Reuters investigation* show that $1.515 billion came from China Reform Holdings through three other Chinese funds to Canyon Bridge Management Corp., which is owned by Ray Bingham, Benjamin Wong and Hong John Kao.What are Mr. Bingham's financial incentives toserve the interests of Canyon Bridge and itsbackers?      The Canyon Bridge SEC filing also shows that Canyon Bridge Management Corp. received $6,147,541 in cash for "management fees" for the last quarter of 2016, a further $30,000,000 cash advance for 2017 management fees and will receive $30 million per year thereafter. Mr. Bingham and his two partners will also benefit from 20% "carried interest"-20% of the profits from Canyon Bridge Management's investments from the $1.515 billion fund.  We believe this relevant financial data should not have been omitted from the Cypress Proxy Materials. How will Mr. Bingham "share" information on his new semiconductor M&A opportunities with his two employersWhat did the CypressBoard do to determine if Mr. Bingham's role at Canyon Bridge constituted a conflict of interest?Despite numerous requests, the Cypress Board has failed to present any evidence that the Code of Ethics was ever considered.  All of Cypress's statements to date are vague and undocumented, such as "Bingham discussed [the] Canyon Bridge role with [the] Cypress Board and outside counsel prior to joining,"* or [Cypress has] "well defined conflict of interest policies at all levels of the company."  What actually happened is never mentioned.Despite the Conflict of Interest, how much are Cypress stockholders paying Mr. Bingham to serve as executive chairman while hepursues outside interests?As executive chairman, a part-time mentoring job, Mr. Bingham receives an annual salary plus target bonus of $877,500, and has been granted a total of $4.5 million in restricted stock units (RSUs). Unlike all other Cypress executives, his RSUs vest solely on time served, and are not subject to performance milestones as are the RSUs of every other Cypress executive.  His pay package was pre-approved by Compensation Committee Chairman, Eric Benhamou, and not debated by the board.*Source: Cypress Definitive Proxy April 19, 2017*Source: SEC Form ADV Part 2 Brochure: "Canyon Bridge Management Corp.," 1/26/17*Reuters, "Chinese government money backs buyout firm's deal for U.S. chip maker," November 28, 2016CypressFirst has other compensation and conflict of interest questions:Why has the Board fought so vigorously in a Delaware Court against disclosure of information to us that should only confirm what a thoughtful and thorough job the Board has done?Why has the Board agreed twice in negotiations to seat J. Daniel McCranie on the Cypress Board, only to attack him days later as a non-independent agent of T.J. Rodgers?Why does the Board refuse to properly interview one of our candidates, Camillo Martino, who, in addition to his governance and operations experience, is also an expert on the system solutions underlying Cypress 3.0?Where is the independent compensation study Mr. Benhamou claims he received to justify Mr. Bingham's seemingly excessive compensation for the part-time executive chairman job?As a stockholder, you have a right to receive full and accurate information regarding the Bingham-Canyon Bridge conflict of interest before the June 8 election.  Unfortunately, it's taking a second Delaware lawsuit to attempt to pry that "full and accurate" information out of the Cypress Board.Cypress 3.0: The FutureLike any other stockholder, I want Cypress to succeed-to grow profitably, to remain an industry automotive leader and to increase stockholder value. I fully support the new CEO, Hassane El-Khoury, and regret that the Board's actions have placed him in the middle of a proxy contest the Board could have averted long ago.As part of Cypress'sformal succession planning process, I personally recommended that Hassane El-Khoury become Cypress's new CEO, exactly because of his personal system-solution capabilities and his demonstrated business management expertise.  Despite that formal succession plan, Ray Bingham blocked El-Khoury's succession to CEO for over three months, while he paid a six-figure fee to a headhunter in an unsuccessful search to find a non-Cypress candidate.  It was only after the Board gave Mr. Bingham the highly paid executive chairman "mentoring" position that the succession plan was followed.  In my opinion, Mr. Bingham has not earned his mentor's pay.  He failed to accompany the new CEO on his inaugural trips and showed up at work only two days per week in 2016 after his August appointment.  We now know he had a second job starting in October 2016.The Board wants you to believe that a vote for the CypressFirst candidates is somehow a repudiation of the "Cypress 3.0" strategy.That'sabsurd.  We all believed and continue to believe in a system-solution strategy for Cypress, which is now dubbed "Cypress 3.0."  That's why Cypress has been on a course to make our products more complete system-level solutions, starting all the way back in 2000, when Cypress funded the internal startup that invented PSoC, theProgrammableSystemon Chip.After that, the following actions to build the infrastructure for Cypress 3.0 system-solution capability were taken from 2008-2016:  1) starting the automotive business unit, 2) hiring Hassane El-Khoury to run it, 3) merging with Spansion to build our automotive business by a factor of five, 5) fully integrating Fujitsu Electronics, a Japanese automotive powerhouse, 6) acquiring an Internet of Things (IoT) division from Broadcom, 7) introducing leadership USB Type-C system-level products, 8) hiring hundreds of software and applications engineers to create complete system solutions, and finally 9) naming Hassane El-Khoury as my successor.Yet, the Board now seeks to rewrite history, claiming that the last two quarters represent some sort of abrupt sea change based not onyearsofinfrastructure-building, but on the PR buzzword "Cypress 3.0."Cypress Would Benefit from Upgrading the Board in Any CaseIn our letter to stockholders dated April 10, we presented a Director Qualification chart.  The analysis in the chart shows that based on real semiconductor company experience-as CEO, as public-company board members, as operations experts, and as technical people with electrical engineering degrees-each of our candidates is more qualified to sit on a system-solution semiconductor company board than any current Cypress Board member.In addition, while CEO Hassane El-Khoury is doing a good job at Cypress 3.0, it is clear that he would benefit from their mentoring on Cypress's nagging operational problem of low gross margin. Finally,Messrs. Bingham and Benhamou have Failed to Govern with Integrity, and We Now Offera Modest and Measured Solution to That ProblemWe believe the Cypress Board should focus on stockholder value rather than on circling the wagons.  We believe Nominees J. Daniel McCranie and Camillo Martino can help the Cypress Board:enhance stockholder value with their exceptional experiencerestore compliance with the Cypress Code of Business Conduct and Ethicseliminate the Canyon Bridge conflict of interest problemeliminate the expensive executive chairman positionmentor the new CEO effectively without demanding excessive payWe at CypressFirst urge you once again to vote the enclosedGOLDproxy card for two extraordinarily qualified individuals, J.

UV Coatings Market: APEJ Inclined Towards High Value - High Growth in the Coming Decade: Global Industry Analysis and Opportunity Assessment 2016-2026; APEJ is projected to be a relatively high growth regional market in the global UV coatings market during the forecast periodPR NewswireApril 19, 2017 Wednesday 5:57 PM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 789 wordsDateline: NEW YORK, April 19, 2017 BodyThe APEJ UV coatings market was estimated to be valued at more than US$ 1,000 Mn by the end of 2016 and is projected to expand at a CAGR of 9.2% to reach more than US$ 2,000 Mn by the end of 2026. The APEJ market is projected to represent incremental $ opportunity of more than US$ 1,500 Mn between 2016 and 2026. The incremental $ opportunity in the region can be attributed to the increasing production of electronics and semiconductor goods, as well as growth of the automotive sector in China and India. China is expected to be the key country in the APEJ UV coatings market and is likely to account for maximum value and volume share over the forecast period. APEJ was estimated to account for more than 30% of the total market value share by the end of 2016 and is expected to increase to more than 45% by the end of the forecast period. This regional market is anticipated to gain more than 1000 BPS by the end of 2026.Read the full report:http://www.reportlinker.com/p04833635/UV-Coatings-Market-APEJ-Inclined-Towards-High-Value-High-Growth-in-the-Coming-Decade-Global-Industry-Analysis-and-Opportunity-Assessment.htmlChina is expected to be the most attractive country in the APEJ UV coatings market over the forecast periodChina has been the leading country in Asia in terms of usage of radiation-cured technology. This industry has been impacted by the Chinese government's resolve to reduce VOC emissions and sanitise the environment from fog dispersed by manufacturers using radiation-cured technologies. In September 2013, the State Council released the Air Pollution Prevention and Treatment Action Plan to monitor air pollution treatment in the near future. A specific measure in this policy categorically pertains to VOC regulations, thereby impacting the use of radiation-cured technology in China.Aggressive implementations are being done, with local governments pursuing the shutdown of factories not meeting these regulatory standards. Due to these developments, research and development departments of radiation-cured technology users and coatings companies have been working to achieve technological success in the form of compliance with the new regulations. In the case of India, specific regulations with regard to the application of UV cured coatings for food packaging could be expected in the near future. However, currently, as compared to China, there is a deficiency of stringent regulations in India, especially environmental regulations, which could have promoted the use of UV cured coatings even further.Growth of the printing industry in APEJ - particularly in China - likely to create robust development in the global UV coatings marketThe printing industry in APEJ has witnessed a robust growth since the last few years with the advent of flexographic and 3D printing for applications such as advertising, labelling, packaging, and literature publications. Due to high-quality finishing and surface protection, UV cured coatings are used on a large scale in the APEJ printing and packaging industry. The use of UV cured printing inks has gained traction as an additive for new substrate types such as ceramic and introduction of metallic effect inks in gravure printing. All these factors are creating a positive impact on the APEJ UV coatings market.UV coatings have been preferred in the wood and furniture industry in APEJ as a medium of coating over the last four decades. The product has several advantages over conventional coating material such as low VOC emissions and fast radiation curing technology to provide a smooth surface finish and prolonged durability of the product. With the robust growth of the wood and furniture market in recent times, the UV coatings market in APEJ is expected to benefit from the same. The growth of the residential sector in Asia Pacific is also expected to provide traction in the demand for furniture and wood furnishing items thus employing the use of UV-based coatings.Read the full report:http://www.reportlinker.com/p04833635/UV-Coatings-Market-APEJ-Inclined-Towards-High-Value-High-Growth-in-the-Coming-Decade-Global-Industry-Analysis-and-Opportunity-Assessment.htmlAbout ReportlinkerReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

INGDAN.com Achieves Success with Intel on Cultivating Robotics EcosystemPR NewswireJuly 9, 2017 Sunday 8:18 PM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 647 wordsDateline: HONG KONG, July 9, 2017 Body Cogobuy Group ("Cogobuy" or the "Company," stock code: 400.HK), the largest e-commerce platform serving the electronics manufacturing industry in China, is pleased to announce that INGDAN.com, has achieved a milestone in its collaboration with Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) to build a robotics innovation ecosystem.

Good news for Wells; Remembering IndyMac, fondlyAmerican BankerApril 26, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 SourceMedia, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: Vol. 182; No. 79Length: 914 wordsByline: George YacikBodyReceiving Wide Coverage ...Fixed: Just one day before its widely anticipated annual meeting, Wells Fargo got a bit of good news from U.S. financial regulators. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve said the bank "adequately remediated the deficiencies" in its 2015living willplan and is no longer subject to the "growth restrictions" the regulators imposed on the bank when it failed the test last December.Still, the bad news keeps coming. The city of East Orange, N.J., said it withdrew its funds from the bank, accusing it of engaging inpredatory-lending practicesand exacerbating mortgage foreclosures in the city.The New York Times offers a preview of the company's annual meeting, with an emphasis on the possibility some members of its board of directors could fail to win reelection. The bank does have one influential ally, though: Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, which owns about 10% of the bank's stock, isexpected to support the board. That "could ultimately carry more weight than that of investors like pension funds, which tend to be more vocal in their criticism," the paper notes.Wall Street JournalWider umbrella: The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, which takes effect in May 2018, is expected toprotect customers of U.S. banks, credit card companies and insurance companies, too, not just EU citizens.Come here Watson: IBM plans to use its Watson technology to help Wall Street bankscatch rogue tradersand solve other security and compliance problems. The Watson Financial Services product "looks for patterns in traders' chats and emails while also analyzing numerical trading data," the paper reports. The computer giant is developing other capabilities for the technology as well, including analyzing regulatory text to assess the sufficiency of a company's compliance programs, and helping banks detect suspicious customers or transactions.A lesson in finance: The paper investigates the federal Parent Plus program, in which millions of American parents have taken out loans to help their childrenpay for college. "The problem is the government asks almost nothing about its borrowers' incomes, existing debts, savings, credit scores or ability to repay. Then it extends loans that are nearly impossible to extinguish in bankruptcy if borrowers fall on hard times." As of September 2015, more than 330,000 people, or 11% of borrowers, hadn't made a payment in at least a year."Parent Plus is one thread in a web of higher education loan programs that have come to resemble the subprime mortgage industry a decade ago," the paper says.Laissez-faire: "Main Street lending institutions should not have to keep paying for the sins of others," Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., says in an op-ed piece. So he is introducing a bill, called the Reforming Finance for Local Economies Act, that would exempt community banks and credit unions with assets of less than $10 billion from Dodd-Frank.Under his bill, small banks "would no longer have to reduce products and services and divert resources to compliance. Their skill in evaluating risk would no longer be reduced to a mathematical exercise. They would be free to concentrate onproviding traditional banking servicesto the customers they know by taking in local deposits and making loans to local borrowers, whose creditworthiness is closely monitored."Silver lining: Failed banks, including IndyMac and Washington Mutual, may be remembered with disdain by the public, but for thousands offormer employeesof these disgraced businesses, working at these institutions was generally a positive experience. "I have wonderful, lifelong friends because of that," says one former underwriter.Financial TimesTaking on the giants: UnionPay has become the largest bank card group in the world by value of transactions, although nearly all of it comes from its home market in China. But that might be about to change, as the company plans totake on Visa and MasterCard globally, thanks to a "clear mandate" from the Chinese government. Already banks in countries like Myanmar, Indonesia, Malaysia and Kazakhstan have started issuing the company's cards "to an increasing cohort of non-Chinese customers."New York TimesFailed thinking: Financial columnist William D. Cohan says the "crafty" Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council, is playing Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., "for the fool" over her desire to try to recreate Glass-Steagall. "What's unfortunate is that she has yet to figure out that not only is the idea of separating investment banking from commercial bankingnot the panacea she is hoping it will be, but it is also not something banks' clients, customers and counterparties want to have happen," Cohan, a former Wall Street banker himself, writes.Washington PostForgiving: VantageScore, the credit scoring model developed by TransUnion, Equifax and Experian, will soon be putting more weight on the trends in a person's credit report. "The new data is meant toprovide more contextto a consumer's debt load and help lenders get a more holistic view of a person's credit behavior and risk level," the Post reports. "The shift could make the key number more forgiving for people who have debt."Quotable ..."For many people in emerging markets, this will be the first card they come in contact with. That's a big shift from when Visa and MasterCard werethe only game in town." - Neil Katkov, senior vice president at Celent on UnionPay's plan to expand globallyhttp://www.americanbanker.com/morning-scan/good-news-for-wells-remembering-indymac-fondlyLoad-Date: April 25, 2017End of Document

FOCUS ON AGRICULTURE IS KEY TO ENSURE THAT BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE PROMOTES SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTUS State NewsMay 15, 2017 Monday 7:22 PM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 535 wordsBodyBEIJING, May 15 -- The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization issued the following news release:The Belt and Road initiative linking China and the Eurasia region can help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, provided it addresses the needs of millions of farmers and fisher folk in the countries involved, according to FAO Director-General Jose Graziano da Silva."Agriculture is a crucial sector. It accounts for more than 25 percent of GDP, as well as for more than 40 percent of employment in many countries involved in the Initiative," he said in Beijing on Sunday.Graziano da Silva made the remarks at the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. The event, he said, provided a unique impetus for an international concerted effort to promote "a more balanced, equitable and inclusive development along the Belt and Road".Leaders from 29 countries were participating in the May 14-15 Forum which, under the initiative called "One Belt, One Road", focuses on expanding development and trade links between Asia, Africa, South America and Europe, as mentioned by the Chinese President Xi Jinping in his opening remarks.The FAO Director-General underscored that agriculture is not only important for generating and promoting sustainable livelihoods, but it is essential for ensuring food and nutrition security, preserving natural resources and biodiversity, and for promoting rural development.FAO has been the first international organization to develop a specific framework to reinforce policy coordination in the implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative with relation to the agriculture sector.The framework seeks to promote four flagship programmes: i) one health approach for sustainable agriculture and trade; ii) sustainable food production and value chain development; iii) science and technology for agri-food innovation to combat climate-change; and iv) smart agriculture and information and communications technology (ICT) application in the food industry.CHINA - A LEADING ROLE IN SOUTH-SOUTH COOPERATIONThe Belt and Road, according to the FAO Director-General, opens a "great opportunity" among all countries involved to engage in South-South Cooperation, a FAO-promoted model of development which has proven effective in creating jobs, building infrastructure and promoting trade among developing countries across the "global South"."Let me take this opportunity to thank the Chinese Government for playing a leading role in the support of FAO's South-South cooperation programme. It has benefitted over 30 countries and produced strong impacts in developing countries," Graziano da Silva said.President Xi's keynote speech indicated that China will provide an additional one billion US dollars to support international organizations to implement a series of projects to benefit countries along the Belt and Road. This will allow linking the Overseas Development Assistance already provided with policy advice, trade and long-term investments, which is what is particularly relevant for developing countries' deprived rural areas.

Haier Launches Magnetic Bearing Centrifugal Chiller Unit with World's Largest Cooling CapacityPR NewswireApril 17, 2017 Monday 5:14 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 556 wordsDateline: SHANGHAI, April 17, 2017 BodyHaier Central Air-Conditioning(Haier CAC), a business unit of Haier Group Corporation, debuted its magnetic bearing centrifugal chiller unit with world's largest cooling capacity, 4200RT, at the 28th China Refrigeration Exhibition held in Shanghai New International Expo Center on April 12. One unit can cool a 100,000-square-meter, a feat unmatched to date, while the Integrated Part Load Value (IPLV), the indicator of efficiency at full load conditions, measures 13.18. The new unit brings the application of magnetic levitation technology in the refrigeration sector to an entirely new level.At variance with traditional central air-conditioning, the maglev unit is oil and friction free, consumes 50 per cent less energy and has a 30-year-long service life, twice as long as traditional units. As a result of these advances, magnetic bearing centrifugal chiller is taking the front seat in terms of becoming one of the key development directions for the central air conditioning industry. Early in 2006, Haier pioneered the development of China's magnetic bearing centrifugal chiller sector and, in 2015, launched its first model, rated at 2200RT, which, at the time, was the highest available cooling capacity on the market. The just rolled out 4200RT unit sets a new world record.In terms of intelligence technology, the unit is equipped with the self-cleaning Driverless maglev system, a system that is fully automated to the point of requiring no human intervention for upkeep and maintenance during the entire life cycle, and requires half the power consumption of traditional units when in operation. The air conditioner is the first unit in the industry that applies artificial intelligence to large-scale industrial equipment, making full use of the latest in technological advances in terms of the interconnection between man and machine and between machine and machine.In terms of manufacturing technology, Haier CAC built world's first factory with the mission of producing user-centric central air-conditioners that leverages the technology of interconnected devices, while combining energy-saving technology, artificial intelligence and mass customization, bringing about the transformation from mass production to mass customization and accelerating the implementation of the China Manufacturing 2025 strategy, the Chinese government's initiative for the country's leading industries to attain self-reliance for key components and to integrate innovation across all aspects of a new product roadmap.In the Chinese market, Haier has, to date, built and installed 539 magnetic bearing centrifugal chillers. Although, the installations are still considered part of a pilot program in a nascent industry, Haier has taken an 81 percent share of the market and has been the leader for five consecutive years. According to industry experts, the new 4200RT unit not only represents advances in magnetic levitation technology applications and innovation, but also acts as a core contributor to energy conservation and emission reductions, while serving as a backbone for the transformation of the green building sector.To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/haier-launches-magnetic-bearing-centrifugal-chiller-unit-with-worlds-largest-cooling-capacity-300440126.htmlSOURCE HaierCONTACT: Liu Xi, +86-10-8555-3034Load-Date: April 18, 2017End of Document

GRETCHEN DAILY HONORED WITH BLUE PLANET PRIZE FOR HER WORK TO HARMONIZE PEOPLE AND NATUREStates News ServiceJune 14, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 756 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: STANFORD, Calif. BodyThe following information was released by Stanford University:by Rob JordanYour summer vacation plans have changed you're going to the moon. Stanford biologist GRETCHEN DAILY wants you to imagine this scenario and to consider all the Earth-bound organisms you would depend on for food, building materials, pharmaceuticals and general happiness up there."You'd get a list of thousands of species," said Daily, the Bing Professor of Environmental Science. "Your list probably wouldn't even include species we rely on indirectly for services such as crop pollination and climate stability."For her work on practical actions and policies to secure ecosystems and human well-being, Daily was honored with the 2017 Blue Planet Prize, a roughly $450,000 award widely considered the Nobel Prize for science that contributes to solving global environmental problems."We are down to the last bits of land, and it's kind of a zero sum game in many places," Daily said. "On the one hand, we need more nature. On the other hand, the answer is not going to be locking it up in more extensive park systems."Daily's work shines a light on the intimate connections between nature and human health, prosperity and well-being. She developed a field of research called countryside biogeography, which has shown that most parts of the earth are profoundly affected by human activities, but still hold potential to be in harmony with nature. Among the questions Daily seeks to answer: how are human impacts affecting the life-support services we depend on; what plants, animals and places are most important to protect; and how can we create practical incentives to protect them?"The way people think about nature and the science that can inform our decisions are changing," Daily said. "This is a moment of revolution."Catalyzing that revolution is the Natural Capital Project, a partnership among 200 partners globally, including the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, the Stanford Department of Biology, The Nature Conservancy, the World Wildlife Fund and the University of Minnesota Institute on the Environment. Cofounded by Daily, the initiative aims to develop a systematic approach to valuing nature's benefits and to mainstream this approach into policy, finance and management decisions worldwide.The Natural Capital Project melds world-class research on environmental economics with influential conservation programs. Its open-source software is used in more than 80 countries to map and model the value of ecological resources, assess trade-offs in land- and water-use choices and integrate conservation and human development into investments.Gretchen Daily and Paul EhrlichAmong its successes, the Natural Capital Project has collaborated with stakeholders to manage risk in major corporations' global sourcing decisions, inform transportation loan decisions across Latin America, and support massive Chinese government investments in conservation and human development. A Natural Capital Project study offered the first comprehensive map of the entire U.S. coastline that shows where and how much protection communities get from natural habitats such as sand dunes, coral reefs, sea grasses and mangroves."Information we derived using Natural Capital Project framework and methods was used in the designation of a new system of protected areas that spans about 30 percent of China and in developing ecological compensation policies," said OUYANG ZHIYUN, deputy director of the Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. "Gretchen's innovations have benefited nature and millions of people in China."Daily joins two past Blue Planet Prize recipients from Stanford: HAROLD MOONEY, the Paul S. and Billie Achilles Professor of Environmental Biology, and PAUL EHRLICH, the Bing Professor of Population Studies Emeritus and mentor to Daily during her time at Stanford as an undergraduate, graduate student and postdoctoral scholar."Gretchen turned out to be one of those rare students from whom you learn rather than teach," Ehrlich said. "I've always been immensely proud of her accomplishments, including the Natural Capital Project, the single most important global conservation effort today."Daily said she considers her latest honor a validation not just for her work, but for a larger shift in awareness and action on the issues. "The Blue Planet Prize sheds a light on the thousands of people driving forward this movement to mainstream the values of nature in our decision-making," Daily said.Load-Date: June 15, 2017End of Document

Nations around globe boosting precautions as cyberattacks rampantConcordiensis: Union CollegeMay 17, 2017 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD; Pg. 1Length: 422 wordsByline: Lisa HladikBodyCyberattacks are becoming a major threat globally as hundreds of thousands of computers are becoming prey to viruses and hackers. The attacks originated in Asia, where there were initial reports in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. However, there are concerns that these attacks could spread far beyond their epicenter. As a result, U.S. officials are responding. President Trump ordered his homeland security adviser, Thomas Bossert, to coordinate a U.S. response to the spreading computer virus. The source of the attacks is unknown, so part of Mr. Bossert's prerogative is finding the creator of the malware. According to Whitehouse officials, the code is difficult to trace because it is a conglomeration of various codes originating from various sources. The United States is especially taking a cautious approach to the malware attack because of recent issues with security leaks. Over the past few months, a hacking group called the Shadow Brokers has been targeting the National Security Agency and publishing classified information. The U.S. has not yet been targeted by this new wave of malware yet, but the cyberattack has already hit more than 200,000 computers in more than 150 countries, according to Rob Wainwright, the executive director of Europol, which is Europe's police agency. A variety of nations have already been hit by the attacks, including the Spanish telecom Telefonica, the French automaker Renault, several Chinese universities, Germany railway system and Russia's Interior Ministry. The greatest impact has been felt by Britain's healthcare system. As a result of the cyberattacks, a number of surgeries had to be rescheduled, while other patients were simply turned away from emergency rooms. Measures are already being taken to secure computer systems from the continued spread of the malware following warnings from Malware Tech, a leading security expert. According to spokesmen from this company, a less-vulnerable version of the malware is likely to be released in the coming weeks. This has left global cybersecurity experts worried that security specialists might not be able to keep pace with the problem as the malware advances.The Chinese government has shown even more support by granting tax breaks to coastal cities home to big local fishing companies. As a result of China's dominance in global fishing, West African nations like Senegal that rely on fisheries are facing economic turmoil. Because of this conflict of interests, China has already been in and is set for my maritime clashes.Load-Date: May 17, 2017End of Document

Mainland Journalists Warned Not to Ask QuestionsTargeted News ServiceJune 26, 2017 Monday 12:03 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 361 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: BRUSSELS BodyThe International Federation of Journalists issued the following news release:The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) raises concerns about reporting by Mainland media on recent administrative changes. The IFJ voices concerns about the ability of the media in China to freely report, without government intimidation.On June 20, 2017, the International Table Tennis Federation of China (ITTFC) decided to remove Liu Guoliang as head coach of the national team, and appoint the vice chairperson of the Federation to the role. Mainland media reported on the changes, yet did not report of why the changes had been made. Liu is a well-respected member of the national team, and led the team to several international wins. In the following days, several messages on social media disclosed that journalists were ordered not to ask any questions above the move by the relevant authority, following the announcement.According to Guo Bin, a local blogger, on June 22 in a blog post, he said that members of the National Table Tennis Team were ordered to stay silent and not express their opinions about the removal of Liu. However, in the following day fives team members announced they were boycott the next international competition in protest.According to a statement by the General Administration of Sport of China, the action of the five team members ignored professional ethics. The Administration said that 'all athletes should put patriotism and collectivism in first place'.The IFJ Asia Pacific Office said: "President Xi Jinping has repeatedly made public speeches reminding all officials that they have to be accountable to the public and place the best interest of the public in first place. However, the fact that media is ordered not to report on certain facts and withhold information in stories, highlights serious issues with the Chinese government's attempt to control the flow of information in China. All journalists are working on behalf of public interest."We urge all media personnel to uphold the accountability that President Xi demands of public officials when exercising their duties.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-5906893 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: June 27, 2017End of Document

Ping An Technology AI Lab Ranked World's Best Performing in LFWPR NewswireMay 11, 2017 Thursday 11:58 PM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 953 wordsDateline: SHENZHEN, China, May 11, 2017 BodyPing An Technology AI Lab, owned by Ping An Group, achieved an important milestone when the research facility was awarded the highest score for face recognition accuracy and for demonstrating the best ability in recognizing the smallest changes in facial expression, according to the latest test results released by internationally recognized facial recognition technology authority Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW). The tests yielded an accuracy rate of 99.8 per cent, a result that was superior to that of many renowned domestic and foreign rivals as well as the best result achieved to date in the history of LFW. It is also the first time that Ping An Technology was the achiever of the record. According to the usage statistics of Ping An Technology facial recognition system, as of May 2, 2017, the technology has been applied to more than 200 million faces. In addition, the Third Research Institute, a testing facility under the aegis of China's Ministry of Public Security, confirmed the face recognition accuracy rate at 99.84 per cent and issued the relevant certification.With the facial recognition technology, Ping An Technology AI Lab was able to compare facial images based on their differentiating features, precisely identifying faces. During the exploration into artificial intelligence and subsequent R&D process that took place over the past three years, the laboratory was able to achieve the superior results based on hundreds of millions of instances of user data collected from databases across multiple business sectors. Many financial institutions have already deployed the technology:The technology has been successfully used in dozens of projects since 2015, including credit approval, credit card comparison during batch processing, identity verification in banking transactions, opening of bank accounts online, account login and insurance underwriting.Several of China's leading financial companies have already started including facial recognition technology as a necessary step for many transactions, including but not limited to:Shenzhen Social Insurance Wallet, Ping An Puhui, Ping An Bank, Ping An Credit Card, Ping An Property Insurance, Ping An Annuity, Ping An Securities and the Bank of Jiaxing. The technology has already been applied in hundreds of millions of instances.Chinese government offices and state-owned enterprises have widely adopted the technology:Guangzhou's many district offices have applied face recognition to control access to rental units;The Human Resources and Social Security Bureaus in Shenzhen, Fujian and Tianjin have carried out trials of the technology for identity verification;In March of this year, Shenzhen Airport entered into a strategic partnership with Ping An Technology that started with a pilot phase where the technology was used in the VIP lounge and, by the end of June, will be expanded across the entire airport.Shenzhen's Housing Authority and China Railway have each separately started trials of the technology in identity matching, with China Railway planning to roll out the service on the Beijing-Shanghai High-Speed Railway line soon.Ping An Group has started pilot programs that apply facial recognition as the mechanism to verify work attendance and for access control management.In other AI-related areas, Ping An Technology AI Lab has also committed itself to making work and life simpler and more intelligent for one and all through its diversified research. An AI-driven voice navigation system now directs all phone calls made to Ping An Group, and has been integrated into Ping An Securities', Ping An's mobile banking and Kuai le Ping An's apps to optimize the experience. Voice analysis is being used to assess how conversations are being handled by customer service personnel when dealing with incoming calls from customers, as well as to analyze the caller's feelings and emotions during the course of the call. Movement tracking provides an analysis of driver habits and behavior. Artificial intelligence is being used across a wide range of applications.Ping An Technology's facial recognition technology has been widely applied in over 100 use cases involving more than 200 million faces. The technology has also been successfully deployed by more than one hundred of China's leading firms in high security areas including financial risk control, security and protection, health insurance, social security benefits programs, railway facility access, airport security and online access as well as educational and social welfare services. In addition, Ping An Technology has been active in overseas expansion by establishing partnerships with several international financial institutions.With an increasingly expanding face database and numerous domestic and international academic awards and recognitions, Ping An Technology's facial recognition technology has become the best of its class worldwide. Ping An Technology general manager Chen Liming said: "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the way of the future when it comes to social development. Facial recognition technology, a core segment of the AI spectrum, is becoming increasingly accepted as the tool of choice in terms of security management. Ping An Group, the first firm to be certified by the relevant authorities for application of the technology across all financial transactions, has utilized its proprietary AI technology in several core areas of the banking and financial sector, further paving the way for an increasingly broad application of the technology.

A Sperm Whale National Park Area or A Stove SeamountNews Release WireJuly 25, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 Broadcast Interview Source, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1449 wordsBodyThree times I've traveled across the codfish gray seas of Georges Banks, about 150 miles southeast of Nantucket, out onto the Mediterranean blue of Oceanographer's Canyon. Every time we saw sperm whales surface, blow a spout that arched diagonally to the whale's left, and dive.Â  One time we found a dead whale floating on the water likely killed by a ship strike.Â  This wondrous ocean realm is in great need of better management.In 2016 President Obama did just that. He created the NE Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument.Â  He left for posterity a legacy that portends to be as great as President Theodore Roosevelt creating the Grand Canyons National Monument in 1908.Â  While eagles soar over the infamous Arizona canyons, sperm whales dive the cold water coral canyons of the Atlantic Ocean.The trouble is the current president has requested reports be made on the "lost opportunity costs- of having a national park area instead of letting industry cash in on more lucrative enterprises such as oil and gas drilling. Most precious of all is a high-tech metal found in rare earth minerals, tellurium.Â  Due partly to its high atomic number, this element is rarer than gold or platinum, and it's in more demand.Tellurium when combined with bismuth becomes an alloy that is used by Intel for the fastest phase change memory chips.Â  When tellurium is combined with cadmium the result is the alloy with the greatest efficiencies for solar cell electric power generation.In the Atlantic Ocean off the continent, four seamounts rise up from the ocean abyssal floor, Bear Seamount (3,615 ft), Physalia Seamount (6,062 ft), Retriever Seamount (5,967 ft.), and Mytilus Seamount (7,444 ft).Â  Each has its own unique assemblages of animals.Â  The craggy peaks are gnarly with black basalt.Â  This volcanic rock is very porous and soaks up rare earth minerals from seawater.Â  Over the millennia a crust is formed rich in tellurium.Tellurium is mined from ancient seamounts in the mountains of China.Â  China will not permit the export of tellurium forcing companies to manufacture solar cells and computer chips in China.Â  The solar cell industry was looking to New England's seamounts when Obama wisely went around Congress to create the monument.Â  He forced the industries to look instead to recovering tellurium from discarded solar panels and computer boards, as a company in Belgium does, or to mine tellurium from Mountain Pass in California.While industries bellied-up to China's tellurium mines, America's only rare-earths mineral mine at Mountain Pass California filed for bankruptcy.Â  No surprise, the winning bidder for America's rare earth minerals mine has ties to the Chinese government.Unfortunately for the spectacular ocean places off of New England's shores, instead of standing up to China like he promised in his campaign, President Trump would rather open up our four unique seamount ocean ecosystems to mining.The window of opportunity to comment on why the NE Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument is of greater value to our nation than is mineral mining or oil drilling will close on Wednesday July 26. Speak out for the protection of these sperm whale canyons and seamounts.Â  We can find better ways to keep the glow on our screens and panels.<br/>About: The Ocean River Institute helps people and groups make a difference where they live through environmental stewardship and science. Many environmental issues are best addressed by people taking action in their own communities and regions, not by large, national entities.

You may also write to us and invite friends to join us on ORI?s Fan page on Facebook. Twitter OceanRiverRob for fast breaking news and updates from ORI?s director and founder Rob Moir, Ph.D. On Dec 20th 2010 the Senate and on Dec 21st the House passed the Shark Conservation Act to promote the conservation of sharks internationally and provide a more equal playing field for U.S. fishermen. The bill closes loopholes in a ban on shark finning imposed by then-president Clinton. First, vessels are prohibited from having custody, control, or possession of shark fins without the corresponding carcass. Second, it is a violation of law if the total weight of shark fins landed or found on board exceeds 5 percent of the total weight of shark carcasses. Third, and most particularly, all sharks landed must have their fins naturally attached. With more than 90% of the sharks already absent from world oceans, this legislation is a big step for sharks. If one is going to kill and harvest a shark, one must use the whole shark. The bill legislates public shame under the High Seas Driftnet Fishing Moratorium Protection Act with the identification and prominent listing of nations that have fishing vessels that have not adopted a regulatory program for the conservation of sharks that is similar to the U.S. Directors Jacques Perrin and Jacques Cluzaud in their film Oceans show from underwater the dropping into the ocean of a shark with dorsal and tail fin cut off. The shark is still alive and sinks despite attempting to swim. The cameraman/diver follows the shark down to a sandy bottom where the shark continues to try to swim to no avail. Such images are not easily forgotten. Now shark finning legislation enacted by the Senate and House outlaws such terrible treatment of sharks. The oceans need your help said the December 14th ORI eAlert. Please tell your Senators to take action for harmful algal blooms, turtles, sharks and the wellbeing of oceans. On December 20th and 21st Congress acted for sharks thanks in part to your help. ORI ecostewards wrote 28,500 letters to decision-makers in 2010. The most letters (5,612 or 21% of ORI letters) were written in support of belugas, the magnificent whistling and chirping white whales of Cook Inlet, Alaska. You demanded critical habitat designation of their home waters. That decision is still pending. Our Indian River Lagoon (FL) campaign to save dolphins suffering from excessive nitrogen and phosphorus pollution was second with 18% of the letters written. Participation was 15% in the Green Slime, Red Tide Nevermore campaign. Nearly tied for second (17%) was No New Drilling combined with Let?s Federalize the Clean Up. A three way tie for third goes to the National Endowment for Oceans, a National Ocean Policy and Take Harmful Chemicals Out of Drinking Water. You also wrote letters in 2010 to build a salt marsh on Chelsea Creek, protect blue fin tuna and Atlantic wolfish, save the British Virgin Islands, the Westfield River and Stellwagen Bank. These and other actions are described on our website at            www.oceanriver.org. Here one may also subscribe to ORI's free eAlerts. When you write and join with ORI?s efforts, decision-makers listen. They listen because your letters are thoughtful and heartfelt. Many took the time to put the issue into their own words.

A Sperm Whale National Park Area or A Stove SeamountNews Release WireJuly 25, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 Broadcast Interview Source, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1449 wordsBodyThree times I've traveled across the codfish gray seas of Georges Banks, about 150 miles southeast of Nantucket, out onto the Mediterranean blue of Oceanographer's Canyon. Every time we saw sperm whales surface, blow a spout that arched diagonally to the whale's left, and dive.Â  One time we found a dead whale floating on the water likely killed by a ship strike.Â  This wondrous ocean realm is in great need of better management.In 2016 President Obama did just that. He created the NE Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument.Â  He left for posterity a legacy that portends to be as great as President Theodore Roosevelt creating the Grand Canyons National Monument in 1908.Â  While eagles soar over the infamous Arizona canyons, sperm whales dive the cold water coral canyons of the Atlantic Ocean.The trouble is the current president has requested reports be made on the "lost opportunity costs- of having a national park area instead of letting industry cash in on more lucrative enterprises such as oil and gas drilling. Most precious of all is a high-tech metal found in rare earth minerals, tellurium.Â  Due partly to its high atomic number, this element is rarer than gold or platinum, and it's in more demand.Tellurium when combined with bismuth becomes an alloy that is used by Intel for the fastest phase change memory chips.Â  When tellurium is combined with cadmium the result is the alloy with the greatest efficiencies for solar cell electric power generation.In the Atlantic Ocean off the continent, four seamounts rise up from the ocean abyssal floor, Bear Seamount (3,615 ft), Physalia Seamount (6,062 ft), Retriever Seamount (5,967 ft.), and Mytilus Seamount (7,444 ft).Â  Each has its own unique assemblages of animals.Â  The craggy peaks are gnarly with black basalt.Â  This volcanic rock is very porous and soaks up rare earth minerals from seawater.Â  Over the millennia a crust is formed rich in tellurium.Tellurium is mined from ancient seamounts in the mountains of China.Â  China will not permit the export of tellurium forcing companies to manufacture solar cells and computer chips in China.Â  The solar cell industry was looking to New England's seamounts when Obama wisely went around Congress to create the monument.Â  He forced the industries to look instead to recovering tellurium from discarded solar panels and computer boards, as a company in Belgium does, or to mine tellurium from Mountain Pass in California.While industries bellied-up to China's tellurium mines, America's only rare-earths mineral mine at Mountain Pass California filed for bankruptcy.Â  No surprise, the winning bidder for America's rare earth minerals mine has ties to the Chinese government.Unfortunately for the spectacular ocean places off of New England's shores, instead of standing up to China like he promised in his campaign, President Trump would rather open up our four unique seamount ocean ecosystems to mining.The window of opportunity to comment on why the NE Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument is of greater value to our nation than is mineral mining or oil drilling will close on Wednesday July 26. Speak out for the protection of these sperm whale canyons and seamounts.Â  We can find better ways to keep the glow on our screens and panels.<br/>About: The Ocean River Institute helps people and groups make a difference where they live through environmental stewardship and science. Many environmental issues are best addressed by people taking action in their own communities and regions, not by large, national entities.

Twitter OceanRiverRob for fast breaking news and updates from ORI?s director and founder Rob Moir, Ph.D. On Dec 20th 2010 the Senate and on Dec 21st the House passed the Shark Conservation Act to promote the conservation of sharks internationally and provide a more equal playing field for U.S. fishermen. The bill closes loopholes in a ban on shark finning imposed by then-president Clinton. First, vessels are prohibited from having custody, control, or possession of shark fins without the corresponding carcass. Second, it is a violation of law if the total weight of shark fins landed or found on board exceeds 5 percent of the total weight of shark carcasses. Third, and most particularly, all sharks landed must have their fins naturally attached. With more than 90% of the sharks already absent from world oceans, this legislation is a big step for sharks. If one is going to kill and harvest a shark, one must use the whole shark. The bill legislates public shame under the High Seas Driftnet Fishing Moratorium Protection Act with the identification and prominent listing of nations that have fishing vessels that have not adopted a regulatory program for the conservation of sharks that is similar to the U.S. Directors Jacques Perrin and Jacques Cluzaud in their film Oceans show from underwater the dropping into the ocean of a shark with dorsal and tail fin cut off. The shark is still alive and sinks despite attempting to swim. The cameraman/diver follows the shark down to a sandy bottom where the shark continues to try to swim to no avail. Such images are not easily forgotten. Now shark finning legislation enacted by the Senate and House outlaws such terrible treatment of sharks. The oceans need your help said the December 14th ORI eAlert. Please tell your Senators to take action for harmful algal blooms, turtles, sharks and the wellbeing of oceans. On December 20th and 21st Congress acted for sharks thanks in part to your help. ORI ecostewards wrote 28,500 letters to decision-makers in 2010. The most letters (5,612 or 21% of ORI letters) were written in support of belugas, the magnificent whistling and chirping white whales of Cook Inlet, Alaska. You demanded critical habitat designation of their home waters. That decision is still pending. Our Indian River Lagoon (FL) campaign to save dolphins suffering from excessive nitrogen and phosphorus pollution was second with 18% of the letters written. Participation was 15% in the Green Slime, Red Tide Nevermore campaign. Nearly tied for second (17%) was No New Drilling combined with Let?s Federalize the Clean Up. A three way tie for third goes to the National Endowment for Oceans, a National Ocean Policy and Take Harmful Chemicals Out of Drinking Water. You also wrote letters in 2010 to build a salt marsh on Chelsea Creek, protect blue fin tuna and Atlantic wolfish, save the British Virgin Islands, the Westfield River and Stellwagen Bank.

Copycat terror strikesThe SentinelJune 5, 2017 MondayCopyright 2017 Omega Printers & Publishers Pvt Ltd, distributed by Contify.com All Rights ReservedLength: 788 wordsBodyWith three terror strikes in London and Manchester in last three months that have claimed 34 lives and wounded over 200, Britain's security services seem to be under siege. After the latest outrage near London Bridge on Sunday that killed seven, Prime Minister Theresa May pointed to the 'new threat of terrorism breeding terrorism'. In an address from Downing Street, she said: "Perpetrators are inspired to attack not only on the basis of carefully constructed plots ... and not even as lone attackers radicalised online, but by copying one another and often using the crudest of means of attack." She was referring to Islamists using weapons as rudimentary as a knife or a hired vehicle to cause mayhem, like it was done earlier too near Westminster, or as far afield as in Berlin and Nice. It now transpires that the suicide bomb attacker who killed 22 people in a Manchester concert last month, detonated a shrapnel-laden homemade bomb and was acting largely alone. The Boston Marathon bombing in April 2013 was carried out by two brothers who learnt to fabricate a pressure cooker bomb with nails and ball bearings from an online magazine of the notorious Yemen al-Qaeda franchise. For security agencies in US, Britain, France and several other countries, keeping tabs on suspect individuals or small groups is becoming a nightmare, because they rarely show any prior links with known jihadi networks. Rather than a vast terror organisation with tentacles spread across the world, the damage is being done more by attackers who self-radicalised, absorbed easily available terror content on the Web, and carried out copycat attacks. This explains why Prime Minister May singled out internet companies when she said: "We cannot allow this ideology the safe space it needs to breed - yet that is precisely what the internet, and the big companies that provide internet-based services provide." Promising tougher anti-terror laws, the British PM also called for agreements between allied democratic governments 'to regulate cyberspace', so as to prevent the 'spread of extremism and terrorism planning'.While Prime Minister May has raised a matter of serious concern - about a terrorist mindset and ideology that spreads through internet to seek out willing converts in the anonymity of their homes - questions are being posed about her prescription to prevent this sinister phenomenon. Will Britain emulate the Chinese government's aggressive internet policing and blocking of rogue websites? Does her proposal to regulate the internet and its encryption means that security agencies will be armed with the powers and capability to read everyone's messages? Of course, there are other components of the British PM's address that her detractors have locked on to - like the ones about Britons needing to be prepared to have 'embarrassing conversations' about extremism, or about universities grappling with a 'new duty' to prevent extremist radicalising. Does this presage a surveillance apparatus with its eyes and ears everywhere, like the kind of US Homeland Security President Trump has been talking about with his concept of 'extreme vetting' of suspect people? As Prime Minister May warns of 'extremism online', civil liberty groups contend that policing the Web will simply drive terror mongers into its far darker, inaccessible corners. Meanwhile, mega internet companies like Google and Facebook are sure to face a rising tide of demands to be more proactive and effective in removing terror content from their platforms. Facebook has already responded by pointing out that online extremism can only be tackled via strong partnerships with policymakers, civil society and others in the tech industry. It claims that whenever any such objectionable content is detected by its 'combination of technology and human review', law enforcement authorities are alerted at once. But realistically speaking, effective monitoring of the Web to detect terror content is easier said than done, which is why China takes recourse to blocking websites wholesale. Photos, videos and writings with obviously violent content may be simpler to mark out. But what about subtler content? Besides, is there any effective filter to distinguish between the online campaigns run by terror outfits and various genuinely oppressed groups? Clearly, the artificial intelligence (AI)-based filters used by internet companies will need to be far better to do the job. These companies will also have to frame an adequate strategy when various national governments ask them to turn over unencrypted material, or even data about users searching out terror-related content on the Web. This is relevant for India too, with its own terror threat perception.Load-Date: June 6, 2017End of Document

All Rights ReservedLength: 247 wordsByline: ED ADAMCZYKDateline: May 15 BodyRansomware attacks targeting hundreds of businesses and government organizations across the globe slowed Monday, representatives of the entities said.Organizations, governments and corporations worked through the weekend to contain the WannaCry malware that spread through computers in at least 150 countries. The ransomware began taking control of computer systems Friday, demanding $300 per computer to restore access. Britain's National Health Service reported that seven of 47 trusts -- hospitals serving particular areas or with particular specialties -- struck by the ransomware still face computer problems.Others targeted include Germany's rail network Deutsche Bahn, the Russian Interior Ministry, Spain's Telefonica telecommunications provider, one Renault car plant in France and global parcel shipper UPS.By Monday, the number of reports of locked computers lessened after law enforcement agencies mobilized to find those who released the malware. A significant slowing of the problem was reported in Asia. Nine cases were reported in South Korea, and records in two Indonesian hospitals were blocked. While hundreds of thousands of computers were hit Friday in China, that number has been reduced; some Chinese government agencies reported their operations were affected on Monday.Three small companies in Australia reported an inability to unlock their computers."Fewer than 10" companies were affected Monday in France, the French cybersecurity agency ANSII reported.Load-Date: May 16, 2017End of Document

GLOBALFOUNDRIES and VeriSilicon To Enable Single-Chip Solution for Next-Gen IoT Networks; Integrated solution leverages GF's 22FDX® technology to decrease power, area, and cost for NB-IoT and LTE-M applicationsGlobeNewswireJuly 13, 2017 Thursday 8:00 AM PTCopyright 2017 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: PRESS RELEASESLength: 1147 wordsBodySanta Clara, Calif. and Shanghai, China, July  13, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GLOBALFOUNDRIES and VeriSilicon today announced a collaboration to deliver the industry's first single-chip IoT solution for next-generation Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) networks. Leveraging GF's 22FDX® FD-SOI technology, the companies plan to develop intellectual property that could enable a complete cellular modem module on a single chip, including integrated baseband, power management, RF radio and front-end module combining both Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) and LTE-M capabilities. The new approach is expected to deliver significant improvements in power, area, and cost compared to current offerings.With the proliferation of connected devices for smart cities, homes, and industrial applications, network providers are developing new communications protocols that better meet the needs of emerging IoT standards. LPWA technology takes advantage of the existing LTE spectrum and mobile infrastructure, but focuses on delivering ultra-low power, extended range, and much lower data rates for devices that transmit small amounts of infrequent data, such as connected water and gas meters.The two leading LPWA connectivity standards are LTE-M, which is expected to get traction in the U.S. market, and NB-IoT, which is gaining ground in Europe and Asia. For example, the Chinese government has targeted NB-IoT for nationwide deployment over the coming year. The combination of these two technologies is expected to push cellular M2M module shipments to nearly half a billion by 2021, according to ABI Research.GF and VeriSilicon are developing a suite of IP to enable customers to create single chip cost- and power-optimized solutions for worldwide deployment, based on a dual-mode carrier-grade baseband modem with integrated RF front-end module. The design will be fabricated using GF's 22FDX process, which leverages a 22nm FD-SOI technology platform to provide cost-effective scaling and power reduction for IoT applications. 22FDX is the only technology that allows efficient single-chip integration of RF, transceiver, baseband, processor, and power management components. This integration is expected to deliver more than an 80 percent improvement in both power and die size compared to today's 40nm technologies."Our 22FDX technology is perfectly positioned to support the explosive growth of low-power, battery-operated IoT devices," said Alain Mutricy, senior vice president of product management at GF. "We are especially excited about the opportunities presented by the China market, which is leading the way with a nationwide commitment to IoT and smart cities. This new initiative expands on our long standing relationship with VeriSilicon an important partner helping us build an FD-SOI ecosystem around our new 300mm fab in Chengdu.""Started from more than five years ago, as a Silicon Platform as a Service (SiPaaS) company, VeriSilicon has developed FD-SOI IPs and achieved first silicon success of many chips based on FD-SOI technologies. For IoT applications, besides cost advantages, integrated RF, body bias, and embedded memory, such as MRAM, are the key benefits of FD-SOI technologies beyond 28 nm bulk CMOS." said Wayne Dai, VeriSilicon Chairman, President and CEO. "Integrated with RF and PA on GF 22FDX, the baseband and protocol stack are being implemented on our energy efficient and programmable ZSPnano that is optimized for control and data flow with powerful low latency, single cycle instructions for signal processing. GF's new 300 mm fab for FDX in Chengdu and IP platforms such as this single chip solution for integrated NB-IoT and LTE-M, will have significant impact on China IoT and AIoT (AI of Things) industries."GF and VeriSilicon expect to tape out a test chip based on the integrated solution, with silicon validation in Q4 2017. The companies plan to pursue carrier certification in mid-2018.About GF:GLOBALFOUNDRIES is a leading full-service semiconductor foundry providing a unique combination of design, development, and fabrication services to some of the world's most inspired technology companies.

Hangzhou and Expedia celebrate the Great Silk RoadEturbo NewsJuly 20, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 eTurboNews, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 460 wordsDateline: U.S. BodyU.S., July 20 -- The historic city of Hangzhou in Eastern China, in partnership with Expedia Media Solutions, is celebrating the success of a collaborative online marketing campaign based on the route of the two thousand year-old Silk Road that once connected mainland Europe with this immensely powerful city-region.The "Silk Road Race - Explore the Living Hangzhou" campaign used Expedia's massive online marketing resources to successfully promote Hangzhou to the European travel market, positioning it as a world-class destination for business, leisure and cultural travel."We are delighted with the outcome of our collaboration with Expedia Media Solutions", says Mr Zhao, Associate Director of the Hangzhou Tourism Commission. "We feel that it has already deepened and strengthened the relationship between our ancient yet prosperous city and the European travel industry."The success of this partnership, supported by the World Tourism Organization's ongoing Silk Road campaign, has enabled us to promote Hangzhou in the UK and across Europe and to generate great interest in our wonderful and historic city", continues Mr Zhao."Beyond dispute the finest and the noblest city in all the world" Is how Marco Polo described Hangzhou when he visited it in the late thirteenth century, calling it 'The City of Heaven'.Hangzhou was then the largest human settlement in the whole world and it completely overwhelmed this great European traveller whose statue now looks out over the shore of Hangzhou's West Lake, itself a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site.One of China's 'seven ancient capitals', Hangzhou has been designated by the Chinese Government as a "Historic and Cultural City" and it's heritage can be traced back to the Qin Dynasty when it was linked to Beijing via China's Grand Canal (221 BC), itself a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site.Hangzhou is just over 100 miles from Shanghai and it can be reached in 45 minutes via China's astonishing new Bullet Train, travelling at speeds of up to 190 mph!In 2016, Hangzhou hosted the G20 Summit and its tourism infrastructure has also recently been further boosted by large scale investment in several new top quality hotels and conference centers."The Expedia campaign has now come to an end but it has generated well over 30,000 visits and more than 16,000 retweets, demonstrating the vision, wisdom and courage of those who built the Silk Road thousands of years ago and which, to this day, still motivates European travellers to visit and discover the wonders of Hangzhou." concludes Mr Zhao.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from US Eturbo News.
