Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders for the third quarter of 2017 totaled RMB3.0 billion (US$454.6 million), compared to RMB3.5 billion and RMB3.0 billion for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2016, respectively.During the third quarter of 2017, the Company had a net foreign exchange loss of RMB109.9 million (US$16.5 million), compared to a net foreign exchange loss of RMB131.3 million and a net foreign exchange gain of RMB14.8 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter changes in foreign exchange gains and losses were mainly due to unrealized exchange gains and losses arising from the Company's U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and short-term loan balances as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over the periods.NetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$2.88 and US$2.86, respectively, for the third quarter of 2017. The Company reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$3.39 and US$3.37, respectively, for the preceding quarter, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$3.14 and US$3.12, respectively, for the third quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS were US$3.45 and US$3.43, respectively, for the third quarter of 2017, compared to non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$3.96 and US$3.94, respectively, in the preceding quarter, and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$3.46 and US$3.43, respectively, for the third quarter of 2016.Quarterly DividendThe board of directors has approved a dividend of US$0.72 per ADS for the third quarter of 2017, which is expected to be paid on December 8, 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 1, 2017.NetEase paid a dividend of US$1.08 per ADS for the first quarter of 2017 on June 2, 2017 and paid a dividend of US$0.83 per ADS for the second quarter of 2017 on September 1, 2017.Under the Company's quarterly dividend policy announced on May 13, 2014, quarterly dividends will be set at an amount equivalent to approximately 25% of the Company's anticipated net income after tax in each fiscal quarter. The determination to make dividend distributions and the amount of such distributions in any particular quarter will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will be based upon the Company's operations and earnings, cash flow, financial condition and other relevant factors.Other InformationAs of September 30, 2017, the Company's total cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current time deposits and short-term investments balance totaled RMB40.7 billion (US$6.1 billion), compared to RMB36.9 billion as of December 31, 2016. Cash flow generated from operating activities was RMB1.7 billion (US$248.8 million) for the third quarter of 2017, compared to RMB2.3 billion and RMB3.7 billion for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2016, respectively.Share Repurchase ProgramOn November 15, 2016, the Company announced that its board of directors approved a share repurchase program of up to US$1.0 billion of the Company's outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months. As of November 14, 2017, the last day of such program, the Company had repurchased approximately 1.1 million ADSs for approximately US$306.1 million under this program.The Company also today announced that its board of directors has approved a new share repurchase program of up to US$1.0 billion of the Company's outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months beginning on November 16, 2017. NetEase plans to fund repurchases made under this program from available working capital.Under the terms of the approved program, NetEase may repurchase its issued and outstanding ADSs in open-market transactions on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The timing and dollar amount of repurchase transactions will be subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 10b-18 requirements. It is also expected that such repurchases will be effected pursuant to a plan in conformity with SEC Rule 10b5-1.  The extent to which NetEase repurchases its ADSs will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by NetEase's management team. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.** The United States dollar (US$) amounts disclosed in this press release are presented solely for the convenience of the reader.

These statements are made under the "safe harbor" provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these forward-looking statements by terminology such as "will," "expects," "anticipates," "future," "intends," "plans," "believes," "estimates" and similar statements. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted by a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online game market will not continue to grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its leading position in that market, which could occur if, for example, its new online games or expansion packs and other improvements to its existing games do not become as popular as management anticipates; the ability of NetEase to successfully expand its mobile internet offerings; the ability of NetEase to effectively market its games and other services and achieve a positive return on its marketing expenditures; the risk that NetEase's affiliates will not be able to continue operatingMinecraft,World of Warcraft®, StarCraft® II, Hearthstone®,Diablo® III: Reaper of Souls(TM), Heroes of the Storm®,Overwatch® or other games licensed by it for a period of time or permanently due to possible governmental actions or the risk that such games will not be popular with game players in China; the risk that changes in Chinese government regulation of the online game market and the market for NetEase's e-commerce businesses may limit future growth of NetEase's revenues or cause revenues to decline; competition in the online advertising business and the risk that investments by NetEase in its content and services may not increase the appeal of the NetEase websites among internet users or result in increased advertising revenues; the risk that NetEase may not be able to continuously develop new and creative online services, including its ability to maintain and enhance the popularity of its e-mail, mobile and e-commerce businesses and develop attractive mobile games; the risk that NetEase will not be able to control its expenses in future periods; competition in NetEase's existing and potential markets; governmental uncertainties (including possible changes in the effective tax rates applicable to NetEase and its subsidiaries and affiliates and the ability of NetEase to receive and maintain approvals of the preferential tax treatments and general competition and price pressures in the marketplace); the risk that fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi with respect to other currencies could adversely affect NetEase's business and financial results; and other risks outlined in NetEase's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NetEase does not undertake any obligation to update this forward-looking information, except as required under the applicable law.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresNetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS, as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP").NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders as net income attributable to the Company's shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders enables NetEase's management to assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges. NetEase believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the Company's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates investors' assessment of its operating performance.Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. See "Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results" at the end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.Contact for Media and Investors:Juliet YangNetEase,

GLOBAL MILSATCOM CONFERENCE 2017States News ServiceNovember 8, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 1406 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: LONDON BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Defence of the United Kingdom:From:Ministry of Defence and General Sir Chris Deverell KCB MBE ADC GenSpeech by General Sir Chris Deverell KCB MBE ADC Gen, Commander of Joint Forces Command.Let me begin by saying what a great privilege it is to speak at this conference. I am sure Harriet Baldwin would have expressed a similar sentiment if she not been obliged to attend to pressing business overseas, for which I apologise on her behalf.As an arts graduate, I cannot profess to be a leading expert on orbital mechanics. But I am an enthusiast for space, and have been so since, as a 10 year old, I was taken by my parents to a mountain top in Fiji, where we then lived, to watch the re-entry of an Apollo mission. This was a magical experience for me. Not only was this a shooting star with men in it, as it appeared to me, but I realised that it was a very significant moment because my parents awoke my sister and I at one am to begin the journey to the mountain, an hour of the day I had never seen before!And later in my life, as a tank soldier prone to getting lost at night, trying to read a map with a red torch and red contour lines, I marvelled and thanked the Lord for the arrival of GPS navigation. Still later, as a Brigade Commander in Iraq, I was hugely grateful for what satellite communications could do for us.So I'm pleased to now find myself as the commander of the UK's Joint Forces Command, responsible, amongst other things, for C4ISR, including cyber, special forces, and joint warfighting, because I am in a position to put my enthusiasm and belief in space to good use.The UK has been a space faring nation for decades. We launched the first Skynet satellite in 1969. Since then, you and your colleagues have built a thriving space industry, generating a turnover of 14 billion a year and employing about 40,000 people in the UK.The UK is a world leader in certain technologies: 40% of the world's small satellites are built in the UK, and a quarter of the world's telecommunication satellites. And the space systems and services generated by the UK space sector support a wide range of applications across wider society: more than 250 billion of our gross domestic product is supported by satellite services.Satellites are the reason we can make mobile phone calls, take money from cash machines, ensure our emergency services get to where they need to, and a whole range of activities vital to our daily lives.Defence is just as dependent. More than 90% of the platforms and systems that constitute the UK military equipment programme are dependent on space to some degree. It is space based capability, much of it benefitting from US investment, that has enabled modern information warfare and precision attack. It is this dependence, combined with our appreciation of the growing threats and hazards, which has led us to increase the attention we are giving to space.How are the risks increasing? From both natural and manmade sources. There are the dangers of 'space debris', remains of previous spacecraft orbiting the Earth that travel at speeds of up to 17,500 miles per hour, and environmental hazards like geomagnetic storms, which can damage Earth orbiting satellites.We also have to recognise that potential adversaries see the reliance on space by the UK and our allies as an important vulnerability, and are developing weapons that can exploit that vulnerability. Russia and China have both admitted to developing direct ascent anti-satellite missiles.This should concern all of us: the testing of such weapons in 2007 by the Chinese government created at least 2,000 pieces of space debris, threatening the sustainability of this shared domain.But there are positive changes taking place as well, principally around commercial investment in space related RandD. As in the field of micro-electronics, it is no longer governments and defence departments who are driving innovation, and this is leading to greater accessibility and lower costs. Which is good, because our demand for space services continues to increase.Be it new launch capabilities, mega-constellations, or satellites that provide on orbit repair and refuelling, the space market is evolving in a way that opens up new opportunities for the further exploitation of space.As this market continues to develop, we will work together to ensure the continued security of the space domain. We cannot take this for granted: our dependence is great and growing, and the space environment becomes progressively congested and competitive. Gone are the days when we could launch satellites into space and expect them to operate unchallenged.Our government recognises the vital importance of working closely with industry on these matters. That is why it published a National Space Policy and acknowledged the importance of space to our prosperity and security in the 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review.This included a number of commitments. One was to invest in space surveillance capability, enabling us to further assess space threats, risks and events, both natural and man made. Another was to invest in multi-signal satellite navigation receivers, which will enhance the resilience of the armed forces and emergency services to the loss or disruption of GPS service. And a third was the commitment to enhance our Space Operations Centre and invest in a ballistic missile defence radar that would also enhance our space situational awareness.As we develop our strategy and capabilities in response to these changes, we will look to secure our freedom of action in, to and from space, fully exploiting its military and civil potential. The emerging themes of our space strategy are as follows:optimising space support to the front line, making sure our forces can absolutely depend on getting the services they needenhancing the protection and resilience of space based assets, keeping safe the space assets that underpin our military and civil national security, andcomplementing cross-government space activity, to maximise the opportunities that arise from coordinating matters of security and prosperityNick Ayling will elaborate on these points in the next session, and Air Commodore Nick Hay will discuss in more detail how this applies to our future military satellite communications capability. So let me finish by highlighting the overarching importance of strong relationships to the delivery of our ambitions.We must work closely with our industrial partners in the space sector to exploit innovative emerging technologies.We must work closely with our allies, following the principles of "international by design" to deliver joint force advantage in space, much like we do in every other domain.As with every other aspect of Britain's safety and security, it depends not just on our own efforts, but on working with our allies to manage common threats and hazards that face us all. And this is at least as true in space as anywhere else.Our relationship with the US on space has traditionally been close: the radar at Fylingdales has long contributed to US led networks. And as we develop the next generation of Skynet we will ensure it is as interoperable as possible with US and allied systems. This will be made possible by the framework provided by the Combined Space Operations initiative, through which we are seeking a safe, secure and resilient space environment.And the UK's departure from the European Union will not prevent us from working with our European neighbours on matter of space security. As well as working bilaterally with member states, the UK will seek the closest possible participation in EU space programmes such as Galileo, commensurate with the contribution that UK government and industry has made to date, and where we can continue to add real value.In conclusion, space offers great opportunities. But the strategic context is much like it is here on Earth: becoming less certain, with increasing threats that will take skill and commitment to manage successfully. And that is what we must do. You must judge us by our actions rather than our words as we pursue these goals, but I very much hope you will work closely with us, and our allies as we seek to protect our interests and enhance our capabilities.I look forward to our continued close working between defence and industry on military programmes, particularly Skynet 6.Load-Date: November 8, 2017End of Document

Investment Analysts' Downgrades for August, 14th (AMAT, AMTD, BIOS, COO, ECYT, IFF, IFNNY, JCP, MACK, MSCC)American Banking and Market NewsAugust 14, 2017 MondayCopyright 2017 American Banking and Market News All Rights ReservedLength: 2583 wordsBodyInvestment Analysts' downgrades for Monday, August 14th: Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research  from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, "Applied Materials is one of the world s largest suppliers of fabrication equipment to semiconductor, LCD and solar PV cell manufacturers. The company&#39;s second quarter fiscal 2017 results beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on earnings and revenues. Over the last one year, the stock has outperformed the industry it belongs to. Applied Materials is in a great position to grow sustainably and profitably based on its strong pipeline of enabling technologies, supported by expanding opportunities on the semiconductor, service and display fronts. Nevertheless, high fixed cost structure and customer concentration remain concerns." TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:AMTD) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research  from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, "TD Ameritrade has outperformed the industry in the past year. The company s third-quarter fiscal 2017 results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results reflected increased revenues and eased margin pressure.  The company recorded a rise in average client trades per day in the fiscal third quarter with the trend continuing in the first month of the current quarter, indicating trading activity improvement. Further, its deal to acquire Scottrade is likely to be accretive to earnings per share (EPS) in double digits. Though we remain cautious of the elevated costs, which are likely to weigh on the financials, TD Ameritrade s steady capital deployment activities are encouraging." BioScrip (NASDAQ:BIOS) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research  from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, "BioScrip exited the second quarter on a dismal note with revenues missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and adjusted net loss wider-than-expected. Management s unimpressive 2017 guidance, which includes the negative impact of the Cures Act legislation, also adds to our concerns. Nonetheless, the market is upbeat about BioScrip s announcement to continue to offer certain core product lines to UnitedHealthcare. We are encouraged by the company s recent progress, courtesy of its new multi-faceted CORE plan which was adopted to improve the financial position. Further, the company achieved annualized supply chain improvement of roughly $20 million since the acquisition of Home Solutions. Over the last three months, BioScrip has been trading above the broader industry." Cooper Companies, Inc. (The) (NYSE:COO) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research  from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, "The Cooper Companies generates a significant part of its revenues in foreign currencies. Thus, the ongoing unfavorable currency translation is expected to negatively impact the company s top-line growth in 2017. Furthermore, intensifying competition in the contact lens will continue to increase pricing pressure for the company. Also, the stocks overvaluation reflects a relatively dull scenario that might be a cause for investors  concern. However, the company ended second-quarter fiscal 2017 with the Zacks Consensus Estimates beating on both lines. On a positive note, the company outperformed the broader industry in terms of price performance over the past six months. The Cooper Companies have always had an impressive show from its CooperSurgical business segment. The CooperVision segment also delivered strong sales in the last quarter, buoyed by robust performance by Toric." Endocyte (NASDAQ:ECYT) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research  from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, "Endocyte reported wider than expected loss in second-quarter 2017. During the quarter, the company stopped enrollment in the phase Ib study evaluating EC1456 for lung cancer as well as stop enrollment of taxane-naive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients for EC1169. The company now plans to focus on its most promising programs like CAR T-cell small-molecule drug conjugates (SMDC) adaptor platform, and its pipeline candidate EC2629. However, with no approved product in its portfolio at the moment, Endocyte has to depend heavily on its partners for top-line growth. Moreover, shares of the company have underperformed the industry year to date." Internationa Flavors & Fragrances (NYSE:IFF) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research  from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, "In the last three months, International Flavors & Fragrances&#39; shares have outperformed the industry. In second-quarter 2017, the company&#39;s recorded a positive earnings surprise of 4.2%. Compared with the year-ago quarter, adjusted earnings of $1.50 grew 2% year over year on the back of benefits from acquired assets, healthy segmental performance and lower shares outstanding. For 2017, the company anticipates net sales to grow 7.5-8.5% on a currency neutral basis while predicts earnings per share to increase 6.5-7.5%. The company anticipates gaining from its acquired businesses as well as from its multi-year productivity program, enabling it to check costs, make strategic investments and expand businesses globally. However, forex woes are predicted to negatively impact earnings per share by 2.5% and revenues by 1%. Also, the company is exposed to risks arising geopolitical issues and stiff competition." Infineon Technologies AG (NASDAQ:IFNNY) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research  from a strong-buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, "Infineon&#39;s third-quarter fiscal 2017 results were impressive in terms of top-line growth, which demonstrated the company s strong growth prospects in the automotive market (42% of total revenue). The company s products are currently used by eight of the top-10 electric vehicle makers. Infineon holds a dominating position in the xEV power semiconductor market. Over the last three quarters, design wins almost doubled as compared with numbers in fiscal 2016. Moreover, the company s focus on developing energy-efficient solutions is a key catalyst going ahead.  We note that Infineon has outperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis. However, slowdown in smartphone sales can prove to be a major drag going forward. Additionally, the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, and price erosion is likely to be major headwinds going ahead." J.C. Penney Company, Inc. Holding (NYSE:JCP) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research  from a strong-buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, "J. C. Penney Company shares which have underperformed the industry in the past one year were further battered after the company reported wider-than-expected second-quarter loss. Even the top line which not only surpassed the estimate for the first time after missing the same in the preceding five quarters but also increased year over year failed to cushion the stock. Nevertheless, in an effort to lure more customers and ramp up sales, management has introduced a new loyalty program. These along with remodeling, renovation and refurbishment of stores with special attention on enhancing the reach of national and especially private-label brands looks promising. J. C. Penney is also gradually increasing the count of Sephora stores which is going great business. However, the impact of challenging retail landscape, high-debt level, stiff competition from online retailers, and waning store traffic concerns linger." Merrimack Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:MACK) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research  from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, "Merrimack reported a dismal second quarter with its top and bottom lines missing estimates.With the sale of Onivyde, Merrimack is back to being a development-stage biopharmaceutical company. The successful development of the three lead candidates in its pipeline is critical for Merrimack s growth. Moreover, two of the candidates, MM-121 and MM-141, are still being evaluated in phase II studies. The third candidate, MM-310 entered phase I study in the first quarter of 2017. Also, shares of the company have underperformed the industry year to date. However, the cash received from Ipsen was used to pay down the huge debt and return value to shareholders in the form of dividends. Moreover, the company has also invested a part of the proceeds to develop its streamlined oncology pipeline." Microsemi Corporation (NASDAQ:MSCC) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research  from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, "Microsemi Corporation is an OEM of a broad range of high-reliability and analog/mixed signal integrated circuits. third-quarter fiscal 2017 non-GAAP earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues were in line with the same. The company&#39;s focus on improving product mix, operational efficiency, and consolidation are driving revenues and margins through 2017. Moreover, we have confidence in the company&#39;s strategic positioning, strong fundamentals and growth prospects. Microsemi&#39;s scope for margin expansion and decent balance sheet are the other positives. However, pockets of weakness related to product transition at medical customers, push-out of some communications spending in China and a softer oil & gas market continue to impact revenues. Over the last one year, the stock has underperformed the industry it belongs to." Nikon Corp (NASDAQ:NINOY) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research  from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, "Nikon s earnings for first-quarter fiscal 2018 declined significantly year over year, dragged by adverse product mix in Imaging Products and poor performance of the Semiconductor Lithography business. In the Instruments Business, the microscope-related field suffered, mainly due to delayed budget execution by the government. Over the past one year, Nikon s shares have grossly underperformed the industry s average return. However, Nikon is focusing on expansion in two new segments, namely Medical and Instruments business, which should stoke growth in the times to come. It is also undertaking a number of initiatives on stabilizing the key financials of its core business areas   including Precision Equipment and Imaging Products   to stoke growth. Nikon also anticipates strong capital investments in the semiconductor-related field, which will drive growth in the Precision Equipment Business, going forward." Office Depot (NASDAQ:ODP) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research  from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, "Persistent weakness in the office products sector, stiff competition, loss of customers in Business Solutions Division and lower traffic count have been playing spoilsport for Office Depot. The company succumbed to a negative earnings surprise in second-quarter 2017, after three straight quarters of earnings beat, while sales also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the 12th quarter in row. We note both the top and bottom lines declined year over year. Following the dismal show, the stock took a bearish path and has now underperformed the industry in the past one month. Nevertheless, Office Depot is concentrating on business operating model, growth prospects, cost structure, and omni-channel capabilities. Management anticipates total sales to be lower in 2017 versus 2016 due to store closures, tough market conditions and losses of contract customers in the prior year. However, the rate of decline is expected to decelerate sequentially." Verifone Systems (NYSE:PAY) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research  from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, "VeriFone has underperformed the broader industry on a year-to-date basis. Based on the unimpressive second-quarter results and divestiture of three non-core businesses, the company lowered its fiscal 2017 guidance. Continued forex volatility along with increasing competition remain key areas of concern for the company. Nevertheless, we believe that the company&#39;s strong product portfolio that  now includes the likes of Carbon 8 and Engage will help in expanding customer base in the long haul." Sina Corporation (NASDAQ:SINA) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research  from a hold rating to a strong sell rating. According to Zacks, "SINA Corp reported second quarter 2017 results wherein both earnings and revenues grew year over year. However, we believe that uncertainty over its advertising business and portal, which is preventing management from providing quarterly guidance, doesn&#39;t augur well for investors. Further, we believe that continuing investments in Weibo and other verticals like Internet finance, automobile and sports will hurt profitability, going forward. SINA s monetization efforts may see regulatory pressure due to restrictions imposed by the Chinese government, which may hurt subscriber growth. The company is also seeing some headwinds in regards to obtaining new media rights for sports in China. Nevertheless, the growing popularity of Weibo and a robust mobile user base in China remain positives for the company." Transdigm Group (NYSE:TDG) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research  from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, "TransDigm reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings of $3.20 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.98 on the back of robust top-line performance and improvements in operating margin. TransDigm s excellent business operation model, which implements value-based operating strategies guided by three value driver concepts, has helped the company drive operating margin expansion over the past few quarters. This apart, TransDigm s strategic acquisitions has bolstered its aftermarket content. However, on the flip side, softening discretionary retrofits, interior retrofits and weaknesses in jet and helicopter markets have impacted the company s top-line performance in recent times. Year-to-date shares have underperformed the industry s average return over the past one year. TransDigm s commercial transportation business is suffering from inventory management issues from OEM customers." West Fraser Timber Co. (TSE:WFT) was downgraded by analysts at BMO Capital Markets from an outperform rating to a market perform rating.  DENTSPLY SIRONA (NASDAQ:XRAY) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research  from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, "DENTSPLY SIRONA&#39;s robust performance by its flagship dental implants, CAD/CAM systems, imaging systems, treatment centers and orthodontic product platforms hold considerable promise over the long haul. The company recently announced the renewal of an existing distribution agreement with Henry Schein Canada, Inc. The agreement is a smart move by DENTSPLY SIRONA as the preexisting distribution agreement did not include the CEREC CAD/CAM restoration system and the Schick line of imaging sensors. However higher capital expenditure on product development and tough competition are expected to put margins under pressure. Unfavorable foreign exchange rate and integration are the major risks in the near term. The price performance of the stock has been unfavorable over the last three months."  Load-Date: August 14, 2017End of Document

Coupa and Aisino CorporationPartner to Form Strategic Alliance; Global companies in world's second largest economyto manage more of their spend on Coupa's unified platformGlobeNewswireNovember 7, 2017 Tuesday 5:30 AM PTCopyright 2017 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENTLength: 992 wordsBodySAN MATEO, Calif., Nov.  07, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Coupa Software (NASDAQ:COUP), a leader in cloud-based spend management, announced today that it formed a strategic alliance with China-based Aisino Corporation to help global companies with branches in the world's second largest economy manage their spend on Coupa's unified platform.The alliance will help enable multinational companies in China to manage their spend    including tax invoice issuances    with Coupa's Procure-to-Pay solution. Currently, many global companies with offices in China process their tax invoicing outside of a spend software platform because China requires businesses to issue every invoice via its closed authorized tax invoice issuance program as part of the Golden Tax program.The cloud tax alliance will help global customers manage their tax invoices via Aisino on Coupa's unified platform while still being able to meet the tax reporting requirements of the Chinese government."Our international customers want to streamline their global spend processes in China, and we are fulfilling their request by forming this alliance with Aisino    the only one of its kind in the world's second largest economy," said Roger Goulart, senior vice president of business development and alliances at Coupa.Under this arrangement, Aisino and Coupa will build joint enterprise solutions and products - from invoice to tax management and financial management    to streamline spend for multinational companies in China."Aisino has chosen Coupa to join this cloud tax strategic alliancebased on the company's successful track record in other parts of the world and also its early successes in China," said Jianjian Wang, senior executive who works in the Golden Tax and Enterprise Market Central Division at Aisino. "Both companies will bring to this collaboration their collective business expertise to create a one-stop-shop experience for customers.""Having been invited to join Aisino_s cloud tax strategic alliance as the only foreign service provider is a great honor for Coupa and testament to the superior purchase-to-pay processes we have built over the past years," said Markus Hornburg, vice president of global product compliance at Coupa.

NetEase Reports Second Quarter 2017 Unaudited Financial ResultsPR NewswireAugust 9, 2017 Wednesday 7:00 PM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 5265 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Aug. 9, 2017 Body NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ: NTES) ("NetEase" or the "Company"), one of China's leading internet and online game services providers, today announced its unaudited financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017.Second Quarter 2017 Financial HighlightsNet revenues were RMB13.4 billion (US$2.0 billion), an increase of 49.4% compared with the second quarter of 2016.- Online game services net revenues were RMB9.4 billion (US$1.4 billion), an increase of 46.5% compared with the second quarter of 2016.- Advertising services net revenues were RMB595.6 million (US$87.9 million), an increase of 12.1% compared with the second quarter of 2016.- E-mail, e-commerce and others net revenues were RMB3.4 billion (US$494.2 million), an increase of 68.9% compared with the second quarter of 2016.Gross profit was RMB6.7 billion (US$993.7 million), an increase of 27.6% compared with the second quarter of 2016.Total operating expenses were RMB3.3 billion (US$491.4 million), an increase of 49.2% compared with the second quarter of 2016.Net income attributable to the Company's shareholders was RMB3.0 billion (US$438.4 million), an increase of 9.2% compared with the second quarter of 2016.

See "Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results" at the end of this press release.Second Quarter 2017 Operational HighlightsFurther expanded global footprint withOnmyoji, achieving record high downloads in Japan and Southeast Asia.Launched new mobile titles includingLand of GloryandTreasure Hunter, both of which were well received by players in China.Many legacy titles continued to increase in popularity among players with PC-client gameFantasy Westward Journey Onlineand mobile gameInvinciblereaching record high quarterly revenues."Our total net revenues grew nearly 50% in the second quarter compared with last year as we continued to invest in new content development that broadens our offering and engages our community across our business lines," said Mr. William Ding, Chief Executive Officer and Director of NetEase. "Our online games, advertising services and e-commerce divisions continue to grow. While e-commerce is becoming an increasingly important revenue contributor, our self-developed mobile games remain our primary growth engine. During the second quarter, many legacy titles maintained their popularity, while our instant hit titleOnmyojihad a natural ebb and flow. To bolster the power of this game's IP, we recently commenced dedicated brand expansion initiatives, and our international launch strategy is progressing well.""Additional penetration in China's mobile market, as well as overseas markets, offers considerable room for NetEase's ever-increasing portfolio, particularly as we introduce new gameplay options and genres that diversify and strengthen our offering. We have an exciting pipeline of upcoming games, including the highly anticipated sandbox gameMinecraft, as well asIndexandForever 7, two stunning Japanese-themed RPGs. From our time-honored online games and advertising services, to our flourishingKaola.comandYanxuane-commerce divisions, we will look to further strengthen our portfolio and top-quality internet services that propel our business forward," Mr. Ding concluded.Second Quarter 2017 Financial ResultsNetRevenuesNet revenues for the second quarter of 2017 were RMB13,376.0 million (US$1,973.1 million), compared to RMB13,640.5 million and RMB8,952.8 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2016, respectively.Net revenues from online games were RMB9,430.2 million (US$1,391.0 million) for the second quarter of 2017, compared to RMB10,735.5 million and RMB6,438.3 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2016, respectively. Mobile games accounted for approximately 72.4% of net revenues from online games in the second quarter of 2017, compared to 73.3% and 61.3% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2016, respectively.Net revenues from advertising services were RMB595.6 million (US$87.9 million) for the second quarter of 2017, compared to RMB445.2 million and RMB531.1 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2016, respectively. The top performing advertising verticals in the second quarter of 2017 were automobile, internet services and real estate.Net revenues from e-mail, e-commerce and others were RMB3,350.3 million (US$494.2 million) for the second quarter of 2017, compared to RMB2,459.9 million and RMB1,983.4 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2016, respectively.Gross ProfitGross profit for the second quarter of 2017 was RMB6,736.9 million (US$993.7 million), compared to RMB7,483.6 million and RMB5,280.4 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2016, respectively.The year-over-year increase in online games gross profit was primarily driven by revenue contribution from mobile games such asOnmyojiand the mobile version ofNew Ghost. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in online games gross profit was primarily due to decreased revenue contribution from mobile games.The year-over-year increase in advertising services gross profit was primarily due to NetEase's enhanced monetization efforts. The quarter-over-quarter increase in advertising services gross profit was primarily due to seasonality.The year-over-year decrease in e-mail, e-commerce and others gross profit was primarily due to decreased revenue contribution from certain e-commerce businesses with relatively higher gross profit margins.Gross Profit MarginGross profit margin for the online games business for the second quarter of 2017 was 63.1%, compared to 63.9% and 66.2% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to increased revenue contribution from mobile games, which have relatively lower gross profit margins, as a percentage of NetEase's total online games net revenues.Gross profit margin for the advertising services business for the second quarter of 2017 was 67.6%, compared to 57.3% and 65.5% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-year increase in gross profit margin was mainly due to NetEase's enhanced monetization efforts. The quarter-over-quarter increase in gross profit margin was mainly due to seasonality.Gross profit margin for the e-mail, e-commerce and others businesses for the second quarter of 2017 was 11.3%, compared to 14.8% and 33.8% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter changes in gross profit margin were primarily attributable to changes in NetEase's e-commerce business mix.Operating ExpensesTotal operating expenses for the second quarter of 2017 were RMB3,331.5 million (US$491.4 million), compared to RMB2,711.7 million and RMB2,232.5 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in operating expenses were mainly due to higher staff-related costs resulting from an increase in headcount and average compensation, increased selling and marketing expenses mainly related to online games, and operating expenses related to NetEase's e-commerce businesses.Income TaxesThe Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB703.5 million (US$103.8 million) for the second quarter of 2017, compared to RMB943.0 million and RMB262.7 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2016, respectively. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2017 was 19.0%, compared to 19.0% and 8.6% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-year increase in the effective tax rate was mainly due to the fact that certain subsidiaries of the Company were recognized as Key Software Enterprises in the second quarter of 2016 and subject to a preferential tax rate of 10% for 2015, and the Company recognized related tax credits in the second quarter of 2016. The effective tax rate represents certain estimates by the Company as to the tax obligations and benefits applicable to it in each quarter.Net Income After TaxNet income attributable to the Company's shareholders for the second quarter of 2017 totaled RMB3.0 billion (US$438.4 million), compared to RMB3.9 billion and RMB2.7 billion for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2016, respectively. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders for the second quarter of 2017 totaled RMB3.5 billion (US$512.2 million), compared to RMB4.3 billion and RMB3.2 billion for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2016, respectively.During the second quarter of 2017, the Company had a net foreign exchange loss of RMB131.3 million (US$19.4 million), compared to a net foreign exchange loss of RMB48.5 million and a net foreign exchange gain of RMB77.3 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter changes in foreign exchange gains and losses were mainly due to unrealized exchange gains and losses arising from the Company's U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and short-term loan balances as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over the periods.NetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$3.33 and US$3.31, respectively, for the second quarter of 2017. The Company reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$4.40 and US$4.36, respectively, for the preceding quarter, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$3.06 and US$3.04, respectively, for the second quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS were US$3.89 and US$3.86, respectively, for the second quarter of 2017, compared to non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$4.86 and US$4.82, respectively, in the preceding quarter, and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$3.62 and US$3.60, respectively, for the second quarter of 2016.Quarterly DividendThe board of directors has approved a dividend of US$0.83 per ADS for the second quarter of 2017, which is expected to be paid on September 1, 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 25, 2017.NetEase paid a dividend of US$1.08 per ADS for the first quarter of 2017 on June 2, 2017.Under the Company's quarterly dividend policy announced on May 13, 2014, quarterly dividends will be set at an amount equivalent to approximately 25% of the Company's anticipated net income after tax in each fiscal quarter. The determination to make dividend distributions and the amount of such distributions in any particular quarter will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will be based upon the Company's operations and earnings, cash flow, financial condition and other relevant factors.Other InformationAs of June 30, 2017, the Company's total cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current time deposits and short-term investments balance totaled RMB41.2 billion (US$6.1 billion), compared to RMB36.9 billion as of December 31, 2016. Cash flow generated from operating activities was RMB2.3 billion (US$342.4 million) for the second quarter of 2017, compared to RMB4.0 billion and RMB3.3 billion for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2016, respectively.Share Repurchase ProgramOn November 15, 2016, the Company announced that its board of directors approved a share repurchase program of up to US$1.0 billion of the Company's outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months. As of June 30, 2017, the Company had repurchased approximately 366,000 ADSs for approximately US$100.3 million under this program.** The United States dollar (US$) amounts disclosed in this press release are presented solely for the convenience of the reader.

These statements are made under the "safe harbor" provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these forward-looking statements by terminology such as "will," "expects," "anticipates," "future," "intends," "plans," "believes," "estimates" and similar statements. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted by a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online game market will not continue to grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its leading position in that market, which could occur if, for example, its new online games or expansion packs and other improvements to its existing games do not become as popular as management anticipates; the ability of NetEase to successfully expand its mobile internet offerings; the ability of NetEase to effectively market its games and other services and achieve a positive return on its marketing expenditures; the risk that Shanghai EaseNet will not be able to continue operatingWorld of Warcraft®, StarCraft® II, Hearthstone®,Diablo® III: Reaper of Souls(TM), Heroes of the Storm®,Overwatch® or other games licensed by it for a period of time or permanently due to possible governmental actions or the risk that such games will not be popular with game players in China; the risk that changes in Chinese government regulation of the online game market and the market for NetEase's e-commerce businesses may limit future growth of NetEase's revenues or cause revenues to decline; competition in the online advertising business and the risk that investments by NetEase in its content and services may not increase the appeal of the NetEase websites among internet users or result in increased advertising revenues; the risk that NetEase may not be able to continuously develop new and creative online services, including its ability to maintain and enhance the popularity of its e-mail, mobile and e-commerce businesses and develop attractive mobile games; the risk that NetEase will not be able to control its expenses in future periods; competition in NetEase's existing and potential markets; governmental uncertainties (including possible changes in the effective tax rates applicable to NetEase and its subsidiaries and affiliates and the ability of NetEase to receive and maintain approvals of the preferential tax treatments and general competition and price pressures in the marketplace); the risk that fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi with respect to other currencies could adversely affect NetEase's business and financial results; and other risks outlined in NetEase's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NetEase does not undertake any obligation to update this forward-looking information, except as required under the applicable law.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresNetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS, as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP").NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders as net income attributable to the Company's shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses and certain impairment on investment. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders enables NetEase's management to assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses and certain impairment on investment, which are non-cash charges. NetEase believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the Company's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates investors' assessment of its operating performance.Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses and certain impairment on investment have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. See "Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results" at the end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.Contact for Media and Investors:Juliet YangNetEase,

Bytom Blockchain Developers Takes Home the Second Prize in the 2nd Cosmos HackathonPR NewswireSeptember 21, 2017 Thursday 8:22 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 273 wordsDateline: HANGZHOU, China, Sept. 21, 2017 BodyGuo Guanghua and Xu Liucheng, two developers of the Bytom team from 8BTC.com won the second prize of theCosmos Hackathon on September 15 with a reward of 10,000 dollars, which represents the best achievement a Chinese team has gained in the competition. Cosmos aims to build a network of interoperable ledgers to host multi-assets and blockchains.The competition lasts for 6 weeks and encourages participants to turn innovative ideas into working applications. It brought together some big figures of Tendermint in the judges' seats: CEO Jae Kwon, Co-founder Ethan Bushman and CSO Jim Yang.The Bytom team put forward a technical model Chainmint that is based on Tendermint consensus and combined with UTXO and CVM system, which serves as a cross-chain Cosmos Zone. In short: Chainmint = UTXO + CVM + Tendermint. (More details at: https://github.com/chainx-org/chainmint)The idea of Chainmint stood out from over 100 competitors and was highly-appreciated by the judges."It's amazing that they are trying to solve real-life problems."In 2016, the Chinese government listed the blockchain technology in its Thirteenth Five-Year National Informatization Plan. A growing number of companies are looking for blockchain-based solutions to rebuild trust and solve industry bottlenecks. Though still in its infancy, the blockchain technology has been gaining momentum to disrupt the world. It's predictable that blockchain is well on track to change the world for better.View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bytom-blockchain-developers-takes-home-the-second-prize-in-the-2nd-cosmos-hackathon-300523575.htmlSOURCE 8BTC.comCONTACT: Bishop Hou, +86-180-3796-6957, houly@bytom.ioLoad-Date: September 22, 2017End of Document

Ex- SEC Commissioner Suggests Owning Shares Of Companies That Use Bitcoin But Not The Currency ItselfBenzinga.comSeptember 14, 2017 Thursday 2:32 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Accretive Capital LLC d/b/a Benzinga All Rights ReservedLength: 318 wordsByline: Wayne DugganBodyIt s been a rough month for bitcoin investors. The price of a bitcoin dropped another 7 percent Thursday after one of the biggest Chinese exchanges is closing its doors. On Thursday, BTC China tweeted that it will cease operations at the end of the month as the Chinese government ramps up its crackdown on cryptocurrencies.Bitcoin prices topped $5,013 earlier this month but were trading at around $3,600 early Thursday, down more than 28 percent from their peak.To make matters worse, some big names on Wall Street have blasted bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market this week. It s worse than tulip bulbs,  JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Tuesday.  It won t end well. It will blow up. Arthur Levitt, former commissioner of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said that just because the cryptocurrency markets are wildly speculative at the moment doesn t mean cryptocurrencies are going away. It s here to stay because of the disparity between countries where a monetary system is robust and countries where there is virtually no monetary system, this comes up as an alternative currency,  Levitt said.Levitt said he would avoid investing directly in bitcoin due to its wild price fluctuations that are  hard to understand.  However, he said he would consider investing in companies that use or trade in bitcoin.September has certainly taken its toll on the Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTC: GBTC). The ETF is now down 43.7 percent since Sept. 1.Bitcoin rivalEthereum isn t faring much better lately. After trading above $400 earlier this summer, the price of ether dropped another 15 percent on Thursday to around $232.Related Link: 4 Ways To Trade BitcoinLatest Ratings for GBTCDateFirmActionFromToJul 2015WedbushInitiates Coverage onOutperformView More Analyst Ratings for GBTC           View the Latest Analyst Ratings© 2017 Benzinga.com.

Phosphate Market Procurement Research Report Now Available from SpendEdgeBusiness WireOctober 4, 2017 Wednesday 2:45 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business EditorsLength: 767 wordsDateline: LONDON BodyGlobal procurement market intelligence advisory firm, SpendEdge , has announced the release of their '            Phosphate Procurement Research Report .' The insights and data in this report provide a strategic analysis of the supply markets, factors influencing purchasing decisions, procurement best practices, pricing models, supplier landscape, and an analysis of the supplier capability matrix for the            chemicals industry .

View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171004005715/en/Global Phosphate Procurement Market Intelligence Report (Graphic: Business Wire)"Rapid growth of the meat and dairy industries is expected to augment the market growth for phosphate," says SpendEdge procurement research analyst Anil Seth. "Phosphate finds several uses such as stabilization of pH value and improvement in the texture of meats during storage," added Anil.Key Report FeaturesSupply Market InsightsNegotiation StrategiesProcurement Best PracticesCategory Risk AnalysisCost Saving OpportunitiesKey Supplier AnalysisPricing ModelsSupplier Capability MatrixLooking for more insights from this report?

NPK, i.e., nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, for crop production. Phosphorous is a key nutrient in crop production. Crops rely on phosphorous for proper growth, utilization of sugar and starch, photosynthesis, and cell division.• Suppliers that have large inventories of phosphate rock and other raw materials can commit to large production output due to the steady availability of raw material reserves. Hence, purchasing managers are recommended to collaborate with suppliers that possess large production capacities and strong inventories.• China is one of the largest phosphate producing countries. It faced oversupply conditions, making it the leading exporter. The Chinese government realized that phosphate reserves are limited and export strategy is not favorable for the country's economy. Furthermore, a decline in Chinese exports can affect supply in the market and reduce the supply pool of phosphate.This report is available at a discount for a limited time only: View the report snapshot before purchasingPhosphate Pricing TrendsThe spot pricing and volume-based pricing are the two most widely accepted pricing models in the phosphate market. The spot pricing model helps purchasing managers procure appropriate quantities of phosphate-based products. Moreover, as the prices of phosphate are tied to market indices of phosphate rock, purchasing managers can conduct price forecast and estimation, and leverage drops in prices. However, volume-based pricing helps purchasing managers in managing budgets, as prices are fixed for the duration of the contract, which subsequently helps buyers to manage product prices such as crop prices. Also, it helps reducing the management efforts as it does not require constant monitoring of changes in commodity prices.Get unlimited access to all our reports.

Shimao Qianhai Center debuts on the large billboard overlooking New York's Times Square; Large-scale landmark takes its place on the roster of the world's most impressive real estate projectsPR NewswireAugust 15, 2017 Tuesday 8:00 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 390 wordsDateline: NEW YORK, Aug. 15, 2017 BodyShimao Qianhai Center, a major landmark in Shenzhen, China, debuts on the large billboard overlooking New York's Times Square on August 15, 2017. The same day, promotional campaigns highlighting the center kicks off in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou, China. Shimao Qianhai Center's campaigns simultaneously conducted in the five cities not only announce its commitment to international expansion, but also demonstrate the landmark's strong self-confidence and pride in both the property project itself and in China's stature as a leading economic power on the international stage.Under the One Belt, One Road initiative, the Chinese government's program to build trade routes along the ancient Silk Road, the country has sped up development of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area in accordance with its national economic development strategy, one which will have a far-reaching influence on China's and the world's economy. Qianhai, a US$60 billion investment, will serve as an anchor force and a core element of the area's economy.The center, a super-scale landmark located in the core area of Qianhai Mawan, Shenzhen, is a joint project involving five internationally-renowned design firms, Gensler, AECOM, Woods Bagot, ARUP and Foster. The structures, in the shape of a double helix, feature a core structure capable of rotating up to 45 degrees, unique never-before-seen design principles applied to both the interior and exterior of the buildings and walls that can be raised as needed in the same manner as a curtain. The project is another milestone following Shanghai Shimao Co., Ltd.'s five-star hotel expressly placed in the center of a deep stone pit and which further demonstrates China's growing strength on the global stage.Shimao Qianhai Center, a 300-meter-high skyscraper building, with mountains as a backdrop on one side and the sea on the other, assures its occupants of 10,000 meter-long unblocked vistas including views of Hong Kong and Shenzhen. It is the sole building in Shenzhen currently selling high-rise office space, with 15 rare roof-top office units on offer.View original content with multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/shimao-qianhai-center-debuts-on-the-large-billboard-overlooking-new-yorks-times-square-300504431.htmlSOURCE Qianhai Shimao Development (Shenzhen) Co.

"I should have left them in jail!"Twitter was quick to react to the news, with both Ball and Trump known for their over-the-top, blustering personalities.Tweet Embed:https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/932312412623134720?ref_src=twsrc%5EtfwEveryone on Twitter waiting for Trump vs Lavar Ball and then we see Trumps tweet...            pic.twitter.com/LjXhtIVrwlSince Ball and Trump both have ties to the world of professional wrestling, with Ball appearing on "Monday Night Raw" earlier in the summer, and Trump a member of the WWE Hall of Fame, many anticipated a meeting at WrestleMania between the two men.Tweet Embed:https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/932307988370554881?ref_src=twsrc%5EtfwWhen it becomes clear you're gonna make $1 Billion off Trump v.

JPMorgan CEO claims Bitcoin is a "fraud", citing its volatilityThe Ticker: Baruch CollegeSeptember 25, 2017 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 1Length: 785 wordsBodyRecently, JPMorgan Chase's CEO Jamie Dimon criticized the popular cryptocurrency bitcoin, claiming that it is overvalued and sure to fail. Dimon even said that he would fire any training employee of his company that considered partaking in the bitcoin market for being "stupid."Bitcoin launched in 2009 as a means of paying for items online without having to use a bank or other financial institution that takes a cut from online spending. In recent months, bitcoin's use and value has boomed, increasing almost 315 percent this year. This is in large part due to the blockchain technology that underlies the currency.This technology is critical to bitcoin because it is thought to have the potential to reshape the global financial system, as well as other industries. Blockchain can be used to move money abroad, sign contracts, clear complex financial transactions and make micropayments in emerging countries. It is predicted that bitcoin will eventually become a universal currency, linking the economies of the world.Supporters hope that the currency will become a common medium of exchange, a store of wealth and a vehicle for legitimate speculation and hedging. Many, like Dimon, are suspicious of the bitcoin currency for numerous reasons.Firstly, there is the potential of high price volatility. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies experience high price fluctuation regularly, creating an unstable market. Dimon said that he would not short bitcoin because it is unclear how high its price could increase, an uncertainty which could bankrupt traders. Besides this, bitcoin is highly unstable compared to fiat currency, and it is possible that the cryptocurrency is in a bubble, which means it could be overvalued.Dimon believes that the currency cannot exist without state oversight and that governments will soon intervene. This sentiment was confirmed by the Chinese government's recent ban on bitcoin in China. Critics like Dimon think that bitcoin is vulnerable to manipulation and that the blockchain technology is simply a more elaborate database.Dimon compared the current cryptocurrency craze to the 17th century Dutch Tulip craze, in which the public used tulip bulbs as currency. After a short amount of time, the value of the bulbs increased so much that the tulip market crashed, and the bulbs became worthless. Although bitcoin is trying to serve the same purpose as the aforementioned tulip bulbs did, the difference between them is that bitcoin is monetized. This means that the value of the currency is greater than its current use value in transactions.To get to the point that bitcoin enthusiasts envision as the future of cryptocurrencies, a steady and dedicated user base is necessary, which requires time and widespread adoption. It will also take time for authorial institutions to better understand cryptocurrencies and decide how to regulate them. Many investors believe that cryptocurrencies have no longevity, and will disappear before they become a major regulated currency. So far, bitcoin is yet to be adopted by any government.Besides the lack of regulation and the instability, Dimon is worried about the potential criminal application of cryptocurrencies. He has stated that bitcoin and its ilk are particularly beneficial to people who are trying to keep their financial transactions secret, such as drug dealers and murderers. Likewise, financial institutions are also concerned about bitcoin's early associations with money laundering and crime. Bitcoin initially slipped after Dimon's remarks, going down as much as 8 percent before recovering.Critics of Dimon say he is disparaging cryptocurrencies by suggesting that they pose a threat to JPMorgan Chase and other banks. As cryptocurrencies become more popular, central banks are increasing their involvement with them and their underlying blockchain technology. According to the Bank for International Settlements, one option for central banks is for them to be the only issuers of cryptocurrencies to the public.However, this might increase the risk of bank runs, or lead to commercial lenders facing a shortage of deposits. Unlike Dimon, some of the most well-known figures on Wall Street are embracing the cryptocurrency. Fundstrat's Tom Lee sees bitcoin surging to $6 billion next year, and value investor Bill Miller owns bitcoin. JPMorgan Chase is attempting to use blockchain to reduce trading costs.• About• Latest PostsEstelle SaadLatest posts by Estelle Saad (see all)• JPMorgan CEO claims Bitcoin is a "fraud", citing its volatility - September 25, 2017• The Great Comet closes on Sept. 3 following major casting controversy - September 18, 2017• Dancing reverses anti-aging effects in elderly - September 11, 2017Load-Date: September 25, 2017End of Document

Which market will be affected more? Will this lead to a raw material shortage?     (Logo:http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/536199/CRU_Logo.jpg)With winter curtailments upon us, many questions remain regarding the availability of petroleum coke and carbon anodes. Despite the uncertainty, one thing remains obvious; the Chinese government is taking action to clear up one thing, the sky. The winter season in China is a time when pollution becomes a large concern as coal-fired power plants run harder to provide additional power for heating. Add this to the base line pollution from the industrial sector and you have a situation that requires action.Roughly 2 million tons of primary aluminum capacity will be impacted by the winter cuts, translating to nearly 840,000 tons of production cuts in Q4 2017 and Q1 2018 combined. But the impacts will not end here as the winter policy will also require capacity cuts in the raw material sector, most notably for producers of carbon anodes and petroleum coke. But which market will be affected more? Will this lead to a raw material shortage? This insight focuses on the potential impacts of the winter curtailment policy on the carbon anode and petroleum coke markets in China.Read the full story:http://bit.ly/Winter-policy-warm-anode-and-coke-pricesRead more about CRU:http://bit.ly/About_CRUAbout CRU CRU offers unrivalled business intelligence on the global metals, mining and fertilizer industries through market analysis, price assessments, consultancy and events.Since our foundation in 1969, we have consistently invested in primary research and robust methodologies, and developed expert teams in key locations worldwide, including in hard-to-reach markets such as China.

The annual Forum took place in Dakar this year, where it was hosted by the Government of Senegal, Chinese Ministry of Finance, China Development Bank, and the World Bank Group."We couldn't have found a better topic for a continent aspiring for emergence. On the path to emergence, we must give ourselves the means to positively and sustainably transform our production system. This will inevitably require innovation, and a new mindset that translates into a real willingness to break with established ideas, practices, and habits. It can no longer be 'business as usual', as our Anglophone friends say," said Macky Sall, President of Senegal.The IAF is an annual platform aimed at increasing China's investments in Africa, and other multilateral cooperation. This year it focused on a new generation of investment opportunities driven by innovation and the adoption of technologies critical for unlocking Africa's potential for accelerated, inclusive economic growth."The Investing in Africa Forum is an important multilateral platform to strengthen cooperation and spark innovation across the African continent," said Shaolin Yang, Managing Director and Chief Administrative Officer of the World Bank Group . "African leaders recognize the power of embracing new and disruptive technologies. We look forward to working on ways that move words to action by further leveraging finance, global knowledge, and partnerships through supporting dialogues among governments, investors, and civil society. Through the Forum we are igniting change for long-term sustainable impact across the developing world."Several Memorandums of Understanding were signed at the Forum, covering projects in energy, agriculture, and education."We have committed to mutually beneficial, win-win cooperation to promote the sharing of development experience, investments and trade," said Yaobin Shi, Vice Minister of Finance of the People's Republic of China. "I hope that, through this Forum, China and African countries will coordinate development strategies and find new opportunities for cooperation. We must learn from each other, explore new development paths, integrate our competitive advantages and resources, and develop new financing models to help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030."The Forum also saw the debut of the Investing in Africa Think Tank Alliance, a global platform for knowledge sharing and partnerships in Africa, China, and elsewhere.The International Finance Corporation (IFC) is already working with investments from China to finance development projects through the Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Program. This program has financed to date 57 projects across 27 countries, and has notably invested $465 million in Sub-Saharan African countries (Ghana, Kenya, Guinea, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Gabon, Chad and the Democratic Republic of the Congo)."The digital economy has high potential to unleash economic growth, jobs, and social inclusion," said Nena Stoiljkovic, IFC Vice President for Blended Finance and Partnerships . "The digitization of economies requires the right regulatory framework, significant private sector investment in broadband infrastructure, and financing and advisory solutions to unlock investments perceived as higher risk."More than 400 participants attended the Forum, which was also well-attended by Chinese and African companies seeking to expand partnerships for new investments.Established in 2015 through a China Development Bank initiative, the first two Forums were held in Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) and in Guangzhou (China). During these Forums, participants advocated stronger partnerships to address the acceleration of manufacturing and industrialization, expanding agriculture and agribusiness, and improving infrastructure, regional connectivity and logistics for trade.The next Investing in Africa Forum (IAF 2018) will be held in Hunan, China.PRESS RELEASE NO: 2018/014/AFRContactsDakarMademba Ndiaye221-33-859-4140mademba@worldbank.orgBeijingLi Li+86 10 58617850Lli2@worldbank.orgWashingtonEkaterina Svirina+1-202-458-1042esvirina@worldbank.orgLoad-Date: September 27, 2017End of Document

Fire In New York City Apartment Block Kills 12 Including Four Children; Apple Now Facing At Least 8 Class-Action Lawsuits Over Slowing Down Older iPhones; Trump Targets Amazon In Call For Postal Service To Hike PricesMORNINGS WITH MARIA MORNINGS WITH MARIA 8:00 AM ESTDecember 29, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; FinancialLength: 8015 wordsByline: Cheryl Casone, Lauren Simonetti, Blake Burman; Gerri Willis, Jared MaxGuests: Amy Holmes, Jack Brewer, Michael Block, Mark Lotter, Mark Penn, Tiffany Sizemore, Mark EversonBodyCHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST: -- for a holiday, the Nikkei down a fraction. Well, here in New York a tragedy to tell you about this morning, on a freezing night flames ripped through an apartment building, killing at least 12 people, including four children.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL DE BLASIO, MAYOR, NEW YORK CITY: Here in the Bronx, there are families have been torn apart, this is the worst fire tragedy we have seen in this city in at least a quarter of a century.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: We're going to have the latest from the investigation into the city's deadliest fire in decades. Well, some cold hard cash for SoftBank coming in. Uber reportedly selling a major stake to the investor group. Valuing the ride-sharing giant of $48-billion. Why the deal is a win for both sides. Plus, rotten at the core, Apple apologizing for its slowdown scandal over older iPhone batteries. How the tech titan is promising to make it customers. And from the Super Bowl stunner to the Mayweather- McGregor slugfest. It was an unforgettable year in sports. We're going to have our favorite moments from 2017 to share with you. That's coming up. And here to break it all down, I've got Rasmussen Reports political analyst Amy Holmes with me, Rhino Trading Patterns chief strategist Michael Block, along with the Brewer Group CEO and former NFL star, Jack Brewer. Great show so far you guys. Thanks for being here.AMY HOLMES, POLITICAL ANALYST, RASMUSSEN REPORTS: Oh, thank you.JACK BREWER, CEO, BREWER GROUP: A lot of fun. Thank you.CASONE: We're following and talking a little sports.BREWER: I know.CASONE: Jack, get ready. Get ready. Under the hour we're going to be throwing out some ideas. So --BREWER: Pressure is on.CASONE: The pressure is on. And maybe a little football. Of course we will. But first on the last business day of the year, we're going to look back on the first year under President Trump. The President himself reflecting on his accomplishments in 2017 earlier this week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: WREN: have more legislation passed including (INAUDIBLE) long time ago and we broke that record. So we have a lot -- we have more the all-time records for stopping ridiculous regulations and we're very proud of that record. That's o ne of the reasons to stock market is coming, you know, at a record level. So record level. We broke it 84 times this year. The stock market had a new high, 84 times since we won the election in November 8th of last year.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: You know, as he's making these comments, the President's job approval rating in the latest (INAUDIBLE) daily tracking poll hit the high of 46 percent. The number nearly parallels out of the President Obama at the same time during his first year in office. Joining us now, former special assistant to President Trump and former press secretary to Vice President Pence, Mark Lotter. Along with, we got former --MARK LOTTER, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY TO VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Good morning.CASONE: Good morning. We've also got chief strategist for Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign and chief strategist to President Clinton's '96 reelection campaign, Mark Penn, he is the author most recently of Microtrends Squared. Guys, it's great to see you both. Happy New Year.MARK PENN, AUTHOR, MICROTRENDS SQUARED: Happy New Year to you.MARK LOTTER, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY, VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Good morning.CASONE: Mark, I'm going to start with you, I'm going to start with your take on 2017 under the president. What are your highlights?PENN: Well, I think under the president --(CROSSTALK)CASONE: Oh, Mark that was for you. Sorry.PENN: I think under the president, clearly, he had no honeymoon, so he sunk right to kind of negative approval ratings. He stayed there until now, if you look in contrast to Obama, Obama had an extensive honeymoon but deteriorated all the way down to the midterm elections. The real question here is has Trump hit the bottom? And will tax reform begin to bring him back? Some of these polls just taken in the last few days show a little bit improvement or are we going to see there a continued march down as Mueller comes back with his investigative report and the president continues to use twitter.CASONE: Well, and he has -- again, you know, there's a lot of questions now about what the DOJ and the FBI actually -- what they have in their hands are not willing to turn that over. Devin Nunes is actually on that same way. Mark Lotter, I want to ask you about this, I mean, if you look to the achievements of President Trump in 2017, one of the thing he doesn't seem to getting a lot of credit for is his rollback of regulation , that's been a market positive, it's been an economic positive. Do you think that the -- that the messaging is loss in the White House? Or that Americans aren't getting the message that the economy really has improved and the market?LOTTER: I think it's one of the things that are people are just starting to realize and they will realize it even more as their paychecks go up in February due to tax cut plan. So you're starting to see that economic momentum, people are feeling it, we've seen it in some of the indicators like consumer confidence, business confidence, even in the stock market which will open again today at another record. So, I think as those things continue, the president is going to continue to get credit for it. But a lot of the rollbacks of regulations and things, those are -- those are big incorporate boardrooms and it just takes a while for it to filter through the economy and to where the American people are starting to really see the growth that's happening under President Trump.HOLMES: Mark Penn, any home fear from Rasmussen Reports? And I want to ask you about the Democrats' strategy it appears to be in terms of resist, resist, resist the President's agenda. We didn't see a single Democrat vote for tax reform. Even though in the past tax reform including corporate tax reform has been a bipartisan issue. Do you think this is a smart strategy for Democrats going into 2018 or that voters are going to look and say, hey, what are actually getting done?PENN: Well, I think the Democrats had a o lot of success on health care. I think they managed to convince the public and even I think the policy community that in fact the Republicans didn't have a good plan on health care and they -- in effect tried the same strategy on the tax cut bill. I think that it's an open question right now. This is really a big gamble that the Republicans have taken, if the economy continues to grow at a three to four percent rate, I think that will pay off for the Republicans, if it sinks back to two percent then it's going to appear like giveaways. Personally I think you're correct in the past, Democrats in Republican states would have I think gone along with tax plan. In this case they didn't -- there was a big risk I think for the Democrats as well in an attempt to repeal what did work on health care. I think it's an open question.BREWER: Mark Lotter, I have a question, this is Jack Brewer. The president has taken so much heat over the course of the last year when it comes to issues surrounding race, surrounding religion and those things, leading up into 2018, you know, someone like myself, you know, I'm so excited about this tax plan but that messages lost for a lot of people on the other side just because it can't get past those social issues and some of the of the things that they're upset about. In 2018, when we see president, who will step out and be just a little bit more cautious on his approach and his responses on these issues.LOTTER: I think you're going to continue to hear the president speak with his voice but what I -- but what I would expect is also that you're going to see the president going into places where maybe Republican traditionally don't go and where he can communicate directly to communities who are now starting to experience the benefits of the tax cut plan as you pointed out or in some of the other areas like in his new initiative to improve infrastructure, there are so many things that we can do help rebuild in inner cities in America and that's something that the president is going to be very focused on, and he is going to take that message directly to people. And then in a way also challenge Democrats to see are you willing to work with us on any issue, including an issue that Democrats have traditionally been very supportive of which is investing in our infrastructure.CASONE: Where infrastructure is the one thing you think, I agree with you, Mark Lotter, that we should see some agreement bipartisanship on but this is the swamp, you never know, I do -- Mark Lotter, I want to stay with you though on the -- on the mid-terms because especially with the Senate and what happened in Alabama, they certified Democrat Doug Jones yesterday over that special election. You know, Moore refused to concede, he wanted a special election, he was throwing out voter fraud accusations, Mark Lotter, and the -- but President trump endorsed him and I'm wondering if it -- if that was bad move for the party and maybe a worrisome move for the party going into the mid-terms in 2018.LOTTER: Well, as the president said in an interview yesterday he felt, you know, first, he endorsed Senator Strange who was -- who was running against Judge Moore in the primary and ended up losing and then after that, it became an issue of supporting the party's nominee and making sure in a very closely divided Senate that we had a another in the Senate who was going to vote for things like tax reform and infrastructure but the people of Alabama spoke, that's what we were encouraging them to do. And the new Senator will be seated here in a matter of week or so and then it will be an opportunity to see is this new Senator from, you know, Senator Jones from Alabama going to vote with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and against things like tax cuts infrastructure, immigration or is he going to vote with people of Alabama.CASONE: OK.LOTTER: And that I think is going to -- is going to really kind of foreshadowed the race that we're -- that we're facing in 2018 where you have 10 Senate Democrats who are coming from states that the president won, five of those states overwhelmingly, and many of those Senate Democrats are going to find themselves in a hard place trying to explain to their voters why they stood against the tax cut plan.CASONE: Yes. You know, it's funny though because I got to bring this up, there was a really funny side to all of this. Alabama released the names of the more than 22,000 write-in votes, 22,000 for that special election. I'm going to see -- I want -- I want to show you guys this. There was (INAUDIBLE) to let's vote for Kermit The Frog, Elen DeGeneres was put on the list god, Harambe, the ape, Chris Jenner. Mark Penn, your reaction to -- yes, Jones won but people were voting for Chris Jenner.PENN: Well, look, it's interesting that there were 22,000 write-in votes with the gap between the two candidates was about 22,000. And in fact, Senator Shelby and many editorials in the state called on Republican voters to put in write-in candidates and that's exactly s what they did and you can say not only did the Democrats reject Moore but so essentially did Republicans. So I think everybody welcomes the additional Democrat into Senate and that Trump made a mistake zigzagging back-and-forth.CASONE: Uh-hmm. Well, he is tweeting right now, got to let you both go. We do have that breaking news, Mark Lotter, Mark Penn, gentlemen thank you very much. We just got a tweet in from the President just now, this is what he says, why is the United States post office which is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their package is making Amazon richer the post office dumber and poorer, should be charging much more. Michael Block, what do you think?MICHAEL BLOCK, CHIEF STRATEGIST, RHINO TRADING PATTERNS: I'm glad I'm not the postmaster general right now.CASONE: Yes.HOLMES: Wooh.BLOCK: This is interesting, so we're large a lot about global warming's benefits, we're learning about the post office here. Hey, good point, you know, maybe the post office should be privatized. Now what the president is trying to say, Donald, is that what you're saying? I love more.CASONE: Yes. Well, I mean, let's look at Amazon right now in the premarket. I mean, it's not affecting the stock really on a fraction but, you know, his point is, is that the post office needs to change its game.HOLMES: And let's remember the post office is subsidized by the American taxpayer here.CASONE: Taxpayers.(CROSSTALK)HOLMES: -- you know by a substation subsidizing Amazon.CASONE: Yes. This is why UPS --(CROSSTALK)BREWER: Yes. Raise prices on them. Why not. Amazon --(CROSSTALK)BREWER: Amazon doesn't worry about losing money though.CASONE: Yes. Well, the post office also has union problems, that's something that kind of hurts them. Well, we've got a lot more coming up. SoftBank taking a major stake in Uber. How the deal could shake up the transportation industry. That's coming up next. And Apple saying sorry. A rare apology from the tech giant after performance issues with older models. That's coming up.CASONE: New York City hit by deadliest residential fire in decades. Lauren Simonetti has got the details on this. Lauren, good morning.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Officials say the fire spread through every floor of the five-storey apartment building in the Bronx but in a matter of minutes last night killing 12 people including four children as young as one. The New York City deadliest fire and at least a quarter of a century. Four other people in critical condition, they are fighting for their lives. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says first responders were able to save at least 12 lives but we've seen images little girls out in their nightgowns in the cold. Investigators now trying to find out what caused this fire.Well, Japan's SoftBank winning a big to buy stake in Uber for nearly $8 billion. The deal valuing Uber at $48 billion which is about a 30 percent discount to the previous evaluation of near $70 billion. The deal also good news for Uber's new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, he is taking over for ousted CEO and founder Travis Kalanick.Too little too late, following at least eight class-action lawsuits and backlash from iPhone users. Apple apologizing for older iPhones performing more slowly. The company said that it would not intentionally shorten the life of any product or degrade the experience to encourage customers to buying new iPhone. Apple also said it is taking 50 bucks off the out of the warranty iPhone battery replacement for next year. That brings the cost down to $29.00 for anyone with an iPhone 6 and that starts in late January. Then a software update will be available in the New Year too and that should help extend the battery life. Take a look at Apple shares in the premarket trading, they're not moving too much but you can see that this is a stock that's trading $171. Cheryl?CASONE: Finally an upgrade that Amy Holmes is going to actually do. I like that.HOLMES: So the battery last longer?CASONE: Yes. She was like, I'm not taking those updates anymore.(CROSSTALK)CASONE: I'm (INAUDIBLE) right? I mean, there you go.HOLMES: I guess so. I don't know.CASONE: The stock is on fire but what do you make of them -- I mean, they really -- this is rare for them to say sorry for anything.BLOCK: I actually applaud this move. I think they're coming clean, it's not going to stop further allegations of this nature from happening including (INAUDIBLE) here. I will say, Apple is actually been a little bit of pressure or recent week or so, there is some bad checks coming out from some of their Asian suppliers. I think some of that is very sensationalist. I never trust those checks, it usually end up being a -- like a very rope-a-dope situation, that is where you want to start buying the stock. I actually am very bullish on the large cap texting next year point out and I appreciate that Apple is cleaning the slate coming out. I think people once they get done muttering about this, are going to like this move.CASONE: I think what got me on this is that we're talking about the iPhone 6, 6s, but some of it was the iPhone 7s, Jack.BREWER: Yes.CASONE: These are not that old of a phone. If you pay $1000 for a phone, I mean, I don't --(CROSSTALK)HOLMES: Well, you don't expect the company sabotaged it as you're using it.BREWER: No question and it's unfortunate because this -- these phones are so new and you're talking about within a six to 12-month period they already have a new phone coming out. So do I agree with you though, for them to come out and say now you at least expect to know what you're getting into.CASONE: Yes. I'm glad that it -- that's being addressed. I need to get to some breaking news right now. We just got another tweet from President Trump. Here's what he just tweeted a few seconds ago, the Democrats have been told and fully understand that there can be no DACA without the desperately need wall at the southern border and an end to the horrible chain migration and ridiculous lottery system with immigration et cetera. We must protect our country at all costs. We know, Amy, that immigration is going to be right there with infrastructure in the New Year on the agenda for the president.HOLMES: Well, absolutely and it's one of the top issues that put President Trump in the White House with his position on immigration. From my point of view an also fro polling border security should be bipartisan issue, it shouldn't have, you know, this back and forth. But the question of course for Democrats will be, do they want to hold DREAMers hostage while they're having their resistance to Trump agenda?CASONE: Even President Trump though, that six months that they gave them and that expires I (INAUDIBLE) at least they all agree, you don't want to unfairly punish these kids, now young adults that had been in their whole life and don't know the country that they came from.HOLMES: Well, you know, Americans want to have compassion for that but remember, deferred action, it's right there in the title of the act that it was supposed to be decided by Congress, how this will be resolved. Now, it shouldn't be by executive order.CASONE: You need to figure that out after the New Year. Well, we've got more coming up. The future of Republican tax reform. How this all going to shake out. There are new concerns that this could stretch the IRS too thin. We're going to discuss that. And the bold truth. What a man's hairline can reveal about his health. Stand by for that.CASONE: Here's a question for you. Can your hairline determine your health? There is a study that shows that male pattern baldness maybe a better indicator of heart disease and obesity. Let's bring in Dr. Tiffany Sizemore, she's a board-certified cardiologist. We've already been talking about this on set before we even saw you, Dr. Sizemore. It's great to see you. Good morning.TIFFANY SIZEMORE, CARDIOLOGIST: You too. Thanks.CASONE: What do you make of that?SIZEMORE: This is a study actually done in India, quite recently, that looked at about 2,000 young Indian men and they looked to at group of men that were young under the age of 40 that had known coronary heart disease, that's what causes heart attacks and men who did not and they looked at, you know, the differences in these men and what they realize is those young men that had early onset coronary disease under the age 40 actually had premature balding, male-pattern baldness and gray hair. And so now we're starting to make the correlation, maybe this is showing early biologic aging on the outside which can reflect biologic aging on the inside. And I was speaking with my girlfriend last night and I said, you know, maybe subconsciously the cardiologist -- this is why I always like guys with good hair.CASONE: They're just -- they're just healthier. Jack, look at (INAUDIBLE) question for you. Mr. Athlete's health is not over here. He's got a question.BREWER: Well, thank God I have a pretty good hairline, I'll keep that. But now, what can -- what can be done to help offset this is? Is this an issue where you think, you know, diet and exercise like you've heard, you know, my entire life. Are there other things that you can do in order to take on these issues?SIZEMORE: You know, this is a conversation I have to have with my patients every day because we have -- when doctors talk to their patients, we talked to them about -- what we call modifiable risk factors and non-modifiable risk factors. So you can't control the fact that your hair started falling out early and you can't control the fact that it's graying early. You also can't control that your mom or your dad might have had heart disease, what you can control to some extent, cholesterol, blood pressure, making sure you're getting up and moving every day, you're active, you're definitely not smoking, you're not drinking to any excess. So, at the end of the day, if you have things that you cannot control but that are a risk to you for instance your dad having a heart attack at 40 years old, you need to be even more cognizant of controlling those modifiable risk factors.BLOCK: Hey, Dr. Sizemore, Mike Block here.SIZEMORE: Hey, Mike.BLOCK: You know, what, you know, what about, you know, environmental factors, you know, where people live, occupation, how much of that is really a part of this?CASONE: Uh-hmm. I'm stress too.BLOCK: Stress.SIZEMORE: Yes. To some extent. So, when we talk about occupation, there's actually another study that just came out that -- about people who sit too long, big study that shows that people who sit more than 10 hours per day have a significantly increased risk of heart disease. So, when we -- when we talk about occupation, really for heart disease, obviously if you're in a occupation where they're smoking around you, that's a big risk factor. But other than that, it's those jobs that you're just kind of sitting all day long which becomes a big risk factor for heart disease.CASONE: Yes. That's interesting. Amy is here too.HOLMES: Doctor, Amy Holmes here. We've been talking about men and heart health and heart attacks and hairlines and so forth. But what about the women? I mean, you know, heart disease is a big issue for women. Are there these outer, you know, signifiers that can tell you about your heart health?SIZEMORE: I mean, like I said, this study was really in men. You know, do -- could it -- could it be translated into women as well? Those women who tend to age earlier on your outward appearance, sure, there's been no real studies with that yet, that have been a large study but I mean, I think it would probably be able to translated to both for sure. And I do want to touch in your point and I -- and I thank you for bringing it up because it happened yesterday in my office. You know, heart disease is the number killer of women and women are starting to die more of heart disease than men because we're not treating them the way we should be treating them. So I want to thank you for bringing it up. I was telling my women if you're not getting the answer you want by one doctor, go to another one.CASONE: So that -- well, I'm sorry to hear that that happened in your -- one of your patients yesterday. You know, and speaking of women and health, I mean, also stress, there was a study earlier out in the week that I found fascinating that said that stress and particular for women's heart could be just as have an ill effect as, you know, bad eating, and obesity and diabetes and things like that. Is that true?SIZEMORE: Yes. Yes, so, you know, and I'm sure you probably know women tend to hold in their stress and that can, you know, increase catecholamines, can increase bad enzymes and hormones in the body that Increases blood pressure that leads to heart disease, that leads to stroke. So, you know, unequivocally women tend to kind of hold in their stress more which can definitely have ill effects on their cardiovascular health.CASONE: Wow. It's fascinating to have you on especially, you know, it's holidays, it's been stressful, you know, especially when were talking about the -- usually like the mom and the wife that's kind of trying to keep everything together. So, it's a good -- it's a good way to end this segment with you. Tiffany, thank you very much.SIZEMORE: Thanks, guys. Have a great New Year.CASONE: Yes. Happy New Year, Dr. Tiffany Sizemore. Well, coming up. The impact of the Republican tax plan, the latest as homeowners race to pay their property taxes before the New Year. Is it worth it? Plus, thanks for the memories. Snapchat's new feature for looking back on 2017. We're going to show it to you.CASONE: Welcome back. I'm Cheryl Casone, in for Maria Bartiromo this morning. It's Friday, December 29th. Your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. The tax man coming early this year. Homeowners across the country are racing to beat the property tax deadline before the law limiting state and local deductions goes into effect on January 1st. Why this last-minute effort might not pay off for some.Meanwhile, despite pushback from blue states, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy says the bill did have Democratic support.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: As we walk through on the tax plan, I had a number of Democrats individually come up to me tell me they liked the plan, they're going to vote for it. In the last days they came to me and said that they were getting whipped from their own leadership that would not allow them to vote for the bill. We need to be able to break this logjam to be able to work together fine common ground.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: And beleaguered by the bill, how the tax code overall could spell trouble for the IRS this filing season. Goldman Sachs also taking a hit from the bill. The company says the legislation is going to slash its fourth quarter earnings by $5 billion. Details on the big blow for the banking giant.And looking at your markets, it is the final trading day of 2017. Right now the Dow is higher by 74 points, S&P, NASDAQ pointing higher as well. Over in Europe, one market holding on to a little bit of green, the FTSE 100 up by 64. Turning to Asia, markets closed mixed over there. The KOSPI closed for a holiday.Well, President Trump is accusing the U.S. Postal Service of mailing it in, he tweeted in last hour, he is suggesting that the USPS charges more at the expense of Amazon. We're going to look at how the news is hitting the tech titan shares this morning. And millions of football fans across America turned in for the Patriots epic Super Bowl comeback then they tuned out over the national anthem protest. We're going to have our favorite and least favorite moments from the year in sports.And a police chase in Oregon sending a suspect over the edge, there he goes. Literally. Yes. What happened after he drove off that pier and he tried to escape, we're going to have that story and more of that video.Well, it is the last business day of the year. Homeowners are rushing to prepay their property taxes for 2018 but is this year-end's tax scramble even worth it? Blake Burman has been covering the story all week, he's live at the White House with the latest this morning. Good morning, Blake.BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hey there, Cheryl. Good morning to you as well. The IRS has stepped in and said you can make these 2018 property tax prepayments if you do it before the calendar turns in a few days. Here and also if at some point within recently if you've been given that 2018 property tax bill. That last point is what is led to a lot of questions about whether or not these prepayments can be tax deductible in 2017 and the tax foundation says this is yet to become a settled issue.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NICOLE KAEDING, TAX FOUNDATION ECONOMIST: I do think this is going to be an open legal question and I would expect to see some litigation on this subject. Unfortunately that means though for taxpayers that want certainty by the end of the 2017 tax year, we're not going to be able to provide that for them.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: Now the prepayment rush is coming from taxpayers who will likely be impacted by the new $10,000 cap on state and local income taxes and property taxes in. In a revealing interview yesterday with the New York Times, President Trump suggested that have the tax bill been bipartisan, the SALT scenario would have been different, he said and I quote, "Had they come to me for a bipartisan tax bill, I would have gone to Mitch," meaning Mitch McConnell, and I would have gone to other Republicans and we could have worked something out bipartisan and that could have either been a change to SALT or knock-out of SALT. He didn't directly say it there, Cheryl, but the implication from the president seems to be that if the Democratic delegation in New York specifically Chuck Schumer had come to the table then this $10,000 cap might have played out a whole lot differently. As you know though, Cheryl, not a single Democrat voted for this tax bill, they say this is just to give away to the wealthy corporations.CASONE: You still had yet Peter King here in New York saying he couldn't do it.BURMAN: Right.CASONE: I mean -- I guess, I said that now Schumer does anyway. Blake Burman live at the White House. Thank you very much. Interesting stuff. Let's bring in former IRS commissioner and vice chairman of Alliant Group, Mark Everson. Mark, what do you make of all these homeowners that are scrambling to try and prepay the property taxes and that last-minute notice by the IRS that it may not even be valid?MARK EVERSON, VICE CHAIRMAN, ALLIANT GROUP: Well, thanks for having me, Cheryl. Taxes assess, what the IRS is saying is if you have if you have a tax that has been assessed, I live in Mississippi, I got a postcard that says, what my property taxes are, I get the postcard at the beginning of the December, it's not due until February. Every year I pay it in December to get that benefit. That's fine is what the IRS is saying but if normally they don't bill you until January or next February, they're saying that is a no-go, that's what's being said here.BLOCK: Hey, Mark, Mike Block here. So, the tax bill is passed, it's done, now we're -- now it is lot of scrambling to figure out what's what like this property taxes that we're talking about. If this bill could have been made better, they could have spent more time on it, made it better. What is it missing? What else would you include as a former IRS commissioner guy who knows taxes?EVERSON: Oh, I think that remains to be seen, Michael. This is comprehensive reform, there's no doubt about it. Lots of changes and there is so much in here, I would tell you that we're going to have to wait and see and remember, there is going to be interaction, some of the states talking about changing their codes and we're already seeing some of the countries oversee, so making changes. So, I think what we have to do here is buckle up, understand it's going to be a very iterative process here. And my hope is unlike the Affordable Care Act which we all remember, same thing went through, just one party going for it and then what happened was there were never any changes made here. That is not the playbook, we have to follow here, we have to see how it affects the economy and we have to make changes both technical in nature and also substantive as time unfolds.HOLMES: Amy Holmes here. I want to ask you what do you make of Governor Cuomo saying that he might sue over disparate impacts by the tax reform on blue states where they no longer -- the citizens will no longer be able to take those deductions from state and local tax. Do you think that there this is a court case to be made here?EVFERSON: Amy, I'd be very surprised. I mean, look, the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act because of its tax clause. I think there's wide deference to the Congress here.CASONE: You mentioned a moment ago about overseas, you know, countries overseas changing things, there is news that China is offering new tax incentives to foreign investors, big American companies. So they basically say this will temporarily exempt foreign companies from paying tax on earnings but you have to reinvest in industries that specified by the Chinese government but don't you think that other countries are going to start to kind of react to the U.S. tax law trying to keep American money overseas if they can?EVERSON: Absolutely. There is no question about that. We are not a sole actor in the system because of all the global corporations and the companies are all taking a look at what they want to do right now and governments around the world are going to look as well.CASONE: Let me ask you about the IRS since you were the commissioner, I mean, there's a lot of concern that the IRS -- I mean, look, they've had a shrinking budget, next year, the agency is getting 11 billion in funding but you say the IRS, they don't have enough resources and that they're not going to be able to help taxpayers in this overhaul, they just don't have a staff basically, is that so?EVERSON: Well, a couple points I'd make here. First good, the good news is that unlike the usual practice where their extenders put in at the minute, this law takes effect next year. So the IRS has time to adjust and the upcoming filing season shouldn't be affected, so everybody should calm down, relax, file your taxes as you normally would. Come January, February, March. That's one point. But the IRS has a lot to do, there -- the standards particularly on the international take effect immediately. And you're going to have to have a lot of regulations drawn, you need the call centers just because people aren't affected until next year, they're going to start calling, asking the IRS questions so they have to staff up for that.CASONE: Calling this week, Mark. I mean, they're lining up at county offices, county officials can't even handle the crowds they're getting.(CROSSTALK)EVERSON: Exactly. So the -- so, yes, of course, the IRS needs some additional resources here. That's on top of their day job, they've got challenges with the identity theft, the international, and the Affordable Care Act just because the mandate has been relieved, there is still a lot of exchange of information takes place. So, yes, they have a -- they have a lot to do. And a lot to do.CASONE: Mark, you need to come back so we can talk about what -- how states are going to handle this and maybe this changes finally the dynamic at the state level about how taxation is handled in the -- in the blue states anyway. Mark Everson, thank you for your perspective.EVERSON: Thank you.CASONE: I bet you don't miss the IRS right now. You laughed. Mark, thank you very much. He's like, I'm out of there. All right. So, he's going to be crazy. Coming up. President Trump accuses the U.S. Postal Service of mailing it in. He tweeted earlier suggesting that U.S. PS charges more of the expense of Amazon. The potential impact on Amazon is coming up next plus a police from Oregon sending a suspect literally -- wait for it -- over the edge. This video is great. OK. Stand by. We will finish the video after a quick break anyway he drove off the pier, he tried to escape. We will return in a moment.CASONE: Goldman Sachs expecting a big hit from tax reform in the fourth quarter. Gerri Willis on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with details, Gerri. Hey, good morning.GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey, good morning too. Good to see you. All right. So tax reform is going to cause Goldman Sachs $5 billion have to hit to their fourth quarter earnings is mainly due to repatriation taxes and that's two-thirds of their cost of this $5 billion lot. We don't know how they're going to use that money? It could be bad news for Goldman Sachs, good news for us. Interesting story today, more interesting story today is Amazon down about a half of percent this morning on Donald Trump's tweet essentially he says, why is the United States Post Office which is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging Amazon another so little to deliver packages making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer, and guess what, he is right.Citigroup estimate, this is a study they conducted that for every package the USPS delivers for Amazon they lose a $1.46. $1.46. They deliver two- thirds of all of Amazon packages are delivered by the U.S. Postal Services and it's part of Amazon's entire business model. They've opened all these warehouses that are near depots for the USPS so they can get that last smile, that last smile of delivery into individual homes paid for by the USPS. You can think of it this way Cheryl, it's as if every package you got from Amazon have a little dollars, $2.00, you know, stapled onto the front of it because that's the amount of money that the postal service is losing. Remember that first class mail subsidizes the USPS but I have to tell you that's down 40 percent from Pixar making up a difference with parcels but they just can't pay for it, Cheryl.CASONE: Gerri Willis, fascinating story. We also got some other headlines we're following for you this morning. The number of police officers killed in line of duty dropping sharply this year. Lauren Simonetti has got that story for us. Lauren?SIMONETTI: Hey, Cheryl, 128 officers have died in the line of duty this year. That's down 10 percent from last year. This year's toll is actually the second lowest in more than 50 years. Believe it or not, traffic accidents causing the largest number of deaths in 2017, killing 47 officers, 44 officers fatally shot.Well, the Trump administration rolling back offshore drilling rules that were put in place after the 2011 Deepwater Horizon disaster, the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Then the rules you were enacted during the Obama administration to prevent accidents and pollution by oil and gas drilling. Well, the Trump administration says, the move to take them away will reduce the regulatory burden on drillers and encourage more domestic oil and gas production. Environmentalist, however, warn that the changes could lead to another major offshore oil spill.It is the end of the year, and Snapchat is helping you take a look back. They're rolling out a year-end review feature. It basically allows you to see the highlights of your year in videos and photos. So, what you do is, you view them in the memory tab which is right near the button where you would snap a photo. And if you have enough pictures saved throughout the year, they create this year-end review for you. It's kind of cool. I just tried it out in the greenroom with the younger people who worked in the building, so -- I mean, what their reviews look like. I'm seeing -- look at Snapchat's parent Snap, little change in premarket trading this morning.An amazing video, a man being chased by police, driving his truck off a dock to try and get away from them. Look at that. Plunging into that frigid river in Oregon. The driver was a 27-year-old. He actually swam away, briefly, police actually rescued him, threw him a life vest, scooped him up with a rescue boat, taken to the hospital, treated for hypothermia, imagine that, before being booked for criminal trespassing. A parole violation and -- well, reckless driving, clearly.CASONE: I so love that viral video. Lauren, thank you for that. I understand that Jack Brewer has his own viral video he's willing to share. And I think we're going to play it whether he wants to see it on national television or not.(LAUGHTER)CASONE: You look great. OK. So, you -- so you dressed up with this to go to the movies like this?BREWER: Yes.(LAUGHTER)BREWER: I cannot believe you all played that on national T.V.CASONE: That's what we're here for, to embarrass you in front of thousand --HOLMES: Coolest dad.BREWER: That was my movie of the year that we shared.BLOCK: Now, where is the video of you taking your kid to see -- to see Frozen that's --BREWER: No, we won't go there.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)BREWER: That's awesome. But do you feel it's not a reaction to the (INAUDIBLE) watching the movie with us.HOLMES: So, you wore that to the movie theatre?BREWER: And it's great. 100 percent, we wear it to the movie theatre and everyone loved it.HOLMES: Absolutely.BLOCK: That's great.CASONE: Did anybody else dress up when you went to the movies, or anybody else did --BREWER: No. No. Just -- I mean, think, I'm a grown man walking through in an all out Spiderman outfit.HOLMES: So, you were able to see through your spider eyes?BREWER: Oh, yes, I got the real deal.CASONE: Oh, yes. Daddy's messing around. It was awesome. Very cool. It was a fun clip. Thanks for sharing.BREWER: Awesome.HOLMES: Fabulous.CASONE: All right. Well, coming up, we're going to talk a little sports. From the Patriots' epic Super Bowl comeback to the Mayweather-McGregor throw down. It was an unforgettable year in sports. We're going to have our favorite and least favorite moments from 2017 in the world of sports.CASONE: OK. On this final Friday before the New Year, we take a look back at some of the top sports stories of 2017. Jared Max has got a big list to choose from. Hey, Jared.JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTSCASTER: Good morning, Cheryl. Second year in a row, the biggest sports story wasn't even about sport, but we will get to that. Let's begin with something we have never seen before, August 26th in Las Vegas, 11-time, five-division boxing champ, Floyd Mayweather, Jr. got into the ring with mixed martial arts world champ, Conor McGregor, months of hype, and the fight delivered. 10th round technical knockout for Floyd Mayweather. The event generated well over $600 million in global revenue, thanks to 4.3 million buys on pay-per-view, over $55 million in ticket sales. Mayweather scored at least $100 million, some reports say double that. McGregor got, at least, 30 million, may be as high as $70 million.Third year in a row, the Golden State Warriors played the Cleveland Cavaliers for the NBA title. Unlike the previous two seasons, Golden State had one of the best basketball players in the world, Kevin Durant, when he finally won his first NBA title, was named Finals MVP. Golden State won the championship in only five games, second time in three years that Warriors fans got to celebrate a win over the Cavaliers. And while the Warriors partied with their fans in Oakland, the team now prepares soon to move to San Francisco in 2019.The City of Houston, wow, a year like never before in 2017. At February at Houston's NRG Stadium, Tom Brady led the Patriots to the greatest comeback in Super Bowl history, down 28-3, third-quarter. Pats forced overtime, beat Atlanta 34-28. Super Bowl classic. Six months later, the City of Houston was under water. Hurricane Harvey ravaged South-Eastern Texas. And while local sports teams were displaced by the storm, Texans' all-pro J. J. Watt created a fundraiser for victims. It generated over $37 million. Less than three months after Harvey, the Houston Astros won the World Series for the first time. Exaltation to the City of Houston after all it had endured. It was such a fun series to cover.It started in Los Angles, that day it was over 100 degrees for Game 1, the first World Series in 29 years for Los Angeles. Dodgers won that opener and then a classic comeback in Game 2, the Astros took it in 11 innings. And then, the series went to Houston, it was all tied 1-1, and I got to tell you, the Astros fans among the most colourful, pleasant fans I have encountered in sports. They got to see their team win two out of three games at Minute Maid Park. Game 5 lasted over five hours it was -- it was an epic, won by Houston in 10 innings. We have the little guy outside of Mandalay Park. Astros only needed one more win to take the series but they lost Game 6 as we went back to Los Angeles, and they blew out the Dodgers in Game 7.Here, we shift to the Super Bowl that was also in Houston, Eli Manning and Cheryl Casone. Look at that. Do you remember that day? And then there we were outside the stadium. And what a year, what a Super Bowl that it turned out to be. Here's to this --CASONE: He is such a nice guy. He is such a nice guy.MAX: Tom Brady is such a nice -- there's our --CASONE: No, Eli Manning is a nice guy.MAX: OK. (INAUDIBLE) You know, the Super Bowl, I though, was a bore until Gaga came on stage.CASONE: No, Lady Gaga came on, right? That was awesome.MAX: And then the fourth-quarter really picked up, it turned out to be a great game, and the celebration was just on. I mean, the confetti went wild, Brady gets to celebrate Robert Kraft, they booed Roger Goodell so loudly, I remember, at that stadium because all they went through with deflate gate. But an amazing ending as it was for the New England Patriots.CASONE: You -- and you were on the -- I know that you're on the feel for the celebration. I mean, and I -- in my opinion one of the biggest stories are obviously was the kneeling in the NFL at which we've had a lot of conversations about, has it hurt the league? But it's gotten so much attention, Jack. I know that you've been, you know, talking a lot about it. But, you know, do you think that the league can recover from this bad publicity they got this year?BREWER: I hope so. They're trying to take steps now whether it's doing a social program and they just announced, you know, donating over $100 million to programs throughout the country. And so, you know, it's time right now to try to come back, it was such a great year in sports, to have this damper in its cloud over the number one sport in America, is unfortunate. You know, hopefully, you know, we can all as Americans come back and watch this year's Super Bowl, get those ratings back up because at the end of the day, one country, one America.CASONE: In Minneapolis, a former Viking right next to me, and his --MAX: I know Vikings fan right over here.BREWER: We got -- we got a lot of (INAUDIBLE) going on in Minneapolis. So we're --CASONE: We had it -- we're all three going again. It's going to be fun. And Jared, you're going to Super Bowl as well again?MAX: Yes. Yes.CASONE: Team Maria is going to be down there again.MAX: We're going to be hanging on the skyway system of Minneapolis. New York City feels like Minneapolis today.CASONE: Let me -- I want to tell you my favorite moment at the Super Bowl, I'm going to show it to you right now. I want you guys to see this. And my favorite thing that I think I did for Maria during the Super Bowl is because I love her, I agreed to do this. And I want to show the video, if we have it.BREWER: YesCASONE: And there we go, our Jack Brewer.(LAUGHTER)CASONE: Who was more freaked out when we did this story, was it you or was it me?BREWER: I'm sweating right now just thinking about what happened.(LAUGHTER)CASONE: And I'm trying to like report from that thing. Meanwhile, I'm screaming halfway through.BREWER: And I'm terrified of heights.CASONE: See you in Minneapolis, Jack.BREWER: This is --CASONE: All right. Jared, thank you very much.MAX: Happy New Year.CASONE: Happy New Year. You can catch Jared, of course, on Fox News Headline 24/7, Sirius XM 115. We'll be right back.CASONE: Happy New Year, everybody. A record year for the market. And of course, a big year for MORNINGS WITH MARIA for the ratings. This show has come so far. (INAUDIBLE) the other guys, Maria Bartiromo, Dagen McDowell, I love you guys. Amy Holmes, Michael Block, Jack Brewer, Happy New Year to all of you.HOLMES: Happy New Year.(CROSSTALK)CASONE: All right. All right. Cheers with our coffee, cheers to Charles Payne.CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Thank you very much and Happy New Year, Cheryl.

The offices would "house employees working on Facebook's effort to make hardware but could also help with its broader ambitions in China," according to sources. Facebook's plans "would depend on approval from the Chinese government," but if successful, the Times says it would be "a symbolic victory for the social network, which has long worked to get into China despite being blocked there for nearly a decade."Load-Date: September 7, 2017End of Document

Strong quake strikes southwest China, 13 dead, 175 injuredAssociated Press InternationalAugust 9, 2017 Wednesday 2:43 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 697 wordsByline: By GILLIAN WONG, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - A strong earthquake shook a mountainous region in southwestern China near a famous national park, killing 13 people, injuring 175 others and knocking out power and phone networks.At least five of the dead were tourists, China's official Xinhua News Agency said. At least 28 people had serious injuries, according to the Aba prefecture government in Sichuan province.Chinese President Xi Jinping called for rapid efforts to respond to the quake and rescue the injured. Authorities sent medical teams, rescuers and other resources.The quake around 9:20 p.m. Tuesday struck a region bordered by the provinces of Sichuan and Gansu. The area is on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau and home to many Tibetan and other ethnic minority villages. It's also near Jiuzhaigou, or Jiuzhai Valley, a national park known for spectacular waterfalls and karst formations.The U.S. Geological Survey said it was magnitude-6.5 and just 9 kilometers (5.5 miles) deep, while the China Earthquake Networks Center measured the earthquake at magnitude-7.0 and said it struck at a depth of 20 kilometers (12 miles). Shallow earthquakes tend to cause more damage than deeper ones.A man surnamed Song who answered the phone at a local emergency office in Aba prefecture, where the Jiuzhaigou national park is located, said the nearby town of Zhangzha reported the deaths and injuries. Song did not say where the five tourists who died were from.The epicenter was about 39 kilometers (24 miles) from the county of Jiuzhaigou, which has a population of around 80,000, and was 285 kilometers (177 miles) from Chengdu, the densely populated capital of Sichuan province, according to the Chinese quake center.Xinhua said strong tremors could be felt in Chengdu. The Sichuan provincial government's news website said that after the quake struck, a number of train services to Chengdu and other cities were suspended.Jiuzhaigou county had a massive power outage following the quake, Song said. Local officials were being sent to the town of Zhangzha, which was closest to the quake's epicenter."The tremors were very strong," said a woman in Jiuzhaigou town who gave only her surname, Wang, and said she worked for a travel company. She said the damage in the town center seemed minimal other than the suspension of electricity."People from other regions are a pretty frightened," Wang said.Xinhua said more than 30,000 tourists at Jiuzhaigou were relocated to safety with help from tourist buses and private vehicles.Yu Qian, a local taxation bureau official, told Xinhua that she felt strong shaking that sent her and her two children rushing from their home on the fifth floor. Yu said the quake cut off power in her neighborhood and disrupted telephone service."I was getting into a car at the time of the quake, and it felt like a heavy-duty truck roaring past," said Liu Yanrong, a local township official, told Xinhua.Xinhua cited a worker at the Jiuzhaigou park named Sangey as saying that some houses in the tourist site collapsed or cracked following the quake and that authorities were organizing evacuations of residents.Images on Chinese social media sites showed rocks scattered on roads and people running out of bars and cafes in Jiuzhaigou town onto the street.A report on the news site's official microblog also cited Zhao Wei, the party secretary of the Communist Youth League's Jiuzhaigou division, as saying some telephone communications networks were down, making it difficult to determine the scale of the damage.On Wednesday morning, another strong earthquake struck in far northwestern China, some 2,200 kilometers (1,360 miles) away. It was measured at magnitude 6.3 by USGS and 6.6 by China's agency and was in a sparsely populated area of the Xinjiang region near the Kazakhstan border. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage.Earthquakes are common in China's west, although the low population density there often means casualties are low. China's deadliest earthquake this century, a magnitude-7.9 temblor, struck Sichuan province in May 2008, killing nearly 90,000 people.___Associated Press writer Louise Watt and researcher Fu Ting contributed to this report.Load-Date: August 9, 2017End of Document

Thomas Wright argued that the document itself is coherent, but that its success depends on the bureaucracy's ability to constrain the president to its vision. That's because, according to Peter Beinart, the president doesn't seem to            truly believe in his own NSS. And Eliot Cohen argued that how one views the document            largely depends on how one decides to look at it: as a sacred text, or "like the scat of a shaggy, woodland beast."The New Year: A lot happened around the world this year. The #MeToo movement caused a moment of reckoning within communities across the world-and Jalal Baig wrote about the specific challenges of talking about sexual abuse openly and honestly within the Muslim community. Brexit monopolized British tabloid attention, and Yasmeen Serhan rounded up            a year in Brexit headlines. President Trump also captivated the attention of the media and the word through his            Twitter account, which started several international feuds, from diplomatic scuffles with Sweden and Australia to major confrontations with North Korea.

Read it            here:Most Venezuelans have a love-hate relationship with oil. I personally was never one of the haters-I was one of the lovers. When I was very young, I would go after school to my mother's office at Meneven, a subsidiary of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, where I was fascinated by the processes of production and refinement, as well as the economics of the industry.When I was 16, I toured the massive oil fields of Zulia State, about a day's drive from my hometown of Caracas. It was then that I realized that the country's massive wealth potential was at odds with the widespread poverty that was all around me. I was too young to know anything about resource curses, the all-too-frequent phenomenon in which a country's natural-resource wealth feeds economic distortions and inequality. But you didn't have to be an academic to understand something was terribly wrong. I have never stopped thinking about the dichotomy in Venezuela between the wealth underground and the poverty on the surface.That was 30 years ago. Today the contrast is more severe. Venezuela has the world's worst economy, even though it has the world's largest oil reserves. The paradox is that, even though oil helped lead the country to its present devastation, the same resource is essential to getting it out.What We're Reading           How a Secretive Police Squad Racked Up Kills in Duterte's Drug War, by Clare Baldwin and Andrew R.C.

Bitcoin Cryptocurrency is in Record Territory; FinancialBuzz.com News CommentaryPR NewswireOctober 24, 2017 Tuesday 9:00 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1977 wordsDateline: NEW YORK, October 24, 2017 BodyBitcoin traded near the $6,000 level on Monday after it hit an all-time high of $6,147.07 last Saturday. The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has risen nearly 500 percent this year and bringing its total market value of about $98.74 billion. According to Cryptocoins News, rumors that China may resume cryptocurrency trading by licensing bitcoin exchanges could have added to the recent rally in bitcoin prices. According to data from CryptoCompare, Japan now accounts for 59 percent of the total cryptocurrency trading volume, while 25.5 percent of trades came from United States. Global Payout, Inc. (OTC: GOHE), BTCS Inc. (OTC: BTCS), Global Blockchain Technologies Corp. (OTC: BLKCF), Global Arena Holding, Inc. (OTC: GAHC), Digatrade Financial Corp. (OTC: DIGAF)Asian countries have different attitude toward the cryptocurrency market. In September, Chinese government announced to ban Initial Coin Offering (ICOs) and shut down the major cryptocurrency exchanges such as such as OKCoin, Huobi, and BTCC in China, which caused bitcoin to drop sharply to a low of $2,980. Since then, bitcoin prices have recovered after Japan showed interested in the booming market. In September 29, 2017, Japan's Financial Services Agency announced to issue licenses for 11 cryptocurrency exchange operators, which followed a previously passed law to recognized bitcoin as a legal form of payment in April.Global Payout, Inc. (OTC: GOHE) announced breaking news this morning that, "its majority owned subsidiary, MoneyTrac Technology, Inc. ("MTRAC," the "Company") has established a strategic partnership with Pegasus Fintech, Inc., an innovative blockchain and token accelerator company delivering regulatory-compliant solutions in the financial services, technology, blockchain, and cryptocurrency market sectors.The core focus of the partnership will center around the development of a regulatory-compliant, security-based cryptocurrency token to be utilized within the financial technology platform that MTRAC is currently developing for its clients operating in the cannabis industry. Additionally, it is MTRAC's intent to introduce a value-driven token that will completely streamline payment processing for businesses and consumers across an industry that continues to grow substantially."MoneyTrac Technology is aiming to establish itself as the most effective full-service provider of financial technology solutions for businesses in the cannabis industry," says MTRAC COO Vanessa Luna. "Pegasus's cryptocurrency technology will serve as the catalyst for us to develop and introduce a cryptocurrency token that we believe will become the foundation for a revolutionary financial platform for the cannabis industry and go well beyond anything currently available in this market."Pegasus Founder and CEO David Lucatch adds, "At Pegasus Fintech, we have devoted a considerable amount of time and effort toward the development of a security-based token acceleration process that meets the needs and expectations of a changing global securities landscape. We are excited to have the opportunity to work in collaboration with MoneyTrac Technology on the development of a regulatory compliant Public Initial Blockchain Offering ("PIBCO") that will become the foundation for a token offering in their market sector that we believe will not only offer a real value to investors and token holders, but also facilitate market liquidity." With the development and successful launch of a cryptocurrency-based token, MoneyTrac expects to increase its revenue earning potential in addition to its overall value amongst its client base within the cannabis industry."BTCS Inc.(OTC: BTCS) plans to create a portfolio of digital assets including bitcoin and other "protocol tokens" to provide investors a diversified pure-play exposure to the bitcoin and blockchain industries. BTCS intends to acquire digital assets through: open market purchases, participating in initial digital asset offerings. On October 11th, BTCS announced it has secured $1,000,000 in financing, which includes $250,000 (59.38) in bitcoin. "This financing represents a major milestone in the ongoing evolution of our Company," stated Charles Allen, CEO of BTCS. "With the opportunity in the burgeoning blockchain space is still in its infancy, our planned merger with Blockchain Global Ltd. ("BGL") positions us with a diversified business model that sets the stage for market leadership globally, and this financing represents a strong commitment to move forward."Global Blockchain Technologies Corp.(OTC: BLKCF) is an investment company providing investors access to a basket of holdings within the blockchain space, managed by a team of industry early adopters and pioneers who have had a significant impact on the rise of the blockchain. Global Blockchain is focused on streamlining the complicated process that interested investors currently must undergo in order to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency space. Global Blockchain Technologies announced on October 16th that it has commenced an Australian Securities Exchange listing application. Global Blockchain president Shidan Gouran noted: "The addition of a listing in Australia to our listing in Frankfurt brings access to trading much closer to 24 hours a day on conventional exchanges, which should be the standard in the digital age."Global Arena Holding, Inc.(OTC: GAHC) holds a number of interests, including Global Elections Services, Inc., GAHI Acquisition Corp and Blockchain Technologies Corporation Inc. The Company focuses on acquiring technologies, patents and companies having the ability to leverage the blockchain crypto technology. On August 17th, Global Arena Holding announced that after months of development and testing, the Company's subsidiary, Global Election Services, Inc. is proud to announce the implementation of new proprietary software and hardware to utilize in ballot scanning during the tabulation process.Digatrade Financial Corp.(OTCQB: DIGAF) a digital asset exchange, blockchain development and fintech advisory services company announced on September 28th, the execution of a Letter of Intent "LOI" for its Initial Coin Offering "ICO" with No Limits Consulting Limited based in Hong Kong. The project deck, currently under development, will include the leadership team, development team, new Digafund ICO platform & launch date, legal & accounting, regulatory compliance partnerships, white paper, token structure, use of proceeds and user guide registration for token activation among other items and requirements.Subscribe Now!

Investment Bridge Announces Investment Opinion: Bridge Report on Ferrotec Holdings Corporation: The Company Continues to Expect Strong Growth in FY3/18Business WireAugust 22, 2017 Tuesday 1:00 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business EditorsLength: 676 wordsDateline: TOKYO BodyInvestment Bridge, one of Japan's leading IR services companies, has issued a "Bridge Report" on Ferrotec Holdings Corporation (JASDAQ: 6890) reviewing its earnings results for the fiscal year March 2017 and its earnings estimates for the fiscal year March 2018.Report Highlights• In fiscal year March 2017, Sales and operating income rose by 6.3% and 41.1% year-on-year respectively.• Ferrotec's earnings estimates call for sales and operating income to rise by 12.4% and 26.8% year-on-year respectively during fiscal year March 2018.Ferrotec Holdings Corporation manufactures and sells silicon single and multiple crystal manufacturing equipment and other products in the photovoltaic related products segment, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, flat panel display (FPD) manufacturing equipment parts, semiconductor materials, and various thermoelectric temperature controllers widely used in personal computers, cellular telephones, and devices using liquid crystal and plasma technologies.During fiscal year March 2017, sales and operating income rose by 6.3% and 41.1% year-on-year. Increases in profitability of the Equipment Related and electronic device businesses, and an improvement in the profitability of the photovoltaic related business allowed operating income to rise by a large margin. Also, an increase in earnings form equity accounting method allowed ordinary income to rise by 48.5% year-on-year. With regard to sales, the consolidation of the industrial use cleaning equipment manufacturer and sales company Asahi Seisakusho Co., Ltd. yielded a large contribution. Yearend dividend payment was raised by ¥6 including a ¥2 per share commemorative dividend to celebrate the implementation of a holding company structure, bringing the anticipated yearend dividend payment to ¥12 per share and the full year dividend to ¥18 (A ¥8 increase from the previous term).Ferrotec's estimates call for 12.4% and 26.8% year-on-year increases in sales and operating income during fiscal year March 2018. And while sales of photovoltaic related business are expected to decline by 20.1% year-on-year due to restructuring efforts, strong demand for various products responding to increases in capital investments is expected to allow sales of the Equipment Related business to rise by 27.9% year-on-year, and sales of the electronic device business are expected to rise by 6.5% based on an assumption of slowing automobile sales in North America. Economies of scale and automation are expected to allow operating income margin to improve a step further, and operating income to continue to grow. Dividend is expected to be raised by ¥2 to ¥20 per share (¥10 dividends at both the interim and yearend).Demand for data center memory equipment and smartphone application semiconductors are growing. Expansion in IoT applications for industrial machinery and the appearance of self-driving cars are expected to contribute to strong long term growth in semiconductor demand. At the same time, Ferrotec boasts of similar levels of manufacturing and marketing as local companies in China and should therefore fully benefit from the Chinese Government's "Made in China Plan".To view the full report, please go to the website at the URL listed below. http://www.bridge-salon.jp/report_bridge/archives/eng/6890/20170726.htmlAbout Bridge Report:Bridge Report is produced by Investment Bridge Co., Ltd. and provides accurate and objective information about the earnings, business strategies, and other information of publicly traded Japanese companies.

Chinese propaganda video prompts Indian complaint of racismAssociated Press InternationalAugust 17, 2017 Thursday 10:43 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 197 wordsDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - China's main state news agency, Xinhua, has released a video online criticizing India in a border dispute that prompted an Indian newspaper to complain of "racist overtones."The English-language video, titled "7 Sins of India," accuses the New Delhi government of illegally entering Chinese territory. It includes a man portraying an Indian dressed in a turban and false beard.Soldiers from the two sides are in a standoff in Doklam, an area between China and Indian ally Bhutan. New Delhi sent soldiers in June to stop China from constructing a road there.The Hindustan Times said the three-minute video has "racist overtones" and "mocked and parodied Indians."The video appears to be an attempt to use humor to win over foreign audiences. It is posted on Twitter and YouTube, both of which the ruling Communist Party tries to block Chinese web surfers from seeing.It accuses Indian forces of trespassing and breaking international law."Didn't your mama tell you, never break the law?" says the host, identified as Dier Wang.The video includes appearances by a man in a turban, sunglasses and false beard who speaks in an exaggerated Indian accent over canned laughter.Load-Date: August 18, 2017End of Document

CHINA'S PARLIAMENT CONSIDERS DRAFT LAW PROTECTING 'HONOR' OF COMMUNIST HEROESStates News ServiceDecember 22, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 756 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:China's rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC), is considering criminalizing anyone deemed to have smeared the "reputation and honor" of the ruling Chinese Communist Party's canon of heroes and martyrs, official media reported on Friday."Departments including public security, culture, press and cyberspace have a responsibility to protect the reputation and honor of heroes and martyrs in their supervision," state news agency Xinhua quoted the text of a new draft law as saying.The text suggests that officials are particularly concerned with online criticism, and perhaps satire, targeting the country's revolutionary heroes.The draft adds: "It is a duty of internet operators to timely handle online information that infringes on heroes and martyrs."A report on the draft law was heard by a session of the NPC standing committee on Friday.If passed, the new law would ban the "illicit appropriation" of land and facilities near memorials of heroes and martyrs, as well as any damage to such memorials, Xinhua said."Those who appropriate, damage or contaminate memorials, and insult or slander heroes and martyrs, may receive administrative penalties from public security or even criminal sanctions," it quoted the draft law as saying.Such protections would include the Monument to the People's Heroes in Beijing's iconic Tiananmen Square, which has previously formed a focal point for mass protests on the square, particularly during the 1980s.The monolithic structure is referred to in the draft test as "a symbol of the spirit of the Chinese people and nation, and as such, its structure, name, inscriptions, patterns and signs should be protected by law," it says.Beijing-based rights lawyer Yu Wensheng told RFA that the law isn't based on material facts, for example, an increase in vandalism and damage to such sites, however."Why do heroes and martyrs need protecting? I don't think this is based in fact, and I don't think a law specifically protecting heroes and martyrs is necessary," Yu said."We already have laws that would be enough [to cover such behaviors], for example, laws governing reputational damage," he said.Protecting a 'fake version of history'Wang Aizhong a rights activist based in the southern province of Guangdong, said the real reason behind the law is to prevent ordinary people from openly casting doubts or aspersions on the ruling Chinese Communist Party's official version of history."I think there have been signs that this is coming for a while now," Wang said. "They want to protect the Communist Party's fake version of history that it has been peddling for several decades now.""That includes narratives of these so-called martyrs; they want to try to maintain their legitimacy," he said.Wang said the true history of the Communist Party has been one of usurping of political power, including the spreading of false historical narratives."They are worried that these lies will continue to be exposed, to the extent that doubts begin to be cast on their legitimacy as a government," Wang said.The Chinese Communist Party already retaliates harshly against anyone abusing late supreme leader Mao Zedong or his image, as this is held to represent an attack on the founding supreme leader of the People's Republic.It also recently passed laws banning the "desecration or insults" to the national flag and other symbols of the Chinese state.Three protesters Yu Dongyue, Yu Zhijian, and Lu Decheng who helped splatter Mao's portrait with red paint during the 1989 Tiananmen pro-democracy movement all served lengthy prison sentences during which they were subjected to torture and ill treatment.In August 2015, Bi Fujian, a popular TV host for China's state-run broadcaster CCTV lost his job after a private joke at the expense of late supreme leader Mao Zedong that was leaked online.Bi "used ridicule to harm the image of the older generation of the Communist Party and the [late] state leader," the China Discipline Inspection Daily, a newspaper affiliated with the country's top graft watchdog, said in an article at the time.In the video, Bi is shown at a private dinner with friends, singing a parody of the revolutionary model opera "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," one of just eight operas approved for public consumption by Mao's wife Jiang Qing during the political turmoil of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976).Reported by Yang Fan for RFA's Mandarin Service.

451 Research: OpenStack Private Cloud Revenue to Overtake Its Public Cloud Revenue in 2018Targeted News ServiceNovember 6, 2017 Monday 12:59 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 515 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyThe 451 Research issued the following news release:451 Research predicts that service providers with OpenStack private cloud revenue will exceed revenue from service providers with OpenStack-based public cloud implementations in 2018, sooner than previously expected. From a regional perspective, deployments in China and APAC are now growing faster than in the rest of the world. While not the primary driver, a contributing factor is the Chinese government's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology advocating for OpenStack.The latest study, published on the first day of OpenStack Summit 2017, forecasts OpenStack revenue will exceed $6bn by 2021, as it experiences a growth rate of 30 percent CAGR. OpenStack is benefiting from the increase in hybrid cloud environments with 451 Research's Voice of the Enterprise: Storage Survey finding that 61 percent of the enterprises surveyed now utilize a hybrid cloud approach. Certain verticals and regions that are less enthusiastic about exclusively using hyperscalers also present a growth area for OpenStack.451 Research believes the OpenStack development community has made progress addressing challenges in installation and rolling upgrades over the last two years, resulting in increasing production deployments. This will continue in 2018 as OpenStack becomes more shrink-wrapped and risk is reduced for enterprise use. The platform was once limited to mostly development/testing and proof-of-concept deployments but there are now mission-critical workloads onOpenStack across nearly all enterprise verticals and regions.To date, OpenStack revenue has been overwhelmingly from service providers offering multi-tenant IaaS, but 451 Research Market Monitor finds that OpenStack growth is now shifting towards the private cloud space faster than previously expected.While containers are eclipsing OpenStack in terms of attention, 451 Research's OpenStack Pulse finds that very few OpenStack users are abandoning OpenStack. In reality, some of the most innovative and progressive OpenStack deployments feature the use of container technology such as Docker and Kubernetes."OpenStack has solidified its position as the leading open source option for building private and public cloud environments but it is no longer the shiny new toy in the industry - that torch has been passed to containers and microservices. And while there is no clear answer yet about OpenStack coexistence with containers, it is worth noting that containers and container management are nascent markets in terms of production use cases," said Al Sadowski, Research Vice President at 451 Research.451 Research's OpenStack Pulse also finds that that the OpenStack market is coalescing around a handful of the top providers, just as happened with Linux. Parallels have always been drawn between OpenStack and Linux but the comparisons are even more valid today as the top Linux vendors, such as Canonical, SUSE and Red Hat, are also key OpenStack vendors.This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 6, 2017.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6063163 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 6, 2017End of Document

However, the transition to mobile workforce involves planning and providing the right tools to the employees. In the field sales and service jobs, where on-the-spot payments have to be received, portable printers have huge demand. For instance, in logistics, thermal printers such as barcode printers find an increased utility such as printing barcode and radio-frequency identification (RFID) label for better inventory tracking and logistics.According to Rohan Joy Thomas, a lead analyst at Technavio for computing devices research, "In transportation and other retail sectors, receipt printers are widely used for generating tokens, printing receipts, invoices, generating shipment labels, sample tracking, in aisle repricing, and shelf edge labeling. Thus, increasing dependency of firms on mobile workforce models is driving the global portable printer market."Looking for more information on this market?

The manufacturers of these portable printing solutions have expertise in the downstream supply chain. Vendors currently have new business solutions that provide end-product offerings such as portable printer models along with solutions to deliver business intelligence and insights in the customer enterprise and value chain. These vendors have increased their area of generating revenue and moved from product provider to complete solution provider, thereby increasing their opportunities to earn revenue from wider and new markets. Firms realize the opportunity that comes with technology enablers from business analytics, mobile solutions, and cloud computing.Market challenge: alternate printing solutions in enterpriseTraditional printing methods required the system to integrate the external printer by installing the device driver. As this technology is improving day by day, business models and scenarios have also changed. Currently, many employees are on the move and are required to print documents wherever they go at anytime, anyplace. Printing has always gathered demand in terms of presentations, tickets, and contracts. However, this creates an additional workload for the IT team. To provide printing anytime and anywhere from the office laptop, smartphone, or tablet and at the same time maintain the security, software application firms have developed software that addresses the concern of print system operators as well as the IT managers around the globe. Such solutions are growth inhibitors for mobile printers .Is your business on track for a successful future? Learn how Technavio can helpTechnavio helps businesses anticipate changes in their marketplace, make proactive adjustments, and develop effective strategies to optimize their market positionsKey vendors in the market• Canon• HP• Seiko Epson• TOSHIBA TECThe global portable printer market is highly competitive. Though there are few leading vendors, new vendors look at capturing the market share based on taking advantage of lower ASP. Vendors that offer rugged printers or hardware of military grade have higher ASP than those offered by vendors, which do not qualify the high standards such as IP65 and IP54.

The Cryptocurrency Market Remains Strong; FinancialBuzz.com News CommentaryPR NewswireSeptember 28, 2017 Thursday 9:00 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1856 wordsDateline: NEW YORK, September 28, 2017 BodyBitcoin Price rose back above $4,000 on Wednesday as South Korea plans to create a major cryptocurrency exchange. Bitcoin price jumped 7.13 percent to $4173.27 on Wednesday, bringing its market capitalization to over $68 billion. The cryptocurrency market has grown at a rapid rate this year. According to Coinmarketcap, the total cryptocurrency market was about $144 billion. It reached a record high of $180 billion earlier this month. Other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum also have significant gains this year. The price of Ethereum, which is the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rose more than 3600 percent this year. Big Wind Capital Inc. (CSE: BWC), First Bitcoin Capital Corp. (OTC: BITCF), Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTC: GBTC), BTCS Inc. (OTC: BTCS), HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. (OTC: PRELF)Bitcoin price has hit an all-time high of $5000 earlier this month. But it fell after the Chinese government announced it will ban Initial Coin Offering and shut down the major cryptocurrency exchanges such as such as OKCoin, Huobi, and BTCC in China. But other Asian countries such as South Korea are interested in the booming cryptocurrency market. According to a Coindesk report, South Korean Fintech Firm Dunamu plans to launch a new cryptocurrency exchange, known as Upbit.Big Wind Capital Inc. (CSE: BWC) target Hill Top Security Inc. (HTSI) listed on the Canadian Stock Exchange under the Ticker 'BWC'. The company announced breaking news yesterday that, "HTSI is developing its first Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for the mining and metals industry and has already received funding for development. The new ICO will enable HTSI to expand its current protection of company networks and communications to include the protection of company transactions. HTSI is also in the process of joining the Financial Information eXchange (FIX), which has revolutionized the trading environment and has been fundamental in facilitating many of the electronic trading trends that have emerged over the past decade. HTSI recently signed a letter of intent with Big Wind, pursuant to which Big Wind intends to acquire various interests in HTSI and its assets." News Highlights:- The ICO will facilitate secure trading of specific commodities even in unstable jurisdictions worldwide- Hill Top's ICO will utilize proprietary technology created by Hill Top, within the Etherium framework. Etherium is the leading technology used by most crypto currencies.- Hill Top has received funding and product development is at a very advanced stageCorby Marshall, CEO of Hill Top Security, said, "From our perspective, the value of cryptocurrency goes beyond theunderlying currency or coin because it allows a company to conduct trustworthy transactions in untrustworthy jurisdictions or circumstances. We therefore see our application of cryptocurrency as a new and ground-breaking method of securing our customers' operations - an approach that moves beyond protecting company networks and communications to a point at which we are protecting transactions as well."Kim Pease, SVP, Product Management, of Hill Top Security, said, "We are very excited to be on the vanguard of an intriguing new paradigm for distributed apps. Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the future of financial transactions and, with our ICO already at an advanced stage, we expect to be in a position to launch in the near future."First Bitcoin Capital Corp.(OTC: BITCF) is engaged in developing digital currencies, proprietary Blockchain technologies, and the digital currency exchange -  http://www.CoinQX.com.  First Bitcoin Capital Corp and SAMCO Financial announced on September 20th, that SAMCO has delivered 3 automated check-cashing kiosks to BITCF locations in Northern California. Kiosks were ordered by BITCF as a pilot test to integrate Bitcoin ATM functionality into self-service check cashing kiosks nationwide. During the pilot, BITCF is offering discounted check-cashing services and will promote the new services through online advertising, in-store signs, and special events, all aimed at consumers who use a check-cashing services.Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTCQX: GBTC) is a publicly-quoted security that is solely invested in and originating value from the price of bitcoin. The BIT exposes the value and price movement of bitcoin to investors through a traditional investment vehicle, without requiring the purchase, storing and safekeeping of bitcoins. The Bitcoin Investment Trust tracks the bitcoin market price, fees and expenses.BTCS Inc.(OTCQB: BTCS) is an early entrant in the Digital Asset market and one of the first U.S. publicly traded companies to be involved with Digital Assets and blockchain technologies. Subject to additional financing, BTCS plans to create a portfolio of digital assets including bitcoin and other "protocol tokens" to provide investors a diversified pure-play exposure to the bitcoin and blockchain industries. BTCS announced on August 21st, that it signed a non-binding Letter of Intent ("LOI") to merge with Blockchain Global Limited ("BCG"), an Australian blockchain company.HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd.(OTC: PRELF) is a growth oriented, TSX.V-listed company building a bridge from the blockchain sector to traditional capital markets. On September 18th, the company announced the commencement of trading in the Company's common shares on the TSX Venture Exchange under the ticker symbol "HIVE" effective at the open on September 18, 2017.

Asian Shares End Mixed After China Trade Data As Yen GainsLive Briefs PRO Global MarketsNovember 8, 2017 Wednesday 3:38 AM ESTCopyright 2017 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 606 wordsBody Asian stocks turned in a mixed performance on Wednesday as geopolitical worries resurfaced in the Middle East and commodity prices weakened after the release of Chinese trade data.Media reports suggesting that US Senate Republicans are considering delay in the implementation of corporate tax cut by a year also weighed on markets.The dollar fell against the yen, while oil prices dipped after data showed Chinese crude imports fell to their lowest level in a year.Chinese shares gave up earlier gains to end on a flat note as traders digested mixed trade data. The benchmark Shanghai Composite index finished marginally higher at 3,415.46 while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was down 0.3% at 28,906 in late trade.Government data showed that Chinese exports climbed an annual 6.9% in dollar terms, slightly below economists' forecast for an increase of 7.1%. Imports surged 17% from a year ago to marginally beat estimates, leaving a trade surplus of USD38.2 billion for the month.Japanese shares finished mixed as escalating tensions between OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Iran helped spur demand for yen. The Nikkei average slipped 23.78 points or 0.1% to end at 22,913.82, while the broader Topix index rose 0.2% to 1,817.60, a near 11-year high.Exporters closed mostly higher, with Canon, Toyota Motor, Panasonic and Sony rising 2% to 3%. Falling bond yields kept banks and insurers under selling pressure. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial declined 0.9% while T&D Holdings ended down over 2%.Australian shares erased early losses to finish marginally higher after the release of strong quarterly earnings from Commonwealth Bank of Australia.The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index closed largely unchanged at 6,016.30 after rising as much as 1% the previous day to scale a near 10-year high. The broader All Ordinaries index also finished flat at 6,089.10.Commonwealth Bank of Australia rallied 2.7% after the lender posted solid first-quarter results, helped by increased home lending and lower bad debt charges.Miners Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton, South32 and Fortescue Metals Group dropped 1% to 3% after base metals prices fell sharply on Tuesday.Energy stocks such as Origin Energy, Woodside Petroleum and Beach Energy lost 1% to 2% on profit taking after recent sharp gains.Ardent Leisure shed 2.1% as its chief executive Simon Kelly resigned, after only six months in the job.

Tuskegee University Names Koong as Business DeanTargeted News ServiceAugust 17, 2017 Thursday 1:49 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 589 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: TUSKEGEE, Ala. BodyThe Tuskegee University issued the following news:Tuskegee University has appointed Dr. Kai S. Koong as dean of the Andrew F. Brimmer College of Business and Information Science at Tuskegee University. Koong comes to Tuskegee with more than 20 years of experience as an educator and administrator in public and private higher education institutions -- including three with a focus on serving minority students.As dean, Koong will oversee all academic and operational aspects of Tuskegee's Brimmer College. This includes nine accredited undergraduate degree options in accounting, business administration, computer science, computer information systems, economics, finance, hospitality management, sales and marketing, and supply chain management -- as well as an accredited master's option in information systems and security management. The college is comprised of administrative units as well as three academic departments: Accounting, Economics and Finance; Computer Science; and Management.Prior to joining Tuskegee, Koong served on the faculty of School of Economics and Management at Xidian University (Xi'an, Shaanxi, China) as a distinguished professor and a foreign expert certified by the Chinese Central Government. In the United States, he previously served on the faculty and as an administrator at the University of Texas Pan American, Southern University at New Orleans, and Dakota State University. His previous experience also includes faculty appointments at Kentucky State University, Mount Olive College and Virginia Commonwealth University. Both the Caritas Institute of Higher Education (soon to be called St. Francis University) in Hong Kong and Xidian University in Xi'an, China have named him a lifetime honorary professor."Dr. Koong's perspectives as an acclaimed national and international educator certainly will enhance the experiences of our business and information science students," said Dr. Charlotte Morris, Tuskegee's interim president. "Furthermore, that academic experience -- coupled with his demonstrated higher education leadership success -- will benefit the Brimmer College and the university as a whole."As a result of his research specializations and teaching interests in the areas of e-commerce, energy markets, global information systems, health information technology and labor issues, Koong has published more than 150 manuscripts in leading peer-refereed journals, books and conferences. He currently serves as the editor-in-chief for two global peer-refereed journals: the International Journal of Electronic Healthcare and the International Journal of Services and Standards. He was the featured keynote speaker at the 2015 International Conference on Technology in Education, the 2017 Information and Communication Technologies in Organizations and Society Conference in Paris and the 2017 Lebanese Conference on Information Systems in Lebanon. In addition, he has been invited to deliver keynote addresses at several international conferences next year.Koong's numerous accolades for his academic and professional endeavors include the Decision Sciences Institute-Southwest Region's Outstanding Educator of the Year Award (2012), the Province of Shaanxi's (China) Outstanding Foreign Educator Award (2017), and a senate resolution in his honor from the Louisiana State Senate. As a result of his mentoring efforts, his students frequently have been honored with awards for their research, research writing and academic success.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-5962832 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: August 18, 2017End of Document

ACLU Joins Professor's Lawsuit Against FBI for Baseless Arrest, Illegal SpyingTargeted News ServiceOctober 31, 2017 Tuesday 12:30 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 785 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: PHILADELPHIA BodyThe American Civil Liberties Union, a 501(c)3 non-profit that works to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution and laws of the U.S., issued the following news release:The American Civil Liberties Union announced today that it is representing Xiaoxing Xi, a Chinese-American physics professor at Temple University who is suing the government over its dismissed prosecution of him for supposedly sharing sensitive technology with scientists in China. The ACLU and the law firm Kairys, Rudovsky, Messing, Feinberg & Lin LLP filed an amended complaint today in federal district court. The complaint challenges the government's baseless arrest and surveillance methods as well as its discriminatory targeting of Chinese-American scientists like Xi.In May 2015, FBI agents came into Xi's house with guns drawn and led him away in handcuffs in front of his wife and daughters. The government accused Xi of sharing information about a superconductor device known as a "pocket heater," relying on email exchanges between Xi and scientific colleagues in China that the FBI had obtained. The government claimed that those communications violated a legal agreement Xi had signed with the company that owned the pocket heater in which he had agreed not to share the technology.The intercepted emails, however, were not about the pocket heater, but concerned a different kind of superconductor technology that has been public for years. In September 2015, prosecutors were forced to drop the charges. But the damage to Xi and his family was already significant. As a result of the charges, Xi was placed on administrative leave, suspended from his position as the interim chair of the Temple Physics Department, denied access to his lab and the graduate students working under his supervision, and had to pay substantial legal fees to defend himself.The government spied on Xi using orders issued under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which is intended for spying on foreign agents. As the complaint alleges, he was also spied on without any court order under Section 702 of FISA and Executive Order 12333, both of which are used by the government to conduct warrantless surveillance of international communications, including those of Americans.The government has reportedly engaged in extensive warrantless surveillance of Chinese universities and scientific research centers. It has siphoned communications off servers, computers, and major internet networks that connect many of China's most prestigious academic institutions. Both the NSA and FBI routinely store the emails and phone calls they intercept in government databases for years, where they can be later searched by analysts and agents who are investigating Americans. FBI agents conduct so-called "backdoor searches" on Americans so often that the government has referred to one of these massive databases as the "FBI's Google.""The dangers of giving the government such sweeping surveillance powers are real and unmistakable. This case is a glaring example of an innocent American's privacy rights being grossly violated, with disastrous consequences for Professor Xi and his family," said ACLU attorney Patrick Toomey. "The government needs to stop spying on Americans without a warrant and start following the Constitution."Xi's case is one of three espionage-related prosecutions of Chinese-American scientists in a 10-month period in which the government abandoned the case before trial. The others include the dismissal of charges against Sherry Chen, a hydrologist with the U.S. National Weather Service in Ohio in March 2015, and Guoqing Cao and Shuyu Li, senior biologists at Eli Lilly & Company in December 2014."The FBI's conduct in this case and others suggests that the government has been targeting Chinese-Americans because of their race or ethnicity," said Toomey. "The Constitution demands a remedy when the government runs roughshod over the rights of innocent citizens."In May 2017, Xi filed a lawsuit against the lead FBI agent in the case, Andrew Haugen, and other agents, alleging that they made knowingly or recklessly false statements in support of the investigation and prosecution. Xi's wife and oldest daughter later joined the case. The lawsuit asks the court to award damages and to declare that the defendants violated the plaintiffs' Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights. It also asks the court to order the government to return or delete any of the Xis' communications that it obtained during the investigation.Today's amended complaint is here:https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/xi-v-haugen-second-amended-complaintCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6055491 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 1, 2017End of Document
