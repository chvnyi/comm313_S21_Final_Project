UK Government Should Urgently Consider New Review Process for Chinese Investment in Sensitive SectorsTargeted News ServiceJuly 18, 2017 Tuesday 3:42 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1133 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: LONDON BodyThe Henry Jackson Society, a 501(c)3 non-profit that fights for the principles and alliances which keep societies free - working across borders and party lines to combat extremism, advance democracy and real human rights, issued the following news release:The UK Government should welcome inward investment from China, but ensure the national security of key infrastructure remains protected, our new report warns."Safeguarding our Systems: Managing Chinese Investment into the UK's Digital and Critical National Infrastructure", described by Sir Malcolm Rifkind as "authoritative and spot on", analyses how large Chinese buy-outs of strategic assets are driving a debate among Western allies on the need to balance economic growth with national security.The report findings include:* China's investment into Western advanced economies - including that of the UK - is increasing and changing in scope. It has moved away from commodities in developing economies and moved to targeting key high-tech sectors and critical national infrastructure* China's own stated economic strategy, Made in China: 2025, might threaten the long-term survival of UK businesses unless some sort of Government protection is afforded them or unless China affords British businesses more access to China's home market* Because of cyber vulnerabilities, critical national infrastructure will be at the forefront of any future war* A formal investment screening regime is both necessary and desirable, both to protect the UK's economic interests and its national security* Any new regime should be adequately resourced to carry out the difficult task of tracking FDI into the sensitive parts of the UK's economy* The new regime should begin to coordinate more closely with the UK's closest military and intelligence-sharing allies, including the Five Eyes partners and NATO member states* This review body should use a clear matrix to screen investment, perhaps using the three threat types identified by Theodore Moran for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States* Any new regime should carry out its review process in a judicious but swift manner, so that foreign investment in the UK is not hampered or harmed. This report suggests that the regime should be able to sufficiently pass its decisions within 30 days of receiving inquiry* Ideally, any regime should be overseen by a special committee in Parliament that ensures that it is adequately funded and resourced to carry out its activities, and that it is carrying them out in a legal, expedient, and sufficient mannerCommenting on the report, Sir Malcolm Rifkind (Foreign Secretary 1995-97, Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament 2010-2015) said:"John Hemmings' report is authoritative and spot on in its analysis.The massive increase of Chinese investment in the United Kingdom has not happened by accident. Much of it is a consequence of a strategy well developed by the Chinese Government. He makes the significant point that the Chinese are loathe to permit foreign investment and competition in comparable sectors of their own economy.Much of that investment from China is as welcome as it would be from any other country. But some of it has implications for our long-term security and for our Critical National Infrastructure.John Hemmings' call for a new standing body to be set up by the Government to review future investment proposals in the UK against national security criteria is long overdue."Sir Hugo Swire, former Minister of State at the Foreign & Commonwealth Office, said:"In this day and age, where the UK's economy and well-being and increasingly tied to trade and inward bound investment, it seems perverse to demand a review process for FDI. However, I think it is precisely because our need, and because of the strategic intent of some foreign state-owned enterprises with less-than-benign intentions, that we do need to have proper safeguards in place.The Government should urgently consider an investment review body to both safeguard our national interests and to coordinate with our allies who is allowed to own our telecommunications and future technologies."Nigel Inkster, the former Assistant Chief and Director of Operations and Intelligence at MI6, said:"It's a good report and timely. There is a lot of naivete in regard to China by western governments and businesses alike. China knows it's political model is unattractive in the West but it has found that it's money exercises a powerful attraction.It shouldn't be forgotten that China is still heavily dependent on Western technologies but there is a clear set of strategies to redress that imbalance. That is not to say that western states cannot do business with China nor accept Chinese FDI. But they need to do so with their eyes open and with clear strategies of their own."Lord Arbuthnot, former Minister of State for Defence Procurement and Chairman of the Defence Select Committee (2005-2014), said:"The UK is entering a period in which we must warmly welcome OFDI into our economy. It'll be good for jobs, good for rebuilding infrastructure, and good for our communities. However, this does not mean that we should welcome unfettered access to every corner of our high-tech economy and our critical national infrastructure.Britain needs an independent investment review body, which brings together our trade experts and our security experts, to screen foreign companies and state-owned enterprises attempting to buy access to sensitive parts of our economy. Big data, dual-use technologies, and the protection of our national infrastructure should be at the forefront of this new body.The Americans have CFIUS, the Australians have FIRB, many of our friends and allies have review processes or units who help screen foreign investment into their infrastructure in an open and transparent manner. It is high time that the UK developed one too: for the protection of our infrastructure and technologies, and to give foreign investors more security and confidence in the process. "John Hemmings, the Director of the Asia Studies Centre at The Henry Jackson Society and author of the report, said:"The UK should of course welcome inward investment to feed the economy. Britain needs investment. But not at all costs. We have to ensure that foreign state owned enterprises are not compromising our most critical infrastructure or key future technologies. The UK needs to follow the lead of Germany and urgently put in place a robust review process that protects our digital and critical national infrastructure."Safeguarding Our Systems - Read the report in full here (http://henryjacksonsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Safeguarding-Our-Systems-Report-FINAL-Digital.pdf)Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-5929668 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 18, 2017End of Document

Even in death, the Chinese government still censors activist Liu XiaoboCNN.comJuly 14, 2017 Friday 11:37 PM ESTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: CHINALength: 1335 wordsByline: By Steven Jiang, CNNDateline: Beijing BodyThe global outpouring of grief and anguish over Liu Xiaobo's death stands in marked contrast to the muted reaction in his homeland.The Nobel Peace Prize-winning writer and human rights activist died Thursday evening of liver cancer while in custody at a hospital in Shenyang in northeastern China. He was 61.Liu's funeral was held Saturday morning in Shenyang and attended by his "family members and close friends," according to a city government spokesman. Liu's body had been cremated, and his ashes had been dropped into the sea in a private ceremony, he said."The authorities can't afford to see Liu's grave turn into a landmark and symbol where people gather to pay tribute," said Hu Jia, a leading Chinese human rights activist who has known Liu's wife for years and has served prison terms for his own advocacy. "They want to erase all traces of him.""But three-quarters of the Earth's surface is covered by water," he added. "His grave is now everywhere."In a government-organized news conference, Liu Xiaobo's eldest brother -- who Liu's supporters say had never approved his activism -- on Saturday afternoon expressed the family's "profuse gratitude" to the state for showing "humanity" in providing medical treatment and arranging "perfect" funeral services for Liu. He left without taking questions.The Chinese government, which had long banned Liu's work and even his name, continues to censor the story of his death, deleting social media posts mourning him -- including those simply displaying the image of a burning candle -- and blocking online searches containing variations of his name and famed quotes.CNN's broadcast is blacked out in China every time Liu's images or story appear.Domestic media outlets, all controlled by the ruling Communist Party, mostly have ignored the news. Dominating Friday's front page of the party mouthpiece, People's Daily, was a photo of a beaming President Xi Jinping meeting his Canadian counterpart.A few English-language outlets carried short reports on Liu's death, highlighting his "criminal" background and Chinese doctors' effort to save him.'Inciting subversion'Before he was granted medical parole last month, Liu had been serving a 11-year prison sentence for "inciting subversion of state power." His conviction in late 2009 stemmed from his co-authorship of a manifesto calling for human rights and political reform in China.In 2010, while he was in prison, the Nobel committee awarded Liu the peace prize for "his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China" -- a move that infuriated Beijing.In a harshly worded, English-language editorial published Friday by the nationalistic tabloid, The Global Times, the state-run newspaper painted Liu as "a victim led astray by West.""Liu lived in an era when China witnessed the most rapid growth in recent history, but he attempted to confront Chinese mainstream society under Western support," it said. "This has determined his tragic life.""The West has bestowed upon Liu a halo, which will not linger," it added.The newspaper had posted a since-deleted message in Chinese on Sina Weibo, a platform similar to Twitter, mocking the international reactions to Liu's death: "The person's gone but a blockbuster tear-jerker is just on -- we'll sit back and enjoy the show."'Improper comments'Amid an avalanche of condolences and condemnations from politicians and activists around the world, the Chinese government took the unusual step of issuing a statement shortly after 2 a.m. Friday to respond to what it called "improper comments" by foreign officials."The handling of Liu Xiaobo's case belongs to China's domestic affairs, and foreign countries are in no position to make improper remarks," said foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang. "We call on relevant countries to respect China's judicial sovereignty and not to meddle in China's domestic affairs with this individual case."The statement was sent directly to foreign journalists and was nowhere to be found on the ministry's website -- just like all previous official responses to questions about Liu.China has conveyed its "strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition" to all governments and international entities that commented on Liu's death, including the United States and the United Nations' human rights commission, Geng said at a regular news briefing Friday afternoon.China's warning seems to have gone unheeded, with even the US President -- not known as a public champion of human rights activists -- expressing his sorrow over Liu's death and calling him a "political prisoner" in a statement.Echoing myriad other world leaders, Donald Trump made a point of mentioning Liu Xia, a poet and artist who married Liu Xiaobo in 1996 while he was serving an earlier prison sentence.As her husband remained behind bars until recently, Liu Xia, 56, paid a heavy price for simply being his wife. Under de facto house arrest since his Nobel win, Liu Xia saw her communication with the outside world almost completely cut by the government.She has been suffering severe depression, according to close friends, especially after authorities sentenced her brother to 11 years in prison over what supporters call trumped-up charges of business fraud.Struggle continuesNow, Liu Xia is increasingly the focus of an international campaign calling for her freedom and right to live abroad, which many friends and supporters say were her husband's dying wishes."He loved her so much that he felt he owed it to her," said Liao Yiwu, a prominent Chinese writer and longtime friend of the Lius who now lives in Germany."He didn't know about her condition and what had happened at home until not that long ago," Liao said. "That's why he agreed to go abroad with her."In a hastily arranged news conference in Shenyang after his death, Liu Xiaobo's Chinese doctors acknowledged for the first time that he had sought treatment overseas but insisted that his medical condition by then had made international travel impossible.They confirmed that Liu Xia was by her husband's bedside when he died -- and his last words urged her to "live a good life."Despite worldwide solidarity behind Liu Xia, many supporters sense the Chinese government's fear of her turning into an international symbol and rallying cry for human rights. They foresee an uphill battle for her ahead."Few knew Liu Xiaobo's thoughts in the last eight years, but she did, and they talked during his last days," said Hu, the Chinese activist. "I think the authorities are afraid of seeing even the simplest last words from him get out and spread."Geng, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, repeatedly declined to say Friday whether the government would allow Liu Xia to leave China, insisting that Beijing would handle her case "in accordance with law.""Liu Xia is free," the Shenyang city government spokesman said Saturday, but needs privacy to mourn her painful loss.In government handout photos of her husband's funeral, a grief-stricken Liu Xia, wearing all black and sunglasses, can be seen bowing to the open casket and holding a portrait of Liu Xiaobo.The authorities later released videos that they said proved Liu Xia's consent to the burial arrangement. One clip purportedly shows a handwritten note by Liu Xia on Thursday requesting a private sea burial, while the other appears to be a hidden-camera recording of her saying the same thing.In a brief appearance before reporters, Liu Xiaobo's eldest brother said Liu Xia was unable to join him due to her "extremely weak condition" that may require medical attention. He did not respond to shouted questions about her whereabouts amid growing international concern over her freedom and welfare.Across the closely monitored cyberspace in China, some internet users have evaded censors to post lines from Liu Xia's poems that were dedicated to her late husband -- including verses from "Wind": "Walls make you suffocate / you are the wind, and the wind / never tells me / when it comes and when it goes."Load-Date: July 16, 2017End of Document

His conviction in late 2009 stemmed from his co-authorship of a manifesto calling for human rights and political reform in China.In 2010, while he was in prison, the Nobel committee awarded Liu the peace prize for "his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China" -- a move that infuriated Beijing.In a harshly worded, English-language editorial published Friday by the nationalistic tabloid, The Global Times, the state-run newspaper painted Liu as "a victim led astray by West.""Liu lived in an era when China witnessed the most rapid growth in recent history, but he attempted to confront Chinese mainstream society under Western support," it said. "This has determined his tragic life.""The West has bestowed upon Liu a halo, which will not linger," it added.The newspaper had posted a since-deleted message in Chinese on Sina Weibo, a platform similar to Twitter, mocking the international reactions to Liu's death: "The person's gone but a blockbuster tear-jerker is just on -- we'll sit back and enjoy the show." 'Improper comments'Amid an avalanche of condolences and condemnations from politicians and activists around the world, the Chinese government took the unusual step of issuing a statement shortly after 2 a.m. Friday to respond to what it called "improper comments" by foreign officials."The handling of Liu Xiaobo's case belongs to China's domestic affairs, and foreign countries are in no position to make improper remarks," said foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang. "We call on relevant countries to respect China's judicial sovereignty and not to meddle in China's domestic affairs with this individual case."The statement was sent directly to foreign journalists and was nowhere to be found on the ministry's website -- just like all previous official responses to questions about Liu.China has conveyed its "strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition" to all governments and international entities that commented on Liu's death, including the United States and the United Nations' human rights commission, Geng said at a regular news briefing Friday afternoon.China's warning seems to have gone unheeded, with even the US President -- not known as a public champion of human rights activists -- expressing his sorrow over Liu's death and calling him a "political prisoner" in a statement.Echoing myriad other world leaders, Donald Trump made a point of mentioning Liu Xia, a poet and artist who married Liu Xiaobo in 1996 while he was serving an earlier prison sentence.As her husband remained behind bars until recently, Liu Xia, 56, paid a heavy price for simply being his wife. Under de facto house arrest since his Nobel win, Liu Xia saw her communication with the outside world almost completely cut by the government.She has been suffering severe depression, according to close friends, especially after authorities sentenced her brother to 11 years in prison over what supporters call trumped-up charges of business fraud.Struggle continuesNow, Liu Xia is increasingly the focus of an international campaign calling for her freedom and right to live abroad, which many friends and supporters say were her husband's dying wishes."He loved her so much that he felt he owed it to her," said Liao Yiwu, a prominent Chinese writer and longtime friend of the Lius who now lives in Germany. "He didn't know about her condition and what had happened at home until not that long ago," Liao said. "That's why he agreed to go abroad with her."In a hastily arranged news conference in Shenyang after his death, Liu Xiaobo's Chinese doctors acknowledged for the first time that he had sought treatment overseas but insisted that his medical condition by then had made international travel impossible.They confirmed that Liu Xia was by her husband's bedside when he died -- and his last words urged her to "live a good life."Despite worldwide solidarity behind Liu Xia, many supporters sense the Chinese government's fear of her turning into an international symbol and rallying cry for human rights. They foresee an uphill battle for her ahead."Few knew Liu Xiaobo's thoughts in the last eight years, but she did, and they talked during his last days," said Hu, the Chinese activist. "I think the authorities are afraid of seeing even the simplest last words from him get out and spread."Geng, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, repeatedly declined to say Friday whether the government would allow Liu Xia to leave China, insisting that Beijing would handle her case "in accordance with law.""Liu Xia is free," the Shenyang city government spokesman said Saturday, but needs privacy to mourn her painful loss.In government handout photos of her husband's funeral, a grief-stricken Liu Xia, wearing all black and sunglasses, can be seen bowing to the open casket and holding a portrait of Liu Xiaobo.The authorities later released videos that they said proved Liu Xia's consent to the burial arrangement. One clip purportedly shows a handwritten note by Liu Xia on Thursday requesting a private sea burial, while the other appears to be a hidden-camera recording of her saying the same thing.In a brief appearance before reporters, Liu Xiaobo's eldest brother said Liu Xia was unable to join him due to her "extremely weak condition" that may require medical attention. He did not respond to shouted questions about her whereabouts amid growing international concern over her freedom and welfare.Across the closely monitored cyberspace in China, some internet users have evaded censors to post lines from Liu Xia's poems that were dedicated to her late husband -- including verses from "Wind": "Walls make you suffocate / you are the wind, and the wind / never tells me / when it comes and when it goes."TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

CECC MARKS 28TH ANNIVERSARY OF TIANANMEN MASSACRE WITH BIPARTISAN CONGRESSIONAL LETTER TO CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPINGStates News ServiceJune 1, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 1085 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by the Congressional-Executive Commission on China:A bipartisan group of lawmakers from the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) urged Chinese President Xi Jinping to lift restrictions on public discussion of the Tiananmen protests and their violent suppression and to release individuals detained for commemorating the June 4 anniversary and human rights lawyers detained in the "709" crackdown.In the letter, Commissioners expressed their belief that "greater transparency, adherence to international standards, and the development of the rule of law are the keys to advancing a range of mutual bilateral interests from fighting corruption to building investor confidence, from ensuring cybersecurity to maintaining stability and security in the Pacific...an honest accounting of the events of 1989 will reap domestic and global benefits for the Chinese government and the Chinese people." Text of the letter can be found below.Joining Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Chris Smith, respectively the CECC's Chair and Cochair, in signing the letter were Commissioners Senators Jeff Merkley and Tom Cotton and Representatives Timothy Walz, Robert Pittenger, Randy Hultgren, and Marcy Kaptur.The Commissioners also said in the letter that they were "gravely troubled" by the nationwide campaign targeting Chinese human rights lawyers and rights advocates that started in July 2015 and asked the Chinese President to unconditionally release those still detained and investigate reports of torture, including the forced ingestion of "unknown substances with adverse psychological and physical effects."Among others, the Commissioners urged the release of Tang Jingling, Jiang Tianyong, Wang Quanzhang, Wu Gan, Guo Feixiong (Yang Maodong) and Su Changlan. These, and other prisoners of conscience cases, are featured as part of the CECC's #FreeChinasHeroes initiative.CECC Releases New Analysis on the Suppression of Wukan Village Protests: The analysis concludes that official corruption and lack of effective redress mechanisms lay at the heart of the protests in Wukan, China's "Democracy Village" in Guangdong province, and the location of repeated demonstrations over government land grabs since 2011. Chinese officials' suppression of Wukan village in 2016 has dampened observers' previous hopes for grassroots democratic reforms and legitimate public participation in China.Text of Commissioner's Letter:June 1, 2017His Excellency Xi JinpingPresident of the People's Republic of ChinaDear President Xi:We write as members of the bipartisan U.S. Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) on the 28th anniversary of the violent suppression of nationwide demonstrations in support of democratic reform in China that took place in Beijing's Tiananmen Square and other cities in China in the spring of 1989.We solemnly commemorate the Tiananmen massacre each year in the U.S. Congress because of the lives lost and persons permanently injured, because of the profound impact the event has had on U.S.-China relations, because so many former student leaders have made important and lasting contributions to global understanding of China, and because the Chinese people themselves are unable to mark this event.The ongoing prohibition of public and online discussion of what transpired in the spring and summer of 1989 has done more to negatively shape global perceptions of the Chinese government than anything else in your country's recent history. Open information about the Tiananmen massacre and its aftermath is crucial for Chinese citizens, and is a vital concern to those of us seeking more productive U.S.-China relations.We respectively ask that your government allow uncensored, public discussions of the Tiananmen protests and to end retaliation against those, like the Tiananmen Mothers, seeking information about family members who died or disappeared on or after June 3 and 4, 1989.We remain concerned about those who are imprisoned, detained, or held under other types of official restrictions in connection with their attempts to commemorate the Tiananmen protests, including Yu Shiwen who took part in the protests in 1989 and is now reportedly in poor health due to a stroke he had in detention, and others such as Tang Jingling, Chen Yunfei, Chen Xi (Chen Youcai), Liu Shaoming, Xu Zhiqiang (Sheng Guan), and Yuan Xinting (Yuan Chaoyang). We have been seeking the release of these individuals for the past three years, and we respectfully ask that they be unconditionally released to demonstrate your government's commitment to transparency about the history of the Tiananmen protests. We also urge the release of Fu Hailu, Luo Fuyu, Zhang Juanyong, and Chen Bing, who were detained in 2016 in connection with the production of satirical liquor bottles meant to commemorate the anniversary of the Tiananmen protests.We are also gravely troubled by the sweeping, nationwide campaignthe "709 Crackdown"that targeted Chinese rights lawyers and rights advocates starting on July 9, 2015. The reports of torture in detention, forced disappearances, and public confessions are particularly troubling as are the intimidation and illegal detentions faced by family members. We ask that Jiang Tianyong, Wang Quanzhang, Zhou Shifeng, Gou Hongguo (Ge Ping), Zhai Yanmin, and Wu Gan be unconditionally released and that you investigate reports of torture, particularly reports indicating that those detained were forced to ingest large amounts of unknown substances with adverse psychological and physical effects. The ongoing campaign to imprison, torture, and disbar human rights lawyers undermines your public commitments to develop the rule of law in China. Moreover, we urge you to release Guo Feixiong (Yang Maodong), Hu Shigen, Xie Wenfei, Su Changlan, Huang Qi, Liu Feiyue, and others detained or imprisoned for their rights advocacy.We make the above requests respectfully in the spirit of improving U.S.-China relations. We firmly believe that greater transparency, adherence to international standards, and the development of the rule of law are the keys to advancing a range of mutual bilateral interests from fighting corruption to building investor confidence, from ensuring cybersecurity to maintaining stability and security in the Pacific. We believe an honest accounting of the events of 1989 will reap domestic and global benefits for the Chinese government and the Chinese people.We thank you for considering our request.Load-Date: June 4, 2017End of Document

KEY MOMENTS FROM CECC HEARING "GAGGING THE LAWYERS: CHINA'S CRACKDOWN ON HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYERS AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS"States News ServiceJune 30, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 1336 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Congressional-Executive Commission on China:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) and U.S. Representative Chris Smith (R-NJ), the chair and cochair respectively of the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), held a hearing this week looking at the Chinese government crackdown on human rights lawyers and legal advocates.Witnesses included Terence Halliday, co-director of the Center on Law and Globalization at the American Bar Foundation and co-author of the book Criminal Defense in China: The Politics of Lawyers at Work; Teng Biao, Chinese human rights lawyer and a Visiting Scholar, Institute for Advanced Study; Li Xiaorong, independent scholar and former researcher at the Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy at the University of Maryland; and Xia Chongyu, the son of imprisoned human rights lawyer Xia Lin.Partial transcripts and links to videos of some of the hearing's key moments are below. Witness testimonies and the opening statements of Senator Rubio and Congressman Smith can be found on the CECC's website. The hearing webcast is archived and can be viewed via the CECC's YouTube page.VIDEO: Senator Rubio says U.S. problems with Chinese Communist Party, not the Chinese people"I welcome China's rise in many ways, I don't welcome a totalitarian state's rise...If somehow there was a Chinese government that cared about the rights of all mankind that could work together with us, I think we would be a lot further along in some the major issues confronting this country. But when you don't care about the rights of your own people, why would you care about the rights of anybody else? That is our problem with the Chinese Communist Party, and its leadership, not its people. While I remain hopeful for change, in the interim, we will continue to speak out..."VIDEO: Rep. Smith says U.S. must be a voice for those silenced and repressed in China"The one thing that gives me hope is that the people of China long for liberty, justice and opportunity... The need for principled and consistent American leadership is now more important than ever, as China's growing economic power, and persistent diplomatic efforts, have succeeded in dampening global criticism of its escalating repression and failures to adhere to universal standards. The U.S. must be a beacon of liberty and a champion of individual rights and freedoms. The United States must also continue to be voice for those silenced, jailed, or repressed in China. We cannot...will not...forget those in China bravely seeking liberty and justice and the unalienable rights we all share here in the United Stateslike China's human rights lawyersand like Liu Xiaobothose who bravely seek peaceful change in China. That's our focus. That's our priority. That's our hopes and prayers for them. "VIDEO: Terry Halliday explains why repression has not stopped the work of human rights lawyers"Many lawyers build their courageous representation upon legal ideals that underwrite the good political society. They insist on the protection of basic legal freedoms, such as the right to be represented by a lawyer, due process in trials, and fair adjudication. They insist upon freedoms of speech, of association and religion...Our research documents that many lawyers, notable and ordinary practitioners, also draw their courage from their Christian faith. Christians insist upon the values of equality, most importantly, that in the eyes of God and in the eyes of the law, said one lawyer, "Chairman Mao is as equal as me"... They believe in fairnessthat justice should be available reliably and fairly to all, whether they are Han Chinese or Tibetan, Party members or Falun Gong members. Finally, they hold China's law accountable to God's law."VIDEO: Teng Biao Offers Recommendations for U.S. Policy"...A powerful and autocratic China will bring calamities to mankind. Supporting democracy and human rights in China not only corresponds to American declared values; it will also benefit American politics, society and economics in the long term. Please stand on the side of Chinese people, not on the side of Chinese Communist Party. China should be represented by the human rights lawyers, activists, dissidents and all Chinese people fighting for freedom and democracy, not the illegitimate Party and government."VIDEO: Xia Chongyu asks the U.S. Government to work for his father's (Xia Lin) release"Human rights lawyers are the cornerstone of the society. I hope the US. Government can increase its involvement in these cases in the future. Moreover, I wish the Congress of America could urge the Chinese government to stop controlling the judiciary system and stop the persecution against 709 lawyers. Lastly, I plead that the White House summon the Chinese ambassador and ask the Chinese government to respond to me and my 94,000 petition supporters....By making a clear stance, the US. Government would communicate to the world that human rights violations will not be tolerated. I appreciate the Congress for organizing this hearing so that our voice could be heard by the world."VIDEO: Xiaorong Li says systematic human rights abuses call into question China's fitness to take global leadership role"Congress should support U.S. actions holding the Chinese government accountable for its failures to live up to its international human rights obligations...As China becomes a rising world power the government's systematic human rights abuse raises serious questions about its credibility or fitness to take global leadership in areas where the U.S. is retreating. The Chinese government has a clear track record of signing up for international human rights treaties, meanwhile violating them outrightback at home and in countries where it is investing, lending money, and building infrastructures. It is important to lay bare this track record of deceit and hypocrisy. A government that can't honor its own commitments, can't keep its own promises has no credibility."VIDEO: Senator Rubio asks Xia Chongyu if he faced threats from the Chinese government"After my father was arrested, he was completely missing. We did not receive any warrant and so we do not know where they took him or who took him. That's one of the pressures we got. The police also summoned my mom to ask her to divorce with my father, and I was on the threaten list, that is the reason why my family sent me hereto keep me safe. But I think, the first two years, I was threatened by the government...The police officers went to my family friends and other family members to threaten them, and me and my mom kind of get isolated. So, I'm just worrying about everything, and I was scared; I just kept silence here. But, I have learnedI have learned what is right to do and what is justice, I would say, so the pressure turned into my power, and I would have the chance to speak here."VIDEO: Senator Rubio asks Terry Halliday whether prisoners of conscience benefit from public advocacy on their behalf"In my empirical research and the work of our team, speaking to many activist lawyers over a period of time, there is absolutely no doubt in their mind that China must be spoken to publicly and China must be publicly shamed...I have no doubt that when the world speaksout loud and publiclyChina listens. China has a very thin skin. When the American Bar Association awarded its International Human Rights prize to Wang Yu, within 48 hours, the Global Times had an editorial trying to rebut that move. That tells me that not only was China listening, but China felt it had to respond. And finally, the point that you made, Mr. Chairman, is that in our interviews with notable activists, time and again, they have said that when there is public calling for their release or public calling for news about them, their treatment is improved. They can perceptibly point to the day or the week or the month when their treatment changes when the international has turned the spotlight publicly on their plight."Load-Date: July 2, 2017End of Document

Chinese Government Tighten Grip with New Media RegulationTargeted News ServiceMay 5, 2017 Friday 12:42 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 473 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: BRUSSELS BodyThe International Federation of Journalists issued the following news release:The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) voices concerns for the online media regulation that will be implemented in June 2017. The IFJ calls on the government to withhold the regulation's implementation until proper public consultations are held.On May 2, the Cyberspace Administration Bureau of China issued a new set of regulations for online communication channels under the guise of safeguarding national interest. Under the new regulations, online communication channels will not be allowed to report, publish or disseminate any kind of news unless they apply for a license from the Bureau. Additional Internet Service Providers (ISPs) should provide 'positive guidance' for the new regulations and 'safeguard national interest'.According to section 5 of the regulations, websites, software applications, forums, blogs, microblogs, social media accounts, instant messaging services and websites that provide news reports, comments of any kind of public affairs and news, must apply for a license from the Bureau. Failing to do so could lead to them be taken offline. Under section 7, it specifically states that no foreign investments will be allowed to provide internet services unless they apply for approval from the authorities, and undergo a 'security assessment'. Those found to be breaching the regulation will face fines or jail time. Section 21endorses the current practice by the Bureau of maintaining a 'black list' and 'interrogation system' for ISPs who have breached the regulationThe practices and rules outlined in the new regulation are not new, however this latest step simply formalises them. By including blogs and microblogs the authorities are addressing the growing number of dissident bloggers that are serving as 'independent news sources' in China, as the government crackdown continues.Many Mainlanders voiced concerns for the new regulation, but queried if it was simply a move by the government to create a 'safe' environment in the lead up to the 19th National People's Congress later this year.The IFJ Asia Pacific office said: "This latest regulation demonstrates the complete disregard and disrespect by the authorities of the Chinese Constitution which guarantees the people's right to free speech and press freedom. The blatant disregard for the people by not including public consultation in the development of this regulation shows the authoritarian nature of the Xi government.""We urge President Xi to respect and defend the people's rights while there is no mutual exclusion between individual rights and national security. We hope Xi demands the Bureau to implement a comprehensive consultation before take this new set of regulation in effective."Copyright Targeted News Services09J-Vista-5856039 09J-VistaLoad-Date: May 6, 2017End of Document

Chinese Government Threatens Foreign Media Over Live-Streamed InterviewTargeted News ServiceApril 24, 2017 Monday 4:04 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 434 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: BRUSSELS BodyThe International Federation of Journalists issued the following news release:The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) strongly criticise the recent actions by Chinese authorities against foreign journalists, threatening to revoke visas following an interview.On April 19, Voice of America (VOA), a US government-funded, independent media outlet, livestreamed an interview with Guo Wengui, a Chinese billionaire, currently in exile in the US. Guo has made a series of allegations of corruption against relatives of high-ranking Communist Party officials. In the interview, which VOA streamed, Guo made new alloegations about businesses secretly controlled by Chinese leaders, including one allegation involving Chinese President Xi Jinping, as well as the nephew of Wang Qishan, a current member of the Politburo Standing Committee.The interview was into its second hour, when VOA abruptedly ended, citing issues of miscommunication. Speculation spread online, particularly on social media and in the media industry. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that on April 19, Interpol has issued an arrest warrant for Guo Wengui and that was the reason the interview finished.VOA spokesperson, Bridget Serchak, told the media in an email: "The stream was allowed to continue beyond its first hour. When this was noticed, the feed was terminated." According to a New York Times report, VOA executive, Amanda Bennett, proceeded with the interview, with the understanding that the live portion only lasted one hour. The rest of the interview would be recorded. The New York Times also reported that Chinese government officials tried to suppress VOA to cancel the interview. In the report, it said that the Foreign Ministry summoned VOA's Beijing-based correspondent, Bill Ide, and demanded that broadcasting on the interview not go ahead as it interfered with internal affairs and threatened that the broadcast may affect the renewal of journalists' visas."The whole thing is stupid anyway. We are in a low morale," a reporter of VOA said, "such an interview related with the legal issues, the editor or manager should consult the legal department in advanced."The IFJ Asia-Pacific office said: "The actions by the Chinese government to attempt to control and suppress the media highlight the volatile environment that the media continues to operate in in China. Foreign media are no longer exempt from controlling hand of the Chinese government. Threats to the media, and in this case, against whistle-blowers, only work to weaken press freedom."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-5843528 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: April 26, 2017End of Document

ON SENATE FLOOR, RUBIO CONDEMNS CHINA'S OPPRESSION OF HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST, LAWYERStates News ServiceMay 16, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 1368 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Florida Senator Marco Rubio:Speaking on the U.S. Senate floor today, Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), chairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, condemned the Chinese governments oppression of human rights activist Huang Qi and lawyer Xie Yang. Rubios speech was part of his #expressionNOToppression initiative, which highlights human rights abuses around the world.The full speech can be watched here, and a downloadable broadcast quality version is available for TV stations here. A transcript of Rubios remarks is below.U.S. Senator Marco RubioU.S. Senate FloorWashington, D.C.May 16, 2017YouTubeRubio: Mr. President, I come to the floor today as part of my office's Expression Not Oppression initiative, which highlights human rights abuses around the world and the plight of individuals imprisoned or oppressed for simply exercising their God-given rights.Earlier this month, we observed World Press Freedom Day, which serves as a reminder that freedom of expression is a fundamental and universal human right, and a free press is vital to a free society.We should never take for granted the freedom of the press that we enjoy here in the United States. These rights are an integral part of the bedrock of any healthy democracy, and in too many parts of the world they are nonexistent or under assault.According to Reporters Without Borders World Press Freedom Index for 2017, press freedom is threatened now more than ever. Governments around the world continue to crack down on their citizens access to information .Out of 180 countries, Burundi dropped from 156 to 160 most problematic for press freedom, Egypt dropped from 159 to 161, and Bahrain dropped from 162 to 164.Additionally, Reporters Without Borders has reported at least nine journalist have been killed already in 2017. Several were killed in Mexico here in our own Hemisphere.&#8206;Its hard to believe that people are being thrown in jail or worse, simply because government officials dont like what they write or publish, but that is what is happening, especially in countries like China, Russia, Iran, and Saudi Arabia, just to name a few.The case I come to the floor here today to highlight is that of Huang Qi , who has long been targeted by the Chinese government because of his advocacy for the rights of ordinary citizens, and his coverage of the Chinese governments violation of those rights.In November of last year police reportedly burst into his residence and ransacked his home and took him into detention. In December of last year, Chinese prosecutors authorized Huangs arrest for allegedly illegally providing state secrets overseas, a charge that can result in a sentence of life imprisonment.The Committee to Protect Journalists described his detention as part of an intensified crackdown on online journalists and bloggers who report on protests and human rights abuses.Huang founded the 64 Tianwang human rights website in 1998. The Chinese government has blocked access to 64 Tianwang since 2003, according to Radio Free Asia, because the site covers issues deemed politically sensitive by authorities, such as protests and government corruption.Authorities previously sentenced Huang to 3 years in prison on November 2009, for illegal possession of state secrets, this in connection to his work assisting parents who lost children during the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.In addition, Chinese authorities sentenced Huang to 5 years in prison in 2000 for subversion for his advocacy on behalf of the families of 1989 Tiananmen protest victimsa solemn anniversary which we will mark next month.In short, Huang, a veteran activist, is no stranger to the Chinese governments silencing of dissent. His lifes work is a testament to fearless reporting regardless of what consequences may follow.While his own government views him as a threat, outside of China Huangs work is widely praised and recognized.Reporters Without Borders awarded the 2016 Press Freedom Award to his website. His case has been championed by Human Rights Watch, Freedom House, and others, including the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which I am proud to Chair.His case is featured in the Commissions Political Prisoner Database which presently contains more than 1,400 active prisoner recordsa staggering, but far from exhaustive, number.Huang is committed to reporting the factsfacts that describe the daily struggles of Chinese citizens. And for this he has suffered greatly including: reported torture and mistreatment in detention, unjust imprisonment and deprivation of his most basic human rights.The Chinese government should immediately and unconditionally release him, and the United States should make this case and the cases of many others like him languishing unjustly behind bars in China, or tortured into confessing to crimes they did not commit, priorities- we should make these priorities in our bilateral engagement with Beijing.It is this second pointthe torture and mistreatment of rights defenders, which brings to mind another troubling casethat of prominent human rights lawyer Xie Yang. His wife, who recently arrived in the United States with their two young children, will testify before the House Foreign Affairs Committee later this week.Xie has bravely taken on sensitive cases involving land grab victims and advocates for democratic reform. Chinese security agents detained him as part of the 709 Crackdowna sweeping, nationwide campaign against Chinese rights lawyers and advocates that started on July 9th , 2015.The plight of the forty-five year old Mr. Xie, burst on to the international scene in January of 2017 when his attorneys released transcripts of their meetings with him.The transcripts recount the threats of his inquisitors. They said, Well torture you to death just like an ant. Another warned, Im going to torment you until you go insane.He told his lawyers, I wanted to end their interrogation of me as quickly as I could, even if it meant deathLater, I wrote down whatever they wanted. As if foreshadowing the fate that awaited him, he had earlier written a letter in detention in which he cautioned, If one day in the future I admit guiltthat will not be a true expression of my thoughts.Fast-forward to last week.He was charged with inciting subversion of state power and disrupting court order plead guilty in a recorded video released by the court and widely reported in major media outlets, he said, I want to take this opportunity to express to other rights lawyers my view now that we should give up using contact with foreign media and independent media to hype sensitive news events, attack judicial institutions and smear the image of the nation's party organs while handling casesHe continued in that same, coerced statement, Everyone should take me as a warning to certainly stay within the framework of the law, and avoid being exploited by Western anti-China forces.And Yet, despite these warnings and the Chinese governments unyielding assault on human rights, there are still men and women committed to reporting on the governments abuses and steadfast in defending the powerless and marginalized. Their courage is an inspiration and it must summon our solidarity.I look forward to the day when the Chinese government upholds rather than tramples the rights of its own citizens, abides by the rule of law at home and respects the international rules-based system globally. However, that day has not yet arrived.And until it does, we must signal to the Chinese people that whatever our broader diplomatic and strategic aims may be as it relates to North Korea or any other issue, America is under no illusions about the iron-fisted leadership of President Xi and his utter disregard for the rights and dignity of his own people.As President Trump continues fulfilling his duty and appointing individuals to key positions, I will keep raising these issues with each and every relevant nominee that I meet with both privately, as I did with Governor Branstad, and publicly, as I did during his confirmation hearing.It is critical that the United States keep human rights for all people as a core pillar of our foreign policy.Load-Date: May 16, 2017End of Document

Apple to open data center in China with government tiesAssociated Press Financial WireJuly 13, 2017 Thursday 2:23 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: DOMESTIC NEWSLength: 602 wordsByline: By MICHAEL LIEDTKE, AP Technology WriterDateline: SAN FRANCISCO BodySAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Apple will open a data center in mainland China with ties to the country's government, raising concerns about the security of iCloud accounts that store personal information transferred from iPhones, iPads and Mac computers there.The data center announced Wednesday will be located in the Guizhou province and run by a company owned by the Chinese government. Apple is teaming up with the company, Guizhou on the Cloud Big Data, to comply with a new Chinese law requiring data-storage providers to keep the information of mainland China customers on computers located within the country.The Guizhou data center will store photos, video, documents and other personal information uploaded to iCloud accounts by Apple customers who live in mainland China, even when they're traveling outside the country. Backups and other data stored in iCloud accounts by customers outside China will continue to be stored in data centers in the U.S. and eventually Denmark.Other major technology companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM, have already made similar deals to run data centers in mainland China to remain in the good graces of the country's Communist government.But Apple's acquiescence is striking because CEO Tim Cook has made preserving customers' privacy a company cornerstone. The Cupertino, California, company underscored that commitment last year in a high-profile battle with the U.S. government over a legal demand to crack open the iPhone of a suspected killer in a mass shooting.Apple has a strong incentive to toe the line in China because that country already is its third-largest market behind North America and Europe, with all signs pointing to it become an even bigger profit center. China currently accounts for about 20 percent of Apple's revenue.Even though it's working with a government-owned company, Apple sought to reassure customers in China that the arrangement won't compromise their privacy. "As our customers know, Apple has strong data privacy and security protections in place and no backdoors will be created into any of our systems," the company said in a statement.What's more, Apple says it will hold to the security keys protecting the data that people routinely back up in iCloud accounts.But experts believe the data center will make it easier for the government to retrieve the information through legal demands or other means.Apple will find it more challenging to resist any order from a Chinese court to give authorities there access to an iCloud account that they want to sift through, predicted Nate Cardozo, a senior staff attorney specializing in privacy for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group. Currently, the Chinese government has to funnel those demands through the U.S. court system, a more difficult process to negotiate.Cardozo recommends that Apple customers in mainland customer turn off the iCloud feature on their iPhones and other devices to protect their information from prying eyes.Data stored on the devices themselves should remain secure as long as they lock them with passwords that only the user knows. Even if the government seizes a device, Apple won't have the keys to unlock data. But with iCloud, Apple does have the keys. The exception is passwords and credit card data synced with iCloud Keychain.Ajay Arora, CEO of data security specialist Vera, also warns that Apple's partnership with a company owned by the Chinese government increases the chances that authorities could secretly pry their way into iCloud accounts."It's like Apple is putting the fox in charge of the henhouse," Arora said.Load-Date: July 13, 2017End of Document

Committee of 100 Urges Focus on Mutual Interests in Trump-Xi Summit; C100 Survey Reveals Hopes and Concerns of American and Chinese People for U.S.-China Relations,Overwhelming Chinese Optimism Ahead of Xi's ArrivalPR NewswireApril 6, 2017 Thursday 9:15 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 425 wordsDateline: NEW YORK, April 6, 2017 Body Chinese President Xi Jinping arrives in the United States today for his first meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, bolstered by significant domestic Chinese support and increased Chinese optimism about the country's trajectory. Initial findings from the forthcoming Committee of 100 (C100) U.S.-China Public Perceptions and Opinion Survey 2017 reveal that 92% of Chinese respondents think China is headed on the right track. Relative to four years ago, there is also greater Chinese support for China's leaders to grow their international stature through diplomacy and take a global leadership role.With more Chinese believing that the U.S.-China relationship will improve (32%) rather than worsen (23%) under the Trump administration, today's meeting comes with high expectations on both sides. "This moment is the opportune time for both countries and their leaders to set the bilateral relationship on a hopeful and mutually beneficial path," said Frank H. Wu, Chairman of C100.The C100 survey also revealed that while each country had concerns about the other - with Americans most worried about the trade deficit, loss of U.S. jobs to China, and cybersecurity, and the Chinese most concerned about the U.S. military presence in the Asia-Pacific region and the issue of Taiwan - there were also areas of common concern around issues of climate change and North Korea.For the first time, Americans and Chinese are in agreement about the main areas in which both countries would benefit from working together: trade, global financial stability, and the environment.At this critical inflection point in U.S.-China relations, these areas of common interest between the two countries should invite expanded cooperation and creative collaboration at the highest levels. C100 urges the leaders of both countries to seize this opportunity to focus on issues of mutual interest and exercise collective global leadership. These initial findings are part of the Committee of 100 U.S.-China Public Perceptions Survey 2017. The full survey will be released in May 2017 around the C100 Annual Conference in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1990, C100 is a leadership organization of prominent Chinese Americans in business, government, academia, and the arts. C100's survey project began in 1994 and produced surveys in 2001, 2005, 2007, 2012, and 2017. Learn more.To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/committee-of-100-urges-focus-on-mutual-interests-in-trump-xi-summit-300435914.htmlSOURCE Committee of 100CONTACT: Holly Chang, Executive Director, 212-371-6565, media@committee100.orgLoad-Date: April 7, 2017End of Document

CypressFirst Comments On Latest Admissions In Third Cypress Semiconductor Disclosure; Executive Chairman Ray Bingham and Cypress Board Admit Bingham Discussed Cypress M&A Information with Chinese Government-backed Private Equity FirmPR NewswireMay 30, 2017 Tuesday 5:05 PM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 784 wordsDateline: SAN JOSE, Calif., May 30, 2017 Body Camillo Martino and J. Daniel McCranie, nominees for election to the Cypress Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ: CY) ("Cypress" or "the Company") Board of Directors, and T.J. Rodgers, founder and former CEO of Cypress and the Company's largest individual stockholder (collectively "CypressFirst"), today briefly commented on the latest admissions made by the Cypress Board in its May 30 Second Proxy Supplement.T.J. Rodgers said, "In a mid-day filing with five single-spaced pages of additional facts cynically released less than one hour after a report issued by a proxy advisory firm, the Cypress Board finally admitted that executive chairman Ray Bingham has discussed inside knowledge of Cypress's M&A activities and prospects with his other employer, Chinese government-backed private equity firm Canyon Bridge. After two lawsuits attempting to secure the truth about Mr. Bingham's conflict of interest, and two sets of prior misleading proxy disclosures, Cypress has waited until the last minute to even begin leveling with stockholders, who should have been well informed from the very beginning of the proxy contest. By waiting until after two of the proxy advisory firms had issued their reports, Cypress knowingly caused them to base their decisions on inadequate information.  We sincerely hope that the Cypress stockholders will take a close look at the new Cypress disclosures-despite the inadequacy of even this third set of disclosures-before making their voting decisions."The following quotes can be found in the new May 30 Second Proxy Supplement:Ray Bingham disclosed Cypress M&A status to Canyon Bridge.The Proxy Supplement states: "In August 2016, Mr. Bingham first met with Benjamin Bin Chow, the Managing Partner of Canyon Bridge, in connection with Mr. Bingham potentially serving in an advisory role for a private equity fund that would become Canyon Bridge. Also in August 2016, during the early stages of Mr. Bingham's discussions with Canyon Bridge, Mr. Chow informed Mr. Bingham regarding a 'rumor flying around in China about possible M&A plays surrounding the company [Cypress].' Mr. Bingham said, 'Nothing happening here.'"Rodgers explained the significance of Mr. Bingham's reply: "Months before Mr. Bingham notified any member of the Cypress Board or management team of his Canyon Bridge activities, he was providing confidential information on the status of Cypress's M&A activities to an outside party that was seeking acquisition opportunities in the semiconductor industry and is a potential acquirer of Cypress itself."Ray Bingham discussed semiconductor acquisition targets with Canyon Bridge. The Proxy Supplement states: "[O]n November 4, 2016, an investment bank, at the investment bank's request, presented to the Cypress Board regarding the continuing consolidation in the semiconductor industry and listed a number of companies that Cypress may want to acquire. The presentation also speculated that Canyon Bridge might be one of 30 companies that could have an interest in Cypress.""On November 15, 2016, Mr. Bingham messaged Mr. Chow and the other prospective Canyon Bridge principals regarding potential acquisition opportunities in the semiconductor space."Ray Bingham disclosed the identities of Cypress customers and acquisition targets to Canyon Bridge.The Proxy Supplement states: "[O]n November 22, 2016, Mr. Bingham informed Canyon Bridge that he would be visiting certain companies in China and Japan on behalf of Cypress. During his trip, Mr. Bingham talked with Cypress employees, met with Cypress customers, visited semiconductor companies of potential interest to Cypress and met with private equity investors. Before his trip, Mr. Bingham asked his colleagues at Canyon Bridge for their advice and opinions of the various companies and investors he would be meeting with."Rodgers continued, "This record clearly shows that on multiple occasions Mr. Bingham provided his Canyon Bridge partners with confidential information he learned as a Cypress director. Cypress stockholders should not tolerate an executive chairman who serves two masters and is leaking highly sensitive Cypress M&A information to a competitor that is seeking to acquire semiconductor companies."CypressFirst urges Cypress stockholders to put a stop to this conflict of interest by voting theGOLDproxy cardFORthe election of highly qualified candidates Dan McCranie and Camillo Martino.More information about CypressFirst can be found athttp://www.CypressFirst.com.To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cypressfirst-comments-on-latest-admissions-in-third-cypress-semiconductor-disclosure-300465768.htmlSOURCE CypressFirstCONTACT: Media , Abernathy MacGregor, Jeremy Jacobs / Sheila Ennis, 212-371-5999 / 415-926-7961, JRJ@abmac.com, SBE@abmac.com | Investor , MacKenzie Partners, Daniel Burch / Laurie Connell, 212-929-5500, Dburch@mackenziepartners.com, ldennedy@mackenziepartners.comLoad-Date: May 31, 2017End of Document

Committee of 100 Releases 2017 U.S.-China Public Perceptions Survey; Survey finds that rising levels of distrust could undermine the U.S.-China relationship, Bridge-building required to ease concernsPR NewswireMay 19, 2017 Friday 8:51 PM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1011 wordsDateline: WASHINGTON, May 19, 2017 Body A new survey conducted by theCommittee of 100(C100) - a non-profit organization of prominent Chinese American leaders from politics, business, media and entertainment, and academia - underscores that a majority of Americans view cooperation and bridge-building between the two countries as "critical" and recognize the benefits of increased trade and investment, and cultural exchanges. Americans are, however, wary of China's economic and military intentions. According to C100's Chairman Frank Wu, the C100's landmark survey is intended to provide unique, comprehensive, and comparative information to better understand and enhance U.S.-China relations. The report also allows for a comparison of attitude changes over the last decade in both the U.S. and China"The aim of this survey is to determine American attitudes toward China, and Chinese attitudes toward the United States, in order to explore the most salient issues in U.S.-China relations. Now more than ever, it is more crucial than ever to find paths to mutual understanding and stronger bilateral relations. The study illuminates the hopes and fears of Americans and Chinese people for U.S.-China relations, and can be used to foster more fact-based dialogue and decision-making," said Wu.TheCommittee of 100's Public Perceptions Opinion Survey project began in 1994 and produced reports in 2001, 2005, 2007, 2012, and 2017. The report covered 79 questions showing responses in China and the United States from four target respondent groups: the general public, business leaders, policy experts, and journalists.Key highlights:The survey found that favorable views of the other country have declined: 55% of Chinese say they have a favorable impression of the U.S., down from 59% % in 2012, while 48% of Americans have a favorable view of China, down from 48% in 2017.   Chinese have become less trusting of America: Only 15% of Chinese think China should trust America, down from 36% in 2012.  However, Americans and Chinese also agree on areas of U.S.-China Collaboration: For the first time, Americans and Chinese are in agreement about the areas in which both countries would benefit from working together: trade, global financial stability, and the environment. In addition, North Korea has proved to be a common area of concern and desired collaboration.  Chinese Optimism at All Time High:More Chinese than ever (92%) think China is headed on the right track, with a majority believing China will surpass the U.S. as the world's leading superpower.Other findings from the survey include:Concerns about cybersecurity are on Americans' minds.Americans cite cybersecurity as the top likely source of conflict between the two countries, along with trade. Concern for the threat of cybersecurity doubled in importance for Americans from 11% in 2012 to 24% in 2017.    China has serious concerns about the United States' military presence in Asia.79% of Chinese see America's military power as a potential to serious threat. 72% see the disputes over the claims in the South China Sea as a regional issue rather than an international one.   Environmental concerns are at an all-time high when it comes to individuals.60% of Americans and 79% of Chinese (the highest percentage yet in the last decade) personally worry about climate change.    U.S. - Chinese trade relations are a top priority.Over 80% of both Americans and Chinese agree that trade with China is beneficial to the U.S. economy. Both Americans (75%) and Chinese (74%) also agree that products from China benefit American consumers.     Millennials in the United States driving up support for China.72% of American millennials value China as the most important partner compared to 64% of the general public.       Despite these challenges, both American and Chinese citizens want to be invested in each other's future.88% of American millennials think positively of the Chinese language being taught in U.S. schools (82% general public)' and 86% (78% general public) think the increase of Chinese students studying in the U.S. is good for America.Methodology:The survey, conducted in English in the U.S. in collaboration with Brunswick Insights, was released during the C100 Annual Conference 2017 in Washington, D.C. on May 19, 2017. The data for the national China survey was drawn from Horizon Dataway's own continuous self-sponsored and annually released survey on China's global views, "The World in Chinese Eyes." The latest survey covered 79 questions, 53 of which were asked in both the U.S. and China, 11 in the United States only, and 15 in China only. About 80% of the survey questions in this update were repeated from the 2012 survey. This year, the survey was conducted among 3,696 Chinese respondents and 1,019 American respondents between November 18 and December 23, 2016.About the Committee of 100The Committee of 100 is an international, non-partisan leadership organization of prominent Chinese Americans in business, government, academia, and the arts.

Thank you all for attending the hand-over ceremony of goods donated by the Chinese Embassy to the Office of the Attorney-General. The donation includes desktop computers, printers, UPS and a cheque of 10,000 Ghana cedi. Though limited in amount, the donation reflects the Chinese Embassy's sincere desire to support the Attorney General's Office in organizing a stakeholders' consultative workshop on the Office of the Special Prosecutor Bill, 2017.Corruption is a canker to social development. People abhor corruption. Recently, a TV series called in the name of the people" becomes very popular in China. This TV series tell the story of contemporary Chinese public prosecutors trying to maintain fairness, justice and the rule of law and investigating corruption cases. The audience rating is at the top and it has obtained many favorable comments.China's central leadership attaches great importance to building anti-corruption and clean governance. The setting up of a strong anti-corruption system by both the Party and the Government has won high praises from Chinese people and the international community. We address corruption through the rule of law, prevent corruption through the establishment of a strict supervision and control mechanism and punish corrupt ones through the establishment and implementation of scientific and comprehensive laws and regulations. In recent years, the Communist Party of China (CPC) has introduced a number of internal discipline documents to comprehensively strengthen Party discipline and to put forward requirements that are stricter on the party members' duties. We made important progress on strengthening the institutional constraints and mobilizing the public to supervise the government as well as building a system that will prevent corruption.China's anti-corruption act has gained strong support from the Ghanaian government. In 2015, relevant authorities of our two countries worked closely to catch one of China's most wanted economic criminals in Ghana. I want to take this opportunity to express once again our appreciation to the government of Ghana.China-Ghana relations are flourishing with effective cooperation in various fields. It is essential to manage and guide the exchange and cooperation between China and Ghana by legal means in order to protect the legitimate rights and interests of citizens of both sides, maintain a healthy market order, combat transnational crime and ensure social justice. We need to strengthen the exchange of experience on governance and learn from each other and implement the concept of the rule of law in bilateral cooperation. The Chinese government has always educated Chinese citizens and enterprises abroad to abide by the laws and regulations of the host countries, and to contribute to the local economic and social development.The Chinese side supports the new government of Ghana to carry out anti-corruption campaigns, and expect to strengthen our cooperation and exchanges on both domestic and international combat against corruption. I firmly believe China-Ghana cooperation will yield more fruitful results.Thank you!Load-Date: June 13, 2017End of Document

Besides, a cooperation landscape of the whole industrial chain has basically taken shape, which includes farming, seed breeding, deep processing of farm products and agricultural products trade..6.China-Kazakhstan cross-border logistics cooperation is intensified. During the visit, the state leaders of both sides jointly attended China-Kazakhstan Cross-Border Transport Video Connection Ceremony, witnessed the cooperation development of China-Kazakhstan Lianyungang Logistics Transport Base in the past three years. This project has promoted the fruitful achievements of China-Kazakhstan cross-border transport cooperation and boosted Kazakhstan to transform from a traditional inland country to an important hub for Eurasian continent connectivity. The number of China-Europe freight trains going through Kazakhstan in 2016 exceeded 1,200, and the container capacity grew by two folds.Q: At the SCO Astana Summit, President Xi Jinping put forward a series of important trade and economic initiatives. How will the Ministry of Commerce implement them?A: President Xi proposed to gradually build the institutional arrangement of regional economic cooperation, promote negotiating the SCO Trade Facilitation Agreement, positively carry out the small-and-medium-sized enterprises' cooperation and local cooperation, set up the economic think tank alliance, and strengthen the human resource development cooperation. These not only conform to the practical cooperation demands of the members of the SCO, but also contribute to building consensus of enabling all parties to take part in regional economic integration, and improve the influence of the SCO. MOFCOM will carefully implement these initiatives and do a good job in the following aspects:First is to promote the institutional arrangement of the regional economic cooperation. We will work with all parties to promote negotiating the SCO Trade Facilitation Agreement by the trade ministers' conference mechanism, strengthen comprehensive facilitation measures such as custom clearance, inspection and quarantine, logistic transportation, standard authentication and payment and settlement, enhance cross-border e-commerce cooperation, expand e-commerce enterprises' training and communication, continue to promote the joint research of SCO FTA and strengthen regional trade, investment, service and technical cooperation.Second is to positively promote small-and-medium-sized enterprises' cooperation and local cooperation. We will negotiation the MOU of promoting small-and-medium-sized enterprises' cooperation with trade and economic department of the SCO, discuss playing the irradiation effect of infrastructure connectivity and platform role of overseas cooperation zone, drive small-and-medium-sized enterprises of members to profoundly participate in industrial chain and value chain of regional cooperation. Efforts will be made to discuss make full use of investment and financing channel such as the Silk Road Fund and China-Eurasia Economic Cooperation Fund to support the small-and-medium-sized enterprises' projects cooperation and local cooperation, play the complementary advantages and further motivate market vitality and innovative capability of the SCO members.Third is to promote to set up economic think tank alliance. We will positively communicate and coordinate with our member countries, do good preparation work of the economic think tank alliance and strive to officially set up at the 2018 SCO Summit. Efforts will also be made to research how to innovate capacity cooperation mode and financial cooperation mode by think tanks of all countries, fully play the advantage of resource endowment and industries of all countries, provide policy suggestions for docking between the Belt and Road Initiative and development strategy of all countries and promote to form the overall competitive advantage of the regional economy of the SCO.Fourth is to enhance capacity construction. According to China-SCO human resources development cooperation plan announced by President Xi, we will share development experience of China with our member countries to improve their own development capability by inviting the SCO members to research and study in China, send the Chinese experts to our member countries to provide policy consultancy, carry out training in our member countries and provide the Chinese government scholarship quotas, etc.Q: During the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, China jointly issued the Belt and Road Trade Connectivity Initiative with many countries and international organizations. What is the response of the SCO countries?A: At the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in this May, MOFCOM, together with the relevant departments and international organizations of more than 80 countries jointly issued Promoting Belt and Road Trade Connectivity Initiative, marking an important achievement of this summit. The initiative defines the cooperation principle of trade connectivity, puts forward the cooperation measures of promoting trade connectivity and demonstrates the positive attitude of China to further expand opening up.SCO members actively respond to and support this initiative in concert with one another, and speak highly of its contents such as promoting trade growth, prospering mutual investment and pushing forward inclusive sustainable development. The support of SCO members for Promoting Belt and Road Trade Connectivity Cooperation Initiative stems from the common aspiration of all parties to joint hands to promote the construction of the Belt and Road Initiative, support economic globalization and promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation. Practical measures such as holding China International Import Expo since 2018 put forward by China not only build international platform for products of all countries to enter into China, but also for all countries to carry out trade, strengthen communication and promote global economic growth. They are the practical actions of China to support economic globalization. These measures highly conform to the concern of all countries to balance the development of bilateral trade and win the welcome and strong interests of the SCO members.We are willing to work with the SCO countries to jointly implement the trade connectivity cooperation initiative, pave the way for expanding trade and investment cooperation, promote the profound integration of regional market, make bigger cake for trade and economic cooperation and enable the people of all countries to feel tangible benefits.Q: What are the achievements acquired by construction of "One Belt and One Road" in Shanghai Cooperation Organization areas? After India and Pakistan join in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, what kinds of challenges will be brought to regional economic cooperation?A: Areas of Shanghai Cooperation Organization member states are the key regions in the construction of "One Belt and One Road" In recent four years, China and Shanghai Cooperation Organization member states have been promoting the construction of "One Belt and One Road" and have made positive progress.Firstly, there will be closer trade contacts. China and the member states promote trade convenience positively. Also the bilateral trade relationship is closer. At present, China has already become the first trade partner of Russia and Kyrgyzstan and the second trade partner of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan.Secondly, bilateral investment realizes the stable development. Until April 2017, China's direct non-financial investment in member states was $74.2 billion. The member states invested $1.09 billion in China. China's project contracting turnover in member states was $ 48.7 billion. Nowadays, China has already become the first investment resource country of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan and also the second investment resource country of Kyrgyzstan.Thirdly, the constructive effects in economic and trade cooperation zones can be obvious. China established 21 overseas economic and trade cooperative zones in Shanghai Cooperation Organization countries. The industrial agglomeration effects of China-Uzbekistan Pengsheng Industrial Park are increasing constantly. The "Best Asia Star" agricultural industrial park of China and Kyrgyzstan will be the regional demonstration project. The Chinese enterprises return to the local society in operation and make great contributions to enlarge reemployment and increase taxation.Fourthly, major project cooperation makes the positive progress. Some projects between China and member states have been completed one by one, including highways, railways, tunnels and electric power to improve cross-border logistic conditions and enhance development ability of member states. The former president of UZ said the completion of AngrenPapu Railway could achieve the dream of several generations in Fergana." In addition, the completion of southern and northern electric system in Kyrgyzstan might have the great significance on improving the local resource guarantee ability.In addition, China carries out positive assistance for member states. It has already accumulated 7500 employees in different trainings for member states and constructed some major projects, such as social safeguard house, hospital and school, so as to benefit the public and promote the connection between countries.After adding India and Pakistan, Shanghai Cooperation Organization's "Circle of Friends" will be further expanded. In addition, economic strength will be further enhanced. In addition, regional economic cooperation has the larger potential. Firstly, international and regional influences will be enlarged. After Shanghai Cooperation Organization increases its members, the regional range will be extended to South Asia, covering 3/5 of the area of Eurasia. Its population occupies nearly a half of the world. The total GDP will exceed $14.5 trillion, accounting for 1/5 of the total value. This develops the more important role of promoting regional stability and development. Secondly, it contributes to opening the connective new pattern. After adding India and Pakistan, Shanghai Cooperation Organization is more than the important platform of economic belt construction in Land Silk Road. What's more, it is connected with ocean Silk Road to develop Asian and European markets. We will implement the network infrastructure construction projects of energy, communication and transportation with every party, promote transportation logistics project with regional influential, and forge the convenient and high-efficient regional interconnection network. Thirdly, new functions are increased in the regional economic cooperation. India and Pakistan are one of the WTO member states. As the emerging economy, India has the faster economic growth, and industries like information technology and medicine also bring the new blood and power to regional economic cooperation. Chinese party hopes to further reinforce communication, expand consensus, positively promotes trade investment convenience, promotes cooperation between e-commerce and SMEs, and improves regional economic cooperative level in the framework of Shanghai Cooperation Organization.President Xi Jinping visited KZ and attended the Astana Summit and further to further pooled together the consensuses of all countries. Looking forward into the future, it is just the good time to realize the overall economic cooperative development in Shanghai Cooperation Organization regions. After the summit, the Chinese side will take over the rotating presidency of Shanghai Cooperation Organization. The ministry of Commerce will give a full play to the meeting mechanism among the economic and trade minister of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, implement the economic and trade achievements of the summit, push for more practical achievements in economic cooperation of Shanghai Cooperation organization and further create benefits for regional people.Load-Date: June 30, 2017End of Document

China Takes a Bite Out of Apple; Foreign Tech Companies FretRealMoneyApril 24, 2017 Monday 10:00 AM EDTCopyright 2017 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1119 wordsByline: Alex McMillanHighlight: China's online watchdog wants to ask Apple a few questions about its apps and live streaming. It's the latest cause for alarm in Silicon Valley.BodyApple faces an ominous grilling at the hands of Chinese authorities over how it tracks and manages online content, particularly of live streaming. It's the latest company to brush up against restrictions on how technology companies function in China. Silicon Valley is increasingly vocal about criticizing these operating rules as anti-competitive.Apple, a holding of the Action Alerts PLUS  charity portfolio that Jim Cramer co-manages, is "next on a list for inquiries" in an expanding crackdown,            according to Xinhua , China's official news service. Chinese authorities will summon the company to urge it to tighten up checks on software applications available in the Apple Store. Xinhua didn't say when the company would be answering the Chinese government's questions. But falling foul of the rules could lead not only to administrative penalties, but also to police inquiries and criminal punishment, according to Xinhua.The Cyberspace Administration of China, the country's Internet watchdog, says it has already punished three Web sites -- the news service Toutiao.com, game site Huoshanzhibo.com and entertainment portal Huajiao.com -- for violating regulations over tracking online users, the content of live streaming and online performances. It is also interested in how the companies handle tip-offs.Regulators found "significant loopholes" about how those three sites manage users and data. That has led to "forbidden" live content going out on Internet platforms. Xinhua said officials have already met with Apple representatives to examine live-streaming apps released by the App Store.The administration was joined by the Beijing Public Security Bureau and the Beijing Cultural Market Administrative Law Enforcement Team in bringing its case against the Chinese sites.Apple has declined to comment in China. The investigation is part of Beijing's increasingly futile attempts to corral the Wild West of the Internet.The services of Alphabet subsidiary Google , Facebook and Twitter have been blocked in China for quite some time. Apple is granted considerably more freedom, but its iBooks Store and iTunes Movies have been shut down in China, six months after they started.Chinese authorities are now turning their attention to apps and require app stores to register with the government. The proliferation of third-party and mobile content on Web sites and smartphones presents a massive headache for Internet regulators.Any action against Apple would pose a problem at a time when U.S.-China trade ties are particularly unsettled under President Donald Trump. They would likely also hurt the prospects of Chinese tech companies attempting to expand into the United States.Alibaba Group Holding would be one of the key beneficiaries if China-U.S. relations prove better than expected as Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump get to know one another. It could possibly gain entry to the U.S. market, Nomura analyst Jialong Shi notes. This would also help U.S. small business looking to sell into China on Taobao and T-mall, the company's online-sales platforms.Trump has ordered a comprehensive study of "trade abuse" that contributes to the country's trade deficits, a report due on June 28. Though Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the  , Trump announced the study less than a week before his first summit with Xi.One of the questions that the study, which is to shape Trump's approach on trade, will consider is the seriousness of intellectual property theft. It will also address the issue of "forced technology transfers", in which foreign partners are compelled to transfer technology to local Chinese partners.That's one of the issues at stake with computer companies operating in China. In late March, a group of U.S. lawmakers sent a letter to the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, complaining that China's current and drafted restrictions on cloud computing would force U.S. companies to supply intellectual property to Chinese partners.China's existing and proposed rules would effectively bar foreign cloud-computing providers "from operating or competing fairly in China," the letter said, adding that China's restrictions are "fundamentally protectionist and anti-competitive."Many of the lawmakers come from states where Amazon and Microsoft , two of the giants in cloud computing, have operations, .Companies may be jockeying behind the scenes for political clout, but few are willing to come forward publicly. This is something then-President Barack Obama criticized in 2015. Microsoft declined to comment on the most-recent letter, while Amazon didn't respond.Companies may not be willing to go on the record in criticizing China's trade policies, but they are increasingly wary."The enthusiasm is gone," James McGregor, chairman of greater China for the consulting company APCO Worldwide, told the Times. "Foreign businesses here used to be very excited about China and quite enthusiastic. Now, it's kind of a grind and a battle."In the past, companies and trade groups have pushed for better U.S.-China trade links and relations. But that stance is shifting. Many remained silent as Trump criticized China as a thief and rapist on the campaign trail, and remain silent now he is feeling his way towards a trade policy while in office.After his summit with Xi, Trump promised better trade terms for Chinese companies in a variety of industries in exchange for help handling North Korea."I explained to the President of China that a trade deal with the U.S. will be far better for them if they solve the North Korean problem!" Trump said in a message on Twitter days after meeting Xi earlier this month at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla.But the approach of linking politics with business has drawn fire from William Zarit, the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. He told reporters at a press conference in Beijing that it would be a "shame" for the United States to concede on trade instead of pushing to level the playing field.China forces foreign cloud computing companies into a junior position in a joint venture that must include a local partner. Tech companies also fret over rules such as the cybersecurity law passed in China in November, requiring them to store data within China's borders if the data are to be used there.Similar security concerns led to a proposed requirement that tech companies hand over encryption keys and other technology to Chinese partners, although that stipulation ended up being scrapped. There's also a regulation now in draft form that would require online operators to "terminate the transmission of" and report any information posted that "violates relevant Chinese laws and regulations."Load-Date: April 25, 2017End of Document

The tragedy of Liu Xiaobo is another victory for ChinaCNN.comJuly 14, 2017 Friday 10:23 AM ESTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: OPINIONSLength: 475 wordsByline: By Antony DapiranBodyIf you'd been surfing the Chinese Internet Friday, you might have read about Chinese President Xi Jinping extolling the virtues of free trade in his Thursday meeting with the Canadian Governor-General.You might also have read about the bride in the coastal city of Qingdao who drove a bus to her own wedding. And you would surely have seen at least a handful of funny panda videos.What you would not have read about is the death in Chinese custody of Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo.The Chinese government long ago won its battle for complete control of information in China, turning the Chinese internet into a "walled garden," with all the news deemed fit to print by the Communist Party, and nothing more.It is this victory that renders the Chinese government's treatment of Liu Xiaobo tragically redundant.Liu need never have been imprisoned, or could long ago have been paroled on medical grounds, and the vast bulk of the Chinese population would never have heard of him, much less read any of his writings. The Party had already won. In this context, the brazenness of Liu's imprisonment appears even more chilling.Logging onto the web in China over the last nine years since Liu's imprisonment, you also would not have seen any reports of strong and persistent calls by global leaders for China to free their most prominent prisoner of conscience. But then you would not have seen such reports outside of China either -- because it did not happen.Since the financial crisis of 2008, China has grown in economic power and diplomatic self-confidence, while the West has been consumed in a vortex of its own internal squabbles and anxieties. Western countries have spent the years, fretting over the immigration and extremism resulting from almost two decades of constant warfare, and split by social and political division to a degree not seen in perhaps half a century. All of this anxiety manifested itself in such events as President Trump's election and the Brexit decision.To say the West has ceded global leadership suggests that there is a country to which it has ceded it. China, for its part, pretends to have taken that role, speaking out on issues such as climate change and free trade.But every time China looks like it might be succeeding in taking its place on the world stage as a mature and confident global player, some internal issue -- such as its treatment of Liu, or the government's ongoing campaign against civil rights lawyers, or the extra-territorial abductions -- will demonstrate just how unprepared, and how insecure, China's leaders are.It will be of some comfort to Beijing that, despite the expressions of grief and outrage at Liu's passing, they will as usual be able to ride out this news cycle until the world's attention moves on.Another week, another meeting with a world leader extolling the virtues of free trade.Load-Date: July 15, 2017End of Document

Does MoneyGram sale to Chinese firm pose cyber, AML risks?americanbanker.comMay 18, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 SourceMedia, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: Vol. 1; No. 1Length: 1602 wordsByline: Kevin WackBodyDonald Trump ran for president on a message of economic nationalism that included a promise to protect America against cyberattacks from China.His campaign website declared: "China's cyber lawlessness threatens our prosperity, privacy and national security."Now, the Trump administration faces the choice of either approving a large Chinese company's bid to acquire a prominent U.S.-based money transmitter, or nixing the deal on national security grounds.The fate of the proposed acquisition will serve as an early indicator of how far Trump is willing to go to deliver on his "America First" campaign rhetoric. And it will likely be read as a signal as to whether Chinese investment is still welcome in the U.S. financial services sector.Under the pending deal, Ant Financial would pay $1.2 billion in cash to acquire Dallas-based MoneyGram International, a money transfer firm that operates in roughly 200 countries. Ant Financial is an affiliate of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group.The purchase, announced on Jan. 26, is currently under review by an interagency group led by the Treasury Department, which determines whether proposed foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies represent a threat to the nation's security.The process - conducted by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, also known as CFIUS - is something of a black box. But several observers said that the review is likely to include a close examination of issues related to data security and anti-money-laundering efforts.The proposed acquisition has drawn fire from an assortment of parties, including conservative groups that are wary of China, some Republicans and Democrats in Congress, and a Kansas-based company that has made its own offer to buy MoneyGram.The deal's opponents argue that a Chinese firm cannot be trusted to safeguard the kind of sensitive personal information that MoneyGram collects from its U.S. customers. Money transmitters gather names, addresses and other private information about their customers in order to comply with regulations aimed at preventing money laundering and terrorist financing.In a March 10 letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a coalition of conservative groups that are opposed to the acquisition, including Tea Party Nation, referenced suspicions that Chinese hackers were behind cyberattacks against the Office of Personnel Management and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in recent years."These activities are sadly consistent with China's international ambitions, its disdain for the rule of law, and its permissive views on theft of American intellectual property and violation of consumer privacy," the groups wrote.Ant Financial dismisses some of the arguments made by the deal's opponents as misinformation. For example, Reps. Chris Smith, R-N.J., and Robert Pittenger, R-N.C., wrotein a Wall Street Journal op-edthat the Chinese government owns a roughly 15% stake in Ant Financial, but the company calls such characterizations misleading.While Ant Financial's shareholders include a handful of funds that are state-owned or state-affiliated, they are noncontrolling, passive investors and do not have any participation in the firm's management or board, the company stated."We're a private-sector company in China," said Douglas Feagin, senior vice president and head of international operations at Ant Financial. "We're in no way an arm of the Chinese government or being used that way."But the objections raised by the deal's opponents go beyond the company's ownership structure.Critics are also raising questions about the willingness of a Chinese firm to cooperate fully with U.S. authorities in efforts to crack down on money laundering, and about the amount of influence the Chinese government wields over private-sector companies."Some have concerns that this would give the Chinese government access to a huge new pool of data," said James Andrew Lewis, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic & International Studies in Washington. "The general concern is that if the Chinese government asked, it would be hard for Alibaba to say no."One hypothetical scenario imagined by the deal's opponents involves malicious actors in China retrieving data on U.S. military personnel who use money transfer services, in order to determine their physical locations and their personal networks, and identifying their vulnerabilities for coercion.In September 2015, U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping reached an agreement that bars the cybertheft of intellectual property for economic advantage. Since then, Chinese cyberattacks on U.S. targets have decreased, though certain types of attacks continue, according to the cybersecurity firm FireEye."Definitely there's been a trend upward in terms of targeting personally identifiable information," said Christopher Porter, who manages a FireEye team that forecasts emerging risks.Ant Financial contends that the critics' fears are unfounded. "We view the protection of customer information as absolutely critical," Feagin said.On Tuesday, MoneyGram's shareholders approved Ant Financial's offer. MoneyGram CEO Alex Holmes said in a recent interview that his company takes numerous steps to protect its customers' personal information. "None of those can change simply because the ownership of the company changes," he added.The Treasury-led review process is supposed to focus exclusively on national security considerations, but the deal's opponents are injecting a separate, protectionist argument into the mix.They make the case that the Chinese government would never allow an American company to make the same type of acquisition in China, and say that the U.S. government should draw a similar line in the sand.Michael Brown is the CEO of Euronet Worldwide, a Leawood, Kan., company that operates the Ria Money Transfer business. In March, Euronet made its own offer to buy MoneyGram, but MoneyGram rejected it. Now Brown is trying to convince the U.S. government to block the Ant Financial deal.He said that Euronet was operating ATMs with China Postal Savings Bank roughly a decade ago, but that relationship withered as the Chinese government's concerns about foreign-owned companies grew. Given that history, he questioned why the U.S. government is even considering allowing a Chinese firm to buy a U.S.-based money transmitter."That would say the Chinese are either a whole lot smarter than us, or we're a whole lot dumber than them," Brown said.At a congressional hearing on Tuesday, Trump's nominee for assistant Treasury secretary for international markets and development, Heath Tarbert, declined to comment on the Ant Financial-MoneyGram deal.But he noted that under current law, the Treasury-led review process is only allowed to consider national security issues. "If confirmed, I would use all available resources to ensure that there are no unresolved national security concerns," said Tarbert, a bank regulatory lawyer at Allen & Overy.The government's review of the Ant Financial deal has already been underway for months. There are currently vacancies in a number of key positions at various participating government agencies, said Anne Salladin, a former Treasury official."I would say that right now is kind of a period of transition," said Salladin, a lawyer at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan.The Treasury-led review group has the authority to recommend that the president block a specific merger. In practice, the companies involved will typically scuttle the deal if they learn that such a recommendation is coming.As a presidential candidate, Trump often railed against China for both cyberattacks and what he described as unfair trade practices. He recently delivered a win for U.S. payment card networks by negotiating a deal that givesfirms such as Visa and Mastercard access to the Chinese market.But Trump's tone on China has softened considerably since taking office. He has stopped calling the country a currency manipulator, and he no longer talks about imposing stiff tariffs on Chinese imports.He has also staffed his administration with various bankers and corporate lawyers who have benefited from globalization. Keith Noreika, a lawyer at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett until he was named acting comptroller of the currency in early May, recently represented Ant Financial in its efforts to buy MoneyGram. (The OCC is not part of the interagency committee that reviews foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies.)In addition, Trump has developed a relationship with the billionaire Jack Ma, the founder and executive chairman of Alibaba Group.The two men met at Trump Tower on Jan. 9.Afterward, Trump called it a "great meeting" and described Ma as a "great entrepreneur."During the Obama administration, U.S. officials took steps toward opening the American financial services market to more investment from China.In 2012, the Federal Reserve Boardapproved a Chinese bank's applicationto buy a majority stake in a U.S. depository institution, which gave other Chinese banks a blueprint for how to enter the American market.The Fed's decision did not lead to a flood of similar deals, but for reasons that largely involve market conditions, according to Walter Mix, who heads the financial services practices at Berkeley Research Group.Last year, Ant Financial won the U.S. government's approval for its purchase of Kansas City, Mo.-based EyeVerify, which had developed technology for authenticating users of mobile apps. And in December, the Treasury-led review panelapproved the sale of the Chicago Stock Exchangeto Chinese investors.http://www.americanbanker.com/news/does-moneygram-sale-to-chinese-firm-pose-cyber-aml-risksLoad-Date: May 19, 2017End of Document

PROTESTS CONTINUE IN KAZAKHSTAN OVER CHINA'S TREATMENT OF KAZAKHSStates News ServiceJuly 6, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 747 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Amid growing cross-border tensions over a dispute over Chinese restrictions on the free movement of Kazakhs to neighboring Kazakhstan, an elderly Kazakh mother has made an emotional plea to the country's president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, to put pressure on Beijing to release her son, an ethnic minority Kazakh actor in the northwestern region of Xinjiang.Kazakhstan citizen Sabila Tacassi, mother of Zhenishan Baghdap, 50, made the plea in a video after he was taken away from his home by Chinese police in Xinjiang's regional capital Urumqi on May 2."I have been a Kazakh citizen for many years now, after emigrating from China in response to the President's call," she said. "I am a mother of seven, and became a Kazakh citizen in 2002.""I have also won a Glorious Mother award from the government, as well as government subsidies, which, combined with my pension, mean that I live a comfortable life," she said.The Chinese government in the mid-20th century issued Glorious Mother awards to women who gave birth to more than five children in recognition for their contribution to boosting the country's population so as to fortify it against Western imperialism."But now, I have suddenly discovered that my son Zhenishan Baghdap has been detained in China," she said.Baghdap, a Kazakh voice actor and movie translator with family in Kazakhstan, may have been detained for posts made to social media, sources in the region told RFA on Thursday."This was a fairly high-powered guy, and quite a famous character," an anonymous source said. "He had previously worked in the Kazakh section of Xinjiang TV, and he was a famous voice actor who had also translated a lot of movies.""The reason they detained him was probably because of something he did or said online," the source said. "But the authorities don't need a reason to detain people anymore."Growing anger among KazakhsBaghdap's detention comes amid growing anger among Kazakhs with relatives in China over the Chinese Communist Party's apparent crackdown on the minority ethnic group within its borders.Last month, a group of state scientists and other scholars hit out at the "persecution" of ethnic Kazakhs by Chinese authorities, and called on Astana to put pressure on Beijing.Meanwhile, sources said two other people, a Kazakh named as Kalyhar and a member of China's Uzbek minority identified by the single name Rustum, were detained at the same time.Kalyhar was detained at Xinjiang's Baktu border crossing on his way to Kazakhstan, a second source said."He had already bought a house in Almaty, and then gone back [to Xinjiang]," the source said. "Then he sold his house in [Xinjiang's] Tacheng, and was on his way back again.""He was detained at the Baktu border crossing, carrying a huge amount of cash, and they wanted to know why he was taking so much money out of the country. He was a former cop in Tacheng, but they detained him anyway."Rustum, meanwhile, was a devout Muslim youth with an elderly mother to care for, the source said."He said his prayers every day like an ordinary Muslim, and was detained," he said.Passport, resident permit confiscationsResidents of Kazakhstan have complained they are being prevented from seeing their families after Chinese authorities began confiscating the passports and residence permits of ethnic minority Kazakhs whose family members live across the border.Some 200,000 Kazakhs who hold Chinese passports and permanent residence cards for Kazakhstan were told to hand in their Kazakhstan-issued residency cards to Chinese police "for safekeeping," although sources later said officials in some parts of Xinjiang were rapidly backpedaling on the policy and working round the clock to send Kazakh green cards and passports back to their owners.In a related development, Chinese police recently issued warrants for the arrest of some 200 Chinese nationals who follow prominent Kazakhstan blogger and podcaster Jarkan 7 on social media, sources in Kazakhstan told RFA this week."Some of them had been downloading Jarkan 7's podcasts or retweeting them, so now 200 Kazakhs are on the secret watch list [of the Xinjiang police], including me," the source said."I'm not afraid, because I am a Kazakh citizen, so they can't touch me or hurt me, but they have gone to visit my family, my parents a number of times," the source said.Reported by Qiao Long for RFA's Mandarin Service.

View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170421005374/en/Ammar Al Malik, Executive Director, and Faisal Hammoud, Director of Business Development, from Dubai Internet City at the China Shanghai International Technology Fair, representing Dubai and discussing business and collaboration opportunities with the technology community of China. (Photo: ME NewsWire)The week-long visit, scheduled from 19 to 26 April 2017, aims to highlight how Chinese companies can benefit from the integrated technology ecosystem that DIC offers. The trip comes at a time when a key focus for the Chinese government is the Internet Plus Plan. A new driving force for economic development, the plan looks at transforming China into a digital economy by integrating digital technologies with modern manufacturing and encouraging technology companies in China to increase their global presence.According to the 'Dubai FDI Monitor', the majority of investments into Dubai in 2015 were in the medium- to high-tech industries. This trend is supported by an increasing number of Chinese technology companies which are operating in DIC already, such as China Telecom Global Middle East and Africa, Union Pay and Huawei, which is driving innovation through its dedicated 'Huawei Innovation Centre' and playing a major role in Dubai's Smart City programme.Commenting on the huge potential of international collaboration, Ammar Al Malik, Executive Director Dubai Internet City, said: "China is a very important market and valued partner of the UAE.

China controls information about ailing Nobel Prize laureateAssociated Press InternationalJuly 12, 2017 Wednesday 2:39 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 1027 wordsByline: By GERRY SHIH, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - As China's government faces mounting international pressure to grant imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo his wish to leave the country for treatment of advanced liver cancer, it's fighting back with a familiar strategy: information control.From coordinated leaks of hospital surveillance video to a near-total news blackout for Chinese-language media and social media, the Chinese government's sprawling propaganda apparatus has revved up efforts to contain the controversy surrounding its most prominent political dissident.In an update Tuesday afternoon, the hospital treating Liu said he remains in critical condition and is now on dialysis and organ support.Liu was convicted in 2009 of inciting subversion for his role in the "Charter 08" movement calling for political reform. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize a year later while in prison.Chinese media have hardly mentioned repeated calls by the U.S., the European Union and others for Beijing to let Liu leave on humanitarian grounds. On Tuesday, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert again urged China to parole Liu so he can receive medical care at a location of his choosing.Chinese state media have provided extensive coverage this past week of President Xi Jinping's recent achievements, especially his travels to Russia and Germany, which they portrayed as a massive public relations triumph for China.On Tuesday, state newspapers including the official People's Daily and the English-language China Daily trumpeted Xi's call to "unswervingly advance" China's judicial reform and improve the military. Meanwhile, the daily barrage of questions about Liu fired off by the international press at foreign ministry news briefings has been excised from the ministry's published transcripts, as if they were never asked.The few mentions of Liu in the state media's overseas-oriented English editions in recent weeks contained denouncements and tough language aimed at foreign audiences."It is probably out of politics that some people and forces are requesting Liu to be treated abroad," the nationalistic Global Times tabloid, published by the People's Daily, said in an editorial Tuesday headlined "Liu's cancer treatment mustn't be politicized.""Today's China is stronger and more confident, and will not yield to Western pressure," it said, accusing unidentified overseas forces of "squeezing Liu for their political goals."Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang reiterated on Tuesday that China hopes other countries can "respect China's judicial sovereignty and not use such an individual case to interfere in China's domestic affairs."The response is a reflection of the party's fear of showing weakness "either at home or abroad," said Andrew Nathan, an expert on Chinese history and politics at Columbia University.Any sign of giving way "would only encourage domestic enemies and foreign critics," Nathan said, adding, "Been tough up to now, better continue being tough to the end."A more subtle effort to shape the narrative came this week when a video from Liu's hospital room emerged just as the government was saying that he was too sick to be transported abroad and was already receiving world-class treatment in China.Surveillance video from Saturday leaked to English-language Chinese state media showed two foreign doctors at Liu's bedside telling his wife, Liu Xia, that the medical team assembled by China's government was doing its "utmost" for her husband.However, in a subsequent statement that was ignored by Chinese media, the German and American doctors said Liu was capable of traveling abroad, and the German Embassy in Beijing lashed out at China for "selectively leaking" the video to state media in a breach of doctor-patient confidentiality."It seems that security organs are steering the process, not medical experts," the embassy said. "This behavior undermines trust in the authorities dealing with Mr. Liu's case, which is vital to ensure maximum success of his medical treatment."The hospital video leak followed a familiar pattern.After Liu's diagnosis was made public in June, a jailhouse video montage quickly found its way onto YouTube that showed him playing badminton with a prison guard, chatting with his wife during a visit and sitting for a teeth cleaning - all intended to show a decent quality of life behind bars at Jinzhou Prison. At one point, he was shown remarking about the "great care" that prison authorities have shown for his health.Watson Meng, who runs the overseas Chinese-language media site Boxun that reposted the video, told The Associated Press that he believed it must have been released by the authorities as part of their propaganda campaign.Outside of official channels, unauthorized discussion of Liu has been swiftly punished. A police document that surfaced on the Internet this week described how a 38-year-old man in central Hunan province had been detained for seven days for discussing Liu's situation on WeChat, a social media messaging app.Local police in the city, Zhangjiajie, said they could not respond to questions about the case and referred inquiries to the provincial propaganda and foreign affairs offices, which did not respond to queries.News searches for Liu's name on Baidu, China's largest internet search engine, have turned up no hits since February. Searches on WeChat also turn up empty.Many supporters of political reform inside China have instead taken to Twitter, which is inaccessible in China without special software, to circumvent government censors. Bao Tong, a 85-year-old former top Communist Party official who has been under house arrest for decades, began learning to tweet this week because he has been forbidden from giving media interviews or publishing articles about Liu, according to his son, Bao Pu."China's state-run media ... won't even report relevant information," the elder Bao fumed in one tweet. In another, he commemorated Liu's calls for freedom, referring to the first line of China's national anthem, "Rise up, all those who don't want to be slaves."___Associated Press writer Josh Lederman in Washington contributed to this report.Load-Date: July 12, 2017End of Document

VIDEO: KEY MOMENTS FROM CECC HEARING "WILL THE HONG KONG MODEL SURVIVE?: AN ASSESSMENT 20 YEARS AFTER THE HANDOVER"States News ServiceMay 4, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 1619 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Congressional-Executive Commission on China:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), chairman of the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), chaired a hearing on Hong Kong this week examining the long-term prospects for human rights and basic freedoms in Hong Kong as well as challenges to preserving its promised "high degree of autonomy." Witnesses also provided the Commissioners policy options for consideration in light of the Chinese government's continued interventions in Hong Kong's political affairs and courts.Witnesses included Umbrella Movement leader Joshua Wong, veteran democracy advocate and founding Chairman of the Democratic Party of Hong Kong Martin Lee, former British Governor of Hong Kong Chris Patten, abducted bookseller Lam Wing Kee, and writer Ellen Bork. CECC Cochair Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ) attended the hearing along with CECC Commissioners Senator Steve Daines (R-MT), Senator Angus King (I-ME), and Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR).The witnesses, speaking from their own experiences, stressed the importance of maintaining Hong Kong's freedoms and autonomy both as an American interest and an international interest, given China's promises under the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration. The witnesses also urged the U.S. to take more decisive action to counter the Chinese government's efforts to erode Hong Kong's democratic freedoms and the rule of law. Additionally, the witnesses supported passage of the bipartisan Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act (S. 417), which would establish punitive measures against government officials in Hong Kong or mainland China who are responsible for suppressing basic freedoms in Hong Kong, especially in connection with the abduction of certain booksellers.Partial transcripts and links to videos of some of the hearing's key moments are below. Witness testimonies can be found on the CECC's website. See also the opening statements of the Chairs, Senator Rubio and Congressman Smith. The hearing webcast is archived and can be viewed via an integrated Video Player (enable Adobe Flash player) or on the CECC's YouTube page.VIDEO: Rubio says Hong Kong cannot be allowed to go the way of China's "failed authoritarianism""Despite a multitude of challenges, Hong Kong's future, indeed its destiny, should not be sidelined. China's assault on democratic institutions and human rights is of central importance to the people of Hong Kong and to its status as a free market economic powerhouse and hub for international trade and investment. We cannot allow Hong Kong to go the way of Beijing's failed authoritarianism and one-party rule."VIDEO: Smith says maintaining Hong Kong's freedoms a critical U.S. interest"Mainland China has become more repressive, not less...Some have argued that the best course of action is to retreat into a hard realism, recognize China's interests and spheres of influence and protect U.S. interests. We should ignore what is happening in Hong Kong and shift responsibility to the British or some undefined international body. I strongly disagree. We do not need a new realism to govern our China policy. Instead, we need a new idealisma renewed commitment to democratic ideals, to human rights, and the rule of law in ways that compete directly with the Chinese model in Asia and Africa and elsewhere."VIDEO: Chris Patten says that British government should not "let down" Joshua Wong's generation"The British Government has not always been...very robust in drawing attention to breaches whether large or small of the undertakings of both the letter and the spirit made by China [in the Sino-British Declaration of 1984] and I regret that...I just hope we will speak out more loudly over the coming months and years...I hope that we don't let down Joshua Wong's generation...because I think the most exciting and important thing to have happened is that there remains in Hong Kong a sense of citizenship in a free society which is exemplified by the brave way Joshua and his colleagues have behaved."VIDEO: Joshua Wong urges bipartisan U.S. support for Hong Kong and says democracy will eventually come to Hong Kong because "time is on our side.""Hong Kong is home to around 85,000 U.S. citizens and 1,400 U.S. companies. Two-way U.S.-Hong Kong trade was around $42 billion last year. Most American media outlets, including CNN, the Wall Street Journal, and TIME Magazine establish their Asian offices in Hong Kong. These are all evidence that despite all the difficulties it is facing, Hong Kong remains the freest city under Chinese administration. I hope Democrats and Republicans alike can work together to defend the fundamental human rights values they share. Hong Kongers will continue to fight hard against the Communist regime for the day will come for us with democracy and the exercise our right of self-determination."I started my fight for democracy six years ago when I was 14. The father of Hong Kong's democracy, Martin Lee, is turning 79 years old this year, after four decades of struggle. I wonder, if I come to the age of 79, will I be able to see democracy? Our generation's challenge is to ensure that Hong Kong continues as a beacon of human right and freedom for China and the world. To sum up, today an authoritarian regime is dominating our future, but the day will come when we decide the future of Hong Kong. No matter what happens to the protest movement, we will reclaim the democracy that belongs to us, because time is on our side."VIDEO: Rubio asks Joshua Wong what "self-determination for Hong Kong means?""Self-determination for Hong Kong means that the political system, political status, and future constitutional arrangement of Hong Kong should be decided by Hong Kong people. According to the Sino-British Joint Declaration it proved that Hong Kong can implement one-country two systems from 1997 to 2047 under the fifty years unchanged policy framework. After 2047 I will be 51 years old. At that moment I'm not sure whether Hong Kong will turn to be, one country, one and half system, or worst case, one country, one system. And what we hope is to let people to realize is that it's time for Hong Kong people to rule Hong Kong. It is time for Hong Kong people to determine their own future."VIDEO: Martin Lee says Hong Kong's rule of law threatened"In a way Hong Kong has been a miracle because it is a tiny dot at the coast of China, and yet, even today, according to Lord Patten, with whom I agree, there is still the rule of law which separates Hong Kong from every other Chinese city. But that rule of law is now under threat, more now than ever before."VIDEO: Senator Rubio warns authorities about any retribution against bookseller Lam Wing Kee for his testimony"I just want to be very clear, after your appearance here today our view is that if any hostility comes your way...we will directly attribute that to your appearance here today and your willingness to speak truth before this Commission...I believe [this] should have a direct impact on the way we interact with the Chinese communist Party and their government. If in fact there is retribution sought against you for your appearance and your testimony here today we will take it as a deep personal affront to the Members of this body."VIDEO: Martin Lee says Hong Kong autonomy is America's "business""I think the [U.S. State Department] reports are important and I am happy that they will be continued because they will then give members of the Congress a clear picture as to what is happening in Hong Kong. Now of course the Chinese government will say, 'mind your own business,' but don't be deterred by that Mr. Chairman because you must remember that when the Sino-British Joint Declaration was first announced on the 26th of September 1984, the U.S. government strongly supported it--even though it was 'none of your business,' to use the same language again. It was a treaty between the British government and the Chinese government, but both governments actually worked very hard lobbying for international support. So your government was lobbied hard and gave its support so that gives your government every justification to say, 'well you wanted our support, we still support one country, two systems, and if it is not working well because of your fault, why should we not be allowed to comment on it and ask you to deliver what you already promised?'"VIDEO: Ellen Bork says Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act (S. 417) will "completely change outlook" of U.S. policy"I think the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act is major because it will completely change the outlook toward Hong Kong policy which has been to let things move along, let China see the value of Hong Kong staying the way it is...I don't think the Communist Party really can quite do that, certainly not without being encouraged to do so by the world's most powerful democracy. I wouldn't in any way underestimate the importance of the addition of sanctions for [Chinese] misbehavior in Hong Kong, it is huge."VIDEO: Rubio Says Human Rights Must Remain a Key Pillar of U.S. National Security"Our hope is to continue to highlight human rights as a key pillar of our national security and foreign policy...the more a country oppresses its own people, the more likely they are to create chaos and havoc and uncertainty everywhere else in the world. Meanwhile, for the most part, free people who choose their own leaders and have economic freedomdon't have time for wars...The more of a role people have in choosing their own leaders and the direction of their nations, the less likely those nations are to wage war against their neighbors and destabilize the world."Load-Date: May 7, 2017End of Document

Chinese fugitive billionaire vows to expose corrupt officialsUPIApril 24, 2017 Monday 3:19 PM ESTCopyright 2017 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 320 wordsByline: ELIZABETH SHIMDateline: Dec. 31 BodyA Chinese billionaire fugitive has vowed to expose corruption among top Chinese Communist Party officials, but his moves are being met with a stern response from Beijing.Guo Wengui, a member of U.S. President 's Mar-a-Lago resort, recently accused a Chinese airlines owner of buying off politicians while purchasing the largest tract of land in Hong Kong in 2016.He posted on Twitter on Sunday that he plans to hold a press conference that will expose the "truth behind the anti-corruption" drive in China that began in 2013, South Korean magazine Chosun Biz reported.Guo mentioned the names of top Chinese officials: , a senior leader of the Communist Party; Meng Jianzhu, a Politburo member; Fu Zhenghua, public security vice minister; and a fourth official, Sun Lijun.China's Hurun Research Institute places Guo's net worth at about $2.2 billion. Chinese media once fawned over his ability to amass wealth through real estate development and investments.Guo's troubles began when reports in China suggested he had been using illegal means to throw business rivals in prison.In recent weeks, following Chinese President 's state visit to the United States, Guo has become increasingly vocal about corruption among Chinese officials.But Beijing may have retaliated against the Chinese billionaire.China's foreign ministry cut short Guo's interview with Voice of America last week, and Interpol recently issued a red notice for Guo's arrest, possibly following a request from the Chinese government.The fugitive also claimed Facebook had blocked his public account."What does this mean, Facebook blocked me?" He wrote in part of the post. "They must have got really scared! Can this stop my revelations? This is truly lawless. This is very interesting. Their fear and worry make me think that the value of my various evidence is bigger than what I had imagined."Facebook is seeking to gain greater market presence in China.Load-Date: April 25, 2017End of Document

China rappers to Seoul: 'Big brother' opposes missile shieldAssociated Press InternationalMay 17, 2017 Wednesday 11:20 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 611 wordsByline: By MATTHEW BROWN, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - A rap group backed by China's government is warning South Korea in a music video that "you're going too far" with the deployment of a U.S. missile defense system, as Beijing seeks to bring its state-supported cultural forces to bear in the international dispute.A member of the group CD REV said government officials worked with them on the video and helped to promote it on foreign websites, many of which are blocked in China by official censors emboldened by the ruling Communist Party's warnings against foreign "cultural infiltration."In the song, group members chant that "about THAAD we say no, no, no," a reference to the U.S. Army's missile defense system formally known as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense.Later in the song, they refer to South Korea, saying, "this time, kid, you're going too far" and "your big brother's annoyed," a nod to China's view of itself as the pre-eminent political and economic power in northeast Asia.Beijing vehemently opposes the missile shield, saying its powerful radar will allow it to monitor missile launches, aircraft flights and other sensitive activities in northeastern China. South Korea and the U.S. say it is necessary to guard against North Korea's missile and nuclear weapons activities that threaten South Korea, Japan, U.S. territories and possibly even the continental United States.CD REV's Wang Zixin told The Associated Press that the group hopes to rally Chinese worldwide against the deployment of THAAD and demonstrate China's "tough stance" on the issue."We would see government reports and comments, but at the same time, we see the whole event from the position of Chinese," Wang said.In the video, the group also takes shots at what Wang referred to as "vulgar behavior" within China, such as vandalism against South Korean-made Hyundai vehicles.The video - viewed by Wednesday more than 300,000 times on Facebook and Twitter and almost 2.7 million times on the Chinese video-posting site Maiopai - represents the latest example of China's use of non-diplomatic channels to broadcast its displeasure with South Korea.Last year, there were reports that China had stopped giving approval to performers of Korean pop music, or "K-pop," to play shows in China, on the heels of Seoul signing the agreement to host THAAD. In March, South Korean officials voiced concerns that Beijing was limiting tourism to their country as an unofficial sanction.South Korean retailer Lotte, which provided the land for the THAAD deployment, has also been boycotted by Chinese customers and seen construction halted on an amusement park it was building in northeastern China.Such moves underscore a willingness on the part of China's Communist Party leaders to fan the flames of anti-South Korea sentiment, said Korea expert Sung-Yoon Lee of Tufts University in Massachusetts."THAAD retaliation is a Chinese government-engineered project," Lee said. "It can be controlled and reversed by Beijing. ... The Chinese public has no interest in the complexities of missile defense systems."South Korea's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to questions about the song, and the video did not appear to garner much attention on the country's social media platforms.During a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping last week, South Korea's new president, Moon Jae-in, said he was aware of Chinese worries about THAAD and asked Xi to help resolve difficulties facing South Korean businesses operating in China.A special envoy representing Moon is due to visit China on Thursday for talks on THAAD and the overall bilateral relationship.___Follow Matthew Brown on Twitter at twitter.com/matthewbrownapLoad-Date: May 18, 2017End of Document

China, Pakistan investigate IS claim 2 Chinese were killedAssociated Press InternationalJune 9, 2017 Friday 11:59 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 559 wordsByline: By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - China and Pakistan said Friday they are investigating the Islamic State group's claim that two Chinese teachers abducted in Pakistan have been killed, after a video appearing to show the pair was sent to journalists.A spokesman for the government of Baluchistan province, where the two were abducted May 24, said he could confirm they were dead based on the 24-second video appearing to show the bloodied bodies of a Chinese man and woman."We condemn the gruesome murder of the Chinese pair," Anwarul Haq Kakar told The Associated Press. "We are sad and shocked."The video was sent to the phones of journalists working in Baluchistan, apparently by the Islamic State group. Pakistan government officials speaking on routine condition of anonymity said they were aware of the video but the bodies had not been found or their identities verified."According to the initial information from relevant departments of Pakistan, the two Chinese citizens kidnapped may have been unfortunately killed," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying. "We are highly concerned about that and will try our best to get more information on that through various approaches."The IS claim came hours after Pakistan's military released the pictures of what it said were 12 slain members of the militant group. They were killed in an operation this week in Baluchistan, where the military said it foiled an attempt to set up an organized IS militant base.Hua said that after learning the two were missing, the Chinese government and diplomatic missions in Pakistan activated their emergency response mechanism and coordinated with the Pakistani side to "rescue them with our upmost efforts."Hua gave no details about the two, other than that they were not a couple and came from different provinces in China.The two teachers at a private language school were kidnapped by gunmen dressed as police who stopped their car in Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan. A bystander who attempted to intervene was shot and wounded while rescuing a third person.A statement late Thursday from the IS news agency said the two Chinese teachers had been killed.Thousands of Chinese work in Pakistan and have sometimes been targeted by militants. China is a longtime ally of Pakistan and is building roads and power plants under a multibillion-dollar project termed the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.Islamic militants opposed to Chinese rule in the northwestern region of Xinjiang are also believed to be sheltering in Pakistan's lawless tribal areas, from which they have threatened to launch attacks.Hua said the abductions would have no effect on Chinese-Pakistani relations or plans for development projects."Pakistan always pays great attention to the protection of Chinese citizens and institutions there and has made great efforts in this regard. Since this abduction took place, China and Pakistan have been in close communication," Hua said.She praised Pakistan for "sparing no effort to investigate the incident and search and rescue the hostages."Kadar, the Baluchistan government spokesman, said security forces had done their best to track and rescue the two."Those who killed the innocent Chinese pair will not go unpunished," he said.___Associated Press writers Munir Ahmed in Islamabad and Abdul Sattar in Quetta, Pakistan, contributed to this report.Load-Date: June 10, 2017End of Document

NOBEL PEACE LAUREATE LIU XIAOBO'S CONDITION WORSENS IN CHINESE HOSPITALStates News ServiceJune 30, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 926 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:The condition of jailed political prisoner Liu Xiaobo, who was recently moved to a hospital in the northeastern city of Shenyang with terminal liver cancer, was rapidly worsening on Friday, with sources reporting that the Nobel peace laureate is now too weak for a transfer to another hospital.According to overseas writer Yu Jie, Liu is receiving treatment at the No. 1 Hospital of the Shenyang Medical University, under armed police guard and constant surveillance by state security police.He said Liu is currently crying out in frequent pain, and asking for narcotics, and is suffering from a buildup of fluids in the abdominal cavity, one of the symptoms of terminal liver cancer.Another source told RFA that Liu is on liquids only, and his family is "preparing themselves mentally" for his death.On Thursday, Chinese officials told U.S., German and European Union diplomats that Liu is in too weak a state to be moved elsewhere.Meanwhile, the ruling Chinese Communist Party's propaganda officials have issued a ban on any reporting of Liu's situation."Regarding Liu Xiaobo's medical parole, do not report it, do not comment on it, and do not retweet it," a June 30 directive posted online by the U.S.-based China Digital Times website said.Anyone trying to visit Liu is subjected to a rigorous identity check, and only one relative is allowed to visit at any given time, Yu Jie said, citing his own anonymous source.Yu said healthcare workers at the hospital have also been ordered not to speak to anyone about Liu's case, and are banned from carrying mobile phones into the ward where Liu is being treated, for fear that unauthorized photos or video footage will be leaked to the outside world.The revelation by Liu's lawyer Shang Baojun that his liver cancer was already at an inoperable stage by the time of his medical parole has drawn strong criticism from the international community.Activists under surveillancePolice in Beijing have meanwhile place a number of Liu's friends and fellow activists under close surveillance and house arrest in a bid to stop further information from getting out."It's hard to say how many people are affected ... but there are a few people I knew, including Shang Baojung, Xie Xiaoling, Gao Yu, Bao Tong, among others, who have received notifications from the state security police warning them not to write or otherwise comment publicly on Liu Xiaobo," a Beijing-based activist who asked to remain anonymous said on Friday."Xie Xiaoling is now under surveillance by state security police, or some kind of coercive measures," the activist said.He said political journalist Gao Yu had received a visit from four state security police officers after she spoke out on Twitter about the treatment of Liu.Xie confirmed the report on Friday. "They told me I had been too active lately and that they were setting up a surveillance post, but we didn't let them in the apartment," she said. "They wanted to confirm my identity ... and now there are two tall police officers standing guard outside the front door.""Other people have 'disappeared,' while others have been called in for 'a chat'," she said.Outspoken Chinese artist Ai Weiwei said the Chinese government simply doesn't tolerate dissent."Liu Xiaobo is an academic, and he became a rather moderate advocate of reforms," Ai told RFA in a recent interview. "Actually, it makes no sense to put people like him in jail. There is no basis in law ... and it goes against China's own constitution.""There are people calling for his release because he is a Nobel Prize winner or because he is sick, but ... he should never have been locked up in the first place," Ai said."There is no democracy in China ... [and] anyone who sticks their head above the parapet will immediately be obliterated in the cruelest possible way the regime," he said.Open letter to Xi JinpingThe news of Liu's condition came as 154 Nobel Prize winners called in an open letter to Chinese president Xi Jinping to allow Liu and his wife Liu Xia to travel to the United States to seek medical treatment.The call is being repeated in a motion before the U.S. House of Representatives.But Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said on Friday that the country's treatment of Liu is its own affair."The relevant issue is an internal affair of China's. I cannot see any need to discuss this with any other country," Lu told a regular news briefing in Beijing.Unlike many high-profile dissidents before him, Liu didn't qualify for medical parole because he has never admitted to committing any crime, and friends say he is highly unlikely to have accepted any exile deals offered to him by the government.A literary critic and former professor, Liu was awarded the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize "for his long and nonviolent struggle for fundamental human rights in China" in a decision that infuriated Beijing, which says he has broken Chinese law. During the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo, Liu was represented by an empty chair.Beijing cut off trade ties with Norway in the wake of the award, although the Norwegian government said it had nothing to do with the decision. Ties were only fully resumed last December.Liu has been held since 2008 after helping to draft Charter 08, a manifesto calling for sweeping changes in China's government that was signed by thousands of supporters.Reported by Qiao Long and Zhu Dan for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Ma Lap-hak and Ho Shan for the Cantonese Service.

This company will also serve as a distribution partner, opening the door for Mylio to use the large, engaged, mobile-centric Chinese market as a test bed for continued innovation. The Mylio platform is the first internet file system over a personal mesh network platform in the world. The Mylio photo app - the first to run on the company's platform - has paved the way for additional applications that will provide a new choice for consumers who value privacy, and control over their digital files. Mylio founder and CEO David Vaskevitch, says, "The infrastructure we've built for mesh network syncing includes multi-device replication, communication, and facial recognition. It also includes an artificial intelligence (AI) system that will be foundational to a multitude of new apps. We're excited to explore these ideas with strategic, well-positioned partners, who can provide Mylio with the market scale to rapidly acid test new ideas. The size of the Chinese mainland market, we believe, will add rocket fuel to our innovations."As part of the agreement, a Mylio R&D facility will be set up in the Hengqin New Area, one of the most recent Special Economic Zones created by the Chinese government for international collaboration and innovation. This facility will be used to develop new AI and machine learning products specific to Hengqin, as well as extend the Mylio platform and app to the Chinese mainland market.Artificial Intelligence and the Rise of a New Silicon ValleyThe Chinese government has announced plans to be the world leader in AI technologies, with Hengqin as the hub -- a Sino-version of Silicon Valley. Just as China's first Special Economic Zone - Shenzhen - is known as a global center for tech manufacturing (notably for Apple), Hengqin will specialize in software, with Mylio as its first development partner.Mylio was selected because of its thought leadership, and head start in personal, distributed computing - the opposite of centralized, cloud computing. Cloud services like Office and Creative Cloud were designed for personal computers. However, while 1.3 billion people today have computers, 5.4 billion have mobile phones, each effectively a pocket supercomputer. Mylio is betting that the next chapter in computing will include simple, powerful productivity tools that work equally well on desktops and mobile devices, without the need for cloud storage - using instead a personal, secure and private mesh network, like the Mylio photo app does today. Because the AI systems used for face and object recognition on the Mylio photo app run on the device-instead of the cloud -- users also benefit from increased convenience, speed, and efficiency.As China is a mobile-native country, this strategic partnership positions Mylio on the ground floor for testing and bringing to market the very first globally-accessible, mobile-native products for creating and organizing files.The Mylio platform and photo app can be downloaded at http://www.mylio.com, through the Apple App Store, or Android Play Store. The Mylio photo app supports personal computers running OSX 10.9 or later, Windows 7 SP1 or later, iPads, iPhones and iPod Touch running iOS 7 or later, and Android tablets and phones running KitKat 4.4 or later.About MylioPrivately-held Mylio, headquartered in Bellevue, Washington, was founded in 2012 by former Microsoft CTO David Vaskevitch, to pioneer the development of private, personal mesh networks, which protect personal privacy by making an internet or cloud connection completely optional. The company's first mesh network offering is the Mylio photo app, a multi-device, peer-to-peer, platform-agnostic tool to organize, manage, and protect digital photos and other files.Media Inquiries and Requests for Interviews:Cheryl Isen  |  (425) 233-9032  |153973@email4pr.comTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ground-breaking-personal-mesh-network-startup-mylio-announces-joint-venture--rd-facility-in-china-300435808.htmlSOURCE MylioLoad-Date: April 7, 2017End of Document

Outspoken Chinese law professor, government critic, silencedAssociated Press InternationalMay 26, 2017 Friday 7:17 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 665 wordsByline: By GERRY SHIH, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - One of the Chinese government's most vocal critics is finally falling silent.He Weifang told The Associated Press Friday that he would no longer publish on social media after authorities repeatedly shut down his personal blog, his Weibo microblog and two WeChat accounts.He, a famed law professor at elite Peking University and key defender of imprisoned Chinese Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, is the latest public intellectual to throw in the towel in President Xi Jinping's China. Over the past half-decade, freedom of speech and other civil liberties have been rolled back while a radical movement devoted to the People's Republic's authoritarian founder Mao Zedong has flourished."I feel utterly helpless," He said by telephone. "It's as if I'm not allowed to make a single sound."He attracted a massive following in Chinese intellectual circles over the past decade for his prolific writings on everything from social ills to architecture, but especially for his languid but trenchant essays on rule of law and politics. By his own count, He boasted 20 million readers at his peak. When his Weibo account was frozen in March, it had roughly 1.9 million followers.Over the past five years, however, He has come under relentless attack online from defenders of the ruling Communist Party and even more extreme Maoists who've held public demonstrations denouncing He's liberal views, which are considered "rightist" on China's political spectrum. His speaking engagements dried up three years ago after the Global Times, a party-run newspaper with a leftist bent, reported critically on a lecture he delivered to retired party cadres in southern China, essentially ruling him out of the lecture circuit."In the last 40 years, freedom of speech for intellectuals has never been constricted as severely as it is now," He said. "It makes you outraged."Other prominent liberals have been systematically silenced since Xi ascended to power in 2012, ushering in a deep-seated suspicion of liberal Western values and thought. The Unirule Institute of Economics, a liberal think tank headed by the well-known, free-market economist Mao Yushi, was shuttered in January. And elderly editors at a liberal historical journal that examined Chinese history were pushed out last year."He is one of the most influential public intellectuals - a spokesman for liberalism," said Teng Biao, a visiting scholar at New York University who practiced and taught law in Beijing before leaving for the U.S. in 2014. "Scholars with an independent spirit or the courage to criticize will never have a good end."He has long been a thorn in the Communist Party's side and participated in sensitive campaigns, such as the pro-democracy manifesto movement in 2008 that resulted in a brief quasi-exile from his prestigious Beijing university. But until recently, the government has allowed him a degree of freedom to write.For years, He singled out the lack of judicial independence as a fundamental fault in China's political system. In January he took aim at China's top judge, Zhou Qiang, after Zhou dismissed an American-style separation of powers and independent courts as "mistaken Western concepts."He spoke out again months later, in March, after China passed a law forbidding the criticism of Communist Party heroes. That essay was the one that seemed to finally land him in trouble irrevocably, He said.As his decision to stop writing spread among China's intellectual and dissident circles in recent days, some have urged He to take his writing to Facebook and Twitter, two services that are inaccessible in mainland China without the use of special VPN software - but also beyond the reach of Communist Party censors.He said he has considered that option but decided against publishing on any platform that would not be accessible to the majority of Chinese readers."In my mind, whenever I have written, I have always imagined writing for the audience that lives on this land," he said.Load-Date: May 27, 2017End of Document

China International Big Data Industry Expo 2017 highlighted on giant display screens overlooking New York's Times SquarePR NewswireMay 15, 2017 Monday 10:04 PM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 432 wordsDateline: BEIJING, May 15, 2017 BodyChina International Big Data Industry Expo 2017 (Big Data Expo), a conference and exhibition focused on the role of big data in the digital economy, launched an eight-week video campaign that started on May 1, 2017, promoting the event on 12 of the huge display screens atop New York's Times Square, one of the world's business intersections. The video is scheduled to run 4,320 times during the campaign highlighting China's increasingly important role in the global economy. The campaign comes on the heels of the well-attended flash mob event that took place in the square during the Spring Festival Gala, a series of events hosted jointly by various New-York based Chinese organizations celebrating the Year of the Rooster.The Big Data Expo, a highly anticipated event, is scheduled to be held in Guiyang, the capital of Guizhou province, from the 26th to the 29th of this month.Guizhou, in western China, is one of China's most beautiful yet impoverished provinces. The Big Data Expo, along with the simultaneous roll out by Guiyang's city government of a new policy advocating and promoting the sharing of and openness around government data, is not only expected to reset the image that comes to mind when thinking of the province, but also to highlight the efforts of behalf of the Guiyang's government to embrace the new model of openness and sharing that has become dominant since the arrival of the internet, as well as to implement a supply-side economic reform that relies on big data as the engine.For the relatively closed western part of China, leveraging the latest advances in technology to not only catch up but to leapfrog ahead other regions in terms of economic development is a necessary component for the sustainability of the Chinese government's One Belt, One Road initiative, the program to strengthen economic ties with the countries across the Eurasian landmass, but also represents a core pivot to meaningfully improve the lives of ordinary people.The Big Data Expo represents a sincere invitation that the city of Guiyang and the province of Guizhou extends to the world and a bold attempt on the part of Guiyang's municipal government and other local government organizations across China to adhere to a new model of sharing and openness as well as of innovation and entrepreneurship.To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/china-international-big-data-industry-expo-2017-highlighted-on-giant-display-screens-overlooking-new-yorks-times-square-300458066.htmlSOURCE China International Big Data Industry Expo 2017CONTACT: Mr. Wen, +86-18601016806, 1851936783@qq.comLoad-Date: May 16, 2017End of Document

SPEECH BY H.E. MR. XIE FENG, CHINESE AMBASSADOR TO INDONESIA AT THE FAREWELL RECEPTION FROM CHINESE EMBASSY IN INDONESIAStates News ServiceJune 7, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 1453 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:Today is exactly the 1,100th day of my Ambassadorship to Indonesia. Exactly 3 years ago today, I presented the copy of letter of credence to the Indonesian Foreign Ministry. For 3 years, I've been learning about Indonesia, respecting all of you as my mentors and teachers. For 3 years, I've been doing my utmost to build up friendship and cooperation between our two countries.3 years later, I'm so glad to see that under the leadership of President Xi Jinping and President Joko Widodo, our bilateral relationship has grown stronger than ever.I accompanied President Jokowi on 4 trips to China, most recently in May during the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing. Our 2 presidents held their 6th bilateral meeting and reached important consensus to further synergise the "21st Century Maritime Silk Road" initiative with "Global Maritime Fulcrum" strategy and deepen cooperation in all fields, bringing new vitality to the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Indonesia.I'm so glad to see that aside from the vice-premier level dialogue mechanism for political security, our two countries initiated the high-level economic dialogue and vice-premier level people-to-people exchange mechanism, which is the first such mechanism China has built with a developing country. These three mechanisms function as a "troika" driving the comprehensive strategic partnership forward.I'm so glad to see the continuous progress on the Jakarta-Bandung High-speed Railway, the first bullet train being built in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. The joint team of China and Indonesia has shown exceptional resolve and commitment. One by one, the problems and difficulties were tackled and it has been hailed by the world as a true miracle.My colleagues and I have been deeply involved and much devoted to this project. The Jakarta-Bandung High-speed Railway has a special place in our heart. I'm sure with concerted efforts from both sides, the project will be completed and with the highest quality standard. I am looking forward to coming back as a tourist and taking a fast and comfortable ride on the new train.I am so glad to see that as China remains Indonesia's largest trading partner for 6 consecutive years, its investment ranking has risen from 9th to 3rd place. If taking into account the Chinese investment via Singapore and Hong Kong, China is Indonesia's de facto No. 1 investor.Our cooperation has grown beyond the traditional sectors of project contracting, infrastructure and mineral resources. It has expanded into such new areas as manufacturing, finance, telecommunication and e-commerce. While Chinese companies such as Huawei, ZTE, Oppo, Xiaomi and Lenovo have become household brands in Indonesia, tropical fruits, bird's nest and other Indonesian products have gained increasing popularity in the Chinese market.I am so glad to see the vigorous growth of bilateral people-to-people exchanges and greater understanding and friendship between our two peoples. After China became the largest source of foreign tourists for Indonesia in 2016, the number of Chinese visiting Indonesia this year is expected to pass 2 million. We will be able to realize the target of attracting 10 million Chinese tourists between 2014 and 2019 set forth by President Jokowi. The Chinese government scholarship was increased by over 12-fold in past 2 years. There are now over 14,000 Indonesian students studying in China, making China the foreign destination with the largest number of Indonesian students.During the past 3 years, together with Indonesian friends, we enjoyed the wonderful performances by the Chinese National Ballet in the Ciputra Theatre and China Philharmonic Orchestra in the Aula Simfonia Jakarta. Until now, I can still hear the resonating and warm applause from audience. Our embassy hosted receptions for visiting youth from both countries to share their experience and perspective. 4 days ago, Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) General Chairman professor and doctor Said and myself again visited the Luhur /luhu/ Al-Tsaqafah /al-dakafa/ Islamic boarding school to host a fast-breaking dinner with the students and offer our help to those in need. We are now still in the holy month of Ramadan, please allow me to convey to the Indonesian Muslim brothers and sisters the best Ramadan wishes from over 23 million Chinese Muslim brothers and sisters.The fast growth of relationship over the past 3 years deepened my realization that our cooperation is mutually complementary and win-win in nature. A healthy, stable and prospering relationship serves the common interests of our two peoples and contributes to peace and prosperity in the region and beyond. Any difference between us shall not diminish our mutual respect or impede cooperation and search for common ground. Because such difference is far outweighed by shared interests. I believe our relationship will grow stronger and our cooperation will deliver more tangible benefits. Both sides shall take this historical opportunity. China and Indonesia shall always remain as good neighbors, good friends and good partners.The past 1,100 days have left me with many sweet memories. From the Paradise in Bali to the Mecca Corridor in Aceh, from Semarang and Cirebon which were once visited by navigator Zheng Ho to the booming cities of Solo and Surabaya, my trip across the Thousand Islands has opened my eyes to the beauty and vitality of Indonesia, the Emerald of the Equator. I watched the stunning sunrise at Borobudur, stood in awe before Mount Bromo, enjoyed the tranquility of Lake Toba and swam in the blue seas in Bunaken. I enjoyed the angklung performance and watched wayang kulit. I was fascinated by the elegance of Batik, intoxicated by the aroma of Kopi Luwak and feasted on the delicious nasi goreng. I learned to say Terima Kasih to those who helped me.A friend once told me, "if you spend one week in Indonesia, you can write your travel log; if you spend a few months, you can write your own book; but if you spend a few years, you don't even know where to start" That's because the longer you stay, the more you realize that Indonesia, with over 17,000 islands, 714 ethnic groups and 1,100 local languages, is such a huge and diversified country. A 3-year tenure is only too short. I hope I can come back someday to once again enjoy its beautiful scenery, enchanting culture and warm loving people.I was blessed to have made so many friends from the Indonesian government, political parties, business community, religious groups, think tanks, media, the diplomatic corps, Ambassador Xu Bu and his colleagues from the Chinese Mission to ASEAN, Chinese entrepreneurs, Chinese journalists and Chinese volunteers. You have all contributed so much to our bilateral relations. From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank you for supporting our embassy and myself. I will never forget the many days and nights when we worked together, the inspiring conversations we had, and the happy moments we shared. We Chinese say "true friends walk this life together". The Indonesian saying goes "friendship is far in the sky and near in the heart". Although my tenure will soon complete, our friendship will last forever.I also want to thank my dear colleagues at the embassy, including the local Indonesian staff who joined us decades ago. For day and night, we worked side by side. I am so proud of this aspiring, energetic and dedicated team. You are first class. You are superb. You are the real heroes and heroines. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks for your consistent understanding, support and invaluable contribution.My special thanks also go to my wife Wang Dan, who has always been standing by my side and encouraging me. You remain, as always, my source of inspiration and love.Dear colleagues and friends,I hope you will be providing my successor when he arrives, and during the transition, my good friend the Charge d'affaires and Minister Councilor Mr. Sun Weide as much help as you have been kindly providing me.Ladies and gentlemen,I will soon start my new journey with fond memory of this beautiful country, warm friendship and sincere hope for an even better tomorrow for Indonesia. Wherever I go, I will always remain Indonesia's true friend and committed envoy for friendship and cooperation between China and Indonesia.Finally, I would like to send my best wishes:To the ever-lasting prosperity of the Republic of Indonesia.To the ever-growing cooperation and friendship between China and Indonesia.And to the health, success and happiness of all my Indonesian friends.Terima kasih!Load-Date: June 9, 2017End of Document

What Are America's Options on North Korea?Atlantic OnlineApril 7, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1422 wordsByline: Uri FriedmanBodyAhead of Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to the United States this week-an occasion North Korea marked by testing yet anotherballistic missile-Donald Trump            vowed to "solve" the problem of Pyongyang's rapidly developing nuclear-weapons program with or without China's help,            issuing that most Washington-y of warnings: "All options are on the table."The hazy declarations are a response to an ever-clearer threat, one that would arguably dwarf the danger posed by terrorism to U.S. national security. The North Korean government, which tested its first nuclear weapon in 2006, has dramatically expanded its trials of ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons in recent years under the leadership of Kim Jong Un. And some experts estimate that North Korea could            acquire the capability to hit the continental United States with a nuclear-armed long-range missile before the end of Trump's first term. (The North may already be capable of staging nuclear attacks against Japan and South Korea.)North Korea's Escalating Nuclear and Missile TestsReuters / Center for Strategic and International StudiesSpend some time examining the North Korea table, however, and the options can seem dizzying. Proposed policies range from ramping up U.S. cyberattacks against North Korea's missile program, as the Obama administration            reportedly did in its final years, to ending U.S.-South Korean military exercises in exchange for North Korea suspending work on its nuclear program, as the Chinese            have proposed. Other options could include            sending American tactical nuclear weapons into South Korea or            accepting a nuclear North Korea and devising ways to contain it.I asked Victor Cha-a Korea expert who, as a Bush administration official, negotiated with North Koreans and witnessed it become a nuclear power-to walk me through the available options. His list was short. Ultimately, he said, there are only "two ways to impose significant costs" on the North Koreans for pursuing nuclear weapons. The United States "could use military power ... or the Chinese can put real economic pressure on" North Korea. The first option could have horrific consequences, which is why so much rides on this week's talks between Trump and Xi this week.The Military OptionThere's a reason why Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama all considered preemptive military strikes against North Korea's nuclear sites and all eventually decided against it. (Clinton may have            come closer than any other American president to ordering military action in 1994, when he nearly took out the nuclear reactor at Yongbyon.) As North Korea's nuclear infrastructure has become more sophisticated, it has grown increasingly difficult to design a military campaign that could eliminate (as opposed to merely slow down) the entire program-especially now that the Kim regime has spread out its nuclear-weapons arsenal, facilities for enriching weapons-grade plutonium and uranium, and mobile systems for launching missiles. "It's very hard to strike [these components] because you don't know where they are," Cha said.North Korea could also retaliate against U.S. strikes by unleashing a barrage of artillery against the South Korean capital of Seoul, which is one of the largest cities in the world and roughly as far from the demilitarized zone separating the two countries as Washington, D.C., is from Baltimore. The North Korean military could place chemical weapons on that artillery. It could also target U.S. military bases in South Korea and Japan with ballistic missiles-potentially nuclear-tipped missiles. "It gets pretty ugly," Cha said. There could "be millions of casualties if something like this were to happen.""It's certainly true that dictatorships like North Korea-their primary goal is to survive," Cha noted. "So could you carry out a strike against their nuclear facilities with a threat that if they retaliate we will wipe out the regime? Will a rational dictator then sort of sit still? Possibly. But that's a big risk to take."The Economic OptionThe Trump administration could mimic the Obama administration and patiently ratchet up international sanctions against North Korea as a way of pressuring it to return to negotiations over their nuclear program, Cha said. It could crack down on North Korea's revenue from exporting slave labor to countries like China and Russia. But neither of those approaches will change one stubborn, significant fact: Roughly 85 percent of North Korea's            external trade is with China. And China has the ability to shut down that trade, ending barter trade along its border with North Korea and preventing North Koreans from using Chinese banks.China, the world's largest economy by some measures, "doesn't need that trade," Cha continued, and choking off its economic relations with North Korea is "the only thing that we can do at this point. It's not going to solve the problem [of North Korea's nuclear program], but if the North Korean leadership doesn't have the money to buy Mercedes-Benz and cognac and all these other things, and if their bank accounts are being frozen in Chinese banks and elsewhere, they're not going to be in a good position."As for the ultimate goal of placing North Korean leaders in such a bind, the "diplomatic answer is that that would then be a segue to negotiations in which everybody would be united [on] the terms for North Korea to freeze and then dismantle their program," Cha explained. "The undiplomatic answer is that it puts enough pressure on the regime that there will be some sort of internal problems, and that Kim Jong Un might be challenged by others who see a better path for North Korea."I pointed out that the Chinese government's fears about the collapse of the Kim regime-which could produce a refugee crisis, loose nukes, and an opening for the U.S. military to increase its presence on the Korean peninsula-are precisely why China has resisted applying economic pressure on North Korea for more than two decades. So why would they sign up for measures that could destabilize Kim Jong Un's government?Cha mentioned two developments that might make China more willing to cooperate with the United States than it has been in the past. First, "the Chinese are very worried" about mounting tensions between the U.S. and North Korea. "I think they feel like the situation is truly getting out of control. They have no political influence on North Korea, and I think they feel like they have no control over Trump." Second, "Trump is unpredictable. We just don't know what he's going to do." This is why Cha feels U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's            surprisingly terse statement on North Korea's ballistic-missile test-a statement that essentially declared, "I'm sick of talking about North Korea"-was effective. "People start paying attention because it's not the typical U.S. response," Cha said.Cha experienced something similar in  2006, after North Korea conducted its first nuclear test. "President Bush said to [Chinese President] Hu Jintao at the time ... 'They just exploded a nuclear device in your backyard. If you don't do something about this, I will.' That's not a direct quote, but [that was the essence] of it," Cha recalled. "This was a president speaking who was in two wars, who had invaded two countries already. [The Chinese] were worried." Nuclear talks with North Korea resumed, and the United States secured            several (now-defunct) commitments from the North Koreans to roll back their program.Cha said he expects the Trump administration to refuse to engage in nuclear negotiations with the Kim regime-negotiations the Chinese desire-until China reduces its trade with North Korea. He expects Trump to help establish missile-defense systems in South Korea and possibly Japan, a policy China opposes. And he interprets Trump's pledge to solve the North Korean problem without China's assistance if necessary as a veiled threat to impose so-called "secondary sanctions" on Chinese companies and individuals that do business with North Koreans, rather than a prelude to war."I prefer to not think of [a nuclear-armed North Korea] as a geopolitical reality," Cha said. "The geopolitical reality is that this regime can't last forever." Of course: North Korea's nuclear-weapons program is advancing by the day, and the Kims have clung to power for 69 years. For now, North Korean nukes and the Kim regime's resilience are very much realities that the Trump administration must confront.Read            What Are America's Options on North Korea? on theatlantic.comLoad-Date: April 8, 2017End of Document

China propels rise of electric ultra-high-performance carsAssociated Press InternationalJune 19, 2017 Monday 5:34 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 1225 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Want an insanely fast ride with zero emissions? Startup NIO has the car: An electric two-seater with muscular European lines and a top speed of 195 miles per hour (313 kilometers per hour).The catch: The EP9 costs nearly $1.5 million. NIO, a Chinese-Western hybrid with bases in Shanghai, London and Silicon Valley, created it to showcase the company's technology and had no sales plans. But it is taking orders for "bespoke vehicles" after hearing from buyers ready to pay the eye-popping price."We are actually pleasantly surprised how much interest we are getting," said the CEO of NIO's U.S. unit, Padmasree Warrior, a veteran of Cisco and Motorola.NIO is part of a wave of fledgling automakers - all backed at least in part by Chinese investors - that are propelling the electric vehicle industry's latest trend: ultra-high-performance cars.Manufacturers including Detroit Electric, Qiantu Motor, Thunder Power and NEVS aim to compete with Europe, Detroit and Japan by offering top speeds over 150 mph (240 kph) and features including carbon fiber bodies and web-linked navigation and entertainment.The ventures mix U.S. and European technology with Chinese money and manufacturing, reflecting this country's rise as a market and investor for an industry where Beijing wants a leading role. Communist leaders see electric vehicles as a way to clear China's smog-choked cities and as an engine for economic development."We really haven't seen non-Chinese companies get into this super-technology market," said Chris Robinson, who follows the industry for Lux Research.NIO's backers include Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings, operator of the popular WeChat messaging service; computer maker Lenovo Group, a Singapore government-owned investment fund and U.S.-based IDG Capital, TPG and Hillhouse Capital.Some brands are following the strategy of Tesla Inc., which debuted with an eye-catching roadster to establish a premium image before launching lower-priced models.The instant torque and acceleration of electric cars make them natural performance vehicles.Detroit Electric, a revival of a pioneering U.S. electric car brand founded in 1907, launched a sports car venture this year with a Chinese battery maker and the government of Yixing, west of Shanghai. For a base price of $135,000, the company promises zero to 60 mph (100 kph) in 3.7 seconds and a top speed of 155 mph (250 kph).The first seven of 100 cars ordered by European dealers have been delivered, according to its chairman and CEO, Albert Lam, a former Lotus chief executive. He said the company aims to release an SUV in 2018 and wants to have a four-vehicle lineup by 2020."Our target is to be the first Chinese-based vehicle company to sell worldwide," said Lam.Thunder Power, led by Hong Kong entrepreneur Wellen Sham, has a similarly multinational plan for a sport sedan due out in late 2018.The company is building a factory in southern China and plans a second in Spain. Engineering work is being handled by Italy's Dallara Automobili, which helped develop Bugatti's Veyron, the fastest street-legal car with a top speed of 255 mph (408.84 kph).Thunder Power promises a top speed of 155 mph (245 kph). The company says its competitive edge will be a battery that can go up to 400 miles (650 kilometers) on one charge, or almost double the 200 to 250 miles (320 to 400 kilometers) of current high-end electrics.Beijing's backing has helped to make China the biggest electric vehicle market at a time of uncertainty about the scale of support for the industry from Washington and European governments.Sales in China of plug-in and hybrid vehicles in the first quarter of this year totaled 55,929, versus 44,876 for the United States.The Cabinet hopes to have 100,000 public charging stations and 800,000 private stations operating by the end of this year. Regulators are pressing manufacturers to speed up development with a proposal to require that electrics account for at least 8 percent of each brand's production by next year.To raise its profile, the electric vehicle industry launched its own racing circuit, dubbed Formula E, in 2014 with battery-powered Formula One-style cars and events in China, Europe, the United States and Mexico.Still, no matter how appealing they are, there aren't enough buyers to support so many high-performance brands, said Lux's Robinson. He noted Ferrari or Lamborghini might sell only 15 of their fastest vehicles, which are treated as marketing tools and even at prices above $1 million fail to make a profit.Manufacturers wanting to move into lower priced segments face a crowded market, he said."Really, not all of them are going to make it," said Robinson.Despite that, the newcomers express confidence they can take market share from established rivals.NIO's Warrior points to the transition from cellphones to smartphones, in which industry leaders were displaced by upstarts."We are in the beginning of a race. We are all at the same starting position," said Christopher Nicoll, marketing director for Thunder Power.Detroit Electric's Lam said his financial plan calls for each car to be sold at a profit by 2019."We are not from the internet world," he said. "We know how important it is for a car company to make money."Other Chinese tech companies including internet search engine operator Baidu Inc. and LeEco, an online video service, are working on electric and self-driving vehicles. Most have research centers in Silicon Valley or Europe."China isn't necessarily a technological leader. They are a production leader," said Robinson. "A lot of the more advanced electric vehicle, power train and other technology research is going on in Europe and the United States."Chinese city governments are forging partnerships with automakers in hopes of becoming manufacturing centers.That helped Detroit Electric carry out its plans after other investors were uncertain, Lam said. He said the company picked Yixing after talking with four cities."We were invited to come to China," said Lam.The most prominent homegrown competitor is Qiantu Motor, led by a former executive of a state-owned automaker.Qiantu says its K50, on sale next year, will deliver a top speed of 125 mph (200 kph) and go 185 miles (300 kilometers) on one charge.NEVS is developing a sedan to be made in China based on technology acquired from defunct Swedish automaker Saab.Its owners include National Modern Energy Holdings Ltd., a Chinese developer of renewable energy technology, the government of the eastern city of Tianjin and State Research Information Technology Co., owned by the Chinese Cabinet.NIO developed the EP9 to promote its technology for self-driving vehicles. The first, a seven-seat SUV, is due to be released in China in 2018.The company worried buyers saw electrics as a "little toy car." It wants to "break that mold and say that an electric car can be a serious performance car," said Warrior.NIO says a self-driving version of the EP9 hit 160 mph (256 kph) in February on an Austin, Texas, test track."We made seven, thinking it was essentially for a collector," said Warrior. "Now there is increased interest. People actually want to buy this car."___NIO: http://www.nio.io/Detroit Electric Holdings Ltd.: Detroit-electric-group.comFormula E: www.fiaformulae.com/enThunder Power: www.tpev.comNEV: www.nevs.com/enLoad-Date: June 20, 2017End of Document

TRANSCRIPT: WORLD BANK GROUP OPENING PRESS CONFERENCE BY PRESIDENT JIM YONG KIM AT THE 2017 WBG/IMF SPRING MEETINGSStates News ServiceApril 20, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 4684 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the World Bank:World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim World Bank Group/ IMF 2017 Spring Meetings Washington, DC, United StatesTranscriptMR. THEIS: Good morning. Thanks, everyone, for coming. I'm David Theis, the World Bank's Press Secretary. Dr. Kim will give brief opening remarks and then we'll turn to your questions.Light housekeeping, if you can please silence your mobile phones and at Q and A if you could identify yourself and your outlet once the mic gets to you.Thanks. Jim?DR. KIM: Good morning, everybody and welcome to the 2017 World Bank Group/IMF Spring meetings. I'll say a few words first on what we'll be discussing with our shareholders this week and then we'll take your questions.As always the global economy is high on the agenda. We're encouraged to see stronger economic prospects after years of disappointing global growth. There are still many downside risks, however, and countries that have the fiscal space need to continue with structural reforms. This is vital to accelerating the sustainable and inclusive economic growth needed to end extreme poverty by 2030. We're meeting at a time when we face several overlapping crises, both natural and manmade, all of which add urgency to our mission. You and your colleagues have been reporting on them every day, conflict, climate shocks, the worst refugee crisis since World War II, and famine in parts of East Africa and Yemen, which the UN has called the worst in 70 years. With famine in particular, the world was caught unprepared again. Too often we forget about crises as soon as they abate, leading to a cycle of panic and neglect. We're already working with the affected countries and partners to respond to the famine and we will use every tool we have, financial and advisory, to prevent famine in the future. On Saturday, I'll convene a meeting Co-Chaired with the United Nations Secretary General to ensure a coordinated, effective, and well-resourced response.In addition to fragility, accelerations in technology are changing the landscape. We estimate that two-thirds of all jobs that currently exist in developing countries will be wiped out by automation. At the same time the internet, smart phones, and social media allow everyone to see exactly how everyone else lives, which is causing aspirations to rise all over the world. I see this everywhere I go. So in the midst of these crises and with rising aspirations we must change the way we work in development finance. We have to find new and innovative ways to reach the poor and make the world more secure and stable and to help the world grow.Last week at the London School of Economics, I outlined how we're working to change our approach. We have to start by asking whether the private sector can finance a project. If the conditions aren't right, we will work with our partners to de-risk that project or, if needed, de-risk entire countries or sectors. This won't be easy. It will require agreement across the entire international development finance system -- multilaterals, and bilaterals -- to move the global development architecture in this direction. But this is the only way we can act with the speed and scale that these times require.Here's the good news, there's never been a better time to find those win-win solutions. There's trillions of dollars sitting on the sidelines earning little interest or even negative interest and investors are looking for better returns. That capital should be mobilized to help us meet the exploding aspirations of people all over the world. And with the crises we face, our task is much more urgent than we ever thought.Now I'm happy to take your questions.MR. THEIS: Thanks. And, again, just a reminder to identify yourself and your outlet when we get to you. And I'm going to start here in the front row with this gentleman.QUESTIONER: Ahmed Emad from Egypt. I would like to ask in Arabic language. My question is about World Bank cooperation with Egypt in national projects, which Egypt aims at implementing at this time and in the future. How do you see the cooperation of the Bank with Egypt in these projects?DR. KIM: I just met with President el-Sisi when he was here in Washington. As I'm sure you know, we think that Egypt is one of the critically important economies in the Middle East region. And we have a broad array of projects that we're working on, you know, everything from infrastructure focus to a project specifically focused on investing in people. I assured President el-Sisi that we will continue our cooperation given the importance of Egypt to the economy and the region.MR. THEIS: Great. I'm going to go to -- oh, here, again in the front row. Microphone? Thank you.QUESTIONER: (Inaudible) from China Central Television. The One Belt One Road Summit is going to be held in Beijing in May and we know you're going to attend this summit and we'd like to know what is your expectation from this summit and also how will the World Bank work together with the AIIB and other multilateral development institutions.Thank you.DR. KIM: So we have a very close working relationship with the Chinese government and also with the AIIB. We'll be signing another memorandum of understanding. During these meetings I will be doing so with Jin Liqun, the President of AIIB. The One Belt One Road project is an extremely important one for the Chinese government and also for us. The leadership that China is now taking in the overall world of development I think is unprecedented. And I think China has been stepping up and illustrating that it's concerned about development, not just in the neighboring countries or even along the Old Silk Road, but globally. And so not only are we engaged, for example, in a major study with China right now on the drivers of China's future economic growth, but we're partnering with AIIB already. There were two major projects that we've co-financed with AIIB in Indonesia.So our expectation is that our engagement both with the Chinese government and with Chinese efforts at development, both through their own bilateral cooperation, but also through AIIB, will only grow going into the future. And we've discussed at great length our approach of trying to crowd in much more private sector capital and the Chinese are very much in agreement with what we're trying to accomplish.MR. THEIS: We're going to go to Alex Brummer there, please.QUESTIONER: Alex Brummer, Daily Mail, London. The British government looks as if it may now be going to cut its contribution, its foreign aid budget contribution, which has reached 0.7 percent, and is one of the largest foreign aid budgets in the world. What difference would that make and what problems would that create for the World Bank and for the aid community in general if they send that particular signal?DR. KIM: Well, Alex, you know, on the one hand we were extremely encouraged when Prime Minister Cameron fulfilled his commitment to the 0.7. And I think that it's important for people in the UK to understand just how significant that was in terms of expanding the UK's influence in the world and elevating even more the image of the UK in the world. I think it would be very unfortunate for the UK to reduce their commitment. And I would just, through you -- and I see Larry next to you -- to say to the people of the UK that 0.7 that has been committed to is critically, critically important, not just for developing countries but for the future of the world.Now, you know, I've been making this case for the past few months and I want to be sure that all of your leaders understand this. These multiple overlapping crises linked with rapidly rising aspiration, I mean this is a specific issue, Alex. You know, we actually did the study -- we looked at how satisfied people are and what is going to affect their overall level of satisfaction. And what we found is that access to the internet on the one hand increases their satisfaction in the short-term, but it also raises very quickly the income to which they compare their own. So what you see is that as access to the internet expands, people's sense of what is possible goes up. And if you have rising aspirations and connect those with opportunity, you can get really great dynamism in a society. It's frankly what Korea experienced in the 1960s, '70s, and '80s. But if those rising aspirations then meet frustration we are very worried about more and more countries going down the path to fragility, conflict, violence, extremism, and of course eventually migration. Because the other thing that access to the internet does is it increases people's desire to migrate.And I'm not talking about just aid. The DFID has done incredibly thoughtful and innovative things, like also helping us to increase the investment of the private sector in developing countries.So, we need to create dynamic growing societies that will be markets for goods from the OECD in which opportunities are created, so that these rising aspirations are not all met with frustration.You know, I can't -- this is not something that's theoretical. It's happening in front of us right now. And so, people have to think about aid as far more than just sort of giveaways.We think about using our resources now as facilitating the process where owners of capital get higher return, and developing countries will get an opportunity to grow their economies and create jobs.That's the one big win-win situation in the world today, and you need organizations that can facilitate that process. Aid agencies can do that, and DFID specifically has played an extremely important role in doing that.MR. THEIS: Great. This gentleman on the aisle five rows back, please.QUESTIONER: My name is George Wiafe from Joy FM and Montie TV in Ghana. Mr. President, what measures are you putting in place to ensure that aid that you advance to developing countries like Ghana is used effectively, because, years on, there have been questions about effectiveness of this support, even reducing poverty in countries like Ghana? And what is your expectation of the new President? Your Vice President was in Ghana recently.DR. KIM: I haven't met your new President yet, but I'll be meeting very high officials from your government during this week.You know, the question of aid effectiveness is very important. We at the World Bank Group have all kinds of measures, and we audit every single project. We follow the possibility of corruption very, very closely. Also, we're trying to rethink ourselves what's the best way to support countries like Ghana in their aspirations.One of the things that we found is that foreign direct investment often has a much higher impact, much stronger impact on improving institutions and government than aid by itself.This is why we're trying to bring together the financing we provide to governments and also the financing that comes from the private sector to create better institutions, more investment, more jobs, more economic growth, in a much more synergistic way.I think that's the one thing we need to do much more effectively than we have in the past, because even inside the World Bank Group, the public sector side of the organization and the private sector side of the organization, for the most part, worked almost independently.Now, what we're going to do is try to both help institutions evolve so that we can talk about de-risking entire countries with policy reform, improving the business environment, and at the same time facilitate the movement of private capital in a way that will lead to, we hope, more economic growth throughout the developing world.So, on corruption, on misuse, on loans and grants that don't give any outcomes, we have been following that for a long time, but I think the big question now for us in terms of aid effectiveness is we have got to stop fighting each other for the low hanging fruit projects. This is what is actually happening right now.If there's some project that looks like it could be commercially viable, meaning it could be financed by the private sector, all the development agencies run after it and fight over it, and try to get their money in the door so that they can get the money out of their door, right?So, we've been competing with each other for the low hanging fruit projects as opposed to stepping back and saying the low hanging fruit projects, we should let the private sector fund that, and then we should work on the higher hanging fruits that will boost these economies even more.This is a complex and difficult conversation that we're having right now, but it's critical for us to have it. I think if we don't have it and if we don't move forward in a much more coordinated way, we will begin to lose credibility.MR. THEIS: Three rows back, two in.QUESTIONER: News AM News Agency Armenia. On the global scale, do you plan any changes in the mix of lending between IBRD and IDA to better support low income countries through the IDA? And do you have the necessary resources for that? Thank you.DR. KIM: So, for low income countries, we had a record IDA replenishment, and in this case, it was every donor country agreeing to stay at the same level that it was on the last replenishment, which was around $51 to $52 billion, but the reason it got to $75 billion is we also got permission to use our capital in IDA to go to the capital markets and raise financing for IDA countries at very low interest rates. So, we are now at $75 billion.We're actually using the flexibilities that exist within our overall balance sheet to create a 50 percent increase. So, for IDA countries specifically, we're going to have much more funding, and different kinds of funding. We also have a $2.5 billion private sector window that's the first of its kind.Now, in terms of IBRD, let me stress we have talked about a capital increase, and we feel we need one, but this is a decision that will be made by the shareholders. The shareholders have to have a discussion about whether or not they want to go forward with a capital increase for us, but we're making the case very strongly that both IFC, which has only had $2.5 billion of paid in capital in its entire 60-year history, and yet has done tremendously good work, putting hundreds of billions of dollars into the private sector and developing countries only 2.5 - and then IBRD, which had a little bit more than $14 billion of paid in capital over its 70-year history.We believe that for us to meet the aspirations of countries all over the world, that we need a capital increase both for IFC and IBRD. Now, again, we'll make the case, but at the end of the day, it is a decision for the shareholders.MR. THEIS: Great. I'm going to go to the second row here. Please, in the middle.QUESTIONER:Yina Guo with Xinhua News Agency. There's rising populist and nationalist sentiment, so how do the multilateral banks address this challenge. Specifically, the One Belt One Road initiative, which requires multilateral support. So how will this become a challenge for this kind of project?DR. KIM: We believe that globalization and free trade has had just an absolutely huge impact on poor people and poor countries. I think what you see is a reduction in inequality between countries, but increases in inequality within countries, especially OECD countries.We also are very much aware of the fact that there are many who have not benefitted from globalization, who are very angry at the fact that they have not benefitted.Now, if you look at sort of what's happened in the world in terms of lifting people out of poverty, you know, China has had the strongest experience, lifting 800 million people out of poverty, and that happened when it embraced the global market, when it opened itself to competition, when it engaged more and more in trade.So, you know, we've been saying along with the IMF and WTO that trade has been an extremely important part of global economic growth, and it's been an extremely important part of the reduction in poverty, the tremendous reduction in poverty we have seen over the last 30 years.Now, I think OECD countries are now looking very seriously at how they've done in terms of ensuring that globalization and economic growth has been experienced by everyone. I think there is a lot of attention, and that's good.We continue to argue that freer trade, more openness, is actually critical for the future of the world, and there may be individual countries that choose to look inward, but just because those individual countries look inward doesn't mean everyone else is going to look inward.China is a good example. China is not going to stop trading with all of its trading partners and it's not going to stop continuing to work with South Asia, Africa, Latin America. China's work in those countries has only gone up over the last few years, and I think it will go up further.So, we're trying to make the case. I think a lot of people blame trade for the loss of jobs, for example, in the United States, but if you ask the WTO, they will say at most, at the very most, only 20 percent of job loss is from trade, and the vast majority is from automation. That's what we're seeing all over the world.So, my message is you're not going to bring these old jobs back. Every country in the world has to think about how it's going to compete in the economy of the future. When we say something like two-thirds of jobs in developing countries could be lost to automation, we don't know exactly what the timing is going to be.But let me just give you one example. And two, three years ago we were arguing about whether 3D printing would ever be capable of taking over garment assembly, right? Because garment manufacturing, garment assembly has been sort of the classic light industry that goes from country to country based on wages. Right?And even two or three years ago, I was told no way. Garment manufacturing still requires human hands. This will always be the way it is. It's going to be this way for at least another decade. And I just met a woman who had told me an exciting story about how she is making couture cotton T-shirts and other clothing in Haiti with 3D printers. And she said, you know, it's exciting in the sense that we know that Haitians now can run 3D printers, but the downside is that there are far fewer jobs, right?So something we were arguing about two to three years ago of whether it was possible, it's already happening right now in Haiti. And so for every country in the world, we have to think very seriously about what investments we need to make right now in order to prepare ourselves for the economy of the future, right? And for developing countries it's definitely one of the most important things is more investment in human capital. And we're going to stress that a lot this week.You know, get serious. You've got to reduce childhood stunting. You've got to improve your educational system, improve health outcomes. And part of the reason that we're focusing so much on private sector investments for infrastructure is so that we can try to free up resources to invest more in human beings so that more developing countries can be ready for the great complexity that's about to come.MR. THEIS: Front row at the end here, please?QUESTIONER: Athanasios Tsitsas, Antenna TV. A question on Greece, please. There were reports that Athens has expressed interest in receiving a loan of three billion euros for financing active employment policies and programs. Is there any progress on this issue and what are your thoughts?DR. KIM: So we've already been working. We actually started working with Greece, you know, very early in my tenure in 2012. But the things we've been working on are things like better social protection for citizens, improving the doing business ranking by improving the business environment. You know, looking specifically at how to address long-term unemployment.Now we are investing through the IFC, our private sector arm, and we have had talks with the Greek government. But there are no imminent plans to do this, and, you know, anything -- any kind of movement like that to provide a loan in Greece would have to be done with the agreement of all the other creditors of Greece, and also by our board.So it's not -- there's nothing imminent, but we are committed to continuing to support Greece in the ways we have been supporting them now for almost five years.MR. THEIS: We're going to go to a Jeremy Tordjman here at AFP, please.MR. TORDJMAN: Jeremy Tordjman with AFP. The World Bank has been very vocal in the recent years about the economic impact of the climate change. And I was wondering, do you think these efforts could be weakened by the new administration which is, I mean, which denies the reality of climate change?DR. KIM: Jeremy, thank you. So this is really important, and excuse me, I'm going to take a little time on this, right? So we're having multiple events now focused specifically on climate change. We have a panel of eminent leaders in climate change that we're going to be bringing together. And we're thinking about how we can bring together the private sector, the public sector, philanthropists, environmental organizations, governments, to try to really create momentum around financing for climate change. So both in the area of mitigation, yeah, there are six countries that are putting most of the coal-based carbon in the air. And this is China, India, Philippines, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Vietnam, these six countries.So if we can change the incentives, and change the way that financing for energy works in those six countries, we could potentially have a huge impact on how much carbon we put in the air. And we call this our following the carbon initiative in that we have to make progress in these six countries of moving them much more quickly to renewable source. All right, so now the good news is that renewable source are getting cheaper.I'm told that storage technology is getting better very quickly, and that within a few years, we may have some major transformations in the ability to store energy from intermittent sources. And so with all that happening, we think that a major issue is going to be cost to finance, the cost of capital, right?And so we're now, you know, the hundred billion of grants in additional a year that at one point was promised, I don't see it coming. I mean the Green Climate Fund is still right around 7.5 billion after two or three years. And you know, the estimation was that there would be many more billions of dollars than that. So we're using this meeting to bring all of the leaders together to come up with a new plan.I mean, we're going to put on the table a different kind of platform where all the different groups that are trying to have an impact on climate can work together to put the financing tools together. So for example, you could have pension funds. You know, large holders of capital invested very conservatively who may be interested in climate, but they would need help with, you know, guarantees, risk mitigation, et cetera in investing in climate change activities in poor countries.And so we are going to try to put that platform together so that the different organizations that want to be active can continue to be active. But the bottom line is this, that the science of climate change didn't change with any particular election. And I don't see that it will.And so, you know, we have to be an evidence-based organization. We will lose all credibility if we don't maintain our commitment to be an evidence-based organization. And, you know, we have no interest in destroying a particular industry, but we have to be an evidence-based organization. And I think the evidence is even more alarming with every week about the impact of climate change.I mean, in a recent trip to Africa that's all I heard. All I heard was, you know, these droughts, the droughts and floods, and droughts and floods, we all know that this is because of climate change. And we need your help in putting in place investments that will help us to adapt to climate change.So to be very clear, we are not changing what we do. And in fact, we are doing everything we can to accelerate our efforts to help with both mitigation and adaptation to climate change. We're trying to be the sort of an honest broker, a platform so that multiple different players who are all concerned about this, and are moving, but who may need connection to each other to really make it work more effectively, we're working very hard to provide that platform so that we can accelerate quickly our efforts.Now there's some really good news. We've -- our IFC, our private sector group, has been working in India and as recently as a year and a half, two years ago, the price of solar was still around 10, 11 cents per kilowatt hour. And so coal was still much cheaper than solar. But the latest auction that we've been involved in got that price down to 4.4 cents a kilowatt hour.So now solar is quite competitive with coal. And so we need to keep doing that. And the auctions around the world, even in emerging markets, have gone down below 3 cents a kilowatt hour at which point it becomes cost effective, and the incentives are clear that moving towards solar is better than continuing with the building of coal plants.And so we need to find ways of accelerating that process. And we hope to come out of these Spring Meetings with a platform like that in place.MR. THEIS: Right. Thank you. We have time for one more quick one, and we're going to go to the third row in the back right here, please.QUESTIONER: Why are you ignoring the Journal --MR. THEIS: I try and call on mostly developing country reporters that don't have as much access to the President of the World Bank because they are from out of town.QUESTIONER: We haven't had access to President Kim for six month to any US outletsMR. THEIS: We actually had an interview with an outlet this morning. Could I have the third row, please?QUESTIONER: This is Lalit Jha from Press Trust of India.India, as you know, has -- is the fastest emerging great economy in the world right now but it also has a challenge as one of the largest -- people living below poverty line. Do you think with these two and with Prime Minister Modi's economic reforms, India can address, reach the target of removing poverty before 2013?DR. KIM: So -- and I've had direct conversations with Prime Minister Modi about this.India has a very high childhood stunting rate, 38 percent and India has much better nutritional status than many countries that have a lower childhood stunting rate and a big part of it is sanitation and you know Swachh Bharat is a program that we support around sanitation which is really important.I think it's extremely important for India to increase and accelerate its investment in children, in education.There are so many great things that Prime Minister Modi is already doing but it's very difficult to see how with such high childhood stunting rates that as the economy evolves and becomes much more digitally demanding, that those children who are stunted today will be able to compete.So I think that we are so impressed with so many things that are happening.I mean, you know, for example, digital money the way that the demonetization program was very difficult and yet the way that moving the system of providing financing directly to poor people has gone digital, has saved billions and billions of dollars.We think his approach to the goods and services taxes, there are so many things that have been done that are great.My advice would be in addition to those great things that India, the entire country -- Prime Minister Modi has a very strong commitment to this but I would say that what needs to accelerate and accelerate quickly is things like reducing stunting levels, ensuring that educational outcomes are very high so that India can compete in the economy of the future.MR. THEIS: All right, thanks everybody.DR. KIM: Ian, I am sorry we didn't get to you but we will try to next time.Load-Date: April 22, 2017End of Document

Trump's Interests vs. America's, Mar-a-Lago EditionAtlantic OnlineApril 5, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 23231 wordsByline: Jeremy VenookBodyTo many of President Donald Trump's critics, his decision to turn Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, into a "Southern White House" epitomizes the way he's mixing his business interests with his duties as president. With each visit to the property, he boosts the resort's visibility and may very well prompt more people to enroll as members in attempts to get a glimpse of the commander-in-chief. That the club doubled its initiation fees in January only adds to the impression that Trump-or, at least his namesake company-is banking on his presidency as a means of boosting revenues. And without a publicly available guest list and no word on what security protocols are in place, the possibility that somebody could be using a club membership to gain access to the president has led Democratic members of Congress            to draft a bill specifically to mandate better disclosure of the goings-on at the venue.Still, the president apparently intends to continue not only going to Mar-a-Lago himself but also bringing high-profile diplomatic guests there for meetings. The first time he did so, in February, made news in part because it resulted in an apparent breach of security protocol: When Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was interrupted by news of a North Korean nuclear-missile test, the two heads of state read over briefing materials by the light of cellphones, in full view of paying dinner guests, at least one of whom took pictures.Now, Trump is returning to Palm Beach with another world leader in tow. But, as The New York Times reports, one frequent Mar-a-Lago guest may create friction between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. In recent weeks, the billionaire real-estate mogul Guo Wengui has emerged as an outspoken critic of China's ruling Communist Party, accusing it of rampant corruption. Guo himself is no stranger to charges of corruption: He            left China in 2008 amid allegations that he had exploited his ties with one of the country's top security officials to enhance his businesses. Guo maintains that the reporter who implicated him in the scandal was the tool of a government plot to undermine him, and has in turn pointed the finger at multiple party officials he says have engaged in various forms of graft, although he's pointedly stopped short of criticizing Xi. He also claims that the Chinese government has seized more than $17 billion of his assets since he left the country.And,            the Times says, Guo is a frequent attendee at Mar-a-Lago. In March, he            tweeted a picture of himself with the resort's managing director.It is unknown whether Guo will be at Mar-a-Lago, or even in Palm Beach, at the time of Trump's meeting with Xi. Indeed, without a guest list, it may be hard to ever know who's there at the same time as the president except via social-media posts. But Guo's possible presence, and even the fact that Trump is-via the membership fees Guo is paying to his company-profiting from Guo, could still cast a shadow over the president's meeting there with Xi. Trump's relationship with his Chinese counterpart already got off to a rocky start when Trump broke decades of protocol by calling the president of Taiwan, something no president has done since the 1970s. Given China's harsh treatment of dissidents in the past, Trump's holding a meeting with Xi at a club Guo belongs to could be interpreted as another slight, intentional or not, toward the Chinese government and further undermine one of the world's most important bilateral relationships.The problem, then, is twofold: First, it's that Trump directly profits from spending his weekends at Mar-a-Lago and bringing high-profile guests with him, although only he knows for certain the extent to which his visits to Florida are motivated by this. And second, it's that by paying the president to be a member at the resort, Guo gains a chance at brushing shoulders with and possibly even influencing the president, although, again, only he knows if that's his reason for doing so. That exchange of money-Guo's membership dues going into the president's pocket-could in part end up being responsible for complicating U.S.-China relations as Trump and Xi hold their first meeting since the former became president.Guo is also            far from the only Mar-a-Lago member who might have a stake in rubbing elbows with the president, nor is he the only controversial foreign oligarch with whom Trump has financial ties of some kind. As such, Guo is indicative of the larger problem with the president's maintenance of his business interests, both in general and with regard to his estate in Palm Beach.The BackgroundPresident Donald Trump still has not taken the necessary steps to distance himself from his businesses while in office. In accordance with a plan that he and one of his lawyers, Sheri Dillon, laid out            at a press conference on January 11,            Trump has filed paperwork to remove himself from the day-to-day operation of his eponymous organization. However, numerous ethics experts have voiced strenuous objections to the plan, which they say does very little to resolve the issue: As long as Trump continues to profit from his business empire-which he does whether or not he is nominally in charge-they say, the possibility that outside actors will attempt to affect his policies by plumping up his pocketbook will remain very much in play.This week, some of Trump's critics moved forward with legal action. The watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW,           filed a lawsuit alleging that Trump's business holdings violate the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which makes it illegal for government officials to "accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State." CREW's bipartisan legal team includes, among others, Norm Eisen and Richard Painter, who served as ethics lawyers under Presidents Obama and George W. Bush, respectively; Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard University; and Zephyr Teachout, a professor at Fordham University (and former congressional candidate) who is considered an authority on the Emoluments Clause. All have           been           vocally           critical of Trump's continued refusal to sell off his business, and are now taking their case to court to argue that several of Trump's businesses present avenues by which foreign governments could seek to influence the president by, for example, booking stays at one of his hotels or renting space at one of his properties. Additionally, the lawsuit seeks to force Trump to reveal his tax returns, something every president has done since Gerald Ford but which Trump has refused to do,           significantly limiting the public's ability to understand the president's finances. When asked about the lawsuit, Trump           described it as "totally without merit."           Eisen was quick to respond on Twitter, offering to "debate Trump (or his chosen champion) on the merits of our case anytime," making it clear that CREW intends to continue to pursue its case. (CREW has also           filed a separate complaint to the General Services Administration arguing that Trump has violated the lease on his Washington, D.C. hotel,           which states that "no ... elected official of the Government of the United States ... shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom.")Though CREW is the first group to bring a lawsuit against President Trump, it may soon have company.           According to The New York Times, Anthony Romero, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, has said that his organization is looking for a plaintiff to sue Trump for violating the Emoluments Clause, although with a different claim to legal standing: While CREW intends to demonstrate that the group itself has suffered financial harm because the need to focus on the Emoluments Clause has diverted its resources away from other worthy causes, the ACLU is hoping to find a hotel or bed-and-breakfast owner that can prove he or she has lost business to one of Trump's hotels during his presidency.CREW's lawsuit is just the latest development in what promises to be a continuing saga regarding Trump's many conflicts of interest that began almost as soon as he won the presidency. Along with his unprecedented wealth, Trump brings to the office unique and gravely concerning entanglements that, whether he recognizes their effects or not, threaten to undermine his decision-making as president. The plan Trump and Dillon           announced on January 11 would do very little to resolve the conflicts: It places control of his assets in the hands of his two adult sons and a longtime associate of their father's with what so far amounts to a pinky-swear assurance that, despite their proximity to the president, they will not discuss any aspect of the business with him. On top of that, the plan supposedly           would terminate several of the Trump Organization's pending deals and place a ban on new foreign deals, two conditions undermined by the announcement that the organization would be moving forward with expanding its golf course in Aberdeen, Scotland.Even before his most recent plan was laid out, Trump has attempted to deflect criticism by           repeatedly           asserting that the law barring executive-branch officials from maintaining financial holdings or business ties that overlap with their duties does not apply to the president or vice president. In this,           he is correct; the law, passed in 1989,           exempts the two chief executives from conflict-of-interest rules on the understanding that           their purview is so broad that it would be impossible for them to completely disentangle themselves.Regardless, legality does not imply propriety. Unless Trump acts to put actual distance between himself and his business ventures, these questions are likely to continue throughout his time in the Oval Office. On top of the aforementioned legal actions, the director of the Office of Government Ethics, Walter Shaub,            has declared Trump's efforts insufficient, remarking, "I don't think divestiture is too high of a price to pay to be the president of the United States," and a number of Senate Democrats            have introduced legislation that would force Trump to divest or face impeachment. Below is an attempt to catalogue the more clear-cut examples of conflicts of interest that have emerged so far.

That means that, rather than the Trump Organization owning and operating the property itself, a third-party hotelier will be paying the president's company for the right to use the Scion name;            candidates identified by the Post include Foxhall Partners, which has two properties in the city and a third under development, and the Beacon Hotel in downtown D.C.But even if it isn't actually owned or operated by the Trump Organization, the new hotel would likely attract scrutiny along the same lines as the Trump International. A licensing agreement means that the president will not be profiting off of the building directly; payments from individuals or organizations booking rooms or events there will not go straight to the Trump Organization, but to the hotelier. But Trump will still have a financial stake in the hotel's viability: The longer it stays in business and the more successful it is, the more (and longer) the licensee will pay to use the Scion name, and the more likely other owners may be to commit to similar partnerships with the fledgling brand. Trump has resigned from his positions with the Trump Organization and transferred control of his assets to his two adult sons and a long-time business partner. But he still owns the company, which means he will still profit from his properties. According to his son Eric,            the president will even continue to receive quarterly reports on how his real-estate empire is faring financially. The pathway to Trump's pocketbook may be slightly more complicated, but it still exists.The proposed new property also engenders some of the same concerns as the broader round of expansions the Trump Organization announced in February. Developing a hotel, even in an existing building, means working with local government bureaucracies, such as zoning offices that sign off on structural changes or licensing boards. In any city, this would create  conflicting incentives for government officials who are suddenly being asked to rule on the president's businesses. On the one hand, Washington, D.C., like many of the cities into which the Trump Organization is looking to expand, voted strongly against the president in the 2016 election; city officials, especially those elected by D.C.'s denizens, may feel a need to factor his unpopularity into their decisions with regard to the newly proposed hotel. On the other hand,            the federal government still controls D.C.'s budget, placing additional pressure to green-light a proposal from the infamously mercurial commander-in-chief.           Back to table of contentsThat Property in AzerbaijanWhen it comes to President Donald Trump's constellation of foreign investments, properties, and companies, much of the attention so far has been on his business's apparent violation of the Constitution's Emoluments Clause, which bars officeholders from taking gifts from foreign leaders.            According to numerous ethics experts, the clause takes an expansive definition of gifts, encompassing everything from a direct bribe to a foreign official's approval of construction of a new Trump property. But some of the Trump Organization's properties raise additional red flags due to the specific partners involved. That's true in Indonesia, for example, where Trump's affiliates have been involved in bribery scandals and radical Islamic nationalist parties, and            Brazil, where the company pulled out of a branding agreement amid a criminal investigation of a local business partner.Such is the case in Azerbaijan, which Transparency International ranks as among the most corrupt countries in the world, where the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Baku remains unopened. Though the long-stalled development has generated a steady drip of news and rumors for years,            an overview by Adam Davidson in The New Yorker, entitled "Donald Trump's Worst Deal," puts into perspective just how convoluted the situation is, and just how much the project has led Trump and his company into a partnership with numerous corrupt officials in the Middle East. The details suggest that, on top of the continual underlying breach of the Emoluments Clause, the Trump Organization's involvement may also violate            the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which forbids American companies from participating, even unknowingly, in bribery schemes in other countries, with a penalty of up to $2 million and up to five years in jail.           According to Davidson, though the project originated in 2008 as a high-end apartment building, the Trump Organization has had a licensing deal with the building's Azerbaijani developers to turn the property into a hotel since 2012. Though the Trump Organization presented the deal as a straightforward licensing agreement, it was in fact a much more involved agreement granting the company-specifically, Trump's daughter Ivanka-extensive oversight over the project. Based on his FEC disclosures in 2016, which as of this moment remain the only official record of Trump's finances, the president has so far made $2.8 million from the partnership.But what makes this story unique among the dozens of ethical questions surrounding the president is the Trump Organization's partners on the project. Ostensibly, the main developer behind the property is            Anar Mammadov. He is in turn the son of Azerbaijan's transportation minister Ziya Mammadov, who was once            described in a leaked diplomatic cable as "notoriously corrupt even for Azerbaijan." Also in on the deal, though not initially publicly disclosed, is Ziya's brother Elton, who founded the company that currently owns the property in Baku while serving in Azerbaijan's parliament. Then there's the Mammadovs' relationships with Iranian oligarchs. For years, the Mammadovs have been closely linked with the Darvishis, whose members include the head of a  construction firm implicated in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard's possibly illicit financial operations and the former leader of a company that was sanctioned by the United States for its role in Iran's attempts to develop an arsenal of nuclear missiles. As the Mammadovs' influence within Azerbaijan has begun to weaken in recent years, they have  increased both their wealth and their mutually profitable relationship with the Darvishis, green-lighting a number of deals that will prove lucrative for both families.Alan Garten, the chief legal officer for the Trump Organization,            asserted to The New Yorker that, as the company has never worked directly with Ziya or Elton Mammadov, it has not engaged in any behavior that should trip ethical alarms. He has additionally claimed that the company did "extensive due diligence" in making the deal, which did not raise "any red flags," although the actual employees who carried out the process are no longer with the company.Still, merely by partnering with the Mammadov family, the Trump Organization may have violated the FCPA. The law explicitly covers cases in which an American company claims not to have known it was working with corrupt officials; jurisprudence since its 1977 passage has further expanded the law's definition to include "conscious avoidance," or active efforts by an American company to not learn of a foreign partner's corruption. So though Garten claims that, since the Trump Organization did not have enough control over the project and has not itself engaged in bribery, its hands are essentially clean, experts on the law say that the Trump Organization may be legally liable if its foreign partners engaged in corrupt practices.Adding to all this is the fact that Trump is on the record as opposing the FCPA in May 2012, right when it would have become relevant to his company's engagement in Azerbaijan.            Trump called the law "absolutely horrible" and argued that, since other countries do not have the same provision, American corporations are at a major disadvantage in which bribery is the norm. Trump's appointee to the Securities and Exchange Commission (which enforces the statute), Jay Clayton, similarly            considers the FCPA an obstacle to U.S. companies seeking to expand abroad. A dissenting voice on the topic is Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who stated in his confirmation hearings that he            intends to continue enforcing the statute. Which of these voices will end up winning out on the topic remains an open question.This, then, is the situation in which the Trump Organization-and, by extension, the president, who has stepped down from his position within the business but who retains ownership-finds itself in Azerbaijan: The company's direct partner on Trump Tower Baku is the scion of a wealthy and notoriously corrupt family that appears to have only stepped up its self-dealing as its political power wanes. That family is engaged in what appears to be a relationship of mutual graft with Iranian oligarchs with deep connections to their country's Revolutionary Guard, the ideological militia widely suspected by the international community of gross corruption and sponsoring terror at home and abroad.These families can be added to the ever-growing list of international partners whose relationships with the Trump Organization could create conflicts of interest for the president. The Mammadovs' arrangement with Trump's company may not only violate the Emoluments Clause but could also feasibly put the president and his family in legal trouble should the SEC choose to actively pursue enforcement of the FCPA in Azerbaijan. And the Darvishis could in turn use their relationship to influence the Mammadovs, which could have significant implications should Trump attempt, as he has said he will, to take hard-line stances that could affect the Iranian Revolutionary Guard's activities. And if Trump so chooses, he could direct the Justice Department to curtail its enforcement of the FCPA or even use his bully pulpit to lead a legislative push to undo it, essentially condoning unethical behavior that in many countries enables leaders to personally profit at the expense of their own citizens-which, of course, could be a fair way to characterize the current situation with Trump's business holdings.           Back to table of contentsThat Trump Tower PenthouseWith President Trump in office and still refusing to distance himself from his businesses, every new tenant in one of his buildings creates another possibility of a conflict of interest. Such is the case with Xiao Yan Chen, who also goes by Angela Chen, a business executive who, according to            documents filed with the New York City Department of Finance, purchased a $15.8 million penthouse apartment at Trump Tower in New York on February 21. Chen's transaction is            the first notable real-estate deal involving one of Trump's properties since the election, although it should be noted that she has lived in a different unit in Trump Tower since 2004. And though Trump has officially removed himself from the board of directors of Trump Park Avenue LLC, the corporation that runs Trump Tower, he remains the company's owner, meaning that he profits from its dealings.Chen's purchase represents the exact kind of entanglement that has fueled concerns that Trump's financial interests could influence his decision-making as president. Chen is the founder and managing director of Global Alliance Associates, a consulting firm that,            according to its website, "facilitates the right strategic relationships with the most prominent public and private decision makers in China." The firm is explicit about what it sells:            access. Though the page            listing its partnerships is currently empty, the firm's "           affiliates" page includes a number of international organizations promoting relationships between private corporations and the governments of the United States and China, including the            USA-China Chamber of Commerce,            the Asia Society, and            the China Institute. Notably, Global Alliance Associates also consults for the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Trade & Development Agency, meaning that Trump is accepting money from the founder and managing director of a firm that works with the U.S. government.Because Trump is holding onto his businesses, he has created a situation in which some of his earnings include money from the leader of a company whose sole goal is to help its clients curry favor with the Chinese government; it's no stretch to believe that her move to Trump Tower and the money it puts in Trump's pocket may help her gain access to the United States government. (Reached for comment by            the New York Post, Chen said she was "not comfortable" discussing the purchase and its possible ramifications for her company.) Even if it wasn't Chen's intention, the transaction still could influence the president. As the president's conflicts of interest continually accumulate, the likelihood that one or more will eventually impact his decision-making continually grows-as does the appearance that he is ethically compromised by the many people, organizations, and governments from which he is receiving money while in office.           Back to table of contentsThat Resort in the Dominican RepublicThe Trump Organization's January 11 pledge that it would no longer be pursuing new deals in foreign countries is looking increasingly toothless. Shortly after President Donald Trump took office,            The Guardian reported that the president's business would be            moving forward with a planned expansion of its golf course in Aberdeen. Now, the            Associated Press has reported that the company is working on a licensing deal in the Dominican Republic.As was true with the Aberdeen plans, the Trump Organization has provided a narrow justification under which it argues that the news does not violate its promise. Technically, it argues,            the deal is not new: The Trump Organization has had a contract with Ricardo and Fernando Hazoury, the brothers who own the Cap Cana Resort in the Dominican Republic, since 2007. But the financial crisis and disagreements between the Trump family and the Hazoury brothers, which climaxed with Eric Trump            accusing the pair of "textbook fraud" in a 2012 lawsuit, had stalled the arrangement for nearly a decade, and the two parties haven't written a new contract since the 2007 deal was struck. Even            other real-estate developers have said that the resumption of the relationship between the Trumps and Hazourys caught them by surprise. For their part, the Hazourys            have said that the relationship with the Trumps "remains incredibly strong, especially with Eric, who has led this project since its conception."The development in the Dominican Republic epitomizes the way the Trump Organization seems intent to violate the spirit of their "no new foreign deals" pledge, and arguably even the letter. Asked about the Organization's justification for the deal, Richard Painter, who served as the ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush,            noted that the company "can take the tiniest little past involvement in something and then extend it into an enormous new deal" and hasn't presented a meaningful way "to distinguish between new business and old business." Already, the Trump Organization has provided excuses for moving forward with two projects based on an interpretation of its own pledge that seems predicated on the idea that a deal can only be described as "new" if there had never been any relationship whatsoever between the Trump family and the property in question. As the company finds more explanations to broaden what initially seemed to be a clear-cut policy to reduce conflicts of interest-arguably, the only step in Trump's plan that actually would have helped him do so-the pledge will likely become increasingly meaningless.The Cap Cana story is yet another conflict of interest that only became public because of reporting from local media-and because of the nonchalance with which the Trump family handles the relationship between their business and the presidency. The first outlet to report on Eric's trip was            the Dominican newspaper Diario Libre, shortly after Cap Cana            posted a picture of the Hazourys with Eric on its website. This follows stories like the president's            phone call with the president of Argentina and his company's            plans to expand into Taiwan, both of which were similarly broken by local newspapers before getting picked up by American press outlets. Further, like the president's            post-election meeting with business partners from India and            Eric's trip to Uruguay, the Trump family's propensity for photo ops played a role: Even amid intensifying scrutiny of the Trump Organization's actions, Eric seems unworried about having not only taken the trip but also taken pictures with his business partners.The president's putative pick for his ambassador to the Dominican Republic only adds to the perception that Trump will intermingle business and politics in the country.            Trump has picked Robin Bernstein, a campaign donor, business partner, and founding member of Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club, to be his administration's representative in the country. Bernstein and her husband Richard have been in business with the president and his company for decades through            The Americas Group, a consulting and marketing firm focused on construction projects in Latin America and the Caribbean. Choosing personal friends and supporters to be ambassadors is relatively common, especially in countries with which the United States has relatively uncomplicated relations. However, Trump's decision to appoint somebody with whom he has long maintained a financial relationship-           his second such appointment, after having named fellow billionaire real-estate developer and business partner Steven Roth to head his infrastructure program-suggests a continued willingness to blur the lines between his endeavors as a businessman and his duties as president, all while contributing to the perception that the president is willing to reward those who have done business with him in the past.           Back to table of contentsThat Chinese TrademarkOn February 15, President Trump scored a long-sought-after victory when a Chinese court            ruled in his favor in a trademark dispute. In the case, which dragged on for more than a decade, the Trump Organization won sole rights to use the president's name on products in the country, which would help prevent a bevy of unrelated entrepreneurs from applying it to            a wide range of products, from toilets to clothing to condoms to explosives.Almost immediately, Trump's critics pointed out that the ruling poses a clear conflict of interest. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California            called the trademark decision "deeply troubling," adding, "If this isn't a violation of the Emoluments Clause, I don't know what is." Some, including Feinstein, went further in their assertions: Only days before, Trump had apparently reversed one of his stances toward China by            offering a full-throated endorsement of the "One China Policy" (under which countries officially recognize the mainland Chinese government but not Taiwan),            leading to the suggestion that the court's decision was part of a quid-pro-quo deal between the two governments.Additional context, though, complicates this picture. The case, it turns out, was            largely resolved in November 2016, before there was any indication that the president would            waffle on the One China Policy by calling the president of Taiwan, and was the            culmination of more than a decade of litigation that largely predates Trump's involvement in politics.            Conflicts of this kind over trademarks are fairly common in China, and, though resolving such cases often costs companies significant time and money, the Trump Organization's victory is            one           of           several that have gone in favor of American corporations in recent years. None of this rules out the possibility of a quid-pro-quo arrangement, but in sum it suggests that there is more to the case than what Feinstein alleges.Whether or not the Chinese government tried to curry favor with the president by seeing to it that the court ruled in his favor, Trump's newly awarded trademark poses a conflict of interest that could impact his future interactions with China. On top of the questions around his adherence, or lack thereof, to the One China Policy, Trump has taken a number of controversial stands when it comes to China, from            accusing the country of currency manipulation to threatening to take            hard-line trade positions that experts worry            could lead to a trade war. Over all of these questions will loom the president's knowledge that, with its trademark now secured, his company has an ongoing profitable relationship with the Chinese government-which, even if Trump does not proactively consider it in approaching the negotiating table, could provide his Chinese counterparts with leverage to influence the president's decisions.           Back to table of contentsThat Meeting at Mar-a-LagoOf his first three weekends in office, President Donald Trump spent two of them away from Washington, D.C., at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida. On his first trip to the resort, which he has dubbed his "Winter White House," Trump spent time on the golf course, attended a ball held by the Red Cross-a federally chartered organization over which he will likely be tasked to wield authority while in office-and held a Super Bowl party at which he hobnobbed with wealthy patrons.His third weekend in office, Trump brought a guest of honor along with him: the prime minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe. After first meeting with Abe at the real White House, Trump took his Japanese counterpart to Florida for a weekend on the links. The biggest controversy out of the weekend was over the president's handling of a situation that developed on Saturday, February 11: As news of a North Korean missile test broke during dinner, Trump and Abe            discussed the situation in public, using light from phones of gathered onlookers to read briefing documents, an incredibly lax approach to information security, particularly ironic given that Trump won in part because of his opponent's            own lapses in information security.The situation perfectly encapsulates the way the president's business interests are coming up against those of the country. Already, the Trump Organization's decision to double Mar-a-Lago's initiation fees led to accusations of profiteering, premised on the notion that people would be willing to pony up in the hopes of earning an audience with the commander-in-chief.The events of Saturday, February 11 took the problem to a whole new level. By discussing the recently obtained intelligence with Abe without leaving the table, the president committed a breach of international-security protocol in a very public setting. Even had the meeting been taking place in the White House, Trump's lackadaisical approach to information security would have been cause for concern; for self-evident reasons, briefings on urgent security situations do not typically happen in somewhat open settings around civilians. But on the patio at Mar-a-Lago, the situation becomes much more dangerous, because the patio is not a secure setting, and the administration does not appear to have taken measures to make it one. This is a perfect example of a conflict of interest in practice: Trump has an incentive to host an event at Mar-a-Lago (personal financial gain) that runs directly counter to what would be best for the country's security (hosting the event at the White House or an otherwise secure location). Not only that, part of the appeal of Mar-a-Lago is that guests will have a front-row ticket to see Trump at work. Previous presidents like Barack Obama, meanwhile, took a more conventional, and far more secure, approach,            setting up a mobile security perimeter known as a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF, to ensure that nobody in the area could look in on or overhear the president's dealings.According to the president's Press Secretary Sean Spicer, Mar-a-Lago does, in fact,            have a SCIF on site that they used for the remainder of the Trump's conversation about North Korea with Abe. That they apparently began their discussion at the dinner table before deploying the SCIF underscores the problem of the situation at Mar-a-Lag Trump has a financial incentive to hold an open-air meeting like Saturday night's to keep up the appearance that, by paying to be a member of his exclusive club, anyone can have access to the most powerful man in the world.Who could have been present? The club's membership list is private, meaning that the American public has no way of knowing who was around to overhear the conversation. (Two Democratic senators, Tom Udall and Sheldon Whitehouse,            have introduced a bill to change this fact, but there is little evidence suggesting it has any hopes of passing through the Republican-held Congress.) Nor have the Trump Organization and White House been forthcoming as to how they intend to screen club members and employees for security clearance; though Udall and Whitehouse reached out to the administration to ask how Mar-a-Lago vets guests for security risks, but received no response. In such a public place, and without protective measures like a SCIF, there may not be anything to stop an agent of a foreign government or other malicious actor from paying the $200,000 initiation fee to stay at the club, effectively paying to be near to the president when he receives sensitive information. Unless Trump takes significant steps either to erect barriers between himself and the guests at Mar-a-Lago-which he certainly didn't do this time, and which could reduce his ability to profit from the property-there is a real possibility that he will continue to compromise his country's interests when he travels to his resort in Palm Beach.One patron of the club, Richard DeAgazio, demonstrated just how much of a breakdown the situation represents. DeAgazio, who, according to            a photo he posted on Facebook, joined the club in December after Trump's election, snapped            several pictures of the president and prime minister's conversation, which helped corroborate            a CNN report on the public nature of the ad-hoc meeting and details such as the use of cellphone flashlights to illuminate documents; he also took pictures with            Trump's chief strategist Steve Bannon and            the president's "body man," whose job is in part to carry the "nuclear football" containing missile-launch codes (and who was initially            identified by name in the photo's caption). As if to reinforce impression that Mar-a-Lago members gain unprecedented access to the the president, even in the middle of a crisis situation,            another patron was able to film Trump giving a toast at a wedding shortly after his press conference with Abe.There is no reason to believe that DeAgazio had any intention of compromising international security with his pictures; he appears to simply be a wealthy Trump supporter who was excited at the chance to see his commander-in-chief in action and wanted photographs with which to remember the occasion. (He has since apparently either deleted his Facebook profile or increased his privacy settings so that it is no longer publicly accessible.) Nevertheless, he demonstrated just how Trump's continued commingling of his business interests and his presidency places not just Americans but the entire global community in jeopardy.In a way, the sheer enormity of the situation at Mar-a-Lago briefly crowded out the fact that merely bringing Abe to Mar-a-Lago demonstrates Trump's conflicts of interest neatly. Though diplomatic meetings outside the White House are not unprecedented, Trump's trip with Abe is likely the first instance of the president actually making money from such a meeting. Though Trump            said that he was footing Abe's bill, with both increased Secret Service presence and Abe's retinue on hand, there's a distinct possibility that, at some point in the weekend, somebody from the U.S. or Japanese government made a payment that ended up in Trump's pocket. On top of that, the visit generated an inordinate amount of free publicity for Mar-a-Lago, which Trump            repeatedly           mentioned (and            posted photos of) on his social media accounts and was continually noted in coverage of the weekend.           Back to table of contentsThat Defense Department Trump Tower RentalPresident Donald Trump's most iconic property is about to get a new tenant: the Department of Defense.            According to CNN, the Pentagon, hewing to a longstanding policy of establishing an offshoot headquarters near the president's private, non-White House residence, is planning to lease space in Trump Tower in New York City to maintain close proximity to Trump should he choose to spend time there instead of Washington, D.C..The Department of Defense's decision is yet another example of how Trump's decision to hold onto his business interests is rewriting norms surrounding the presidency and creating problems in what were once uncontroversial procedures. As mentioned above, the Department of Defense's decision is not unique to Trump's presidency:            They took up residence in Chicago, for example, during Barack Obama's two terms for the exact same reason.The difference, as is true in so many of the stories surrounding Trump and his family's conflicts of interest-           the Red Cross's decision to hold its annual ball at Mar-a-Lago, for example, or            Eric Trump's business trip to Uruguay-is that the president himself is now making money off of routine governmental functions. Exactly how much money remains unknown, as the Department of Defense has yet to publicly state how much space they will be renting and for how long. However, details of            the Secret Service's decision to do the same are instructive as to the general scope of the bill. When that news first broke back in November 2016, the New York Post used publicly available information regarding rents at Trump Tower            to deduce that, at a cost of up to $105 per square foot, the Secret Service's decision to occupy two 3,000- to 5,000-square-foot floors of the building could cost taxpayers more than $3 million a year, a significant portion of which would be going to the Trump Organization, and, by extension, the president himself.Just how much the DoD will be paying the Trump Organization for the privilege of working out of the president's property is not the only outstanding question. Trump's protestations to the contrary aside,            scientific evidence shows that the mere knowledge that one has profited from a relationship in the past often leads to preferential behavior, which could lead Trump to favor the Pentagon in his decision-making. As a result, beyond the overarching problem of a government agency paying the president himself a large sum of money to set up shop in the president's property, the Department of Defense's decision to rent space in Trump Tower could have significant ramifications for how the Trump White House operates.           Back to table of contentsThat Red Cross BallThe web of President Donald Trump's conflicts of interest has grown to encompass the American Red Cross, which            held its annual ball on Saturday, February 4, at Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida. By hosting the ball, the Trump Organization accepted money from an organization that, while not a federal agency per se, is subject to federal oversight that at some point in the next four years will likely involve President Trump.Unlike a number of the events at Trump properties that have been featured in this list of Trump's conflicts of interest, the Red Cross Ball, which celebrated the organization's centennial anniversary, appears to have been scheduled before Trump even received the Republican nomination for president;            a calendar listing on the website of the Coastal Star, a local newspaper covering events in the Palm Beach area, is recorded as having been placed in April 2016. Additionally, though the event            has been held elsewhere in the past, this was not the first time it has taken place at Mar-a-Lag Not only was            last year's ball held there, but            the very first Red Cross Ball was hosted there by the property's prior owner, the famous socialite Marjorie Merriweather Post.Given all that, there is no indication that the decision to hold the event at Mar-a-Lago had anything to do with Trump's election, and the fact that Trump will likely be            attending the event is not unusual-President Barack Obama also            attended as the honorary chairman of the organization while in office. Nevertheless, the ball perfectly encapsulates why Trump's continued refusal to relinquish his business interests complicates even situations that would have taken place had he not become president.Thanks in part to the makeup of the Red Cross's leadership and its unique relationship with the federal government, the ball creates a particularly complicated situation.            According to its website, the Red Cross "is not a federal agency, nor [does it] receive federal funding on a regular basis to carry out our services and programs," instead relying on donations and fees for services like health-and-safety training courses. However, the organization            operates under a federal charter as a "federal instrumentality ... to carry out responsibilities delegated to [it] by the federal government." The best-known of these duties include overseeing blood-donation drives and disaster-relief efforts;            according to its website, it is also the Red Cross's duty "to fulfill the provisions of the Geneva Convention" and "provide family communications and other forms of support to the U.S. military." Further, the organization has a chairperson appointed by the president; currently, the chairwoman is            Bonnie McElveen-Hunter, who was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2004. The charter also periodically            comes before Congress for review and amendments to be signed into effect by the president.On multiple occasions in recent years, the Red Cross has come under scrutiny for how it handles            its multi-billion-dollar budget, most of which comprises donations from the American public. Prompted in part by reporting on the organization's            inadequate response to Hurricane Sandy,            misleading statements about how it uses its money,            and           a September 2015 report           by the Governmental Accountability Office, two congresspeople-one Democrat and one Republican-have independently            introduced           measures to increase the organization's transparency. Neither has been enacted, but there will likely be another push to improve the relationship between the federal government and the Red Cross during Trump's presidency, whether via a review of the Red Cross's charter, the need to appoint a new chairperson, or the introduction of reform-minded legislation. If and when Trump is called upon to weigh in on these decisions, he will be asked to do so having directly profited from the organization while in office, which could limit his ability to act in the best interests of the American people.           Back to table of contentsThat D.C. Labor DisputeOne month before he took office, President Donald Trump managed to sidestep            a potential conflict of interest at his hotel in Las Vegas. In the fall of 2015, several hundred employees at the city's Trump International Hotel had voted to join the local branch of the Culinary Workers Union, only to find their efforts stalled by Trump and the hotel's co-owner, Phil Ruffin. The case languished for more than a year until, after the National Labor Relations Board            found Trump and Ruffin in violation of federal law, the workers successfully negotiated their first collectively-bargained contract. If this hadn't been resolved, a conflict of interest would have arisen: The case would have gone to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, to which Trump will soon be able to appoint members.Now, the same issue is cropping up at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. Already a centerpiece of            the controversy over the likely violation of the Constitution's Emoluments Clause, the property may soon be the site of another legal tussle:            According to The Washington Post, 40 workers at the hotel have also voted to unionize, the first group to do so at a Trump-owned establishment since his election.As was true in Las Vegas, the push for unionization in D.C., if it's met with resistance from the hotel, would create an opportunity for the president to place his own financial interests above those of the hotel's workers. In Las Vegas, the dispute appears to have been resolved partly because of the NLRB's intercession; if the Trump Organization similarly contests the case in D.C., the NLRB may once again be asked to weigh in. And now that Trump is president, he will be appointing new board members to fill            two vacancies on the agency's five-seat panel, which could very well tip it from its current left-leaning, labor-friendly composition to a more conservative, pro-owner bent. If, as in Las Vegas, the NLRB finds in favor of the workers, but the Trump Organization chooses to continue its opposition, there is a possibility that the case could come before a federal appeals court, where judges who Trump himself may have appointed will be asked to review the NLRB's decision. And if the conflict continues even beyond the Court of Appeals, it will fall to the Supreme Court, to which Trump recently nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch, to render a final verdict. (It should be added that each appointee will be faced with the possibility of ruling against the financial interests of the infamously vindictive man to whom they owe their position.)Appointing labor-unfriendly officials and justices might fairly be said to be in keeping with            Trump's           long           history of questionable labor practices, but this does not mean that the conflict-of-interest question will dissipate. It's difficult, if not impossible, to determine how much his pro-business stances are dictated by a sincere belief in their efficacy rather than an understanding that he himself has benefited from them in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future. As such, Trump's motivations will continue to occupy an ethical and legal gray area until he eliminates the overlap between his roles as a businessman and as president.           Back to table of contentsThat Estate in Palm BeachEven before President Donald Trump took office, Mar-a-Lago, his golf club in Palm Beach, Florida, was involved in instances of self-dealing that attracted scrutiny. During the presidential campaign, David Fahrenthold of The Washington Post discovered that Trump            used donated funds to buy a $20,000 portrait of himself to reside at the resort and that he used foundation money to            settle a lawsuit over the size of the his flag on the property. Then, on New Year's Day, footage emerged from an event the previous evening at Mar-a-Lago in which Trump            praised an Emirati business partner to the assembled crowd, seemingly confirming that those who have done business with the president in the past may receive preferential treatment in the future.Now, it appears that Trump may be exploiting his new position to make more money off of the club. On January 25, NBC reported that            the resort had doubled its initiation fee, from $100,000 to $200,000. The increase, which took effect on January 1, is the first change to the cost of admission since 2012, when, amid a decline in membership in the aftermath of the Bernie Madoff scandal (which affected a large number of Palm Beach residents), the club made the exact opposite decision, halving the fee from $200,000 to $100,000.The increase drew widespread criticism due to the perception that Trump is using the presidency to pad his wallet. As Mar-a-Lago's owner, Trump directly profits from any increase in revenues at the club. He has also            designated it his "winter White House," meaning there's plenty of reason to believe that people will be willing to pony up the increased initiation fee for the chance to rub shoulders with him, whether that means an opportunity to actually talk to him about an issue or just for the chance that they'll catch his eye and make a good impression.On the surface, the situation appears similar to previous examples of access-selling; there's a long history of wealthy citizens paying large sums of money to attend events where they may have a chance to bend a politician's ear. What makes this case different is that, while such events usually benefit a charity or campaign, here, Trump himself will be the beneficiary.           Back to table of contentsThose Expansion PlansOf the measures that President Donald Trump and his lawyer Sheri Dillon            laid out at his January 11 press conference to address conflicts of interest, only two actually ameliorate any of the concerns critics have raised: the cancellation of all of the Trump Organization's pending deals and the promise not to pursue expansion in other countries (although            developments since the announcement suggest that those pledges leave plenty of wiggle room). Conveniently left out of the plan, however, is any prohibition on expanding holdings within the United States-which is apparently something that Trump Hotels plans on doing while Trump is in office.On January 25,            Bloomberg reported that Eric Danziger, the CEO of Trump Hotels, said after a panel discussion in Los Angeles that the company is considering tripling the number of Trump-branded properties within the U.S. According to Danziger, "There are 26 major metropolitan areas in the U.S., and we're in five. I don't see any reason that we couldn't be in all of them eventually." Danziger listed Dallas, Seattle, Denver, and San Francisco as among the cities where the Trump Organization is looking to build in the near future.As the Trump Organization's holdings expand, so too does the potential that business considerations will have undue effects on the president's behavior in office, or at least appear to. Each location presents another opportunity for businesspeople or foreign dignitaries to choose to stay in a hotel in an attempt to burnish Trump's opinion of them, their company, and/or their country. Each location increases the number of municipal governments with whom Trump will be interacting both as president and as the owner of a real-estate empire.Trump Hotels' expansion plans could put not only Trump but also the cities where new properties may be built in a difficult situation. San Francisco, for example, is            currently experiencing a housing crisis, one possible solution to which would be to increase the pace of new home-construction projects, some of which could be funded by federal grants. On the one hand, it is almost certain that the residents of San Francisco, a city that            voted against the president by roughly a 9-to-1 margin in November, would strenuously object to a new Trump-branded property in the city. But there is also an incentive for the city government to work with the Trump Organization in finding a suitable expansion plan. With plenty of evidence to suggest that collaborating with Trump's businesses could influence the president, there's added pressure for city officials to pursue a potentially costly project residents may otherwise not want in hopes of reaping the benefits down the road. Meanwhile, the officials in charge of doling out federal largesse such as housing grants may similarly feel pressure based on the knowledge that Trump's feelings toward particular cities may change based on how receptive the locale was of his business's expansion plans.Finally, the Trump Organization's announcement that it would be pursuing expansion further attests to just how little the president's plan to mitigate his conflicts of interest actually accomplishes its goal. For the Trump Organization to not just expand but do so on such a large scale violates the professed spirit of the measures laid out on January 11 and defies any argument that the company will cease to act in a way that jeopardizes the president's ability to do his job.           Back to table of contentsThat Hotel in VancouverLess than a week into his administration, President Trump has a new property opening for business: the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Vancouver.            According to The Washington Post, construction on the hotel finished shortly before Trump assumed office, with the building's finishing touch-the president's name spelled out in giant letters-revealed on January 19 (the day before the inauguration), and the first guests and permanent residents checking in on January 25.As with many buildings bearing the president's name, the new hotel in Vancouver is a licensing deal, with the Trump Organization leasing its branding to a third party-in this case, a real-estate company called            the Holborn Group, which operates several luxury hotels throughout Canada. The Holborn Group is run by Joo Kim Tiah, the eldest son of one of the wealthiest families in Malaysia;            several members of Tiah's family are expected to fly in from Kuala Lumpur to attend the opening with the president's two adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric.The building is yet another manifestation of the running problem posed by Trump's extensive foreign real-estate holdings. Unless the president actually rids himself of his financial stake in his company, every Trump property influences his incentives when it comes to making policy, foreign or domestic: Should he act in the manner that best serves the country, or the one that will protect his profits? Every building provides the opportunity for third parties to curry favor with the infamously capricious president: If he knows that he has taken money from somebody, be it a company, a private individual, or agents of a foreign government, that knowledge, and the goodwill it creates, is likely to color Trump's decision-making. Moreover, every businessperson who has a licensing deal with Trump now has leverage: If Tiah, or any of the other businesspeople around the world with a Trump-branded property, disagrees with a decision the president makes, he can threaten to pull out of the partnership and jeopardize some of Trump's cash-flow in an attempt to change his mind.Hardly a day had passed between the new hotel in Vancouver opening for business and the first report of an organization choosing to host an event at the site, possibly for political reasons. On January 26,            The Washington Post reported that The American Chamber of Commerce in Canada, a business organization affiliated with the conservative U.S. Chamber of Commerce, had scrapped longstanding plans to hold a meeting about trade relations at the home of a diplomatic official and would instead be booking space in the new Trump Hotel for the equivalent of roughly $1,900-a relatively small sum, to be sure, but            even small sums have been shown to substantially influence decision making. The change initially prompted at least one planned speaker, the University of British Columbia professor Matilde Bombardini, to back out of the event; however,            according to the Vancouver Sun, she has since changed her mind after being told that the change of location was due to a leak at the previous site.As with so many of the instances chronicled here, the venue change demonstrates how Trump's conflicts of interest often operate in shades of grey. If the Chamber of Commerce did make its decision solely based on logistics, booking a spot in a Trump-branded building still makes possible the appearance of paying for play. In a marked departure from the Chamber's            copacetic relationship with the Republican nominee Mitt Romney in 2012, the aggressively free-market, pro-trade group            clashed with the president           on multiple occasions during the 2016 campaign over Trump's protectionist trade policies, but            has already made public overtures since the election to reconcile with the president. If it did, in fact, choose to move the event even in part because of the giant name on the new location's facade, the decision represents another chapter in the ongoing saga of the business community's desire to both please and sway a president whose ideology is not that of a typical Republican. Additionally, though nearly all of Trump's rhetoric about NAFTA centers on Mexico, Canada actually            trades more with the U.S. than not just Mexico but any other country in the world. As such, there is plenty incentive for the Canadian branch of the American Chamber of Commerce to do whatever it can to reach out to Trump.           Back to table of contentsThat Reality-Television ShowThough President Donald Trump has been a well-known figure in American public life for decades, perhaps the single biggest contributor to his stardom has been NBC's The Apprentice. Trump himself is no longer the star of the show-former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger            has taken over as host in 2017-but the president            remains an executive producer on the series for at least the coming year, including receiving a low five-figure salary for the position,            according to Variety. Shortly after the news of that income broke, Kellyanne Conway, a counselor to Trump, clarified that he would be taking on his producing duties            in his spare time, comparing the situation to previous presidents playing golf or pursuing other leisure activities.Norm Eisen and Richard Painter, who served as the chief ethics lawyers under Presidents Obama and George W. Bush, respectively,            pointed out on NPR's Fresh Air that Trump's ongoing involvement with The Apprentice presents yet another conflict of interest.            According to AdWeek, 11 companies, including the television-shopping network QVC and Carnival Company (which operates the eponymous cruise line), are providing on-air sponsorships for the newest season of The Apprentice; a twelfth,            the Japanese motorcycle company Kawasaki, withdrew from a previously reported deal after customers threatened a boycott because of its sponsorship of the show. All of these companies-plus the numerous companies that run ads during the show's commercial breaks-are effectively putting money into the pockets of the president, not to mention supporting one of his products.Trump apparently believes himself immune to such conflicts of interest, both in terms of legal impunity and his ability to ignore them, despite a good deal of research            indicating that even minuscule financial incentives (minuscule for a billionaire, that is) can be enough to significantly influence behavior. Additionally, there is little doubt that Trump cares deeply about the ongoing success of The Apprentice: The weekend after the new Schwarzenegger-led season debuted,            the then president-elect took to Twitter to voice his thoughts on the new season's ratings. So when one of the companies that sponsors the show interacts with the executive branch-as when            Carnival reached a $40 million settlement with the U.S. government over pollution in the Atlantic Ocean, for example, or when            QVC settled a $7.5 million suit regarding deceptive advertising in 2009-the question will necessarily arise how their contributions to Trump's pocketbook and beloved TV show will affect the outcome.Even if Trump were able to fully blind himself to the conflicts described above, the president's role would remain a problem because it provides an unprecedented bargaining chip for both the companies currently sponsoring in the show and those that could seek to use it to attempt to manipulate the president. Consider, for a moment, the potential negotiations between one of Trump's sponsors and a government agency that finds it in violation of federal regulations. That company, though, has a trump card the likes of which has never been seen in American politics: Should it become apparent that the case is going awry, they can threaten to pull their support of the president's television show. The move would inevitably make waves on cable news of the kind that Trump has repeatedly demonstrated himself to be susceptible to. Any decision, whether in favor of the company or against it, immediately loses credibility: If the company is found guilty, the decision is easily framed as retaliatory, a vindictive manifestation of the president's ego and narcissism; if the company is let off the hook, it will appear that the company has manipulated his venality for its own gain. A formerly uninvolved company facing federal investigation could essentially pull the same gambit in reverse: By publicly committing to sponsor The Apprentice, a company could create a situation in which any decision appears to reflect not the facts of the case but the sticky situation created by its involvement with the show. In this sense, then, Trump's decision to stay on as executive producer, and the conflicts of interest the position creates, jeopardizes not only the president's ability to carry out his job but also the fundamental legitimacy of the rule of law for any company that currently is or in the future may become involved with the show.Additionally, the president's continued involvement with the show creates a strange and tricky situation for NBC. Trump's reputation is            inextricably intertwined with            that of the show, meaning that NBC will to some extent be caught between promoting Trump as a successful businessman and doing its journalistic work. The network will likely also be advertising The Apprentice during its other programs, not only through commercials but also possibly in-studio promotions on other shows, creating conflicting incentives for NBC journalists who will be trying simultaneously to talk about the Trump administration fairly while their own network markets one of his products.           Back to table of contentsThat PipelineThe Dakota Access Pipeline, or DAPL, was the subject of           continual controversy during the presidential campaign, drawing months of protests because of the perceived environmental impact it would create by crossing the Missouri River in close proximity to a Standing Rock Sioux reservation. Shortly before the election,           the Army Corps of Engineers announced that it would be halting progress on the pipeline for further environmental review and to study potential routes that might avoid crossing both the river and Native American territory. On January 24, however, only four days after President Trump took office,           he decided to move forward with both DAPL and the Keystone XL pipeline, which           the Obama administration likewise blocked because of environmental and tribal-sovereignty concerns; the Army Corps of Engineers finalized the easement on the project on February 7. Trump has been           vocally supportive of the pipelines for months, claiming that they would create new jobs in construction and the oil industry.Trump's FEC filings, which remain the only public record of his finances, suggest that he may have had an additional incentive to greenlight the projects: According to financial-disclosure forms he filed in June 2015 and May 2016, Trump has owned stock in Energy Transfer Partners,           the company seeking to build DAPL. The stock was worth between $500,001 and $1,000,000 in 2015 and between $15,001 and $50,000 in 2016.The president and one of his spokesmen, Jason Miller, have both stated, without offering evidence, that Trump's stock-related conflicts of interest have been resolved. According to Trump and Miller, the president           sold off his stocks in June of last year specifically to head off concerns that they may influence his decision-making in office. However, they have offered no meaningful evidence to back up their claims-evidence which, in this case, would likely be fairly easy to provide. They could, for example, offer more details on when exactly the stocks were sold beyond simply "           back in June," or explain why they           did not mention the sale until December, just after the election, if the intention was to proactively address conflict-of-interest questions.Given Trump's penchant for dissembling about his personal finances and the lack of evidence that he has sold off his stocks, Trump's decision to push ahead on DAPL and Keystone XL simply underscores the need for him to take larger, and more public, steps to distance himself from his financial interests. Moving forward with the pipelines is not the first instance of Trump making a significant decision that benefits a company whose stock is listed in his financial disclosures. For example, when Trump announced his intention to intervene at the factory of the air-conditioner manufacturer Carrier in Indianapolis,           the Indianapolis Star noted that Trump's filings list stock in Carrier's parent company, United Technologies.           Back to table of contentsThose HUD GrantsAs has been noted on several previous occasions, one of the overarching questions about America's first businessman presidency is just how President Trump's vast empire            will           interact           with federal agencies that answer to him. One of these potentially sticky situations became something of a flashpoint at the hearing for Dr. Ben Carson, Trump's appointee to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development. At the hearing,            Senator Elizabeth Warren pressed Carson over the fact that, as the head of the department, he would be in charge of numerous programs that the president could manipulate to profit his real estate empire, asking Carson, "Can you assure me that not a single taxpayer dollar that you give out will financially benefit the president-elect or his family?" Though Carson did not respond to the question with regard to Trump specifically, he responded that he "will absolutely not play favorites for anyone" or act with an "intention to do anything to benefit any American, particularly." (Warren went on to expound on how            Trump's lack of financial transparency makes it borderline impossible to know if a policy will benefit him.)Warrens's line of questioning was not entirely hypothetical: Trump does, in fact, own properties the maintenance of which falls under HUD's purview. Thanks to an inheritance from his father, the president            holds an ownership stake in-and has made millions from-           Starrett City, a 153-acre, 5,881-unit low-income housing development in Brooklyn. The development,            according to ABC News, receives substantial federal funding via HUD's many programs designed to support low-income renters and homeowners. Trump could easily press for policies that would increase his profits from Starrett, most notably            allowing for the sale of the complex, an action HUD blocked in 2007-and, potentially, to other properties from which he may profit in ways that, without more complete financial information, the American public may not even know.The potential for a profitable relationship with HUD underscores a central problem with Trump's refusal to fully divest from his holdings before entering office. It's not just high-ranking officials who will possess the ability to act in a manner that benefits the president's pocketbook-it's ordinary civil servants as well. Shortly before his inauguration, The Washington Post            noted several additional ways employees in Trump's executive branch could do s Trademark disputes, for instance, will be adjudicated by judges appointed by his Commerce secretary, while the EPA could roll back environmental regulations that reduce profits at his golf courses.Meanwhile, lower-level officials tasked with the day-to-day work of regulating Trump's properties are likely to face pressure as well-if not explicit from superiors, then from the implicit, inescapable knowledge that enforcement decisions will impact the president personally. Federal Aviation Administration inspectors, for instance, are in charge of on-the-spot, random inspections of aircraft, including Trump's, and at one point during the campaign            grounded one of his planes after its registration expired; the Occupational Safety and Health Administration oversees construction sites, and            has fined the Trump Organization on multiple occasions for workplace-safety violations. Only 10 years ago,            politically motivated firings within the Justice Department became one of the many enduring scandals of George W. Bush's administration; with so many executive-branch employees interacting with the president's properties in so many different ways, some will inevitably face difficult decisions between proper enforcement at his expense or looking the other way to stay in the boss's good graces.           Back to table of contentsThat Golf Course in AberdeenThough his golf course at Turnberry is the more famous of his two properties in Scotland, it is Trump's resort in Aberdeen that has attracted attention for the conflicts of interest it created when Trump spoke with the British politician and Brexit cheerleader Nigel Farage about            blocking a proposed wind turbine that Trump believed would have blocked views from the resort. Now, attention has once again turned to Scotland after            The Guardian reported that the Trump Organization will soon be moving forward with a multi-million dollar plan to expand its Aberdeen resort, including a new 450-room, five-star hotel and a second 18-hole golf course.The announced expansion drew criticism almost immediately, especially coming as it did only three days after the press conference at which Trump unveiled his (woefully insufficient) plan to resolve his conflicts of interest.            At the conference, the president and one of his lawyers, Sheri Dillon, announced that the Trump Organization would cease pursuing new foreign investments. Additionally, though neither Trump nor Dillon articulated the promise at the event,            a press release detailing the steps Trump would be taking also states that he has "directed the Trump Organization to terminate all pending deals-over 30 in number."           A representative soon clarified the grounds on which the Trump Organization deemed the expansion permissible in light of these statements. She argued that "implementing future phasing of existing properties does not constitute a new transaction, so we intend to proceed." In other words, plans for the expansion had been drawn up and agreed upon before Trump made his pledge; simply moving forward with the project does not, in their view, breach their commitments to avoid pursuing new foreign investments or moving forward on pending deals.As with so many of the defenses of Trump's behavior when it comes to conflicts of interest, the representative's justification overlooks the actual concerns regarding conflicts of interest: that Trump's relationship with the British government and other foreign-policy questions may be colored by his expectations of what a policy will do to his property values, for instance, or whether wealthy guests will pay for a stay in the interest of currying favor with him. Instead, the argument relies on a tactic Trump and his many surrogates have used with alarming frequency. On several occasions, Trump has come out with what appears to be a clear policy statement, which then becomes increasingly vague as he and his surrogates attempt to justify an action or position. One famous example is his proposal to            ban Muslims from immigrating to the United States: As critics started to question its constitutionality, and as support for the measure declined,            he revised it to a vaguer policy of "extreme vetting," which itself varied significantly depending on who was describing it to whom and what part of the plan they were defending. Here, the Trump Organization has done something similar: In the face of allegations that the Aberdeen development violated the company's pledges regarding conflicts of interest, the pledges have been revised to create a more vague, and therefore more permissive, stance.             As Richard Painter, who served at the chief ethics adviser for President George W. Bush, put it, the new, more ambiguous policy "clearly illustrates that around the world, he will just simply expand around the various holdings and as they continue to expand, the conflicts of interest expand."If, as they argue, the expansion of the Aberdeen golf course constitutes neither a "new foreign deal" nor a "pending deal," that only further complicates the picture regarding the Trump Organization's future behavior during Trump's presidency. The organization currently has several nascent development projects, several of which, including those in            Georgia,            Argentina,            Indonesia, and            Taiwan, have already prompted concerns over conflicts of interest. Trump and Dillon's statements at his press conference appeared to rule out continued development of these properties, but the ongoing development in Scotland calls into question whether other development plans have truly been canceled or whether Trump will find a similarly legalistic framework under which they claim they can proceed. By moving forward in Aberdeen, Trump has demonstrated just how easily he can-and, in all likelihood, will-continue to flout concerns regarding his conflicts of interest by simply redefining the terms of his promises in order to allow for his latest move.           Back to table of contentsThat Other Billionaire New York Real-Estate Developer President Trump's promise to erect a big, beautiful wall between himself and his business lasted slightly more than 48 hours.Almost exactly two days after the January 11 press conference at which Trump announced plans purported to disentangle himself from his namesake business,            the Huffington Post reported that the president had scheduled a meeting with Steven Roth. Roth,            a fellow New York-based billionaire real-estate developer, is in charge of Vornado Realty Trust, an investment firm that co-owns two of Trump's most valuable properties, one in Manhattan and one in San Francisco, and served as an economic adviser during the campaign. What Trump and Roth discussed at their meeting remains unknown, nor is it clear when exactly the meeting was scheduled. Regardless, that the meeting came directly on the heels of the press conference at which Trump and his lawyer laid out a plan supposedly meant to resolve conflicts of interest, throws the reality of the problems that come from having a businessman as president-and one who seems completely uninterested in taking steps that would actually distance him from his business-into sharp relief.Shortly thereafter,            The Wall Street Journal reported that Roth may soon become involved with the Trump administration beyond just his pre-existing friendship and partnership with the president. Trump, it seems, will soon be naming Roth and Richard LeFrak, yet another New York-based billionaire real-estate developer, to oversee a council of 15 to 20 builders and engineers who will be carrying out the president's $1 trillion infrastructure proposal, a situation which itself provides ripe opportunities for the pair to direct federal dollars toward projects from which they will financially benefit. This news comes on top of            a December report in The Washington Post that Roth's firm had put in a bid to rebuild the FBI's headquarters, a deal that could be worth as much as $2 billion. In other words, Trump, mere days after promising to remove himself from his businesses, is instead ushering a longtime partner into his administration.The move could also end up providing yet another avenue by which Trump could enrich himself in office and by which others could attempt to curry favor. Whether or not he intended to do so, the president's decision to place Roth at the head of such a large pool of money sends a signal to other companies about the continued intermingling of his business and his presidency: that working with the Trump Organization can be a path to increased influence or even appointment. And though Trump claims that he will no longer be in involved in day-to-day operations, he will be actively profiting off from the company, meaning that he will be personally making money off of the attempts of others to gain influence over American public policy.           Back to table of contentsThose Indonesian Politicians Despite President Trump's           assurance that he has stopped pursuing deals since the election, his namesake organization apparently moved forward with a pair of projects in Indonesia.           According to The New York Times, the two properties that will bear the Trump name, one overlooking a Hindu temple in Bali and the other abutting a theme park in West Java, presented ethical problems even before the election.To begin with, through his Indonesian partner on the projects, the billionaire media mogul Hary Tanoesoedibjo (known in Indonesia as Hary Tanoe), Trump has forged relationships with several top Indonesian politicians. One such leader is Setya Novanto, the speaker of the country's House of Representatives who           temporarily lost his post for trying to extort $4 billion from the American mining company Freeport-McMoRan (a company which counts Carl Icahn,           who will be serving as a special adviser in Trump's administration, among its largest shareholders, and which has been           frequently criticized by labor advocates and environmentalists). Trump had lunch with Novanto and several other Indonesian politicians during the campaign in September 2015 to discuss the Trump Organization's planned expansion into Indonesia.           At a post-luncheon press conference, Trump pulled Novanto in front of the cameras, calling him "an amazing man" and "one of the most powerful men" and asserting, "we will do great things for the United States." (It is unclear exactly whom Trump meant when he used the word "we.") Trump then asked Novanto to confirm that "they like me in Indonesia," which Novanto did.Another of the politicians who attended the lunch with Trump is Fadli Zon, the vice chairman of Indonesia's House of Representatives, whose district includes one of the cities in which one of the Trump-branded properties will be built.           According to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Zon is associated with a political movement seeking to unseat and jail the current governor of Jakarta, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, also known by his nickname, Ahok, and has spoken at rallies against Ahok. The anti-Ahok movement is           rooted partly in centuries of ethnic tension within the country: Ahok is both Christian, which has made him the target of attacks by hardline clerics claiming to represent Indonesia's Muslim majority, and a member of the country's historically oppressed Chinese minority,           which was the target of a massacre in 1998. Aside from an interim governor appointed half a century ago,           Ahok is the first governor of Jakarta to fall into either category, and           is currently on trial for blasphemy for allegedly insulting the Koran, although Ahok's supporters claim that it is Ahok's accusers who are guilty of blasphemy for denigrating Ahok's Christianity.Both Trump's question to Novanto and Zon's presence at the meeting underscore another difficulty the president introduces into the United States' relations with Indonesia. Indonesia is both           the largest predominantly Muslim country in the world and the nation with the largest population of Muslims. Novanto received significant blowback for his statement that, yes, Indonesians do like Trump, because it turns out that,           no, many Indonesians don't like Trump, in large part because of his           on-again, off-again proposal to ban Muslims from immigrating to the U.S.; in fact, faced with mounting criticism,           Novanto's party apologized not only for Novanto's statement but also for his mere attendance at the luncheon. Since Trump's victory,           both Novanto and Zon have stood up for the president, arguing that Trump's hardline stance toward Muslim immigration was merely campaign rhetoric and not actually reflective of the president's own beliefs, something Novanto claimed Trump personally assured him was the case. Regardless, it is clear that the Trump Organization's planned expansion into Indonesia-which, again, is the reason Trump met with Novanto and Zon in the first place-could introduce major complications into the relationship between the president and the political leaders of the world's largest Muslim country, not to mention           a significant trade partner and           an important ally in the South China Sea region.As if that weren't enough, Tanoe himself has shown increasing interest in becoming involved in Indonesian politics. In 2014,           Tanoe publicly supported the retired general Prabowo Subianto in the nation's presidential election; Subianto lost to the country's current leader, Joko Widodo. Then, in 2015, he helped found a new political party,           the United Indonesia Party, or Partai Perindo, which intends to field candidates for national office in the near future, including Tanoe himself: Shortly after The New York Times reported on the project,           Tanoe told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that, "If there is no one I can believe who can fix the problems of the country, I may try to run for president."If Tanoe does so, it will create the possibility that Trump will be dealing with a head of state with whom he has shared business interests, which,           as the ethics lawyer Richard Painter told The New York Times, "makes it impossible to conduct diplomacy in an evenhanded manner"-especially considering that, after Trump's election,           stock in Tanoe's company rose significantly. Moreover, Tanoe, like Ahok,           is both Christian and ethnically Chinese, which some insiders consider an obstacle to his electoral chances, although Tanoe argues that it is not Ahok's religion but his lack of firm leadership that has led to the large-scale protests against the governor. Nevertheless, if Tanoe does choose to run for office, it is difficult to see how his race, religion, and business partnership with a president many see as blatantly Islamophobic could do anything other than create further difficulties both within Indonesia and in the country's relationship with the U.S..Tanoe remains close to Trump. He            attended the inauguration as a guest of the Trump Organization; he and his wife posted several photos commemorating the occasion on their Instagram accounts, including pictures with            Donald Jr. and            Eric Trump and            a video taken out the window of a car driving along the inaugural parade route. Then, in            a February 7 interview with the Indonesian news magazine Tempo, Tanoe bragged about his access to the president. In the interview, he claimed to have seen Trump as recently as January 4 in New York, though he demurred when asked what they discussed, saying, "It wouldn't be ethical, especially now that he is the president." Tanoe also confirmed that "nothing has changed" regarding the branding deals in Indonesia, which he says will be moving forward with Trump's sons in charge, a statement that would seem to contradict            Trump and his lawyer's January 11 announcement that the company would be suspending unfinished development projects.           Back to table of contentsThat Emirati Businessman Though the biggest controversy over the New Year's Eve celebration at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Florida estate, was apparently            whether or not Joe Scarborough could accurately be described as having "partied" there,            video footage taken by a guest and obtained by CNN the next day brought renewed scrutiny to President Trump's own presence at the event. During a 10-minute speech given in front of the party's 800-odd attendees, Trump praised his Emirati business partner Hussain Sajwani and Sajwani's family, saying, "The most beautiful people from Dubai are here tonight, and they're seeing it and they love it." CNN            identifies Sajwani as a "billionaire developer in Dubai" who has "paid Trump millions of dollars to license the Trump name for golf courses in Dubai." Trump's spokeswoman, Hope Hicks,            defended the remarks by clarifying that the president and Sajwani "had no formal meetings of professional discussions. Their interactions were social."Whether or not Hicks's statement was true, Trump's commendation of Sajwani is part of a pattern in which the president praises his business partners in ways that suggest he has little interest in extricating himself from his company's interests. Previously, he has name-dropped business partners in            Turkey and            Argentina while on official calls with the countries' leaders;            he also met, and took photos, with associates from India shortly after the election. Moreover, as with several of the countries in which Trump-branded buildings are located, the United Arab Emirates has            a questionable record on human rights;            Human Rights Watch specifically states that the nation "uses its affluence to mask the government's human-rights problems."By singling out Sajwani, Trump also runs headlong into accusations that he and his family are selling access to his administration through their organization and family foundations.            According to Politico, tickets to celebrate with the president at Mar-a-Lago, went for upwards of $500; the stated attendance of at least 800 people means that the Trump Organization made at least $400,000 off of ticket sales for the event. (There is no indication that the party was a fundraiser for any outside organization, such as a charity or campaign fund, as is often the case when politicians attend such an event.) Whether or not the president sees it as such, the event offered attendees the opportunity to be in the same room as Trump and bend his ear for a price. This follows consternation regarding            an auction for a face-to-face meeting with Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and            a charity event that offered a reception with the president and a hunting trip with his two sons, both of which have since been cancelled, as well as ongoing speculation that            foreign entities will attempt to curry favor with Trump by booking rooms and events at his hotel in Washington, D.C. That Trump singled out Sajwani at the New Year's Eve party lends credence to these concerns-it's an instance of someone receiving the president's attention simply by buying a ticket to one of his events.           Back to table of contentsThat Virginia Vineyard Among the dozens of properties President Trump owns is Trump Vineyard Estates and Winery in Charlottesville, Virginia, the source of his namesake wine. On December 23, the property requested temporary H-2A visas for six foreign workers,           according to The Washington Post; on February 17,            BuzzFeed reported an additional request that upped the total to 29. The visas,           which are administered by the Citizenship and Immigration Services wing of the Department of Homeland Security, allow businesses to temporarily hire foreign, unskilled workers provided that the employer proves that there are not enough domestic candidates to fulfill a one-time or seasonal shortage and that the hiring will not depress wages for U.S.-born employees. Trump, of course, appointed the current Secretary of Homeland Security, which gives Trump authority over the very department responsible for deciding whether to grant the visas that the vineyard has requested. His choice for the position, the retired general John Kelly           has a relatively scant track record when it comes to immigration, leaving open the question of how much influence Trump himself will have over the DHS's policy on the matter.On top of the fact that Trump will soon be able to influence the outcome of the request, that his organization has continued to request visas after his election underscores a tension in the president's stance on immigration. From the moment that he announced that he would be running for president, Trump made antagonism toward immigration the central aspect of his campaign, arguing that both legal and illegal immigrants are taking jobs that should be filled by native-born Americans and depressing wages for others. Though he did not specifically single out the H-2B visa, the president has on multiple occasions           spoken critically about the H-1B program, which enables employers to temporarily hire foreign workers for skilled jobs like those in the tech industry.But the Trump Organization has long been a beneficiary of immigrant labor. For example, according to a           Reuters report from August 2015, nine companies of which Trump is the majority owner have requested at least 1,100 foreign visas since 2000. The majority of these requests were from Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida, which has requested at least 787 foreign visas since 2006, including 70 applications in 2015. (Meanwhile,           The New York Times reported that, since 2010, only 17 of the nearly 300 domestic applicants for positions at the Mar-a-Lago have been hired.) The Trump Organization also famously may have benefited from illegal immigration:           There is significant evidence that many of the Polish construction workers at the Trump Tower construction site in New York in 1980 were in the country illegally. In other words, Trump's track record includes not just taking advantage of the very visa process he claims to abhor but also actually subverting existing law for his own profit. Now, by applying for visas for his vineyard, Trump is signaling that he expects that his business will continue to be able to profit from one of the very immigration programs he continually denounces.           Back to table of contentsThat Las Vegas Labor Dispute On top of owning various properties and enterprises, Trump and his company employ roughly 34,000 people, according to           an analysis by CNN. On December 21, several hundred of those workers resolved            a labor dispute against the president-one in which, had it continued for even a few weeks more, Trump would have had the unprecedented power to make appointments to affect its outcome.Here's the situation: In October 2015, several hundred employees, primarily housekeeping staff, at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas voted to join the local branch of the Culinary Workers Union. Trump Ruffin Commercial LLC, which owns the hotel and is itself owned by Trump and the casino magnate Phil Ruffin, contested the vote, first by           enlisting an anti-union consulting firm (for whose services it paid $500,000) and then by filing complaints with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).           Shortly before the election, the NLRB not only rejected Trump and Ruffin's complaints but also found that, because the pair had refused to negotiate with the nascent union, they had violated federal law and their hotel was operating illegally. Trump and Ruffin have since appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.On December 21, more than a year after the hotel's workers first voted to join the union,            the workers announced that they arrived at their first collectively-bargained contract, achieved,            according to an employee quoted in ThinkProgress, despite significant pressure from ownership that attempting to unionize would cost workers their jobs. According to the union, the new agreement "will provide the employees with annual wage increases, a pension, family health care, and job security" comparable to that of other Las Vegas hotels. Moreover, the Culinary Workers Union's parent organization, UNITE HERE, has reached an agreement to represent workers at Trump's recently-opened hotel in Washington, D.C..Although this dispute has been resolved, it is included here because it exemplifies the type of situation in which Trump's business interests are likely to overlap with his duties as president. Trump will be tasked with appointing members to fill current openings on the NLRB, the very body that ruled against him shortly before the election and will be tasked with resolving any future disputes between the hotel's owners and its employees. Moreover, as            Slate noted, the chief justice of the D.C. Court of Appeals is none other than Merrick Garland, whose nomination to the Supreme Court has spent months languishing in the Republican-controlled Congress and was withdrawn once Trump became president. Finally, if disputes of this nature go beyond the Court of Appeals, the case would go to the Supreme Court, to which Trump will be appointing a justice, which is expected to tip the balance decisively in a more conservative (and likely anti-union) direction. In other words, no matter how far up the chain future disputes of this nature go, Trump's presidency will give him new power to influence the results.           Back to table of contentsThat Kuwaiti Event            According to an anonymous source and documents obtained by ThinkProgress, representatives from the Trump Organization pressured the ambassador of Kuwait to hold its embassy's annual celebration of the country's independence at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. The event,            held annually on February 25, was originally scheduled to take place at the Four Seasons Hotel in Georgetown; the location was allegedly changed after members of the Trump Organization contacted the country's ambassador. ThinkProgress's source "described the decision as political," suggesting that the embassy chose to relocate the event in an effort to curry favor with the president. The Kuwaiti ambassador has since disputed the report,            telling The Washington Post that he had not been contacted by the Trump Organization and that the move "was solely done with the intention of providing our guests with a new venue."If ThinkProgress's account is correct, Kuwait's decision represents an escalation of a situation that has been developing since Trump's election.            The Trump International Hotel has been the subject of continual scrutiny for the conflict of interest it poses, in part because its lease explicitly            bars elected officials from holding it, but mainly because Trump's ownership of the hotel will almost definitely result in            a violation of the Emoluments Clause, which prohibits the president from receiving payments from foreign powers-something that will arguably be happening any time a foreign government books a room at the hotel. Already, the hotel has begun advertising itself as a destination for diplomats and dignitaries, and the embassies of            Azerbaijan and            Bahrain have both scheduled events in the building. However, before the ThinkProgress report, there was no evidence that the Trump Organization had individually reached out to a foreign government in hopes of getting it to relocate an event to the hotel.           Back to table of contentsThose Certificates of Divestiture In addition to the many possibilities for President Trump to pursue his financial interests in office, the unique makeup of his cabinet also creates a new set of financial motivations. While Trump's own fortune automatically makes his administration the wealthiest in history, he has also            surrounded himself with an unprecedented collection of billionaires and multi-millionaires whose investments are likely to also come under scrutiny.Unlike the president himself, those who are up for Trump's cabinet, such as his proposed Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, will be legally obligated to divest from any holdings which may pose a conflict of interest. However,            as The Washington Post noted, even selling off their holdings offers an opportunity for Trump's cabinet members to enhance their fortunes. A federal program known as a "certificate of divestiture" allows executive-branch appointees and employees to avoid capital-gains taxes when selling their assets. The program has existed since 1989, and most recently received attention when President George W. Bush            appointed Hank Paulson, then the chief executive of Goldman Sachs as his Treasury Secretary in 2006. Paulson was forced to sell off $700 million in shares of the bank; the certificate of divestiture            enabled him to avoid a potential $200 million in capital-gains tax liability.            According to The Washington Post, the Office of Government Ethics is currently researching whether the president himself would qualify for the tax break; even if he doesn't, the unprecedented wealth of Trump's cabinet promises to push this provision, and the financial incentives it creates, to the limit.           Back to table of contentsThat Carrier Deal One of President Trump's first major economic moves as president was the deal that he and Vice President Mike Pence struck with the air-conditioner manufacturer Carrier, which had planned to move 2,100 jobs from its Indiana plant to Mexico.           Finalized on November 29, the compromise            kept 730 of the plant's jobs in Indiana in exchange for            $7 million in tax breaks over 10 years. The deal immediately            attracted           praise           and           criticism           on both sides of the aisle, with            much of the scrutiny going toward the tradeoff between jobs and tax breaks and Trump's idiosyncratic, ad-hoc negotiation techniques.An additional detail soon emerged regarding the deal: According to his FEC filings (which, despite Trump and his spokesman Jason Miller's            unverified statements that the president sold off his stock in June, remain the most recent public record of the president's finances),            Trump holds stock in Carrier's parent company, United Technologies. In 2014, his investment in the company was            between $100,001 and $250,000, while in 2015, the stock is listed as            worth less than $1,001, which could indicate that he sold some or most of the stock; each year, his holdings earned him between $2,500 and $5,000.The paucity of information in the FEC filings makes it difficult to ascertain why his holdings appear to have decreased; regardless, the investment is not only one of several hundred but also a relatively minor one among Trump's many holdings, some of which are worth over $5,000,000. As a result, it's difficult to know how much, if at all, Trump may have considered the stock, particularly considering that he            didn't appear to remember his initial promise to save the Carrier plant. Additionally, Trump does not have stock in            the next company he called out on Twitter, Rexnord Corporation (which is also based in Indiana), or its parent company, The Carlyle Group. Still, Trump's deal with Carrier demonstrates the unprecedented challenge the president's conflicts of interest create: Unless he either puts his holdings in a truly blind trust or divests completely, a significant number of the decisions he makes will involve some level of financial incentive for himself as well as for the country.           Back to table of contents           That Blind-Trust IssueAlmost as soon as Donald Trump and a lawyer from the Trump Organization            unveiled their plans to distance the president from his businesses on January 11, many ethics experts            argued that the proposal didn't do nearly enough to ward off concerns that Trump's business involvements would produce conflicts of interest during his presidency.           Under that plan, Trump resigned from the positions he held at the many companies that make up his real-estate empire, ceding control to his two adult sons and a longtime business associate, with his assets placed in a trust run by his two adult sons and Allen Weisselberg, a longtime Trump Organization executive, for the duration of his presidency. In unveiling the plan, the president vowed to refrain from talking about his financial interests with Donald Jr. and Eric Trump and said that all future business decisions would be reviewed by a newly appointed compliance officer to prevent even accidental impropriety. However,            critics said, as long as Trump still profits from his businesses, these measures do almost nothing to mitigate worries about conflicts of interest. Besides, with so much of his fortune derived from highly visible real-estate and branding deals,            some lawyers note that no trust would fully blind him from knowing where his financial interests lie; they say the only way to fully protect against conflicts of interest would have been for him to have sold off his businesses before taking office.Events since the election demonstrate that these experts' doubts are well-founded. Trump and his sons have shown little interest in maintaining the appearance of separation, with Eric and Donald Jr. showing up at numerous political events for their father. Roughly two weeks before the election, Donald Jr.            met with a pro-Russian group in Paris to discuss his father's policy toward Syria and,            according to Politico, was involved in his father's search for a Secretary of the Interior; he was also            spotted hunting in Turkey shortly after            his father's phone call with Turkish President Recep Erdogan in which the president praised a Turkish business partner. Eric, meanwhile, appeared in            photos with his father and a group of Indian businessmen mere days after the election.  And both were present for the president's            announcement of his nominee for the Supreme Court.Then, when asked about the blind trust            in a March 24 interview with Forbes, Eric gave answers that seemed to contradict not only the arrangement to which he supposedly agreed but also his own statements on the topic. "I do not talk about the government with him, and he does not talk about the business with us. That's kind of a steadfast pact we made, and it's something that we honor," he said, before telling the interviewer that he will be providing updates to his father "on the bottom line, profitability reports and stuff like that" on a quarterly basis. "My father and I are very close. I talk to him a lot. We're pretty inseparable," he concluded. If Trump is in constant contact with Eric and receiving updates on his businesses from his sons, it renders the trust they created effectively meaningless-and validates the concerns watchdog groups raised when Trump first unveiled his plan in January.After Eric Trump made those comments to Forbes, other holes in Trump's plan have come to light. On April 3, ProPublica discovered            a previously unreported change to the trust arrangement that effectively allows the president to personally withdraw money from his businesses at virtually any time he chooses. On February 10, a clause was apparently added to a letter outlining the details of the trust stating that "the Trustees shall distribute net income or principal to Donald J. Trump at his request, as the Trustees deem necessary for his maintenance, support or uninsured medical expenses, or as the Trustees otherwise deem appropriate." In other words, Trump will be able to draw profits from his businesses at any time during his presidency as long as he and the trustees-again, his two sons and his long-time business partner-agree that it is "appropriate," and will not have to disclose when he does so. This goes directly against the purpose of a blind trust, which in this case would be to distance Trump from his sources of income in an attempt to get rid of his incentive-or even ability-to consciously act in his own financial interest. So far, the plan unveiled in January appears to be as inadequate as many ethics experts had feared.Finally, removing himself from day-to-day operations will do little to change the fact that Trump will retain substantive knowledge of the illiquid assets involved in his business, such as the numerous buildings and other products that bear his name, especially if he remains in frequent contact with his children. Even assuming that Trump does separate himself from any consideration of his holdings, his children will still likely be major players in the family's organization, which will still bear at least the Trump name-           arguably one of their most valuable properties, as much of the family's wealth derives from licensing the name to third-party companies. Given the family's oft-touted brand-consciousness (Ivanka, for example, briefly appeared to be            distancing herself from the campaign, and several properties considered            rebranding under the name "Scion" when it appeared Trump would lose), the situation epitomizes the way Trump's, and his family's, business interests may very well prove inextricable from his actions as president.           Back to table of contentsThose Fannie and Freddie Investments After railing against elites during the campaign, Trump has so far           stocked his prospective cabinet with an array of billionaires whose policy positions seem likely to significantly benefit those who are also doing very well. Trump's putative treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, is no exception: His resume includes stints as           a banker at Goldman Sachs,           a Hollywood producer, and the operator of a bank that has been           described as a "foreclosure machine" and once           foreclosed on a homeowner over a 27-cent discrepancy.One of Mnuchin's apparent beliefs is that the government should cede control of the mortgage guarantors Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which the government acquired during the 2008 financial crisis. The two financial institutions' stocks           rose by more than 40 percent after Mnuchin stated that he believes the Trump administration "will get it done reasonably fast."Doing so would be broadly compatible with Trump's general           antipathy           toward           regulation of the banking industry. However, The Wall Street Journal           identified an additional wrinkle to the story: When Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's stocks rose, one major beneficiary was John Paulson,            an adviser to the Trump campaign and a business partner of Mnuchin's. Paulson's hedge funds include significant investments in both Fannie and Freddie. Trump himself has invested between $3 million and $5 million across three of Paulson's funds,           according to his filings with the Federal Election Commission (which remain the only available window into the president's financial holdings). In other words, as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's stock prices increase-and they have so far           more than doubled since the election on the expectation that the incoming Trump administration will be more lenient toward the financial sector than Obama-Trump's portfolio benefits.           Back to table of contentsThat Phone Call With Taiwan When news first emerged that the president            spoke on the phone with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen on December 2, the immediate reaction was uproar over his apparently impetuous breach of decades of U.S. protocol toward China and Taiwan. As my colleague David Graham            explained, since 1979, the United States has participated in the "artful diplomatic fiction" of officially recognizing the mainland People's Republic of China as the only legitimate Chinese government while maintaining loose, unofficial recognition of-and significant economic and military ties to-Taiwan. That Trump would speak to the president of Taiwan, especially before doing the same with Xi Jinping, the president of the PRC, flies in the face of a diplomatic tradition that has undergirded almost 40 years of U.S.-China relations.Amid the days of dissembling that followed the phone call, an additional worrisome detail came out: At the time, the Trump Organization            was apparently exploring expansion into Taiwan. Soon afterwards, the Trump Organization            denied that it planned to do so; however, even before the controversy arose, the mayor of Taoyuan, Taiwan, the municipality in which the Trump Organization allegedly wants to build,            described in a televised interview a meeting with a representative of the Trump Organization in September to discuss prospective real-estate projects, and at least one Trump employee was found to have            posted on Facebook that she was in Taiwan at the time on a business trip.            Based on the January 11 announcement that the Trump Organization will be suspending its development plans and will not pursue foreign deals in office, it would appear that any movement on development in Taiwan is no longer on the table.The phone call, and the many statements that have followed, are of particular interest because of the extent to which they dovetail with some of the biggest concerns about Trump's approach toward governance. In the ensuing 48 hours, Republican officials offered several, sometimes entirely contradictory, explanations of what initially appeared to be an impulsive move by Trump; depending on who was speaking, the phone call            was actually initiated by Ing-wen (which,            if technically true, ignores that it was Trump's staff who arranged the conversation),            was just "a courtesy," or            manifested a policy shift weeks in the making-although, regardless, it was made            without first consulting the White House or State Department. The defense of the move, and the questions it creates regarding conflicts of interest, have largely hinged on the belief that,            since voters apparently don't mind, the reaction was overblown.On this issue, though, whether or not voters care is immaterial to the central question. The president of the United States breached decades of international protocol created to preserve a precarious balance of power. That decision raised not only the possibility that Trump was blundering into a potential international incident but also that he may have done so in part out of consideration for his business prospects.           Back to table of contentsThat Deutsche Bank Debt Though he often brags about leveraging corporate-finance law to become "           The King of Debt," Trump's numerous bankruptcy filings have left most large Wall Street banks reticent to lend to him,            according to The Wall Street Journal. Among the few exceptions is Deutsche Bank, which "has led or participated in loans of at least $2.5 billion" to the president since 1996, with at least another $1 billion in loan commitments to Trump-affiliated companies;            more than $300 million of those loans have come since 2012.The president's indebtedness does not itself pose a conflict of interest, but Deutsche Bank's ongoing legal troubles very well might. The Justice Department            is currently negotiating with Deutsche Bank regarding a preliminary settlement of $14 billion            to resolve probes into allegedly misleading predatory lending practices in the leadup to the 2008 financial crisis; while it is believed that Deutsche Bank will push back against the sum, there has been no public news regarding negotiations since the initial figure was reported in September.            Trump will soon be naming many of the officials with jurisdiction over this and other deals, prompting several House Democrats to            send a letter to federal financial agencies calling for close scrutiny of how Trump may seek to influence the settlement through his appointments-although doing so would be just as in keeping with            his           general           stance toward financial regulation as with active protection of his pocketbook. Other Democrats have            called for the proactive appointment of independent prosecutors to avoid any appearance of conflict if the case is not resolved before Trump takes office.Fears that Trump may unduly consider his indebtedness to Deutsche Bank in deciding his administration's policy toward the financial sector go beyond general anxiety about deregulation. Deutsche Bank is            undergoing a period of struggle that may have it on the verge of failure already.            Its stock valuation has dropped by more than half since July 2015; in January, it            posted its first full-year loss since 2008; and one of its many tranches of bonds-one            specifically designed to be a high-risk, high-reward safety valve in times of trouble-           has recently begun to crash. In June, the International Monetary Fund            called Deutsche Bank "the most important net contributor to systemic risks" among globally important financial institutions. If the bank were to fail, it could have major consequences for not only Trump's businesses, which would lose their sole remaining lender, but for the global economy as well.Arguably, the $14 billion fine the Justice Department is seeking to impose            has exacerbated rather than alleviated these struggles. Based the company's market capitalization-the number of shares multiplied by their price- of            roughly $16 billion, the sum would leave Deutsche Bank critically low in liquid assets with which to absorb future troubles. although            the institution's own self-valuation of $68 billion argues otherwise. But given the complexity and potential volatility of the situation, it is important for any decision to be free from outside influence, something Trump's outstanding debt threatens to jeopardize.           Back to table of contentsThat Secret Service Detail During the election,            the Trump campaign put no small portion of its funds toward paying for use of the candidate's own properties; perhaps the most notable of these expenditures was            the nearly $170,000 the campaign spent in July on rent for its headquarters in Trump Tower. These expenses raised the possibility that,           as Trump predicted in 2000, he "could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it." Now that he will be president, he may be able to profit off of the Secret Service by virtue of the fact that he and his family will live in Trump Tower and fly in his private jets-which requires the agents tasked with guarding them to pay him rent and airfare.The first way Trump could monetize his own protective detail is by having family members travel in his two planes and three helicopters. This is not so much speculative as foregone: Over the course of the campaign, the Secret Service, which traditionally pays for its own travel during elections,           spent $2.74 million to fly on a plane owned by one of Trump's own companies. While in office, Trump will fly exclusively on Air Force One, while Mike Pence will be riding Air Force Two. However, their families may still be flying on Trump's private planes-along with their protective details, which would effectively direct even more money to Trump. (Previous first families have flown with a detail, whose legal purview covers "the immediate family members," but none have done so on planes they themselves own.)A bigger question regards Trump Tower in New York,            where the president appears likely to spend a significant amount of time. For the past few decades, it has been common practice for the Secret Service to provide protection for the president and vice president's non-White House residences, which sometimes entails paying rent to the officeholder. (Joe Biden, for example,           received $2,200 per month when the agency rented a cottage he owned near his home in Delaware.)But Trump Tower is a unique case, as it's not in Delaware but the middle of Manhattan. Already,           pedestrians and tourists are chafing at the increased security around the building, Trump's frequent use of which           has required closing a block of 56th Street and multiple lanes of Fifth Avenue; with           multiple           outlets           reporting that Trump's wife Melania and 10-year-old son Barron are expected to stay at Trump Tower for at least part of his term, it appears that the consternation will continue, with an enormous price tag for taxpayers:            According to the New York Post, it could cost as much as $3 million a year to rent out two of the building's vacant floors, meaning that Trump will be making money off of his own security detail. Meanwhile,            Reuters has reported that the city of New York is calling for federal funds to reimburse the costs of keeping up a security detail around Trump Tower.This system creates an unusual set of conflicting interests for Trump regarding his own travel and residences. Though presidents as disparate as Dwight Eisenhower and Barack Obama have evoked partisan ire over time spent away from the White House, whether            on the golf course or            on vacation in Hawaii, only Donald Trump will actually have gained from his and his family's travels. And if, while in office, Trump visits properties he owns other than Trump Tower-his buildings in other U.S. cities like Chicago and Miami, for example, or his golf course and resort in Scotland, or one of the many international hotels bearing his name-he stands to gain from the stays            for which his security detail (and, by extension, taxpayers) may be paying. Moreover, the more his family members fly on his planes, whether they are running his business on his behalf or            running interference with foreign leaders, the more the Secret Service will end up paying for seats alongside them.In fact, there are already signs that the Trump Organization has no qualms about making money off of the New York tower's new security arrangements in more ways than one. According to Politico, just five days after the election, a prominent New York real-estate firm           invoked Trump Tower's new secret-service detail as a selling point for a $2.1 million condominium, which it described as "The Best Value in the Most Secure Building in Manhattan." Though the flier was issued by an outside agency, the president's corporation still stands to benefit from increased traffic through processing and other service fees, making the advertisement a clear example of how Trump stands to benefit off of his new position.           Back to table of contentsThat Property in Georgia (the Country) Trump's election has had the effect of speeding up development on a number of his branded properties, even when the president appears not to be pulling any strings himself.            As occurred with Trump Tower Buenos Aires, the completion of an embattled Trump-branded building in the former Soviet republic of Georgia            is no longer on hold now that Trump has won. The project, which has been in the works in the seaside resort city of Batumi            since 2010,            was initially scheduled to break ground in 2013, but has been in stasis for several reasons, possibly including the 2013 electoral defeat of President Mikheil Saakashvili, a friend of Trump's and a supporter of the deal.According to           a report in The Washington Post, the green-lighting of the Trump property in Batumi has not been linked to a specific conversation with Georgian leaders, and a U.S.-based partner on the project has suggested that it has moved forward without any nudging from the government. However,            numerous public statements in the days since suggest that Trump's election was a major factor, including an interview with a real-estate entrepreneur who said, "Cutting the ribbon on a new Trump Tower in Georgia will be a symbol of victory for all of the free world."That the property seems to be moving forward solely because Trump was elected suggests his various business interests around the world may play a role not only in his foreign policy but in how other countries seek to deal with the U.S. as well. America's relationship with Georgia is largely shaped by concerns about Russian influence and potential aggression in the region, most recently manifested in            Russia's 2008 seizure of two regions of Georgia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. With controversy already swirling over            T           rump's admiration for Putin and            Russia's alleged role in the U.S. election,            some in the foreign-policy community have expressed trepidation that Trump's potential deferential attitude toward Russia            would prove deleterious for the continued independence of former satellite nations like Georgia. So, if Georgia has an ulterior motive behind the approval of Trump's property in Batumi, it would be to keep Russia at bay and maintain the status quo in the region.According to Trump and his lawyer,            as of January 11, the Trump Organization has suspended ongoing development projects and will no longer pursue deals in foreign countries. As the project in Batumi falls under both categories, the statement suggests that progress on the president's property in the city is no longer moving forward. Still, it's alarming that a country like Georgia may be giving Trump's businesses favorable treatment (whether he asked for it or not) in an attempt to influence his foreign policy.           Back to table of contentsThat Phone Call With Erdogan One of the worries regarding Trump's many conflicts of interest is that they may influence policy towards countries whose relationships with the U.S. are currently strained. Such is the case with Turkey, whose president, Recep Erdogan, has been            cracking down significantly on            civil liberties and            democratic           institutions within the country after a failed coup last summer. Though Turkey has in the past been a vital U.S. ally            as a bulwark against Islamic terror, Erdogan's            authoritarian turn and            combative stance toward Europe have led to some reevaluation of that relationship.Thus, it was troubling news that when Erdogan phoned Trump earlier this month-it was            one of the first calls Trump received after his victory-Trump used the opportunity to plug his business partners in Istanbul.            According to the Huffington Post, while on the line with Erdogan, Trump relayed praise for the leader from Mehmet Ali Yalcindag, whose father-in-law, Aydin Dogan, owns the holding company that operates the Trump Towers in Istanbul. Dogan has previously drawn Erdogan's ire by criticizing the leader; in recent years, however, Dogan's companies, most notably CNN Turk, have shown support for Erdogan's regime, including broadcasting his first message after the uprising in July.Trump's conversation with Erdogan is also worth noting because of a number of Trump's previous statements regarding the Turkish president. Though Erdogan briefly            called for Trump's name to be removed from the Istanbul property due to his proposed ban on Muslim immigration, Erdogan dropped the demand when, after the overthrow attempt,            Trump praised Erdogan for "turning it around" and essentially dismissed concerns over Erdogan's crackdown on civil liberties by bringing up domestic problems. Michael Flynn, who was recently named Trump's national security adviser,            wrote an election-day op-ed in The Hill arguing against offering asylum to a Muslim cleric whom Erdogan has accused of orchestrating the uprising,            which some have interpreted as a diplomatic overture. Erdogan has also            bristled at post-election protests in the U.S. and the description of both himself and Trump as part of a            "ring of autocrats." That the two are now talking about their countries' relationship as in the same conversation as Trump's business interests further complicates Trump's strangely effusive comments about Erdogan.It's worth noting that Trump himself considers his hotel in Istanbul a potential conflict of interest. In a December 2015 interview with Stephen Bannon, at the time the chairman of Breitbart News,            Trump said as much, telling Bannon, "I have a little conflict of interest 'cause I have a major, major building in Istanbul. It's a tremendously successful job." That he chose to discuss the towers with Erdogan, albeit obliquely, through his references to his business partners when he has already acknowledged the impropriety of doing so simply reinforces the perception that he may prove unable to separate his business from his official duties while in office.             Back to table of contentsThat Hotel in Washington, D.C. The White House is not the only new Trump property in Washington, D.C.; there's also the new Trump International Hotel, which opened in October and is located just a few blocks away in what was formerly known as the Old Post Office Pavilion. Previously, the hotel played a role in the campaign as the site of the event at which Trump recanted (sort of) his belief that Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Now, the hotel is at the center of speculation as a symbol of how inextricable Trump's presidential role may be from his personal interests.First and foremost, since his election, ethics groups and critics of the president have repeatedly alleged that, simply by taking office, Trump            has been in continual violation of the lease he holds on the Old Post Office, the government-owned building the Trump International Hotel inhabits. At issue is            a clause in the lease stating that "no ... elected official of the Government of the United States shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom." As such, watchdog organizations such as            Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington have repeatedly appealed to the Government Services Administration, the federal agency that administers the lease, to terminate the agreement with the Trump Organization.On March 23, however, the GSA            released a letter finding that Trump "is in full compliance" with the lease. According to Kevin Terry, the contract officer who oversaw the initial negotiations between the government and Trump, the president's plan to turn over his businesses to his two adult sons and the long-time Trump Organization executive Alen Garten is sufficient to meet the terms of the agreement, as Trump is no longer "an officer, director, manager, employee, or other official in any of the entities" involved in operating the hotel. The letter immediately drew outcry from ethics organizations like CREW, which            called the ruling "a disappointment" that failed to address the underlying problems of Trump's businesses, and the left-leaning advocacy group Public Citizen,            which described it as "an affront to the rule of law" based on "tortured and wholly uncompelling analysis" that "would get a first-year law student kicked out of law school."The GSA's decision may also prove a blow to the more general argument that Trump has not done enough to distance himself from his namesake organization. Critics have strenuously objected to            the plan Trump and his lawyer Sheri Dillon laid out on January 11 to mitigate conflicts of interest, under which the president has stepped down from, but retains ownership of, his numerous business interests, and placed his assets in a trust to be administered by his adult sons and Garten. His opponents maintain that, because Trump            still has significant knowledge of his business interests and will still be benefiting from them, and because he has put in place few real barriers between himself and his sons, there is still ample opportunity for outside actors to seek to influence the president's decisions by patronizing his companies. Though the letter from the GSA discusses only the Trump International Hotel and not the legality of the overall arrangement, it is nonetheless a decidedly favorable outcome for Trump in the first legal challenge over his conflicts of interest.As if its location didn't pose enough of an ethical question, the hotel has already hosted           at least one promotional event specifically aimed at enticing foreign diplomats to stay at the establishment while in town on official state business. On the one hand, direct influence will likely be difficult to prove: The establishment is, after all, a five-star hotel that would have been likely to attract high-class clientele even if Trump had lost the election, a fact to which Trump and those who surround him may well point in order to maintain a patina of respectability around their dealings. Still, the meeting's proximity to the election reinforces that it will be worth watching the comings and goings at the hotel closely for signs that Trump, who so often accused his opponent (often without evidence) of pay-for-play, may be using his position as president to promote his businesses.Trump himself acknowledged that his presidency is likely to increase traffic to his Washington, D.C. property. Speaking to The New York Times, the president           noted that the property is "probably a more valuable asset than it was before" and that his brand is "hotter" since the election. However,           he went on to insist that there was nothing even potentially problematic about his unprecedented situation and that he sees no reason why he couldn't run both the presidency and his business without conflict.Multiple events since the election have made Trump's lease on the hotel a central focus of discussions of his conflicts of interest, including           among Democrats in the House. On November 29, Bahrain-a country whose donations to the Clinton Foundation Trump and his campaign           decried during the campaign-           announced that it would be celebrating the anniversary of its king's ascension to the throne at the hotel. Other events announced since the election include           a Hannukah celebration co-hosted by the Embassy of Azerbaijan and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations and           a reception for the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation featuring Vice President Mike Pence as its keynote speaker.Nor did the string of bookings by international entities end after Trump's inauguration: On February 9, Politico            reported that a lobbying group with connections to the government of Saudi Arabia had booked a four-day stay at the hotel in Washington, D.C. And on March 13, The Daily Caller            reported that the Turkish-American Business Council will be co-hosting its annual conference at the Trump International Hotel after a seven-year runat the Ritz-Carlton. The latter announcement is especially notable because the organization's chairman, Ekim Alptekin, is involved in another of the Trump administration's scandals: One of Alptekin's companies, the apparent            shell company Inovo BV, paid $530,000 to the former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn to lobby on behalf of the Turkish government, which prompted Flynn to register as a foreign agent shortly after he was ousted from the Trump administration for lying about his contacts with Russian agents while a member of the president's transition team.           Back to table of contentsThat Argentinian Office Building According to a report by the prominent Argentine journalist Jorge Lanata,            the president's first phone call with his Argentine counterpart Mauricio Macri included a discussion of the permit issues currently holding up construction of a new Trump-branded office building in Buenos Aires. Both Macri and Trump quickly denied the report; according to a statement from the Embassy of Argentina, "The subject both leaders talked about was the institutional relationship, and they briefly mentioned the personal relationship they have had for years."As summarized in a tweetstorm            here, Trump's relationship with Argentina's government and business elites-and the story so far on his property there-is already long and convoluted. The phone call with Macri was apparently set up through Felipe Yaryura, one of Trump's longtime associates whose company, YY Development Group, is in charge of Trump Tower Buenos Aires. The day after the phone call, the PanAm Post            reported that YY Development Group had been approved to break ground in June 2017;            evidence has since emerged that the permitting process is not, in fact, finished, although Trump's business associates are moving ahead as though it is.Based on the information at            the president's January 11 press conference, it appears that the properties in Argentina, as both ongoing development projects and deals in a foreign country, is no longer moving forward. Nevertheless, the questionable circumstances under which it did so in the immediate aftermath of the election demonstrates just how many avenues there are for Trump's conflicts of interest to interfere with governance around the world.             Back to table of contentsThose Companies in Saudi Arabia Even as Trump was running for president, his company was continuing to operate and open new properties. While the most memorable openings may have been that of his hotel in Washington, D.C., and his golf course in Turnberry, Scotland, the Trump Organization was continuing to work on projects in other countries, including,            according to a report the Washington Post, registering eight new companies in Saudi Arabia during the 16-month campaign.The organization's endeavors in Saudi Arabia are notable not only because they may further complicate the shaky relationship between the U.S. and an oil-rich gulf state notorious for human-rights abuses but also because of how they relate to Trump's campaign rhetoric. One of his            criticisms of Hillary Clinton was that her charitable foundation had accepted donations from governments with questionable records on human rights, most notably Qatar and Saudi Arabia, always with the implication (or direct accusation) that they were doing so to curry favor with Clinton when she was secretary of state. That Trump was continuing to level this criticism while his namesake organization was actively pursuing new projects in Saudi Arabia not only bodes ill for his ability to separate his personal and presidential interests but also further calls into question the honesty and transparency of his campaign.           Back to table of contentsThat British Wind Farm As he indicated when he stopped there during the campaign, President Trump takes enormous pride in his recently opened golf course in Turnberry, Scotland. The day after the British public voted for Brexit-over intense Scottish opposition-Trump            spoke at the property's opening, proudly touting how the decision's deflationary effect on the pound would benefit his business.However, Trump also has a second golf course in Aberdeen, where it appears Trump has attempted to intercede in the interest of his own pocketbook.*            According to The New York Times, Trump had a post-election meeting with Nigel Farage in which he "encouraged Mr. Farage and his entourage to oppose the kind of offshore            wind farms that Mr. Trump believes will mar the pristine view from one of his two Scottish golf courses." Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the president,            denied that the two had discussed the subject, only for Trump to later            confirm that the topic had, in fact, come up in their conversation.* This entry originally misstated that Trump intervened at Turnberry, his other golf course in Scotland. We regret the error.             Back to table of contentsThose Indian Business Partners It didn't take long after the election for President Trump to be seen in public with international business partners.            According to a November 19 article in The New York Times, Trump took a break from his transition schedule to meet with three Indian real-estate executives who are currently building a Trump-branded apartment complex in Mumbai. According to both Trump and the Indian businessmen, the meeting was essentially congratulatory in nature;            a picture posted by one of the executives on Twittershows the four men smiling broadly and giving a thumbs-up to the camera. However, that the meeting happened in the first place suggests that Trump does not currently have any qualms about forestalling official state business for personal business.On top of that, the meeting raises questions in the blind-trust realm as well. The president himself was not the only member of his family there;            two Facebook photos show that Ivanka and Eric Trump both attended the meeting as well. Their presence serves as a reminder that their father seems so far uninterested in maintaining even the nominal separation between himself and his assets that he repeatedly said he would create during the campaign.           Back to table of contentsThat Envoy From the Philippines One leader with whom Trump already has an advantage over President Obama is Rodrigo Duterte, the similarly brash president of the Philippines. Duterte,            who has threatened to "break up with America," told Obama to "go to hell," and            called the president a "son of a whore," expressed admiration for Trump, noting that, among other similarities,            they both enjoy swearing.Duterte's affinity for Trump apparently goes beyond vulgar word choice. Late in October, Duterte            appointed a longtime business associate of Trump's as a special envoy to the United States, an announcement that became public shortly after the election. This appointment in particular raises questions because it is just as open to exploitation by Duterte as it is to Trump, as the Filipino president could intend to use his new envoy's relationship with Trump to strengthen the Philippines' hand. Whichever side the appointment does eventually benefit, however, the situation is nevertheless fraught with conflicts between the three men's personal and political interests.           Back to table of contentsRead            Trump's Interests vs. America's, Mar-a-Lago Edition on theatlantic.comLoad-Date: April 11, 2017End of Document

CHINA: USCIRF Condemns Ramadan Restrictions in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous RegionTargeted News ServiceJuly 5, 2017 Wednesday 1:17 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 531 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom issued the following news release:Muslims around the world recently marked the end of the holy month of Ramadan. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) strongly condemns the Chinese government's restrictions on Uighur Muslims' religious practice during Ramadan in the autonomous region of Xinjiang."The Chinese government has taken unprecedented steps to trample on the religious freedom of Uighur Muslims particularly during Ramadan," said USCIRF Chairman Daniel Mark. "Chinese Communist Party officials were assigned to live in the homes of Uighur families in Xinjiang to prevent them from fasting and praying. This new level of control is yet another example of the Chinese government's unacceptable repression of Uighur Muslims. We call on Beijing to abide by its international human rights commitments and cease its harassment of religious communities."The Chinese government continues to suppress Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang, often under the guise of countering what it alleges to be religious and other violent extremism. Other recent alarming developments include: new regulations prohibiting face-covering veils and beards; a ban on "extreme" Islamic baby names; and the confiscation of Uighur Muslims' passports and Qur'ans.Uighur Muslims also continue to receive unfair trails and are harshly treated in prison. USCIRF Vice Chair, Sandra Jolley, is advocating on behalf of Uighur Muslim Gulmira Imin (http://www.uscirf.gov/uscirfs-religious-prisoners-conscience-project), as part of USCIRF's Religious Prisoners of Conscience Project (           http://www.uscirf.gov/uscirfs-religious-prisoners-conscience-project). Ms. Imin, a website administrator and Uighur advocate, was sentenced in May 2010 to life imprisonment on charges of splittism (undermining the unity of the state), organizing an illegal demonstration, and leaking state secrets."Eight years ago today, July 5, 2009, Uighurs gathered in Urumqi to peacefully protest the Chinese government's treatment of their people. The protests were met with police violence and a number of arrests and deaths occurred. Gulmira Imin was arrested in connection with these riots and her harsh sentence is yet another example of the government's persistent targeting of Uighur Muslims," said Vice Chair Jolley. "The Chinese government should immediately release Gulmira Imin, prominent Uighur scholar Ilham Tohti, and all other prisoners of conscience."Click here to see Vice Chair Jolley's statement in support of Gulmira Imin (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVmsnN_Rm7o).USCIRF again recommended in 2017 that China be designated as a "country of particular concern," or CPC, for systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom. The State Department has designated China as a CPC since 1999, most recently in 2016.

Siemens Partners With China on DigitalizationTargeted News ServiceJuly 5, 2017 Wednesday 2:49 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 607 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: BERLIN BodySiemens issued the following news release:Siemens has entered into agreements with the Chinese government and Chinese enterprises to continue joint activities for exploring the potential of digitalization and for supporting measures to upgrade and transform China's industrial sector. The documents were signed today in Berlin in the presence of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Chinese President Xi Jinping."Digitalization and innovation are key to China's economic development. We as Siemens are happy to apply our leading role in industrial digitalization for China in order to leverage the full potential of economic development in the country," said Joe Kaeser, President and CEO of Siemens AG. "With the agreements signed today, we take our over 145-year-long commitment to this country to a new level in the digital age."Based on the existing cooperation framework between Siemens and China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the two parties also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that specifies cooperative activities in areas of innovation and in the application of digital technologies. In response to the "Made in China 2025" and "Internet+" initiatives, Siemens will continue to offer Digital Enterprise solutions to support the upgrading and transformation of China's industrial sector. The company will also step up efforts in research and development and talent development for digital manufacturing in China while driving innovation with Chinese partners and taking part in national and local innovation projects. One of the focus areas involves further exploring the use of MindSphere - Siemens' cloud-based open Internet of Things (IoT) operating system - in areas such as city-management and power-grid applications. Siemens has also signed a strategic cooperation agreement with China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC). The two companies aim to strengthen cooperation on industrial IoT and intelligent manufacturing.Siemens' cooperation with China dates back to 1872, when the company introduced the first pointer telegraph to Chinese communications. In October 1985, Siemens and China's former Ministry of Machinery, Electric and Electronic Industries of China signed a Memorandum of Comprehensive Cooperation to jointly promote the country's machinery, electric and electronic industries - the first agreement of this kind to be reached after the country opened and reformed itself. Siemens and NDRC renewed the MoU in 2011 and 2016.Siemens AG (Berlin and Munich) is a global technology powerhouse that has stood for engineering excellence, innovation, quality, reliability and internationality for more than 165 years. The company is active in more than 200 countries, focusing on the areas of electrification, automation and digitalization. One of the world's largest producers of energy-efficient, resource-saving technologies, Siemens is a leading supplier of efficient power generation and power transmission solutions and a pioneer in infrastructure solutions as well as automation, drive and software solutions for industry. The company is also a leading provider of medical imaging equipment - such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging systems - and a leader in laboratory diagnostics as well as clinical IT. In fiscal 2016, which ended on September 30, 2016, Siemens generated revenue of Euros79.6 billion and net income of Euros5.6 billion. At the end of September 2016, the company had around 351,000 employees worldwide.

CHINA TARGETS XINJIANG REGION FOR MASS DNA SAMPLING OF LOCAL POPULATIONStates News ServiceMay 17, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 754 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Chinese authorities in the troubled northwestern region of Xinjiang are carrying out mass collection of DNA from individuals not suspected of any crime, rights groups and academics said.The New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Chinese police already have DNA from 44 million individuals on a nationwide database, collected without oversight, transparency, or privacy protections."Evidence suggests that the regional government in Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region with a history of government repression, intends to accelerate the collection and indexing of DNA," the group said in a report on its website.Of the entries on the DNA database, only 1.5 million were linked to crime scenes, HRW said, which some 513,000 entries were held on a separate database to combat human trafficking."Authorities have stated that the DNA databases are used for solving crimes, including terrorism and child trafficking, as well as to identify bodies and vagrants," the group said.Chinese police in Xinjiang have required all passport applicants to submit DNA samples since November 2016 , while police agencies have issued multimillion dollar tenders for the supply of gene sequencing equipment, HRW said."The purchase indicates that the Xinjiang [police department] intends to build large-scale infrastructure to profile a large number of individuals," the group said, citing DNA experts.Leaked tenders by regional governments have said biometric information is being gathered as part of China's nationwide "stability maintenance" regime targeting peaceful critics of the ruling Chinese Communist Party.Shih Chien Yu, senior journalism lecturer at Hong Kong's Chu Hai College, said reports from ethnic minority Uyghurs in Xinjiang showed that the DNA collection scheme in the region began last September with the inception of a region-wide "health check-up.""There was a health check in Xinjiang, during which various biometrics were taken from ... the whole population," Shih told RFA. "The reason given at the time was that it would make pathology testing much easier.""This story has been circulating among Uyghurs outside China since," he said. "They are saying that there were other uses for these biometrics, including crime prevention and the fight against terrorism."'Focus personnel' targettedDilxat Raxit, spokesman for the exile group World Uyghur Congress, said the policy is part of an overall policy of ethnic profiling of Uyghurs by the Chinese government."This is yet another example of the close restrictions and surveillance of Uyghurs by the Chinese government," he said."I hope that this will spark concern among the international community."Beijing's DNA collection efforts appear to be targeting several defined groups of people across China who aren't criminal suspects, the HRW report said.Such groups include "focus personnel," a broad term that can include dissidents, activists, petitioners, and anyone with a prior criminal record, migrant workers and customers of hostels, entertainment venues, internet cafes, and rental homes, as well as specific professions including sex workers and locksmiths."This form of broad and discriminatory social profiling appears to be a form of preventive policing," HRW said, adding that some police announcements have said "stability maintenance" is the justification for collecting DNA from migrant workers.U.S.-based Chinese democracy activist Wei Jingsheng said the Chinese government's characterization of the mostly Muslim Uyghurs as potential terrorists is in keeping with other highly repressive policies in the region."The government has already taken other measures, such as the banning of traditional Muslim clothing, limits on Islamic baby names, which shows its dictatorial nature," Wei said."Such measures can only push local people towards extremism."HRW China director Sophie Richardson called on the Chinese government to end profiled DNA sampling."DNA collection can have legitimate policing uses in investigating specific criminal cases, but only in a context in which people have meaningful privacy protections," Richardson said."Mass DNA collection by the powerful Chinese police absent effective privacy protections or an independent judicial system is a perfect storm for abuses," she said. "China is moving its Orwellian system to the genetic level."Reported by Xi Wang for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Wong Lok-to for the Cantonese Service.

China's Sovereign Fund Pushes for Greater Access to Sensitive U.S. InvestmentsRealMoneyJuly 12, 2017 Wednesday 9:00 AM EDTCopyright 2017 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 850 wordsByline: Alex McMillanHighlight: The China Investment Corp., which oversees $814 billion for the Chinese government, would like easier approval for "symbolic investments" in touchy industries.BodyChina's sovereign wealth fund, the China Investment Corp., has this week pressed U.S. authorities to grant it greater access to U.S. markets, at a time U.S. lawmakers are urging greater scrutiny over Chinese deals. "We hope that the U.S. government will provide us with a more liberal, equal and nondiscriminatory investment environment," Liu Fangyu, the fund's managing director, said   .It could be a good marriage. The CIC, as a long-term investor, finds infrastructure investments particularly attractive. That meshes well with the priorities of the Trump administration -- although, of course, Donald Trump was particularly strident in his criticism of China on the campaign trail.Chinese investment into the United States tripled in 2016 to $46 billion, compared with the previous year, according to research company the Rhodium Group.White House officials and a group of U.S. lawmakers are, however,  that would scrutinize Chinese investment into the United States more closely. They would like to expand the powers of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which can block deals from foreign investors for national security reasons.Such a change would require Congressional approval. But many within Trump's team would like to see tougher controls over the flow of Chinese money into the United States.The Republican Senator John Cornyn from Texas says he will propose legislation to take a "tougher line" over investments from "nations that pose a clear threat to our national security, focused particularly in the area of advanced technology."Critics are already watching two proposed deals carefully to see how the foreign investment committee responds. That's the $1.2 billion bid for the Dallas-based remittance company MoneyGram  by Ant Financial, a subsidiary of e-commerce giant Alibaba  , and the $1.3 billion offer for communications chip maker Lattice Semiconductor  by the private-equity fund Canyon Bridge Capital Partners, which has ties to the Chinese government.Canyon Bridge has filed three times for approval by Committee on Foreign Investment, attempting to convince the committee that it will run Lattice without influence by the Chinese government. Canyon Bridge, Reuters reports, has indirect links to China's space program.The committee has been particularly tough on deals involving chip technology and telecommunications. The  concerned about the flow of Chinese funds into technology, such as artificial intelligence and robotics.The Pentagon said the formation of Canyon Bridge was an attempt to mask the fact that the capital for the Lattice deal was coming from the Chinese government, to make it easier to get governmental approval for the purchase. Canyon Bridge denies that.The CIC has already invested more than $90 billion in the United States, mostly in public markets and financial companies. But it would like to step up investment in U.S. real estate, infrastructure and technology.It has invested in the United Kingdom in potentially controversial projects such as London's Heathrow Airport, and the Thames Water utility that supplies the British capital with water. Late last year, it was part of a team including the Australian investment bank Macquarie  and several other investors that bought a controlling stake in the gas-distribution wing of Britain's National Grid for $4.65 billion.Liu, who is also head of public relations and international cooperation for the CIC, said such "symbolic investments" are difficult in the United States because of objections from Congress.The CIC, in its 2016 annual report released on Tuesday, said it made a net profit of 6.22% on its international investments. That helped boost its total assets to $813.5 billion. The fund lost about 3% in 2015 and has posted a cumulative net annual return of 4.76% since its formation in 2007.It invested about $19 billion in outbound deals in 2016, according to data from Dealogic, triple the $6.4 billion it invested overseas in 2015.The recent actions of the United States, for instance in approving $1.42 billion in weapons sales to Taiwan, also indicate that any get-to-know-you warmth generated by Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump when they met in April at Trump's Florida Mar-a-Lago resort has dissipated.China has been more strident in its warnings about U.S. foreign policy, as I explained last week , Xi warning Trump in a phone call that "negative factors" were emerging in the U.S.-China relationship.Liu at the CIC said she still holds out hope that the Mar-a-Lago summit is a sign that things are moving in the right direction. She is confident that the Trump administration "will provide us more investment opportunities."Xi and Trump agreed at that meeting to come up with an action plan for cooperation on trade. That was due to be delivered within 100 days -- setting the deadline at this Sunday.China has also warned that Chinese money should be free of baggage."There should not be undue political dimensions imposed on commercial takeovers, let alone political intervention," Lu Kang, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry, said.Load-Date: July 13, 2017End of Document

C.I.A. looking for source of leaks as China interrups U.S. espionageConcordiensis: Union CollegeMay 24, 2017 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD; Pg. 1Length: 600 wordsByline: Lisa HladikBodyU.S. spying operations have been severely compromised as the Chinese government has been working to dismantle U.S. espionage rings in their country since 2010.As a result, the Chinese government has killed or imprisoned dozens of intelligence sources.According to U.S. government officials, this breach has been one of the worst in decades, leaving Washington intelligence agencies in a fervor to discover the source of the leaks. Some believe that the source was an informant inside the C.I.A. itself.Others believe that the Chinese government has managed to hack into the C.I.A.'s computer system to look at its communications with other nations.While the cause of the security breach still remains uncertain, the effects are highly visible and damaging. From the span of 2010 to 2012, at least a dozen C.I.A. sources in China were killed.One of the most notable of these killings occurred when an informant was slaughtered outside the courtyard of a government building. C.I.A. officials the location of the killing was a message to other informants to beware the Chinese government because they are colluding with the U.S. government.Additionally, 18 to 20 of the C.I.A.'s Chinese sources were imprisoned.Overall, the damage has been equated to a security breach dating back to the Cold War. At the time, Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen divulged intelligence operations to Soviet officials in Moscow.The publication of these new, previously unreported breaches have come as an additional blow in the face of well-publicized leaks. In 2015, it was widely known that Beijing had gained access to thousands of the U.S. government's personnel records. Some of those records contained the identities of intelligence contractors.The blow of losing so many Chinese informants is especially potent because spying in China is one's of the C.I.A.'s top priorities. It took years to build up a quality network. In 2010, the C.I.A. was even able to recruit informants from deep inside the bureaucracy in Beijing.However, there have been major obstacles to setting up any network at all due to China's extensive security measures, so these lost sources will be difficult to replace.The C.I.A. and FBI are conducting ongoing investigations, which have been kept highly secretive and was code-named Honey Badger. The investigation started back in late 2010 when the information from their informants began to run dry.As more and more sources continued to disappear, there were increased efforts put into the investigation. Initially, there agencies zeroed in on a potential mole, resulting in a hunt that turned up nothing.Those who rejected this theory believed that the intelligence operations being carried out in China were simply not cautious enough. Some F.B.I. handlers were convinced that the C.I.A. handlers had used the same routes to the same meeting places too frequently. This could explain with the major breaches in addition to suspected Chinese hacking into intelligence agencies' data bases.Some progress has been made in the investigations. In March, prosecutors announced the arrest of Candace Claiborne, a former employee of the State Department. She is accused to lying about her contacts with Chinese officials.Though she has pled not guilty, part of the evidence trail includes cash deposits into her bank account by Chinese officials as well as a fully furnished apartment and stipend.Even with the discovery of Claiborne as a possible mole, the extent of the security breach must have additional attributable causes. As such, the C.I.A. and F.B.I. will continue their joint investigations.Load-Date: May 25, 2017End of Document

UN rights envoy was followed in China, sources intimidatedAssociated Press InternationalMay 3, 2017 Wednesday 8:47 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 690 wordsByline: By LOUISE WATT, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - A U.N. representative on human rights said that he was followed by security officers in disguise during an official trip to China and that some activists he met with may have suffered intimidation and retaliation.Philip Alston, the U.N. special rapporteur for extreme poverty and human rights, said the Chinese government's conduct was at odds with the need for U.N. experts to have the freedom to assess situations and preserve the confidentiality of sources.The difficulties are contained in a final report on his mission to China in August, which was emailed to The Associated Press on Tuesday. It is to be delivered to the U.N. Human Rights Council in June.They include warnings by the Chinese government not to make direct contact with civil society organizations to arrange meetings, requests for full details of any private meetings and security officers posing as private citizens regularly following Alston.The space for civil society has been curtailed dramatically under President Xi Jinping. He has presided over detentions of lawyers and rights activists, bloggers and others reporting on rights abuses and critiquing government policies, and tightening controls over foreign non-government organizations.Alston's report said that the government warned both him and individuals it considered "sensitive" not to meet with each other, and one meeting was prevented when a person was taken into custody for a couple of hours.Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Wednesday that he couldn't comment on the report as he hadn't seen it."What I can say is that Chinese authorities actively supported and coordinated his visit to China last year, making sure it was conducted smoothly. He met with the Chinese people he wanted to meet," Geng said. He added that the Chinese representative at the Human Rights Council would present China's position when the report comes before it in June.Alston's nine-day mission in August 2016 was to assess whether the country's policies relating to extreme poverty are consistent with its human rights obligations.William Nee, China researcher at Amnesty International, said China has "many positive things to say" on poverty relief, "but of course this gets undermined by this issue of trying to control access.""Unfortunately, this type of heavy-handed treatment is really par for the course in China," said Nee. "I would say that it's almost predictable that the government would go out of their way to intimidate sources, try to control the itinerary and not allow the special rapporteur to have the freedom of movement."During and after Alston's visit, certain individuals he met or was supposed to meet "were subjected to what appear to be acts of intimidation and reprisal," the report says. It mentions Jiang Tianyong, a prominent legal rights activist who met Alston on his trip and disappeared on Nov. 21. He has since been accused of inciting subversion of state power, and a state-run newspaper published a purported interview with him in March in which he allegedly confessed to peddling "fake news" to overseas media.In October, Alston told the Chinese government that he had received information that the wives of two detained lawyers had allegedly been intimidated and harassed, with one of them allegedly arrested, partly in retaliation for their "cooperation" with him.The Chinese government responded by saying that neither Wang Qiaoling's nor Li Wenzu's movements were restricted, nor were they illegally monitored or harassed, according to a document on the website of the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights.Alston's report said that China's leadership had shown "impressive" political will in committing to building a society free of extreme poverty, but that China needed to produce and publish more accurate data to use when making policy. He also said that China needed to treat "economic and social rights as human rights."___Online: http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/HRC/35/26/Add.2___Associated Press video journalist Isolda Morillo contributed to this report.___Follow Watt on Twitter at twitter.com/louise_wattLoad-Date: May 4, 2017End of Document

Religion is growing in ChinaThe Scroll: Brigham Young University-IdahoJune 25, 2017 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 326 wordsBodyReligion is prospering in China, despite measures to regulate foreign religious organizations."Christianity is growing at exponential rates in China and there are more believers than ever now," stated the International Christian Concern, a group which reports religious persecution in China, according to The Christian Post.Journalist Ian Johnson supports this in his recent documentary, The Souls of China, according to Deseret News."Across China, hundreds of temples, mosques, and churches open each year, attracting millions of new worshippers," Johnson told Deseret News. "Faith and values are returning to the center of a national discussion over how to organize Chinese life."This comes in the wake of a pro-atheist video on social media. "What if Atheism is a Religion?" was released in May on the Chinese social network Weibo by the Communist Youth League, according to The Christian Post.In the video, a man encounters a group of white-clad atheists, and the rest of the video consists of the atheists teaching the man about their religion, according to The Diplomat."The fact that the video portrays atheism as a religion in itself could be a sign that China's government sees it is losing the battle against religion and may represent a new approach to counteracting Christianity's growth," said the ICC to The Christian Post.This theory is supported by the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, an organization that files annual reports on global religious persecution.The Chinese government sanctioned the mass destruction of religious items such as crosses in 2016, according to the USCIRF report."The top leadership is very, increasingly worried about the rapid growth of Christian faith and their public presence, and their social influence," Bob Fu of China Aid told The Christian Post. "It is a political fear for the Communist Party, as the number of Christians in the country far outnumbers the members of the Party."Load-Date: September 27, 2018End of Document

Thank you so much. Happy Thursday to you and good morning everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it's a busy Thursday this morning. Thursday, April 6th, your top stories right now 6:00am on the East Coast.East meets West, Chinese President, Xi Jinping headed to Mar-a-Lago for two days of meetings with President Trump where issues of North Korea to trade will be on the agenda.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Both of those leaders are going to have an opportunity to get to know one another, have an opportunity to sit down. What they're going to find in President Trump is a strong leader, he's going to put America first, and he's going to be willing to talk about the hard things.I think the fact that we lose $500 billion a year in a trade deficit to China that we've seen manufacturing leaving this country and going to China, the fact that we see China constructing basis in the South China Sea.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: We're taking a closer look at that coming up this morning. A history making day on Capitol Hill, the senate on the brink of going nuclear over the nomination Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. The fallout and everything you need to know this morning coming up.Plus, the White House taking on tax reform, how it is looking to set up a pack for success, we will get into it and take a look at what that means for your money.A wild day on Wall Street yesterday, the DOW swing more than 200 points and then the turning point was the release of the Federal Reserve minutes at about 2:00pm Eastern Time yesterday. The comments from the minutes about winding down the Federal Reserve's balance sheet weighing on investors, turning the entire market around, markets as you see there had a (inaudible) finishing lower. Market actually this morning looks like this, take a look at Futures indicating really a flat showing this morning, DOW Industrial's pretty much exactly it closed yesterday as is the S&P500 and the NASDAQ.In Europe, declines across the board this morning, check the euro zone indices and you'll see losses of that half of a percent of the FTSE100, half a percent lower on the DAX Index in Germany and fractional loss in Paris. The major Asian markets finish like this, mostly lower, Hang Seng index down half a percent, Nikkei average in Japan down one and a half percent.The South still getting slammed by severe weather and the Master is forced to cancel the par three tournament for the first time ever, we've got the very latest there.And Pepsi's protest ads that comes to backlash, the company has pulled the spot featuring Kendall Jenner from the airwaves.Then Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos betting big on his space plans, find out how much he's spending out of his own pocket on Blue Origin.All those stories coming up this morning and joining us to talk all about it, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell. Former Home Depot CEO and Former Chrysler CEO, Bob Nardelli back with us. And Manslansky & Partners President, Lee Carter. Great to see you.LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: Good morning.BARTIROMO: Good morning.BOB NARDELLI, FORMER CEO, HOME DEPOT & CHRYSLER: Good morning.BARTIROMO: Great to see you Bob.NARDELLI: Thank you. It's great to be with all of you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Big day today Dagen.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: So much news. Front page of the Wall Street Journal both major stories about the fold or about foreign policy, about the Trump Administration's policy on Syria but you dig in and there's a great article about tax reform, what the White House is doing, taking the lead on that, that's where my eyeballs went first thing.BARTIROMO: Absolutely. And Bob, you think that's where business eyeballs are going all the time, right? Will this get done?NARDELLI: Totally. I mean, it's already built in, everybody assumes this is going to happen, Maria. It's got to happen quickly. We got to have something by June.BARTIROMO: You know what I thought was interesting when you heard Paul Ryan yesterday say, "We have time." All of a sudden the urgency seems to have been taken out.Did you see that comment yesterday when the speaker said, "We'll get there. We're doing it, we have time."CARTER: But it's clearly not on the same page. Another people are saying that, "We're going to get something done before recess, we're going to do this."And it is -- this -- if they don't get a win pretty quickly, I'm seeing independent support of the president is really softening because they came in believing that he was going to go down and get stuff done. That he was going to drain the swamp, that things are going to be done differently and they're not seeing anything happen.MCDOWELL: Gorsuch confirmation though would be a big win for his base certainly and I just want to point to a quote in this journal article about tax reform, about the White House taking the lead, one White House official says that the current August goal for a plan to pass could slip and then it might be difficult to pass anything after December. So you have this very, very short window.NARDELLI: They've got lots of time. They take another two weeks off.BARTIROMO: Yes.NARDELLI: It's a great job.BARTIROMO: Well we're looking at an Eastern recess, right, in the next couple of weeks.All right. We've got a lot to talk about this morning and joining the conversation, the CEOO of Express Scripts is here, Tim Wentworth is going to talk about the increase in drug prices and how to spend that, we'll about that. Plus, the Founder of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Martha Stewart herself with us this morning in the studio. And another powerhouse woman this morning, SOHO China Co-Founder and CEO, Zhang Xin will join us this morning to talk about China and the big meeting with the president.President Donald Trump is set to meet with Chinese President, Xi Jinping in Mar-a-Lago today. The two leaders are expected to talk about North Korea as well as trade. All those coming after the commander-in-chief blasted China's manufacturing as a candidate on the campaign trail.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Apple and our other major companies will start making their iPhones and their computers and other products inside the United States, not in China. What China has done to our country, they have taken our money, they have taken our jobs. We've lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Last Friday, President Trump signed two executive orders focused on reducing the trade deficit. Let's talk about trade. Bob, obviously, this was what you focused on so much when you were running Home Depot, Chrysler, the trade situation. What do you expect in terms of measures coming out of this meeting today?NARDELLI: Well I think first of all we got to be sure -- make sure did China take our jobs or because of regulations, taxes, and uncompetitive situations, were we forced to move jobs over there and businesses?So I think we have to be candid about what really took place. Now, I do think that the president really needs to work on a balance of trade, in other words, we need to have their markets as open as ours has done to them. So that's what we're really looking for, a little quick pro quo with China.BARTIROMO: Well one of the issues Dagen is the Chinese will not allow American companies to own more than just a joint venture of 49 percent. If you want to get access to the 1.3 billion people in China or the 1.1 billion people in China, you're not going to do it in an ownership situation, it's going to be JV, it's going to be a minority ownership.MCDOWELL: Right. And I think that that speaks to the broad point of discussion between President Trump and President Xi is that we're going to have a level playing field.Moving forward, maybe it's not completely apples-to-apples but you've got to have some give rather than a lot of take from the nation of China and always a sticking point and it goes back to how we manage our own finances here is the vast amount of treasury that the Chinese hold. It's about -- it differs from month-to-month but the second larger owner -- foreign owner of our debt and that always gives them negotiating leverage because what if, what if they stop buying this much?BARTIROMO: This is something the president talked about on the campaign trail, it certainly wasn't us versus them situation, Lee, but how did the American people view this relationship? What are they seeing about the president and getting out of this?CARTER: You know what I think and I think what you said is a very, very important point about they're not necessarily taking our jobs but the American people do view it as they are taking our job and in some way had demonizes what China is and has done.They look at quality issues, they look at a lot of the things that have happened over the years and they say, "This isn't fair. If it was made in America, it would be better quality and you're taking our jobs." And so what we need to see is Donald Trump come out of this meeting with some strength and help in understanding of what's really going on in a give and take that needs to happen.NARDELLI: Yes. I think what he's done on regulations whether it's EPA, rolling back some of the restrictions on the auto industry, those are all positive incentives that will cause repatriation of jobs back to the U.S. Your point about JV, we had one of the first ones in China on the Jeep, it doesn't work. It doesn't work.BARTIROMO: And you want 49 percent of this joint venture.NARDELLI: Exactly. Exactly. And it was very difficult quality forecasting production quotes, it was just a nightmare.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well that's the issue. And --MCDOWELL: Incredibly interesting Bob because, again, a lot of people don't have that kind of hands on experience front of manufacture products in China.And in terms of President Trump's base, they're more connected with what's happened with Mexico quite frankly over the last 20 or 30 years because in a lot of the Trump stronghold across the country during the election, it was really NAFTA and the jobs that were lost were not just lost to China, they were lost in Mexico. Furniture manufacturing, textile manufacturing and the like, a lot of those jobs and even a lot of the other jobs went to China.BARTIROMO: Well you speak to any global CEO like Bob Nardelli and that's the one big issue that they face. They want to have access to the one billion people in China. They want to be able to sell to those people. But the Chinese government knows that and the Chinese government is not going and give it away frankly at all.NARDELLI: Look, we may not like the way China operates but when they say they're going to start building airplanes, they build them. When they say they want to get into technology, now whether they take the technology, borrow the technology, that's another issue. But they are focused, they are disciplined, and they are hungry for economic growth.BARTIROMO: Yes. The president is also so different it seems than President Xi in many ways. The Chinese president reportedly has no social media accounts, he also does not play gold as the communist party has issued a crackdown on his sport and in an attempt to target corruption, it's going to be interesting the optics of this to watch them today in Mar- a-Lago to see how they get along.I mean it's a nice thing for the president to be able to offer come to this glamorous luxurious Mar-a-Lago Estate but not sure how the Chinese president reacts to this.NARDELLI: He'd be more comfortable in the White House in a conference room with no media, no picture.BARTIROMO: Exactly.MCDOWELL: Maybe that's the whole point. Donald Trump, New York Times did this chart of all the trips that President Trump has taken since he was inaugurated to Trump properties and I just laughed at it.But the point is that this is -- he's a very savvy individual and he's comfortable in these places and if people he's meeting with are not comfortable, well then that puts -- gives him the negotiating advantage.BARTIROMO: It sure does. It gives leverage in that. Let's switch gears real quick before we take a break, we got to talk about markets yesterday.Stocks completely have a reversal of fortune reversing a big rally in the earlier hours of the day after the Federal Reserve minutes indicated that there are some valuation concerns here. Major averages were down, the DOW Industrials ending the day down 41 points but that was the least of it, it was really the turnaround that way significant. House Speaker, Paul Ryan reportedly said that tax reform could take months, said that we have time but it could take longer than people thought.What did you think about the minutes yesterday? Now we see a competition, fiscal policy, monetary policy, do you smash the recovery just as its getting traction with higher interest rates?NARDELLI: Well that's interesting, they tended to back off a little bit on whether we're going to get two or three more increases, the balance sheet if you will.Are they going to put the money back? ARE they going to hold it when these things start maturing? It's going to be an interesting time for Yellen and what's happening out there in the markets.MCDOWELL: Because the thinking among investors, since Election Day is that, "Great, we can now move forward with fiscal policy and we won't be so reliant on monetary policy. So monetary policy, the Fed says it's going to start whittling down at $4.5 trillion portfolio beginning later in the year, oh by the way, stocks are maybe overpriced at this point based on historical average."Meantime, you look at what's happening in congress, they're not moving ahead with speed on tax reform and on infrastructure spending. So if you're going to pull away some of the monetary stimulus, you've got to ramp up the fiscal.BARTIROMO: Yes. By the way, taking away monetary policy, taking away the stimulus is one thing, making things harder, squeezing people by making expenses more expensive, by raising interest rates is another.Maybe just taking it away is enough without making things even tighter, maybe that's what the markets were reacting to. We'll see. We're going to take a short break, we've got a lot to come this morning.Coming up, hanging for this race to space, Jeff Bezos betting big on Blue Origin, how much he's spending out of his own pocket to finance the company?Then Pepsi bowing to pressure, the soda giant deciding to pull that controversial ad less than a day after defending it. The company's about face next. Lot to come this morning right here, Mornings with Maria, back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Severe weather slamming the Southeast, second time this week threatening tornados, canceling the Masters opening day for the first time ever by the way. Cheryl Casone with the details there, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. I mean all kinds of stuff happening with this weather. Unfortunately Maria, you've got severe weather advisories that stretched from Alabama to Georgia and north parts of Kentucky and Tennessee.A large tornado struck just south of Columbus, Georgia damaging several structures, though there were no immediate reports of injuries. Now to Atlanta, three city workers had to be rescued after they were trapped in flood waters, one of their vehicles was carrying barricades meant to prevent motorists from driving through those flood waters, there's some pictures there for you.Another suspected tornado damaged several homes in Walton County, that is just northeast of Atlanta, one home owner there reflected on the damage to his home of nearly 30 years.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SCOTT MOSELEY, GEORGIA HOME OWNER: As I started through the interior of the house, a couple pictures fell off the wall and (inaudible) to the ceiling and it was gone. I'm okay, my wife's okay, no one's hurt. It's just property. They can be replaced.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Well National Weather Service says dangerous weather could continue into this morning, that a strong cold front is expected to clear out the storm system. And Maria as you mentioned, yes, the Masters opening day jeopardized as well.Well another news this morning, Amazon Founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos says he's personally investing about a billion dollars annually in his own company's stock to fund his Blue Origin rocket company. Bezos made the announcement while showing off a reusable rocket booster and mockup of the capsule that he says is going to take tourists into space starting 2018. He does predict the floods will open up the flood gates to new entrepreneurship.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEFF BEZOS, FOUNDER & CEO, AMAZON: If we can reduce the cost of launch by a factor of 10 and then by a factor of a hundred then believe me, that's going to take time and a lot of hard work. But if we can do that, you will be living in a completely new world. It will be a golden age of space exploration, you'll see so many people. Then it will be a big industry.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Well, no total estimate yet from how much Bezos is going to be investing overall into the project but he says he's willing to spend whatever it takes. Thre is Amazon stock, 909.28 (inaudible)Another tech news, Google's live TV streaming service, YouTube TV is now up and running in five major U.S. markets. The $35 monthly service offers live streams from all four major broadcast networks and a host of others and totaled their launching 39 stations with 10 more including AMC coming very soon. The streaming TV service is going to be competing with the likes of Sling TV, DIRECTTV NOW, and AT&T, as well as Sony's PlayStation Vue. There is Alphabet parent of Google.And finally, Pepsi pulling the plug on that new protest-themed ad that featured Kendall Jenner after it sparked an uproar online, we brought you this story yesterday in a statement the company said in part, "Pepsi was trying to project a global message of unity, peace, and understanding. Clearly, we missed the mark and we apologize." The ad had at least 1.3 million views in two days before it was pulled, Maria, even from YouTube as well as broadcast and it will say that to their part, they probably spend upwards of $10 million on that ad Maria by some advertising analyst testament. So it's a financial hit for them too.BARTIROMO: Yes, it sure is. And first they were defending it and obviously they just came to the pressure. Cheryl, thank you.CASONE: You bet.BARTIROMO: Coming up, all eyes on President Trump's agenda now Why republicans are considering another go at repealing ObamaCare, tax reform starts to take center stage. Has the timeline changed? The latest on the path to reform, what will it take? What will it do?Plus, whipping up cool new drinks, the tasty beverages Starbucks added to its menu, we will try them out right here on set, back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Republicans weighing another run at repealing and replacing ObamaCare but tax reform is beginning to take center stage in our nation's capital. Despite the shift, Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan warned yesterday any deal on taxes could take longer than many expect.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. PAUL RYAN, (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: We were actually closer in agreement in healthcare than we were on tax reform. The House has a plan but the senate doesn't quite have one yet and they're working on one. The White House hasn't nailed it down, so even the three entities don't -- aren't on the same page yet on tax reform.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is EY Americas Deputy Managing Partner, Michael Inserra. Michael, good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.MICHAEL INSERRA, DEPUTY MANAGING PARTNER, EY AMERICA: Thank you for having me.BARTIROMO: You're very in-touch with what business leaders are feeling right now. do you expect a deal to get done on tax reform and when that might be?INSERRA: Well there's a lot on the administration's plate. We think tax reform along with now seeing infrastructure coming back up into the prioritization and obviously healthcare vacillating back and forth, we think there's real opportunities to get a deal done in tax reform. And tax reform was going to be critical for job creation. Tax reform, infrastructure, and defense are all huge impetus for job creation and GDP growth.BARTIROMO: And, yes. I was going to say, and for economic growth. Well you know Bob, I was skeptical that we would see a real impact in terms of economic growth in 2017, now it feels like, "Yes, we better not even expect it." It's going to be impactful 2018 not 2017. Is that going to be a problem for the markets and for the economy?NARDELLI: Way too slow. Way too slow. What's disheartening is when I hear congress, the senate, representatives say, "I've been here for two decades" and Trump has to learn that things don't move that fast.And the problem is they're in an analog world that we're moving to digital and so they got to get caught up, Michael, don't you think? I mean you're with the C-Suite every week and when you think about taxes, not only corporate tax but we got to think about small business person who files on a personal basis.MCDOWELL: Thank you.NARDELLI: We must give them the same advantage that we're talking about corporate tax. Your opinion, your thoughts?INSERRA: Absolutely. I think when you're talking about tax reform we quickly go to corporate and we do need to make changes in the corporate structure but I think sometimes we lose sight that many of the entrepreneurs will work through flow through.And so when flow through entities exists, it's your personal tax rates that are important here. And so any kind of deal has to really I believe include both corporate and the personal side because they are very intermingle.MCDOWELL: This is a linchpin of what's going on in the White House and in congress right now. We talk about debating over whether how to raise revenue and the border adjustment tax but the central sticking point will be, "Do you cut the top tax rate for wealthier Americans?" But that also applies to small business.BARTIROMO: That's absolutely right.INSERRA: Yes.MCDOWELL: And so that's why conservatives, that's why kind of hardcore republicans want to see that happen, they want that top rate to go down to 33 percent and that's actually something that President Trump and Paul Ryan agree on. They want that top rate cut cut big time.BARTIROMO: And I feel like that's what the Obama Administration did not understand.MCDOWELL: No.BARTIROMO: They wanted to raise taxes on the rich, raise taxes on the rich with no thought about the heavy tail of the impacts on small business because that's actually the job creators in the country.CARTER: Exactly right.NARDELLI: And Michael, to Maria's point, waiting until 2018 we're going to see a pullback in the market equities, what are you hearing from those CEOs about timing and the speed of implementation?INSERRA: Well you know, it's interesting, I think about timing and speed and I think it's just relevant for all business around transformation change.If you look at what technology is doing, in general, it's speeding up agility. It affects global trade, it affects industrialization, and so I think we have to continue to be agile as a country, as corporation, et cetera, and that change in the impacts on change is to be critical. And I think technologies become the real super sector here that is facilitating the need for effecting change in a much more agile basis.BARTIROMO: Is that where the jobs are? Let me ask you about the Friday job report because it feels like things are getting better. Confirm this or deny this, I mean the estimates are 180,000 jobs for the month of March.The unemployment rate is expected to remain at 4.7 percent, what are you seeing in terms of jobs right now and where is the growth in jobs?INSERRA: Well you know, I think that's a really fascinating question because you think about digitization, automation, you hear a lot about out -- off shoring, there's absolutely truth to that. But what I think the silver lining in this is, 235,000 jobs in February, we think it will be a continued upward trend.BARTIROMO: (inaudible) number this week.NARDELLI: Yes.INSERRA: Yes, exactly. So what I think the silver lining in this is the fact that technology is creating new jobs and while certain jobs are going to disappear and they are disappearing, I think data, analytics, robotics, animation, automation is going to continue to permeate.I actually think that plays to the strengths of millennials who have strong technological backgrounds and are very engaged with analytical and thought process. I think there's going to be job creation as the world pivots.BARTIROMO: That requires training.INSERRA: It requires retraining and training and I think that work is across the entire schematic.NARDELLI: Randall Stephenson is one of the leaders out there today where he's committed to retrain over a hundred thousand of his employees.MCDOWELL: At AT&T.NARDELLI: At AT&T. He's doing an amazing job of taking ownership, to create the right kind of talent, not draw a line on the H1 piece.INSERRA: That's what we're advising clients today and that's what we're doing with our own people today is continuing to shift their skill sets.BARTIROMO: Really important insights Michael. Thanks very much for joining us this morning.INSERRA: Thank you very much.BARTIROMO: Michael Inserra, EY this morning. Coming up, protection or intrusion? Technology giants are banding together against a court ruling that police can cease user's Facebook activity without warning. What it means for your privacy online? Do you actually have any?Plus, a selfie gone terribly wrong, a woman in California falls off of a bridge while trying to take her own picture. The details next.BARTIROMO: Good Thursday morning. Welcome back, everybody. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Thanks so much for joining us this morning.It is Thursday, April 6. Your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast. History on Capitol Hill -- the Senate could invoke the nuclear option as Republicans are looking to confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. AL FRANKEN (D), MINNESOTA: I've come to the conclusion that elevating Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court's bench would merely grantee more of the same from the Roberts Court.SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D), CONNECTICUT: That last year was robbed, not just from President Obama but from the American people by Republicans in the Senate when they treated Judge Garland with such disrespect.BARTIROMO: The fallout from the possible vote coming up this morning. The picture is worth a thousand words but not your life -- the details after a woman falls while trying to take a selfie on a bridge in California.We've got the details. On-demand ride taking a hit in Massachusetts -- the latest as 8,000 Uber and Lyft drivers failed background checks in the state. They have failed the background checks, 8,000 of them.Be careful what you post -- what you need to know after a court rules. Police can seize your Facebook activity. And market action this morning -- take a look after a volatile session yesterday.Markets (ph) -- they're looking fractionally higher today, the Dow Industrials, S&P and the NASDAQ all higher after a big reversal of fortune yesterday on the heels of the Federal Reserve minutes. We will tell you what those minutes suggested yesterday.In Europe, declines across the board earlier but as you see there, the CAC 40 just moving into positive territory in Paris, although the FTSE 100 is down about a half a percent. And the DAX index is down a quarter of a percent.In Asia overnight, stocks closed mostly lower. The Nikkei average -- worst performer, down one and a half percent. Mother nature putting the masters in the rough and one of the biggest stars could miss the tournament, the major obstacles putting a damper on golf's biggest week.Plus, Starbucks baking up a cherry pie just in time for summer -- the new drink set to help you cool down as the weather heats up. First though, our top story this half hour -- setting the stage for a nuclear showdown, Senate Democrats say that they will filibuster a closure vote on Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch this morning.If that happens, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is expected to trigger the so-called nuclear option -- permanently changing the chamber's filibuster rules to confirm the president's pick for the high court. Republican Senator, Senator Orrin Hatch slammed the Democrats on after the bell yesterday for forcing this vote to come to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. ORRIN HATCH (R), UTAH: I think the Democrats are just so better about having lost the election to Donald trump that they're just pouting all over the place. And -- and I think it's stupid on their part.They look like idiots. Here is one of the finest judges in the country, one of the most winning personalities. He has a tremendous reputation.He's a wonderful lawyer and a wonderful jurist. And -- and you know, they're treating him like he shouldn't even be given a chance.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: A final confirmation vote will likely come sometime tomorrow night. Joining us right now is Joe Covello. He is a former New York Appellate judge and partner at Lynn, Gartner, Dunne &Covello.Judge Covello, good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us this morning.JOSEPH COVELLO, PARTNER, LYNN, GARTNER, DUNNE & COVELLO: Thank you.BARTIROMO: What do you make of this showdown? I mean, what would -- what would Gorsuch's appointment mean for the bench?COVELLO: It would restore the balance of power that was there before. He's replacing Justice Scalia.The liberals would have you believe that it's really tipping the scales in a different direction. But all they're doing is reestablishing what the -- the balance was before Justice Scalia's passing.Judge Roberts is -- excuse me, Justice Kennedy is really the swing vote.BARTIROMO: Right.COVELLO: The individual that decides.NARDELLI: Yes.COVELLO: .more often than not.BARTIROMO: But -- but if they change the rules, the rules are changed forever, right?CARTER: Yes.NARDELLI: Well, Judge, you know, this nuclear option (ph) -- such -- such a harsh term.BARTIROMO: The Senate president.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A horrible term.BARTIROMO: .the Senate president.NARDELLI: It's such a harsh term to use. How will that really work? I mean, they're going to have a discussion in the caucus and they -- and they pull the trigger. I mean, how does that work?COVELLO: Well, remember, it's been utilized by the Democrats in the past for the federal district court judges as well as the court of appeals judges. So they were the ones who first instituted this nuclear option.NARDELLI: Yes.COVELLO: So all they're going to do is take a vote, stop the filibuster. And I don't believe a filibuster has ever been used before on a judicial candidate.So this is the first time we are seeing this as a weapon. So they are going to utilize what the Democrats had put in place, that being the nuclear option.NARDELLI: Yes.COVELLO: .because what's good for the goose is good for the gander.NARDELLI: Yes.CARTER: Do you think that -- so when I look at what the American people are viewing this as, it's just looking like there is no hope for Republicans and Democrats to ever work together. When you see something, it's like you're going to do this, I'm going to it worse.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right, right.CARTER: Do you think that this is -- this signals that there's a bigger problem? And do you think that changing this rule forever is a big deal?Is it going to be a problem moving forward?COVELLO: No. No, I don't believe it's a big deal. I don't think it's going to be a problem moving forward. The election has spoken.They wanted President Trump to appoint the next Supreme Court judge. And he's nothing that. And they are there to advise and consent.And there was nothing that this individual, Judge Gorsuch, has done that they could point to. He's eminently qualified. He's superbly qualified.When Justice Scalia passed, I said, who could you possibly get to replace such an icon?BARTIROMO: Yes.COVELLO: And we found one.MCDOWELL: You know what is appalling is this desperation of these liberals trying to keep Gorsuch off of the high court, that they've introduced phony baloney plagiarism allegations just in the last few days.CARTER: Oh, yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.MCDOWELL: .involving him siding (ph) in one -- in the work about euthanasia that he wrote, what is essentially the definition of a medical term. You actually had publication writing about esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula.That is what they're hanging their hat on.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Oh, my god.MCDOWELL: I just find that -- that their desperation is -- is over the top.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: You find it (ph) by the way people feel (ph). Don't you think people find that as well?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Exactly.CARTER: Well, it has been one after the other. He's anti-women. And then he says nothing is going the change.He says -- they say that he's -- he's anti-gay marriage, he's anti that community and then that doesn't work. And then they try to -- they tried one argument after another and none of them have worked.And now, they're at the -- at this?MCDOWELL: Yes, it's.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.MCDOWELL: .it's only unphatomable how.COVELLO: The truth is -- I'm sorry, they don't mind who is put up. They're going to oppose it.BARTIROMO: Because it's Donald Trump's pick.COVELLO: Yes.CARTER: Well, and also, there's fight about what happened under the Obama administration.BARTIROMO: That's right. That's right.NARDELLI: Well, I think the big point you made was this is really just bringing it into balance. It's the next one that President Trump will get to appoint that should be the issue.COVELLO: That may very well be if -- if it's a liberal.NARDELLI: Yes.COVELLO: If it's.(CROSSTALK)Let me -- let me ask you, Judge. I want to switch gears here and ask you about whether this is an invasion of privacy or really just a safety precaution.The news this morning, New York state's highest court ruling this week that the police can seize someone's Facebook activity. This ruling was in response to the company's challenge of search warrants issued to uncover suspected social security fraud.Microsoft, Google, Twitter also pointing Facebook's appeal on this but what does this ruling mean really for internet privacy if the police can come and just say, I'm seizing this Facebook data from you?COVELLO: Well, these were warrants that were issued by a judge after an affidavit was presented establishing probable cause. The individual who has the right to challenge it is the criminal themself, not the entity that's holding the evidence.And that's all Facebook is. If I'm silly enough to go out and -- and run a marathon at the same time, then I'm claiming I am disabled under Social Security. They have a right to seize that.And that's exactly what D.A. Vance (ph) has done. He -- what's offensive about it is that he filed 382 subpoenas. It almost looks like a fishing expedition honestly.And about a hundred people were arrested. I think 60 convictions occurred. But what the court of appeals said and correctly said is you don't have standing Facebook to challenge these individual's rights, their fourth amendment rights, the right against search and seizure because that endures (ph) to the defendant himself, not the Facebook.Facebook is simply holding it.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.COVELLO: So I believe the trial judge in that case wrote that if a landlord tried to cause (ph) a subpoena that's being served upon a tenant in his or her building, that would be improper. They don't have standing to do that.BARTIROMO: Yes.COVELLO: Only the defendant does in New York.MCDOWELL: These were -- these were, in some instances, individuals who were on disability who had photos on Facebook of them deep-sea fishing, like catching giant fish, riding a wave runners. They were collecting.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.MCDOWELL: .literally tens of thousands of dollars every year in disability payments. And -- and D.A. Vance (ph) busted it and caught them.BARTIROMO: Wow. And -- and we know that when the D.A. Vance (ph) joined us here, he was not happy with the technology companies. Remember, when he wanted access to the phones.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.BARTIROMO: .to -- to uncover murders and -- and they weren't getting any cooperation from the tech companies so.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: Basically giving.BARTIROMO: .there's a history here.MCDOWELL: .right -- giving cover to and protecting child molesters and -- and drug dealers. It's what these technology companies are -- have been doing, quite frankly.BARTIROMO: Yes.NARDELLI: In the old days, we'd hire a private detective to see the person that was on disability out bowling.CARTER: Right.NARDELLI: Now, we just go to Facebook.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's true.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Exactly.COVELLO: And the court of appeals did not address the merits of the case. They simply said, you don't have standing and that's it.And they even suggested subtly that maybe there is a way that you can do it. And I believe Jenny Rivera (ph) -- Judge Rivera, in a concurring opinion, said the same thing.But I believe the decision is a hundred percent correct.BARTIROMO: All right, we'll be watching that one. Judge, good to see you.COVELLO: Thank you very much.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for your insights.COVELLO: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Very much appreciate it. Judge Joe Cavello there. Coming up next, kicks to the curb -- Uber and Lyft putting the brakes on thousands of drivers after they failed background checks in Massachusetts -- what it means for the ride-hailing companies.Plus, whipping up new drinks -- the cool beverages Starbucks added to its menu. We're going to check them out and give them a try, coming up, back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Check out futures, indicating a higher opening the broader averages today, Dow Industrials, NASDAQ, S&P 500 bouncing after real volatility yesterday. We are expecting a higher opening for the Dow this morning as you see after a reversal fortune yesterday when the Federal Reserve minutes came out.A couple of names to watch this morning -- Boeing investing in technology with a new venture capital arm, the aircraft manufacturer investing two technology start-ups in an effort to keep up with the leverage cutting edge autonomous and wearable technology. Shares of Boeing up better than 14 percent year-to-date.Ford is announcing the launch of a plugging car in China next year, the automaker also saying that it plans to electrify most of its vehicles in the world's auto market by 2025. Shares of Ford up quarter a percent in the premarket.While a woman falls off of a bridge trying to take a selfie, she survived. Cheryl Casone with the details now.Cheryl, what a story.CASONE: Oh, talk about one lucky lady here, Maria. This happened earlier this week in Northern California.According to a local T.V. station, the unidentified woman was walking on a catwalk with some friends under a bridge -- here it is -- outside of Sacramento when she attempted to take a selfie. That catwalk off-limits to the public as she wasn't supposed to be there, she fell 60 feet to a trail below.First responders were called in via helicopter to take her to a hospital. We don't have any update, though, on the extent of her injuries. But she did survive that fall.Well, a new inspector background check law is keeping more than 8,000 Uber and Lyft drivers from getting their licenses to operate in the state of Massachusetts. The most common reason is that many of the drivers have issues with their driver's license status including some that are suspended.The new law went into effect in January, requires drivers for ride-hailing companies undergo a two-part background check, one from the company but then one by the state. Hundreds of applicants denied because they had serious crimes on their record, including violent or sexual offenses.Others had drunk or reckless driving offenses. Well, in other news this morning, GlaxoSmithKline recalling about 600,000 Ventolin asthma inhalers in the United States.GSK received a number of complaints about leakage of packaging on the inhalers, no injuries luckily. The British drug-maker saying the inhalers may deliver fewer doses of the medicine than indicated.The recall involved is the Ventolin HFA 200D inhalers. They're pretty popular. They're manufactured actually in North Carolina.And finally this, for all you morning coffee fans, Starbucks is adding new drinks to its menu. And one of them is a toasted coconut cold brew. It's iced coffee sweetend with coconut syrup and coconut milk.And then I'm going to give you this one as well -- if you happen to be in Japan, Starbucks is offering this one -- god, I wish this was here -- it's called the American cherry pie frapuccino. Looks like dessert.It's made with cherry compound (ph). It's got a pie crust lid. But these are only for a limited time in Japan. But I have the coconut drink on set.And it's -- so it's got -- it's got coconut syrup. It's got coconut milk. So there's no dairy issues for anybody onset, I don't know.MCDOWELL: So this is totally vegan?CASONE: Yes.MCDOWELL: It's totally vegan.CASONE: It's in coffee.MCDOWELL: And Tammy (ph), our producer, always says that I'm like Mikey (ph) and the life zero (ph) commercials that I hate everything. I love the medicine ball. I love the.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: You love them? Do you like this?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Try it.MCDOWELL: Well, it's -- this is delicious.CASONE: OK, you don't want (ph) to try it?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OK, let me try now.MCDOWELL: It's not too sweet.BARTIROMO: Well, coconut -- coconut oil and coconut juice is very good for you.CASONE: Yes.MCDOWELL: It's extremely healthy. So if you're in for like a paleo diet.BARTIROMO: I like it.MCDOWELL: Coconut anything.(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Very good.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: And -- and vegan. And coconut oil is.MCDOWELL: So this is totally vegan.BARTIROMO: And a lot of vegan.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: So the Vegan Brothers (ph) on Instagram who I -- who I adore, this is for you, guys.CASONE: This is limited time. It's inspired by the Jell-o (ph), which is a drink that's made in the Dominican Republic with coconut shavings and honey.So this doesn't -- I don't think this has -- I noticed, no (ph) honey in it. But it's inspired by that drink so according to Starbucks, so.BARTIROMO: How about sugar? How about calories?MCDOWELL: Honey's not vegan, by the way.NARDELLI: No.MCDOWELL: Yes.(CROSSTALK)CASONE: I'm going to go with lower calorie. Yes or no (ph), yes (ph).NARDELLI: Well, a little rum (ph) here (ph) would be great.(LAUGHTER)CARTER: I like the way you think.CASONE: Well, you could have that Starbucks piece (ph) if you like, your own.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: I (ph) like it.Cheryl, thank you.CASONE: You bet.MCDOWELL: A southern girl always has a bottle in her purse, you know (ph).(CROSSTALK)MCGRATH: I'll hook you up.NARDELLI: All right.BARTIROMO: Coming up, golf's rough tee up (ph) as bad weather threatens the masters. One of golf's biggest stars may have to take a rain check, the obstacles looming over the tournament coming up, back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Well, the Masters tees off just over an hour from now. But the world's number-one-ranked golfer may not play. Jared Max with all the details now.Jared, good morning to you.JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS REPORTER: Good morning, Maria. Call this one a tradition unlike any other. For Dustin Johnson, world number one golfer had won three tournaments in a row.He was the odds on favor to win the Masters until yesterday afternoon. According to his agent, Johnson slipped on bare wooden stairs at the home that he is renting in Augusta, Georgia for the Masters and took a hard fall.Johnson's trainer told XiriusXM last night, his client was going out to the garage to move a car, slipped on three wooden steps. Johnson landed on his lower back in both elbows.He is on anti-inflammatories and ice in hopes of being able to compete in the Masters. Yesterday's final round had to be suspended because of severe storms in the Southeast, tornado threats.So there was no part three contest. And today, the forecast calls for high winds, maybe 40-mile-per-hour gusts. Ceremonial tee shot with Jack Nicholson, Gary Player scheduled for 7:40 a.m. Eastern.You knew Derek Jeter wouldn't stay away from baseball for long. "New York Post" today, Derek Fisher -- Fisher, not the basketball player but like the Miami Marlins.He's trying to reel an ownership stake in the Marlins. The retired New York Yankees shortstop set to be interested in becoming an owner of the Miami Marlins.Fox Business learns that Jeter is being represented in talks by former Morgan Stanley brokerage chief, Gregory Fleming. Now, there are said to be other groups also bidding to buy the Marlins.One includes former Florida governor and presidential candidate, Jeb Bush, reportedly teaming up with Citigroup for a possible bid of the Marlins, who are said to be worth around $1 billion. Nineteen-year-old New England Patriots fan, Dylan Wagner, says he helped the FBI find the guy who stole Tom Brady's Super Bowl jerseys.According to CBS Boston, Wagner sold Mauricio Ortega, the guilty man -- he sold him a jersey on eBay. And at that point, the two then exchanged photographs of their jersey collections.Now, Wagner said, he sent me photos of his collections and front and center was Tom Brady's Super Bowl 49 jersey, the one from two years ago. He says I asked him outright, "How did you get that?"And he says, "I'll tell you later. So Wagner shared this information with a friend who was a ATF (ph) agent. And the next thing you know, it was turned over to the FBI and so this story goes, you never know.BARTIROMO: Wow.MAX: If you see something, say something in a whole different type of light.BARTIROMO: Would you believe the tip from a 19-year-old would have -- actually, a Patriots fan would have -- would have triggered this?NARDELLI: Well, what's amazing is how did this thing end up in Mexico.BARTIROMO: Yes.NARDELLI: .when you saw the video of (ph).BARTIROMO: That is the question.NARDELLI: That's just amazing.MAX: Certainly premeditated. I mean, this is something -- I mean, if it was a -- a serious crime, yes, that's -- that's a premeditated crime.MCDOWELL: Wasn't the issue, again, the (ph) open the door for the authorities to move in, the fact that it was a photo, that they could actually get a warrant related to it because.MAX: Because of the jersey.MCDOWELL: Right.MAX: Yes. And he had the.MCDOWELL: There was a photo that existed. That's what gives them a search warrant.NARDELLI: Yes.MAX: Yes, for the Super Bowl 49 jersey.(CROSSTALK)NARDELLI: Probable (ph).MAX: Yes, 51, you know, nothing different. Obviously, he -- he wasn't posting a photo of that one. But that was Ortega's thing.He would go around and tell people. Anybody would question, how did you get this? How did you wind up with that Von Miller (ph) or that Denver Broncos Super Bowl football helmet?And he would just kind of, you know, say, oh, well, you know, we'll get to that.BARTIROMO: And -- and what is he planning on doing with all of this stuff?MAX: They do sell it. I mean, obviously, he must be making some money from.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: It's just.BARTIROMO: I mean, obviously.MCDOWELL: Like when you.MAX: Not here in the States, I imagine.MCDOWELL: .when you steal a masterpiece out of the art museum, there is a black market for all of that. that's why a lot of these -- these very valuable items, whether it's a Super Bowl jersey or an old master's painting, they never resurface.NARDELLI: Dagen's got a room full of NASCAR drivers.(LAUGHTER)MCDOWELL: No (ph) -- but you know why, that was all given to me. My office is full of memorabilia. And it was all given to me.BARTIROMO: I bet it is.All right, Jared, good stuff. Thanks so much. Jared Max.

China Second Most Popular Country for African StudentsUSNEWS.comJune 29, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Best Countries; Vol.; No.Length: 1014 wordsByline: The ConversationHighlight: In less than 15 years, the African student body has grown from just under 2,000 to almost 50,000.BodyBy Victoria Breeze and Nathan Moore The surge in the number of African students in China is remarkable. In less than 15 years the African student body has grown 26-fold -- from just under            2,000 in 2003 to almost            50,000 in 2015. According to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, the            U.S. and            U.K. host around 40,000 African students a year. China surpassed this number in 2014, making it the second most popular destination for African students studying abroad, after            France which hosts just over 95,000 students. For years, these numbers have remained untranslated in the online archives of the Chinese Ministry of Education. But a recent initiative by            Michigan State University researchers to translate them introduces the reports to a wider audience. Not only have these reports revealed the growth in China-Africa ties. They also make it possible to compare China's international education trends in a global context. China's targeted focusChinese universities are filled with international students from around the world, including Asia, the Americas, Europe and Oceania. The proportion of Asian international students still dwarfs the number of Africans, who make up 13 percent of the student body. But this number, which is up from 2 percent in 2003, is growing every year, and much faster than other regions. Proportionally more African students are coming to China each year than students from anywhere else in the world. This dramatic increase in students from Africa can be explained in part by the Chinese government's targeted focus on African human resource and education development. Starting in 2000, China's Forum on China-Africa Cooperation summits have promised financial and political support for African education at home and abroad in China. READ: [Where in the World Chinese Students are Studying]Since 2006, China has set scholarship targets to aid African students coming to China for study. For example, at the most recent 2015 summit, China pledged to provide 30,000 scholarships to African students by 2018. Although China stopped publishing regional scholarship data in 2008, our data analysis using the 2003-2008 data to generate scholarship estimates suggests that this target is on the way to being met. China seems to be upholding the pledges made towards African education. Mutual Benefit - in education and businessFor the Chinese government, providing education to Africans is an extension of            China's soft power -- cultivating the            next generation of African scholars and elites. The experience that these students get in China can translate into a willingness to work with China and view China's internal or external policies favorably in the future. But what do African students gain in return? China-Africa scholars have            found that students head to China for many reasons. Some simply go to pursue an education that is affordable, even without a scholarship, while others go for the chance to develop business connections or learn the language of a country presumed to be a rising power. Based on several           surveys, most students tend to be enrolled in Chinese-language courses or engineering degrees. The preference for engineering may be due to the fact that many engineering programs offered by Chinese universities for international students are            taught in English. The quality of education has received mixed reviews. Some studies have shown that African students are generally           satisfied with their Chinese education, as long as they can overcome the            language barriers.            Others found that even if students were not impressed with their education, they appreciated the            trade and            business opportunities that a Chinese education made available to them back home. The next generationIt's difficult to know exactly which African countries are sending the most students to China. These details are not kept by the Chinese Ministry of Education. But the statistics from Tsinghua University provide an insight. In the 2015-2016 academic year, the majority of the university's 111 African students came from Zimbabwe, Ethiopia,            Tanzania,            Morocco, Eritrea, and Cameroon -- slightly favoring East Africa. African students in France overwhelmingly come from francophone West Africa.

Apple and Google's Very Different Approaches to China Have Huge Financial ConsequencesRealMoneyJuly 14, 2017 Friday 8:07 PM EDTCopyright 2017 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 918 wordsByline: Eric JhonsaHighlight: While Google's services largely remain blocked in China, Apple has been eager to keep local regulators happy.BodyTo say that Apple Inc.  and Alphabet Inc./Google  have taken very different approaches to engaging China in recent years is quite the understatement. A new announcement from Apple drives home just how different the company's mainland Chinese strategy remains from Google's, as its sales to the country close in on $50 billion.This week, Apple disclosed it's  in the Chinese province of Guizhou, as part of a broader plan to invest $1 billion in the region. Though the data center could improve the performance of iCloud services Apple delivers to its now-massive Chinese user base, the company's primary motivation appears to be a wish to comply with a new Chinese cybersecurity law that among other things restricts the movement of Chinese users' data outside of the mainland.The law effectively means that user content such as photos, documents and messages need to be stored on Chinese servers. Apple will retain control over its new data center's encryption keys. However, as the Wall Street Journal notes, it isn't clear if the company will have access to stored data, given that a company owned by Guizhou's provincial government will be operating the facility.This isn't the first time that Apple has gone out of its way to keep Chinese regulators happy. In 2014, the company agreed to store some of its data at China Telecom Corp.   facilities to address security concerns. And its Chinese App Store has been willing to remove apps that have draws the ire of Beijing regulators. The Apple News app was  , and the New York Times' app was pulled last December .Many of Apple's Chinese investments are also arguably done with political goals in mind, even if they're not the only reason that they're made. The company's Guizhou spending plans follows a March commitment to spend  on Chinese R&D centers, and a $1 billion 2016 investment in Chinese ride-sharing leader Didi Chuxing.In addition, Apple PR efforts within China show a high level of sensitivity to both public and government opinion. In 2013, CEO Tim Cook issued a formal apology to Chinese customers for Apple's warranty policies, a week after state-run media began criticizing the company over the matter. The only instance of Cook issuing an apology like that outside of China was in 2012, over the botched Apple Maps launch. And while Apple  at times on U.S. political issues, it has mostly avoided publicly criticizing Beijing's policies.To be fair, just as Apple has strong incentives to keep the Chinese government pleased, the reverse is also true. The company employs a substantial number of Chinese workers via its R&D centers and retail stores, and more importantly is indirectly responsible for hundreds of thousands by having the lion's share of its hardware manufacturing done in China, via contract manufacturers such as Foxconn and Pegatron. The  local governments have provided (generally with Beijing's approval) to contract manufacturers building iPhone plants show that appeasement is very much a two-way street.Regardless, there's quite a contrast between Apple's conciliatory approach towards Beijing and Google's fairly uncompromising stance. Google shuttered its mainland Chinese search engine in 2010 rather than continue censoring its services, and to this day, most of its core services remain blocked by China's "Great Firewall." Thus, while over 80% of Chinese smartphones run Android, they largely come with non-Google apps and services pre-installed.Google still has advertising and R&D offices in mainland China, and -- like Facebook Inc.  , which is also blocked on the mainland -- sells ads to Chinese firms looking to reach overseas buyers. And there have been occasional reports about a Chinese Google Play launch possibly happening. But for now, Google's interactions with Chinese consumers are mostly restricted to those using VPNs to circumvent the Great Firewall...and even that option            might not be around for long.The financial implications of Apple and Google's incredibly different Chinese strategies aren't hard to grasp. Whereas China appears to account for a small percentage of Google's revenue, even after accounting for ad sales to local businesses, Apple's Greater China revenue (it covers mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan) totaled $48.5 billion in fiscal 2016, or 22% of total revenue.The iPhone undoubtedly accounted for a big portion of these sales -- with  44.9 million iPhones were sold in mainland China in calendar 2016, the region's iPhone revenue last year may have been close to $30 billion. But the App Store also seems to have been a key contributor. Analytics firm App Annie believes Chinese App Store publisher payouts more than doubled annually in Q4 2016 to over $2 billion, leading China to surpass the U.S. and Japan as the world's most valuable iOS app market.Perhaps more than any other Apple business, the App Store shines a light on the consequences of Apple and Google's very different approaches to China. Google Play is the App Store's primary rival in nearly all non-Chinese markets, and (though its monetization rates trail the App Store's) a pretty successful one overall. But in China, Google Play is virtually non-existent -- locally-sold Android phones typically come with app stores from the likes of Baidu Inc.  , Tencent and Qihoo 360 -- while the App Store has grown into a 10-figure business.One can argue at length about the ethical and political merits of Apple's Chinese strategy relative to Google's. But it's hard to argue about its financial merits.Load-Date: July 15, 2017End of Document

Why China is banning beards and veils in XinjiangCNN WireApril 1, 2017 Saturday 1:19 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1234 wordsByline: By Katie Hunt, Chieu Luu and Steven Jiang, CNNDateline: (CNN) Body (CNN) --  No long beards. No veils in public places. No home-schooling.China is intensifying its crackdown against what it deems religious extremism in the far-west province of Xinjiang, which is home to 10 million Muslims. The latest measures -- outlined in a sweeping new anti-extremism legislation -- take effect Saturday and come on the heels of a series of steps to increase surveillance in the region that include the surrender of passports and mandatory GPS trackers in cars."They're doubling down on security in Xinjiang," said James Leibold, an associate professor at Australia's Le Trobe University, whose research focuses on China's Uyghur minority. What are the latest measures?The new legislation, which was published on a regional news portal run by the provincial government, appears to standardize, and expand across the whole province, piecemeal rules and regulations that have been enacted in individual towns and cities. Specifically, it prohibits:Advocating or propagating extremist thoughts Wearing or forcing others to wear full-face coverings Hyping up religious fanaticism through growing beards or choosing names in an abnormal way Not allowing children to receive state education, interfering with state education; Deliberately interfering or harming the implementation of family planning policies; Publishing, downloading or reading articles, publications and audio-video material containing extremist content; Rejecting or refusing state products and services that include radio and television programming.The law didn't explain these measures in detail or define abnormal, but the English-language state-run China Daily did say that long beards would be banned "as they are deemed to promote extremism." Why is China so concerned?Hundreds of people have been killed in Xinjiang in recent years; the government describes the perpetrators as terrorists inspired by religious extremism. There has been a spate of high-profile attacks involving ethnic Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking minority, outside the province.These include a 2014 attack outside a rail station in the southwestern city of Kunming that killed 31 people, and an attack in Beijing in 2013 when a car drove into a crowd of tourists and killed five people.In March, President Xi Jinping called for a "great wall of iron" to safeguard the region's stability.Xinjiang, a resource-rich province, plays a key role in the "One Belt, One Road" initiative championed by Xi. The project aims to improve economic ties with central Asia and Xi wants no disruption to a landmark international conference he is holding on it in May. "We'd be foolish to deny that China has a problem with terrorists," Leibold told CNN. "But I think the Communist Party is exaggerating the threat of radical Islam and they are turning up the heat in assimilating the Uyghurs into the Chinese nation state."Who are the Uyghurs?The Uyghurs are largely Muslims, who are the dominant ethnic group in Xinjiang, a large autonomous region that borders Russia, Mongolia, central and south Asia. Uyghurs regard themselves as linguistically, culturally and ethnically close to central Asia, despite a long history of Chinese rule. Tensions have arisen between Uyghurs and the Han, the predominant ethnic group in China, who have migrated to Xinjiang in large numbers over the past 60 years. A 2011 report by the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China said that Han workers have taken most of the new jobs and unemployment among Uyghurs is high. Activists say China has been taking measures to undermine the Uyghur language, culture and religious practices including restrictions on observing Ramadan. In a response to a question on whether the Chinese government was seeking to repress the Muslim faith in Xinjiang, Lu Kang, China's foreign ministry spokesman said on Wednesday that "the objective fact is that the people of all ethnicities in Xinjiang, just like the people living in other regions of China, are enjoying better lives, working conditions and brighter prospect for development.""We oppose the approach of linking terrorism with a certain ethnicity or a certain religion," he added.Leibold said the government has been slowly increasing measures since July 2009, when some 200 people were killed in ethnic riots that were prompted by long-simmering resentment many Uyghurs have for the Han. Are there Uyghur terror groups?Beijing has blamed the violence on Islamic militants, led by the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), which the US State Department listed as a terrorist organization in 2002 a year after the September 11 attacks. But many analysts dispute its characterization as an Al Qaeda or ISIS-style group.In February, a 28-minute video analyzed by the SITE Intelligence Group appeared to show Uyghur militants threatening to return to China to "shed blood like rivers." SITE said it was produced by ISIS. When asked about the video, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he wasn't aware of it, but said: "East Turkestan terrorist forces represented by the East Turkestan Islamic Movement pose a grave threat on security and stability of China and the region."The China Daily, a state-run newspaper published an editorial that went further: "the video lends further credence to Beijing's claim, especially the oft-ignored assertions of links between domestic and foreign terrorist elements."China has long asserted Uyghur fighters have joined the ranks of ISIS in Syria and Iraq. New America, a US think tank, estimates that 100 Uyghurs having gone abroad to fight for the ISIS cause, while the state-run Global Times put the figure at about 300. How do people in Xinjiang feel about this?The Chinese government tightly controls access to the area. Journalists are closely monitored when in the province, and sometimes are prohibited from accessing certain parts of the region all together. The same applies for non governmental organizations.Leibold says the new security measures drive resentment underground and widens the gulf of misunderstanding and between the Chinese state and Uyghurs."This is an example of a surveillance society that we've never seen across China," he said.However, not all Xinjiang residents see Beijing's security build-up as a problem."I don't think they're restrictions," a 30-year-old Uyghur woman in Xinjiang's Manasi County told CNN earlier this month on the condition of anonymity because she's not authorized to speak to media by her employer. "I think the government is doing its job."She said while she's noticed a steady influx of ethnic Han Chinese move into the region over the years, but she hasn't felt discriminated -- either in the Chinese school she attended or in her job as a nurse.She added she didn't mind attending the mandatory weekly flag raising ceremony, because it's the same thing she did in school growing up, and thinks installing GPS in vehicles and other surveillance devices is for the greater good.Dolkun Isa, Secretary General of the World Uyghur Congress (WUC), an exile group based in Germany, said that Chinese news coverage focuses on violence perpetrated by a tiny fraction of the population and "this shapes how some view Uyghurs generally -- though clearly unfairly."CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali in Atlanta and Nanlin Fang in Beijing contributed to this reportTM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Why African students are ditching the US for ChinaCNN.comJune 29, 2017 Thursday 9:58 PM ESTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: AFRICALength: 785 wordsByline: By Victoria Breeze and Nathan MooreBodyThe surge in the number of African students in China is remarkable. In less than 15 years the African student body has grown 26-fold -- from just under 2,000 in 2003 to almost 50,000 in 2015.According to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, the US and UK host around 40,000 African students a year. China surpassed this number in 2014, making it the second most popular destination for African students studying abroad, after France which hosts just over 95,000 students.For years, these numbers have remained untranslated in the online archives of the Chinese Ministry of Education. But a recent initiative by Michigan State University researchers to translate them introduces the reports to a wider audience.Not only have these reports revealed the growth in China-Africa ties. They also make it possible to compare China's international education trends in a global context.China's targeted focusChinese universities are filled with international students from around the world, including Asia, the Americas, Europe and Oceania. The proportion of Asian international students still dwarfs the number of Africans, who make up 13% of the student body.But this number, which is up from 2% in 2003, is growing every year, and much faster than other regions. Proportionally more African students are coming to China each year than students from anywhere else in the world.This dramatic increase in students from Africa can be explained in part by the Chinese government's targeted focus on African human resource and education development. Starting in 2000, China's Forum on China-Africa Cooperation summits have promised financial and political support for African education at home and abroad in China.Since 2006, China has set scholarship targets to aid African students coming to China for study. For example, at the most recent 2015 summit, China pledged to provide 30,000 scholarships to African students by 2018.Although China stopped publishing regional scholarship data in 2008, our data analysis using the 2003-2008 data to generate scholarship estimates suggests that this target is on the way to being met. China seems to be upholding the pledges made towards African education.Mutual Benefit - in education and businessFor the Chinese government, providing education to Africans is an extension of China's soft power -- cultivating the next generation of African scholars and elites. The experience that these students get in China can translate into a willingness to work with China and view China's internal or external policies favorably in the future.But what do African students gain in return? China-Africa scholars have found that students head to China for many reasons. Some simply go to pursue an education that is affordable, even without a scholarship, while others go for the chance to develop business connections or learn the language of a country presumed to be a rising power.Based on several surveys, most students tend to be enrolled in Chinese-language courses or engineering degrees. The preference for engineering may be due to the fact that many engineering programs offered by Chinese universities for international students are taught in English.The quality of education has received mixed reviews. Some studies have shown that African students are generally satisfied with their Chinese education, as long as they can overcome the language barriers. Others found that even if students were not impressed with their education, they appreciated the trade and business opportunities that a Chinese education made available to them back home.The next generationIt's difficult to know exactly which African countries are sending the most students to China. These details are not kept by the Chinese Ministry of Education. But the statistics from Tsinghua University provide an insight. In the 2015-2016 academic year, the majority of the university's 111 African students came from Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Morocco, Eritrea, and Cameroon -- slightly favouring East Africa.African students in France overwhelmingly come from francophone West Africa. If Tsinghua's profile holds true for the larger African student body in China, it means China is an increasingly important player in the education of countries outside of West Africa.Due to Chinese visa rules, most international students cannot stay in China after their education is complete. This prevents brain-drain and means that China is educating a generation of African students who -- unlike their counterparts in France, the US or UK -- are more likely to return home and bring their new education and skills with them.It's still too early to tell how these new dynamics might be shaping geopolitics on the continent.Load-Date: November 23, 2018End of Document

Euronet Worldwide's Statement on MoneyGramGlobeNewswireApril 17, 2017 Monday 6:27 AM PTCopyright 2017 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENTLength: 2365 wordsBodyLEAWOOD, Kan., April  17, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Euronet Worldwide, Inc. ("Euronet" or the "Company") (NASDAQ:EEFT), a leading electronics payments provider, today acknowledges it submitted a binding offer to acquire MoneyGram International, Inc. ("MoneyGram") (NASDAQ:MGI) to MoneyGram's Board of Directors on April 14, 2017.  On April 16, 2017, MoneyGram announced it had rejected Euronet's offer and has entered into an amendment to the definitive agreement under which MoneyGram will merge with Ant Financial Services Group (the "Amended Merger Agreement").  Euronet intends to review the Amended Merger Agreement.Euronet made its initial offer on March 14, 2017.  Under the terms of its offer, Euronet proposed to acquire all shares outstanding of MoneyGram for $15.20 in cash for each share of MoneyGram Common Stock and MoneyGram Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis.  Euronet's proposal provided for no closing condition related to securing change of control consents covering money transmitter licenses in the jurisdictions in which MoneyGram operates and a $69 million antitrust termination fee. Euronet's proposal also did not present security concerns and would not be subject to review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).Michael Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Euronet commented, "We have long believed a combination with MoneyGram would be of great benefit to Euronet and MoneyGram stockholders, customers and other stakeholders of these two great companies, which would be even stronger when combined.  We are disappointed that the MoneyGram board has chosen not to pursue this combination.""The road ahead for MoneyGram remains highly uncertain in our view.  In light of bipartisan concerns that have been raised by four Members of Congress, extensive public reports examining questionable data security practices of Ant Financial and broad concern raised over Chinese based acquirers, we continue to hold the view that the Ant deal may never close.""We are and will continue to be a growth company, having delivered more than a 20% adjusted EPS compounded annual growth rate since 2011.  I founded this company with a strong belief in the potential to bring U.S. technology and know-how to countries that had been denied economic advances.  We have spent more than $500 million bringing U.S. technology, systems and hardware from U.S. brands, including Diebold, NCR, IBM and Microsoft, to the world. From dramatically lowering the cost of domestic money transfer in the U.S to bringing cardless ATMs to Europe, we will continue to lead our industry.  We are tremendously proud of the growth and the value creation we have achieved." Notwithstanding MoneyGram's amended agreement with Ant Financial, Euronet is compelled to set the record straight regarding recent arguments made public by Ant Financial as it pertains to the facts that directly impact the review and consideration of any proposed transaction with MoneyGram.The Facts    Bipartisan Concern ¢Bipartisan concerns have been raised by four Members of Congress about what Ant Financial would have you believe to be but "phantom national security concerns."  Elected officials expressing concern about national security should never be dismissed as "political interference."  Nor should Ant give the back of its hand to the serious work being undertaken by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).• These complaints also ignore the inherent inequity between U.S. and Chinese acquirers when it comes to reciprocal transactions.     ¢Consider a sample of the following voices concerned about the transaction:• "Thus the proposal merits careful evaluation as it would provide Chinese access to the U.S. financial infrastructure, a move that would pose significant national security risks if completed."    Representatives Kevin Yoder and Eddie Bernice Johnson• "The Chinese government is a significant shareholder of Ant Financial, with an approximate 15% stake. Should this transaction be approved, the Chinese government would gain significant access to, and information on, financial markets and specific international consumer money flows ¦we must fully examine how the MoneyGram network may be used by the Chinese government to target these voices."    Representatives Robert Pittenger and Chris Smith• "This deal would not only cause harm to President Trump's trade agenda, it would also create a serious national security and cybersecurity threat to the American economy." - Dan Perrin, Executive Director, The Council to Reduce Known Cyber Vulnerabilities• "As the Chinese government increasingly cracks down on the political, religious and human rights activists, we must fully examine how the MoneyGram network may be used by the Chinese government to target these voices." - Michael R. Wessel, U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission ¢Consider some of the voices concerned about Chinese acquirers:• "The political realities on both sides pose a major downside risk to both pending transactions as well as the pace of newly announced investments in coming months."    Rhodium report• "Wall Street should bet on Team Trump curbing at least some Chinese deals." - Samir N. Kapadia is a political data scientist and managing director at VogelHood Group, a quantitative policy advisory firm in Washington, DC• "It is clear that China's number one goal is to take US technology capabilities so that Chinese firms can gain global market share at the expense of their foreign competitors." - Robert D. Atkinson, president and founder of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF)• "China appears to be conducting a campaign of commercial espionage against U.S. companies involving a combination of cyber espionage and human infiltration to systematically penetrate the information systems of U.S. companies to steal their intellectual property, devalue them, and acquire them at dramatically reduced prices." - U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission 2016 Report to Congress, November 2016• "Generous financing from the Chinese government allows corporations like Zoomlion to outbid other suitors that might be more reliable from a national security perspective. And when shareholders see a higher bid, they are prone to tune out the national security implications." - BG (USA-Ret.) John Adams, Former Deputy U.S. representative, NATO Military CommitteeThe Facts    History of Data Security Concerns ¢There is ample material in the public record to give any consumer or regulator pause with regard to how Ant Financial and its founder view the supposed protection of data.   ¢A report published in a peer-reviewed legal journal titled "Consumer protection in mobile payments in China: A critical analysis of Alipay's service agreement" questions if Ant Financial's user agreements meet even China's relatively loose consumer protection standards.   The article cites: "Alipay's service agreement states that -the company will profile the consumer's information and use it for sale or reward. The company may also disclose the identity information of the consumers'.  It does not reveal the potential recipients of this disclosure. ¢Another research report titled "Cashless Society, Cached Data: Are Mobile Payment Systems Protecting Chinese Citizens' Data?" from the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab states that "the extent to which Alipay shares such data with the Chinese government is troublingly unclear in light of the wealth of citizens' data the company has acquired."  The report further states that "the history of Alipay's data breaches and the company's cavalier attitude toward user security are troubling given the scope and amount of personal user data the app collects to conduct financial and other transactions." ¢A simple search quickly reveals that Ant Financial's founder has publicly urged the Chinese government to use data in troubling ways.  A Bloomberg News article from October 2016 states: "Chinese billionaire Jack Ma [founder of Ant Financial] proposed that the nation's [China's] top security bureau use big data to prevent crime, endorsing the country's nascent effort to build unparalleled online surveillance of its billion-plus people ¦.The capabilities Ma described also highlight the role that leading technology companies -- including Alibaba -- could play in helping build a system not unlike that of Steven Spielberg's "Minority Report," in which an all-knowing state can stop crimes before they take place." ¢Furthermore, Ant Financial is already using its customers' data in China's social credit score project that was described by the Wall Street Journal as "China's New Tool for Social Control." This story noted that Ant Financial is "one of eight companies approved [by the Chinese government] to pilot commercial experiments with social-credit scoring." ¢Ant Financial's own statements speak volumes. Ant Financial is "working actively with public agencies, financial institutions, and various types of merchants to obtain more data" in its participation in the Chinese government's "social credit system." The Facts    Ongoing Protection of U.S. Data ¢Ant Financial stated on April 6, 2017 that it wanted to connect "the Ant Financial and MoneyGram ecosystems."  You simply cannot combine ecosystems - to achieve a business goal or comply with regulations - without involving the integration of data and the architecture of these backbone systems. Access to the architecture of these servers, which the ultimate owner controls, plays a central role in maintaining the protection of this data. ¢The integration of ecosystems stands in sharp contrast to Ant Financial's claims to elected officials and regulators about supposed firewalls and MoneyGram operating as a standalone company. ¢This has absolutely nothing to do with MoneyGram's talented staff and everything to do with the track record of its proposed new owner. About Euronet Worldwide, Inc.Euronet Worldwide is an industry leader in processing secure electronic financial transactions. The Company offers payment and transaction processing solutions to financial institutions, retailers, service providers and individual consumers.

THE 5TH CHINA (SHANGHAI) INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY FAIR SOLEMNLY OPENSStates News ServiceApril 24, 2017 MondayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 930 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China:On April 20, jointly held by the Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Science and Technology, State Intellectual Property Office and Shanghai People's Government, the 5th China (Shanghai) International Technology Fair (hereinafter referred to as Shanghai Fair), solemnly opened in Shanghai World Expo Exhibition and Convention Center. The theme of this Shanghai Fair is: Driving Development by Innovation, Protecting Intellectual Property and Promoting Technology Trade. Vice Minister of Commerce Fang Aiqing attended and addressed the opening ceremony of the forum.Fang said that in today's world, science and technology has become the most active and revolutionary factor in promoting economic development. The level of scientific and technological development has become the core of national competitiveness. As a link between innovation and market, technology trade has received widespread attention and become an important driving force for economic recovery. The Chinese government profoundly implements innovation-driven development strategy, and actively promotes the "mass entrepreneurship and innovation." The vitality of technological innovation is released continuously and the technology trade development shows new features:Firstly, technology input continues to increase and technology trade develops rapidly. A number of technology-intensive enterprises grow up quickly, and R and D investment of some enterprises has accounted for more than 10% of sales revenue, taking a leading position in the world; more than 90% patent technology of some enterprises is invention patent, covering all fields of emerging technology. Over the past 10 years, the annual growth rate of China's intellectual property royalties and license fees were as high as 19.2%.Secondly, information technology and high-end manufacturing technology trade grow rapidly and the structure is obviously optimized. From 2006 to 2016, technology exports of China's equipment manufacturing industry increased from US$ 390 million to US$ 5.76 billion, an increase of nearly 15 times. The exports of information transmission, computer services and software industry increased from US$ 20 million to US$ 6.36 billion, an increase of more than 300 times. The proportion increased from 2.6% to 27.1%.Thirdly, the new technological revolution is ascending, and the development of technology trade has broad prospects. With the rapid development of new technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, Internet of things, cloud computing, and block chains, global IP consumption and communications, computer and information services exports increased by 106.5% between 2005 and 2015.The annual increase was 6.8%, obviously higher than the export of services and goods. In 2016, China's service trade volume related with technology amounted to US$87.54 billion, accounting for more than one-third of the emerging trade in services. Fourthly, technical trade accelerates the structural reform of supply side and the role of promoting innovation, maintaining growth, adjusting structure and benefiting people's livelihood was more prominent. Technology trade has promoted the development of new industries and the emergence of emerging formats, improving the economic vitality. Through digestion and absorption after the introduction of technology and then innovation, strategic emerging industries such as energy saving and environmental protection industry, a new generation of information technology, high-end equipment manufacturing achieve leapfrog development. A number of key technology research and development achieved breakthrough. China has entered the advanced international ranks in high-end equipment manufacturing fields such as communication equipment, high-speed rail, aviation, ship and hydropower stations.Fang pointed out that the current world economic recovery is slow and the transformation of the old and new growth momentum still goes on. In order to enhance the middle-and-long-term growth potential of the world economy, we must grasp the historical opportunity of scientific and technological revolution and the digital economy to seek power from innovation and to seek vitality from reform. China will further enable the market to play a decisive role in the allocation of resources, better play the role of the government, actively create a development environment, strive to improve promotion system, actively perfect public service system, constantly deepen foreign cooperation and promote technological development to achieve new development.The opening forum was presided over by the Vice Mayor of Shanghai Xu Kunlin. Mayor of Shanghai Ying Yong and Vice Minister of Science and Technology Li Mengye attended and addressed the opening ceremony. Netherlands Matin Van der Laan and other people delivered keynote speeches.The total area of this Shanghai fair is 35,000 square meters and five exhibition areas are set up according to four functions such as "technical display", "project docking", "trading services" and "forum activities." At the same time, Netherlands is invited as the guest of honor, Espoo Finland (sister city of Shanghai) as the foreign guest of honor, and Shenzhen as the domestic host city. The theme museum "capital of makers" is set up. Efforts are made to further promote economic and trade reciprocity and technology trade between China and foreign countries by mechanism such as exhibition demonstrations, forum activities, high-level visits, etc.Load-Date: April 25, 2017End of Document

MORE CHINESE CRUDE OIL IMPORTS COMING FROM NON-OPEC COUNTRIESStates News ServiceApril 14, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 655 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Energy Information Administration (EIA):Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, based on data from China General Administration of Customs and Bloomberg L.P.Note: OPEC is the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. China's General Administration of Customs publishes crude oil imports by weight. These values were converted to volumetric units assuming a conversion factor of 7.3 barrels per metric ton.China is the world's largest net importer of crude oil, and in recent years, China's crude oil imports have increasingly come from countries outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). While OPEC countries still made up most (57%) of China's 7.6 million barrels per day (b/d) of crude oil imports in 2016, crude oil from non-OPEC countries made up 65% of the growth in China's imports between 2012 and 2016. Leading non-OPEC suppliers included Russia (14% of total imports), Oman (9%), and Brazil (5%).On an average annual basis, China's crude oil imports increased by 2.2 million b/d between 2012 and 2016, and the non-OPEC countries' share increased from 34% to 43% over the period. Market shares for China's top three non-OPEC suppliers (Russia, Oman, and Brazil), all increased over these years. While still comparatively small as a share of China's crude oil imports, imports from Brazil reached a record high of 0.6 million b/d in December 2016, and imports from the United Kingdom reached a high of 0.2 million b/d in February 2017.Growth in China's total crude oil imports in 2016 reflected both lower domestic crude oil production and continued demand growth. After increasing steadily between 2012 and 2015, China's crude oil production declined significantly in 2016. Total liquids supply in China averaged 4.9 million b/d in 2016, a year-over-year decline of 0.3 million b/d, the largest drop for any non-OPEC country in 2016. U.S. crude oil production fell by more than 0.5 million b/d in 2016, but total liquids declined by less than 0.3 million b/d because other liquids production increased by less than 0.3 million b/d.Much of Chinese production growth from 2012 through 2015 was driven by more expensive drilling and production techniques, such as enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in older fields. As oil prices declined during 2016, investments in developing new reserves also fell and were not high enough to offset the natural production declines of older fields.Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Short-Term Energy OutlookChina's demand growth has remained the world's largest in every year since 2009, increasing 0.4 million b/d in 2016. As China increased its imports to address a growing gap between its domestic production and demand, it surpassed the United States as the world's largest net importer of total petroleum (crude oil and petroleum products) in 2014. The United States imports more crude oil and exports more crude oil and petroleum products than China.Other factors contributed to an increase in Chinese crude oil imports. For example, in July 2015, the Chinese government began allowing independent refiners (those not owned by the government) to import crude oil. The independent refiners previously had restrictions on the amount of crude oil they could import and relied on domestic supply and fuel oil as primary feedstocks. Another factor is the Chinese government's filling of new Strategic Petroleum Reserve sites.EIA's latest Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) forecasts a 0.3 million b/d increase in China's total liquid fuels demand in both 2017 and 2018. Absent any domestic production increases, China's crude oil imports are expected to continue increasing. More information about China's crude oil imports and various market forces that may suggest continued growth in non-OPEC crude oil imports are available in EIA's This Week in Petroleum.Principal contributor: Jeff BarronLoad-Date: April 14, 2017End of Document

China bars wife of detained Taiwanese activist from visitingAssociated Press InternationalApril 10, 2017 Monday 11:47 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 662 wordsByline: By GERRY SHIH and JOHNSON LAI, Associated PressDateline: TAIPEI, Taiwan BodyTAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) - The wife of a Taiwanese pro-democracy activist detained in China said Monday that she was prevented from flying to the mainland to seek a visit with her husband, whose case has inflamed tensions between the sides that have already sunk to their lowest level in years.Lee Ching-yu said airline staff told her when she tried to check in for her flight that Beijing authorities had canceled her Chinese-issued travel permit. Li was hoping to fly to China to demand information about her husband, Lee Ming-che, who has not been heard from since March 19.A Chinese official said last week that Lee was under investigation on suspicion of endangering Chinese national security and was in "good physical condition," but offered no additional information. Lee Ching-yu says her husband suffers from hypertension and has asked that medication be provided to him.Lee, a college employee who used the WeChat social media platform to discuss China-Taiwan relations, is the first Taiwanese activist in years to be held by China on security charges. His colleagues said his account on WeChat - a mainland China-based service used broadly in the Chinese-speaking world - had been shut down by Chinese authorities in mid-2016, suggesting he had attracted government attention.Lee, 42, formerly worked for the Democratic Progressive Party, which has advocated for Taiwan's formal independence. He was due to meet a friend in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong on March 19 but never arrived.China cut off its already limited contacts with Taiwan's government in June, five months after the DPP's Tsai Ing-wen was elected president. Since then, China has been seen as further restricting the island's already limited diplomatic breathing space while bringing economic pressure to bear.Trailed by a scrum of supporters and media, Lee Ching-yu was turned away at the check-in counter by an Air China employee who said the airline had been informed by Beijing that her permit to visit the mainland had been voided, without providing details. China regards Taiwan as part of its territory and requires the island's residents to use a document called a Taiwan Compatriots Pass rather than their passport when traveling to the mainland."I wonder why China needs to stop me, a defenseless woman, from visiting," Li told reporters at the airport.Monday's drama raises the stakes in a case already complicated by the absence of formal cross-strait diplomatic channels. The Taiwanese government department responsible for relations with China says its requests for information about Lee have largely gone ignored.Lee Ching-yu said Sunday that a middleman who claimed to have Chinese government contacts sought to persuade her not to make the trip, saying that her husband would be released soon if she acted in an "obedient and quietly cooperative" manner. If not, Lee said, the middleman suggested that Chinese state television would air a confession extracted from her husband.Taiwanese media on Monday disclosed the middleman's identity as former Taiwanese intelligence officer Lee Chun-min, who told the press that he would no longer work on the case.National security crimes in China are broadly defined and have a range of penalties. Authorities usually release little or no information on the specific allegations, citing the need to protect state secrets.Powers of the security services in dealing with foreign groups and their Chinese partners were strongly enhanced under a law that took effect in January, leading to concerns about further prosecutions and restrictions on civil society.In recent years, China's state security apparatus has detained foreign activists, domestic lawyers and other political elements it considers hostile and extracted and aired video confessions as proof that they were working to undermine China's national security. In several instances, the detainees recanted their confessions upon their release.___Shih reported from Beijing.Load-Date: April 11, 2017End of Document

Student Testifies on Capitol Hill in Support of Father Imprisoned in ChinaTargeted News ServiceJune 29, 2017 Thursday 4:35 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 785 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: LYNCHBURG, Va. BodyLiberty University issued the following news release:Sitting in front of a microphone in a room on Capitol Hill Wednesday afternoon, Xia Chongyu said he was still surprised to find himself at a hearing for the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, headed by U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and U.S. Rep Christopher Smith (R-N.J.). Moments before it began, he admitted that he was a bit nervous, but the rising junior at Liberty University was well prepared to give one of the most important presentations of his life.Chongyu was one of four witnesses at the hearing, titled "Gagging the Lawyers: China's Crackdown on Human Rights Lawyers and Its Implications for U.S.-China Relations." His father, Xia Lin, is a human rights lawyer serving a 10-year prison sentence in China. Chongyu told his family's story, testifying that his father's detainment was based on false charges and recounting the unjust mental and physical torture his father has endured.According to the commission, the tale of Chongyu's father is one of many. "Over the past four years, the Chinese government has carried out an extensive campaign to silence political dissent, curtail civil society, and ensure ideological loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party from various sectors of society, including business leaders, bloggers and social media users, university professors, and journalists," the commission stated in its hearing announcement. "One of the most vicious aspects of the campaign has been the use of detentions, arrests, torture, televised confessions, and enforced disappearances to punish lawyers and legal advocates who have defended various victims of the Chinese government's human rights abuses, including religious adherents, petitioners, artists, and reporters." A nationwide crackdown started in China on July 9, 2015, in which "over 300 human rights lawyers, legal professionals, and human rights advocates were detained, summoned for questioning, or disappeared."Chongyu spoke about the events of Nov. 8, 2014, when he said his father -- who "dedicates himself to be a voice for the voiceless" -- was abducted by secret agents and was imprisoned for fraud "without proper evidence." Chongyu said that when his father was being led away, the agents did not question him about the suspected fraud, but about the clients he represented. "After 600 days of imprisonment and torture, on June 17, 2016, he was finally tried in the Second People's Court of Beijing but was denied a personal statement in court," Chongyu wrote in a petition letter to the Chinese Embassy. In April, the court delivered a final sentence of 10 years imprisonment. Chongyu said that the court rejected the evidence presented by his father's attorneys that showed he did not commit fraud, denying him a fair trial."I refused to accept this illegal and unjust verdict," he testified at the hearing. "In April, I presented my petition at a Convocation at Liberty University, and the response was overwhelming." He said he delivered the petition, with 14,000 signatures at the time, to the Chinese Embassy, "but no one would even see me -- before I left I read the petition aloud at the gate of the embassy."Since then, Chongyu said he has collected "over 94,000 signatures -- most are from Americans, some from countries around the world. I'm not alone."In closing, he pleaded with the commission to join his cause."Human rights lawyers are the cornerstone of society. I hope the U.S. government can increase its involvement in such cases in the future. Moreover, I wish the Congress of America could urge the Chinese government to stop controlling the judiciary system and stop the persecution against human rights lawyers." He asked for the U.S. to take a clear stance and "communicate that human rights violations will not be tolerated."Both Smith and Rubio honored Chongyu and thanked him for being bold in his testimony. In their statements and introductions, they carefully pointed out that any reprisals that Chongyu and his family may face because of his testimony would be taken seriously as a direct attack against the commission's work.Another Liberty student played a special role in the hearing, even though she was never at the microphone like her classmate. Last semester, Jannah Schloeder, a rising junior, heard Chongyu's story in Convocation, and she knew she wanted to help. She contacted her mother, who works for Rep. Smith's office. It wasn't long before Chongyu was asked to speak at the Capitol. But the two students had never met - until the hearing on Wednesday, when Schloeder traveled from New Jersey to Washington, D.C., to show support for her new friend.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-5913234 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: June 30, 2017End of Document

Chinese delegation visits to learn how Aurora operatesThe Beacon-News, Aurora, Ill.July 15, 2017 SaturdayCopyright 2017 Distributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWSLength: 698 wordsByline: Steve Lord, The Beacon-News, Aurora, Ill.BodyJuly 15--What has become somewhat of an ongoing dialogue between the city of Aurora and representatives of the Chinese government continued Friday.Aurora officials brought out the welcome wagon for a delegation of 24 people from the Zhejiang Province of China -- a combination of municipal, county and provincial officials that even included security personal and members of the judiciary.The city has done this several times in the past for officials from different Chinese provinces. On Friday, the delegation heard from Mayor Richard Irvin, the management team of the city, including Alex Alexandrou, chief management officer, and even got to have some words with Police Chief Kristen Ziman and Fire Chief Gary Krienitz.Speaking of words, both Ziman and Irvin managed a few Chinese words that brought smiles, chuckles, and applause from the delegation.But the biggest applause came for Alexandrou who told the delegation, through an interpreter, that Aurora has a lot of bridges, which could be symbolic of the bridges being built between America and China through such exchanges as Friday's.Ye Hanbing, the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau director and leader of the delegation, said through an interpreter that the Chinese officials were interested in the workings of Aurora's municipal government, as well as the legal system, human resources and public security.He said the Zhejiang Province is the most economically developed province in Eastern China, with a population of about 15 million people that includes several municipalities.Included in the delegation were four mayors, two municipal and two county. The municipal mayors were Chen Lingfang, of the Shengzhou municipal government, and Mei Shimiao, of the Linhai municipal government. The other mayors were Li Yibo, of the Jinyun County People's Government and Ding Zheng, of the Pujiang County People's Government.Irvin had a surprise for the delegation with two Aurora residents of Chinese descent who spoke to them.Moon Zia grew up in Shanghai but came to the U.S. in 1987 and has lived in Aurora since 1998. She works with students at the Illinois Math and Science Academy in teaching the tenants of entrepreneurship -- how to start a business and make it successful."I told (the delegation) Aurora is a city very rich in history and education," she said, after her speech.She said she "really wants to help" Aurora with its economic development efforts."Whatever I can do to help," she said. "My background is in running a business."She also serves in an advisory capacity to the Aurora Municipal Airport.Calvin Shih moved to America from Taiwan in the 1970s to attend Northwestern University in Evanston, majoring in computer science. He never left. He moved to Aurora in 2000, and has a son who is a graduate of IMSA."I acknowledged the new mayor and his energy, and how he is reaching out to different people," Shih said.Shih said he was upfront in his speech that he was from Taiwan, which has long-standing political differences with mainland China, and chuckled when he said they would have known anyway when they heard him speak.He said the differences are largely political, and not between the people of both jurisdictions, who understand that they are all historically Chinese."The people, they understand," he said.In addition to hearing from the city's management staff, the delegation heard from Ald. Robert O'Connor, at large, who also served six months as mayor, talk about how the City Council functions, and governance and accountability.They also heard about the city's economic development machine, Invest Aurora, from Director David Hulseberg.The group toured the Aurora Police Department and had a discussion about public safety and security afterward, and got to sample one of the city's eateries, the Two Brothers Roundhouse restaurant, for lunch.As to what the future holds, officials said it could lead to a more formalized Sister City relationship between Aurora and a Chinese municipality.slord@tribpub.com___ (c)2017 The Beacon-News (Aurora, Ill.)

Chinese internet censors crack down on ... Winnie the PoohCNN WireJuly 18, 2017 Tuesday 7:31 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 709 wordsByline: By Steven Jiang, CNNDateline: BEIJING (CNN) BodyBEIJING (CNN) --  One of the most pressing questions facing millions of Chinese internet users right now seems to be: Have the authorities banished a honey-loving teddy bear from China's cyberspace?The answer: Yes... to a degree.For several days, the internet here has been abuzz with a newly discovered online ban on Winnie the Pooh, especially after the Financial Times covered the topic in a front page story Monday.The newspaper printed a long-circulated picture showing the bear strolling with his tiger friend Tigger next to a photo of Chinese President Xi Jinping walking with his then-US counterpart Barack Obama in 2013.When the image first appeared online, Chinese netizens began posting photos of Xi in, what they considered, similar poses. Putting pictures side by sideThey juxtaposed a picture of a frosty handshake between Xi and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe with the image of Pooh and his gloomy donkey friend Eeyore. Next to a photo that showed Xi inspecting troops from an open-top vehicle, they included Pooh standing in a tiny green car.Their sense of humor is ostensibly not shared by China's increasingly sophisticated internet czars. The country already operates one of the world's most extensive and restrictive internet filtering and censorship systems, known as the Great Firewall of China. Cyber officials likely don't appreciate the implication their top leader is naive and slow-witted like Pooh.Pictures don't appearOn WeChat, China's most popular social media platform, if one sends the famous image of Xi and Obama next to Pooh and Tigger in a group chat, other users won't see the picture. This rule even applies to shots of Monday's Financial Times front page -- but one-to-one chat sessions seem to be left alone for now, presumably due to their more limited impact.Users have also found a set of animated emojis featuring Pooh Bear and his friends removed from the platform.On Sina Weibo, often called China's Twitter, an attempted search for "Winnie the Pooh and Xi Jinping" in both Chinese and English will prompt a message that reads: "In accordance with relevant laws and regulations, results are not displayed."Up to Tuesday evening, the censors also banned users from posting the phrase "Winnie the Pooh" in Chinese in any comments. A message window would pop up to warn anyone who tried that their comment was against platform rules and Chinese laws. Amid growing attention on the so-called "Pooh Bear ban" from the international media and even American late-night comedians, the comment restriction on Weibo appeared to have been lifted by Tuesday night.Pooh merchandise, including books and toys, are still readily available online in China for purchase.CNN's broadcast, though, was blacked out in China throughout Tuesday every time the topic appeared on air.Possible reasonSome internet users have pointed to a poignant recent photo as a possible trigger for the latest restrictions. In the picture, Nobel Peace Prize-winning Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo, wearing hospital clothes, and his wife each held a Pooh mug, smiling at the camera with an empty chair in the background.Liu died of liver cancer last Thursday at a hospital while still in state custody, following the authorities' denial of his request to seek treatment abroad. His wife, under house arrest since his Nobel win in 2010, has not been heard from, even after her late husband's cremation and sea burial Saturday.In a moving award ceremony in Norway in late 2010, the Nobel committee placed Liu's medal and citation on an empty chair as the Chinese government banned the recipient -- who was serving a lengthy prison sentence for his call for political reform -- from attending the event. Images of empty chairs have also been censored on Chinese social media platforms in the past.As the ruling Communist Party prepares to hold a major national congress later this year that will decide a new leadership lineup, Xi continues to tighten his grip over the world's most populous nation -- with 731 million internet users, according to government statistics.For a country long symbolized by another cute bear, the battle is on between Pooh and the panda bear.TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Winnie the PoohCNN.comJuly 18, 2017 Tuesday 9:37 PM ESTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 692 wordsByline: By Steven Jiang, CNNDateline: Beijing BodyOne of the most pressing questions facing millions of Chinese internet users right now seems to be: Have the authorities banished a honey-loving teddy bear from China's cyberspace?The answer: Yes... to a degree.For several days, the internet here has been abuzz with a newly discovered online ban on Winnie the Pooh, especially after the Financial Times covered the topic in a front page story Monday.The newspaper printed a long-circulated picture showing the bear strolling with his tiger friend Tigger next to a photo of Chinese President Xi Jinping walking with his then-US counterpart Barack Obama in 2013.When the image first appeared online, Chinese netizens began posting photos of Xi in, what they considered, similar poses.Putting pictures side by sideThey juxtaposed a picture of a frosty handshake between Xi and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe with the image of Pooh and his gloomy donkey friend Eeyore.Next to a photo that showed Xi inspecting troops from an open-top vehicle, they included Pooh standing in a tiny green car.Their sense of humor is ostensibly not shared by China's increasingly sophisticated internet czars.The country already operates one of the world's most extensive and restrictive internet filtering and censorship systems, known as the Great Firewall of China.Cyber officials likely don't appreciate the implication their top leader is naive and slow-witted like Pooh.Pictures don't appearOn WeChat, China's most popular social media platform, if one sends the famous image of Xi and Obama next to Pooh and Tigger in a group chat, other users won't see the picture.This rule even applies to shots of Monday's Financial Times front page -- but one-to-one chat sessions seem to be left alone for now, presumably due to their more limited impact.Users have also found a set of animated emojis featuring Pooh Bear and his friends removed from the platform.On Sina Weibo, often called China's Twitter, an attempted search for "Winnie the Pooh and Xi Jinping" in both Chinese and English will prompt a message that reads: "In accordance with relevant laws and regulations, results are not displayed."Up to Tuesday evening, the censors also banned users from posting the phrase "Winnie the Pooh" in Chinese in any comments. A message window would pop up to warn anyone who tried that their comment was against platform rules and Chinese laws.Amid growing attention on the so-called "Pooh Bear ban" from the international media and even American late-night comedians, the comment restriction on Weibo appeared to have been lifted by Tuesday night.Pooh merchandise, including books and toys, are still readily available online in China for purchase.CNN's broadcast, though, was blacked out in China throughout Tuesday every time the topic appeared on air.Possible reasonSome internet users have pointed to a poignant recent photo as a possible trigger for the latest restrictions. In the picture, Nobel Peace Prize-winning Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo, wearing hospital clothes, and his wife each held a Pooh mug, smiling at the camera with an empty chair in the background.Liu died of liver cancer last Thursday at a hospital while still in state custody, following the authorities' denial of his request to seek treatment abroad. His wife, under house arrest since his Nobel win in 2010, has not been heard from, even after her late husband's cremation and sea burial Saturday.In a moving award ceremony in Norway in late 2010, the Nobel committee placed Liu's medal and citation on an empty chair as the Chinese government banned the recipient -- who was serving a lengthy prison sentence for his call for political reform -- from attending the event.Images of empty chairs have also been censored on Chinese social media platforms in the past.As the ruling Communist Party prepares to hold a major national congress later this year that will decide a new leadership lineup, Xi continues to tighten his grip over the world's most populous nation -- with 731 million internet users, according to government statistics.For a country long symbolized by another cute bear, the battle is on between Pooh and the panda bear.Load-Date: July 19, 2017End of Document

APPLE TAKES DOWN APPS USED BY CHINESE TO SCALE 'GREAT FIREWALL'States News ServiceJuly 31, 2017 MondayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 547 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Apple's removal of apps from its Chinese app store enabling internet users to get around the country's censorship regime has sparked criticism from users and service providers alike, who called the step "disappointing."The company said in a statement on Sunday that it had been "required to remove some VPN apps in China that do not meet the new regulations," referring to new licensing requirements announced earlier this year by Beijing's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.Virtual private networks, or VPNs, are widely used in China to scale the complex system of blocks, filters, and human censorship known as the Great Firewall, and access content outside China.StarVPN and ExpressVPN confirmed that their services are no longer available to Apple customers in China."This is very dangerous precedent," StarVPN said via its Twitter account, while ExpressVPN said it was disappointed by the move."It represents the most drastic measure the Chinese government has taken to block the use of VPNs to date, and we are troubled to see Apple aiding China's censorship efforts. ExpressVPN strongly condemns these measures, which threaten free speech and civil liberties," the company said in a statement.A VPN user who asked to remain anonymous said the move comes as the ruling Chinese Communist Party tightens its grip on online content ahead of a key congress later in the year.But he said he doesn't expect the controls to be relaxed any time soon."It's not just the 19th Party Congress, because it will carry on like this afterwards, too," the user said, adding that other circumvention tools remain."There are other channels we can use to scale the Great Firewall," he said. "But ordinary users who aren't used to technology won't be able to."Profits valued over rightsFormer leader of the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement Joshua Wong hit out at Apple's move."Apple values profit over human rights since it removed VPN services from China app store because of the pressure from Beijing regulators," Wong tweeted on Monday.Earlier this month, China's top three internet service providers were given notice to prevent the country's cell phone users from using circumvention tools to view online content hosted outside the Great Firewall by next February.State-run China Mobile, China Unicom, and China Telecom were told to ensure that their 1.3 billion subscribers can't use VPNs to access blocked content, while popular VPN provider GreenVPN was shut down in early July.Chinese internet users have become adept at circumventing the complex array of blocks, filters, and human censorship deployed by the ruling Chinese Communist Party to control what its citizens can see online.After censors succeeded in blocking Tor, VPNs became the tool of choice for "scaling the wall," in Chinese online parlance, and are used as much by government institutions, state-owned companies, and educational establishments as by the general public.While officials have denied a ban on VPNs, the licensing program suggests the government may be gearing up to allow only users it trusts to scale the Great Firewall.Reported by Xin Lin for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by the Cantonese Service.

Is Trump backing down on China?Politico.comApril 9, 2017 Sunday 11:37 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1154 wordsByline: DPalmer@politico.com,  (Doug Palmer)Highlight: The president last year compared China's economic behavior to `rape.' Now he says he and Xi are `in the process of getting along very well.'BodyPresident Donald Trump slammed China as the "economic enemy" during the campaign, vowing to correct its massive trade imbalance with the U.S. and allow zero tolerance for its cyber thefts of American corporate secrets. But Trump has tempered his fiery rhetoric as he meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago, and critics are questioning whether he'll really defend American businesses and workers in the face of Beijing's aggressive promotion of its own industries."One of the few hopes we had with President Trump is that he'd finally stand up to China," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters this week. "But up to now, when it comes to China, he looks like a 98-pound weakling. He talks a good game. He signs a couple of executive orders that mean nothing. He hasn't saved one job - one job - that China is stealing."Trump last week signed two executive orders: one calling for a study of U.S. trade deficits and another seeking tougher enforcement of rules meant to keep foreign manufacturers from flooding U.S. markets with cheap goods. But there has been little indication since Inauguration Day of how he plans to handle the cyber threat from China. And his campaign promise to label the Asian economic powerhouse a currency manipulator hasn't materialized.Instead, Trump has been taking a conciliatory tone. "We have developed a friendship," Trump said Thursday night at Mar-a-Lago, with Xi at his side. "I can see that. I think, long-term, we are going to have a very, very great relationship and I look very much forward to it."That's a far cry from what he said last year. "We can't continue to allow China to rape our country, and that's what they're doing," Trump said at the height of his push for the GOP nomination. "It's the greatest theft in the history of the world."Cyber theft was at the top of the agenda when Xi last came to the U.S. in September, 2015 to meet with President Barack Obama. That meeting came on the heels of private U.S. government allegations that Beijing-linked hackers had staged a devastating mass theft of hugely sensitive federal personnel records. At the same time, companies were complaining that China was orchestrating a pervasive hacking campaign to steal America's trade secrets and erode the country's competitive advantage on the international market. Government officials estimated in 2015 that such economic espionage was costing the U.S. up to $400 billion a year. Xi and Obama struck a deal in which both countries agreed not to hack each other's companies for commercial gain. That pact appears to have worked - so far. But former officials, cyber experts and foreign policy specialists told POLITICO that many - including the Chinese - will be closely scrutinizing this week's meeting for signs of how tough Trump will be on continuing issues.Observers will be looking to see whether the White House commits to continuing biannual meetings that have helped implement the Obama-era hacking pact, and whether Trump goes after Xi over an industry-detested Chinese cybersecurity law that critics say may force companies to let Beijing review their security protocols.Adam Segal, a China expert who directs the cyber policy program at the Council on Foreign Relations, said it would be "an important sign" if the readout from this week's meeting mentioned this next high-level dialogue."If we don't see [a commitment to meeting], it's either ... not a high priority for the Trump administration, or it's a capacity question," Segal added. "Do they have people who know of it and are planning for it?"A senior White House official told reporters this week that the administration expects to see "some movement" during this week's meeting on setting up a framework to continue the dialogue, "and for there to be clear deadlines for achieving results."On trade, Democrats and business interests are also pressing Trump to talk tough with Xi on issues such as currency manipulation, industrial espionage, and China's excess production of aluminum and steel. Those points were underscored in a letter to Trump signed by a dozen Democrats, including Schumer and Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). "You pledged to support American workers and go after trade cheaters, and we hope you take this opportunity with your first one-on-one meeting with Chinese President Xi to keep this promise to American workers and strongly affirm these priorities," the lawmakers said. John Frisbie, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, said that one meeting can't solve all problems, especially one being held at the outset of an administration. "I think one of the main goals, therefore, for this first early meeting should be for the two presidents to develop a working relationship - and that would be an important outcome."The business world would also like the sides to establish a framework for annual strategic and economic talks similar to those that took place during the Obama administration. The U.S.-China Business Council has urged the Trump administration to conclude talks on a bilateral investment treaty that would also dismantle many of China's barriers to foreign businesses.Xi, for his part, seems to have learned something about dealing with the dealmaker in the White House after Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi came on too strong in a meeting with the new president, key advisers and members of his family after the election."It turned out that wasn't very effective," said Bonnie Glaser, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "And the Chinese rethought their approach and decided that a charm offensive, and working, particularly, directly through the family members, would be more effective."That paid off when Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and granddaughter, Arabella, made a surprise appearance at the annual Spring Festival at the Chinese Embassy in Washington.In addition, Ivanka's husband and senior White House official Jared Kushner has established a regular dialogue with Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai as part of his broad responsibility as a top adviser to his father-in-law, analysts said.Democrats say they're uneasy with this new friendliness.Stabenow this week drew attention to a recent Chinese government decision giving Trump-branded businesses preliminary approval to register 38 new trademarks in China. "I'm very concerned that Trump is more focused now on expanding his own businesses in China, rather than our businesses at home," Stabenow said. "Our president will have his name on businesses in China, including spas, massage parlors, finance, construction companies, real estate companies." Meanwhile, the White House is downplaying expectations for this week's meetings. "A lot of issues are going to come up," the senior White House official said, but "we don't want to be unrealistic about" what can be achieved on any one topic.Load-Date: April 12, 2017End of Document

"Our president will have his name on businesses in China, including spas, massage parlors, finance, construction companies, real estate companies." Meanwhile, the White House is downplaying expectations for this week's meetings. "A lot of issues are going to come up," the senior White House official said, but "we don't want to be unrealistic about" what can be achieved on any one topic.Load-Date: April 11, 2017End of Document

CHINESE AWARD POLICE OFFICERSLesotho News AgencyJuly 30, 2017 SundayCopyright 2017 LENA All Rights ReservedLength: 607 wordsDateline: Maseru BodyMaseru, July 30 -- Chinese community awarded six police officers with certificates of honour for their dedication in curbing crime against Chinese nationals living in Lesotho, during a celebration of first anniversary of Chinese Community and Security Co-operation Centre Lesotho (CCSCC).It is at this event held in Maseru on Saturday where Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Monyane Moleleki said when a project like this starts, one should ask a question of crime statistics, further citing that seven Chinese nationals were killed in Lesotho in the past year and has dropped to two this year.He however commented that two is too many, inviting all to strive for a zero statistics in next year's celebration.Moleleki said it is gratifying and satisfying that there are people in Lesotho who have been assisting the police to fight crime against these foreigners, and commended the Lesotho Mounted Police Service (LMPS) for a job well done.The DPM further recalled that China has never colonised or looked down on Basotho so they must be appreciated by Basotho so there is unity among them, adding that it is not only bad to attack foreigners but any other human being.'We must work together in unison to protect one another because foreigners are here to create jobs through investment which is what everyone is looking for', he said.He concluded by noting that it is the Prime Minister's desire for the security forces to be zero tolerant against crime and make all streets around Maseru and the whole country crime free.On behalf of the Minister of Police, Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr. Tsukutlane Au said the government pledges to work hard to see that police are competent to strengthen their ability to tackle crime and violence.'We should work together to sharpen police skills towards a decline in crime incidents against the Chinese, and the job has already started when 13 police officers were sent to China for training. Among other modules that they were doing, include investigative skills, and crime control, therefore we will forever be indebted to China for this generous assistance', said Au.Au reiterated his office's commitment to put together community policing strategies and get people to work together against crimes such as stock-theft, and cyber crime and urged police to open communication channels.Meanwhile, Chinese Ambassador to Lesotho, Mr. Sun Xianghua expressed his heart-felt appreciation to the DPM saying the government has helped the centre to achieve more than it was expected.He also acknowledged that this initiative has been a platform to consolidate the two countries' relations, and creating a conducive environment for investors and appreciated that although the Chinese have been living in fear for their lives, attacks against them have been committed by a small number of Basotho which means it is not the whole nation against the foreigners.He cited a number of projects that the Chinese government have been providing for Basotho that include poverty reduction exercises as a way to show its gratitude.He added that the current government is a fertile environment for socio-economic development of Lesotho but support of the nation is highly needed.This centre was established last year in July, and is intended to assist Chinese during attacks by criminals through coordination of police officers from different areas to locate them and the kind of assistance that can be provided at the time.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Lesotho News Agency.

Hospital: Chinese Nobel Peace laureate's health worsensAssociated Press InternationalJuly 6, 2017 Thursday 12:35 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 666 wordsByline: By DIDI TANG, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Chinese Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo's health is further deteriorating as his liver function worsens and abdominal fluid accumulates, a friend and the hospital that is treating him said, adding to concerns about the long-term prognosis for the country's best-known political prisoner.The doctor heading a medical team in charge of Liu's treatment for late-stage liver cancer informed his family of the development, the First Hospital of China Medical University said in a statement that appeared on its website Thursday.A family friend confirmed on Thursday that Liu's family had been asked to be on standby in the hospital in the northeastern city of Shenyang over the next 24 hours - which they took as a sign that Liu is critically ill."We are worried about whether we should start planning for what to do after he leaves," family friend Wu Yangwei, better known by his penname Ye Du., told The Associated Press.Wu on Thursday shared on social media an undated photo of a visibly emaciated Liu, in blue-and-white-striped hospital pajamas, embracing his wife Liu Xia, who gazed up at his expressionless face. The photo appeared to have been taken at the hospital, though its background seemed to have been digitally blurred.Liu's liver function is deteriorating, the hospital said in a separate statement later Thursday. The hospital said doctors detected increasing levels of a natural waste product called bilirubin in Liu's body - a sign that his liver is not effectively filtering the byproduct from his blood. Elevated bilirubin levels are linked to jaundice.The hospital also said there were signs that Liu might have blood clots in his lower left leg. Clots are most dangerous when they travel to the lungs, a potentially life-threatening situation, or to the brain, where they can cause a stroke.Liu was diagnosed in May while serving a 11-year sentence for inciting subversion by advocating sweeping political reforms that would end China's one-party rule. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010, a year after his conviction.Since the diagnosis was made public in late June, his supporters, Western governments and human rights groups have been urging Beijing to release Liu and give him the freedom to choose where he wants to be treated. Beijing has maintained that this is an internal affair other countries should stay out of and that Liu is under the care of experts in the Chinese medical facility.Guo Yuhua, a professor of sociology in Beijing, said the government has failed to give Liu what he most needs."Liberty, family and friendship are the best medicine, yet Beijing would never offer them to him," she said.Maya Wang, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, called Liu's treatment "shameful.""The Chinese government's treatment of Liu Xiaobo, which includes holding him and his family even in his dying days, reveal the cruelty and ruthlessness of the Chinese government," Wang said. "How can such a government be considered as a reliable and responsible partner for global leadership?"The hospital statement also included the names of some of the experts, including Dr. Mao Yilei, a reputed expert on liver cancer at the prestigious Peking Union Medical College Hospital, who conducted another round of group consultations on the day when the statement was released, which was most likely Thursday.In a likely response to criticism that China might have failed to adequately care for Liu, the statement said the experts were approving of prior treatments of Liu. They also adjusted the treatment as Liu's illness developed, the hospital said.On behalf of the medical team, Mao informed Liu's family of his most recent condition, and Liu's family said they understood, the statement said. The statement was impossible to verify with Liu's wife or other family members, who have not been contactable and are said to face restrictions on their movements and communications with the outside world. Calls to the hospital were unanswered on Thursday.Load-Date: July 7, 2017End of Document

CHINA: POLICE DNA DATABASE THREATENS PRIVACYStates News ServiceMay 15, 2017 MondayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 2739 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:40 Million Profiled Includes Dissidents, Migrants, Muslim UyghursChina's police are collecting DNA from individuals for a nationally searchable database without oversight, transparency, or privacy protections, Human Rights Watch said today. Evidence suggests that the regional government in Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region with a history of government repression, intends to accelerate the collection and indexing of DNA.In many parts of the country, police officers are compelling ordinary individuals neither convicted nor even suspected of a crime to have their blood drawn and DNA taken. Samples have also been collected from vulnerable groups already targeted for increased government surveillance, including migrant workers, dissidents, and minority Muslim Uyghurs. Because police wield wide powers, and because there are no actionable privacy rights in China, people have little ability to refuse the collection of such personal information."DNA collection can have legitimate policing uses in investigating specific criminal cases, but only in a context in which people have meaningful privacy protections," said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. "Until that's the case in China, the mass collection of DNA and the expansion of databases needs to stop."Mass DNA collection by the powerful Chinese police absent effective privacy protections or an independent judicial system is a perfect storm for abuses.Sophie RichardsonChina DirectorIn the early 2000s, the Chinese Ministry of Public Security started building a searchable, national DNA database called the "Forensic Science DNA Database System" (ac•ac 'a DNAac•[deg]acRa"c»c»Ÿ), also known as "National Public Security Agencies DNA Database Application System" (a 'a¬aR‰acuaDNAac•[deg]acRa"a"c" c»c»Ÿ), as part of a larger police information project known as the Golden Shield.By late 2015, the Ministry of Public Security had accumulated 44 million "miscellaneous data entries." The government claims it is the biggest in the world. It includes data from more than 40 million individuals, while 1.5 million entries refer to physical evidence related to crime scenes. The Ministry of Public Security runs a second, separate "Combat Trafficking DNA Database" ( "ac‰"aci" DNAac•[deg]acRa") with more than 513,000 DNA entries. Authorities have stated that the DNA databases are used for solving crimes, including terrorism and child trafficking, as well as to identify bodies and vagrants.Documented cases demonstrate that the collection of DNA does not appear to be connected to solving specific cases of crimes. Police have conducted campaigns to amass biometrics from ordinary citizens simply because it has identified gathering "basic information" (aŸc',ac¯) a goal, important for the unspecified need to "solve crimes." In these notices, local police stations hail the success of their drives, publicizing the dozens or hundreds of DNA samples they collected.In addition, Chinese law appears to limit police collection of DNA samples to people connected to the investigation of a specific criminal case. Article 130 of the Criminal Procedure Law states that in the course of criminal investigations, in order to "ascertain certain features, conditions of injuries, or physical conditions of a victim or a criminal suspect, a physical examination may be conducted, and fingerprints, blood, urine and other biological samples may be collected. If a criminal suspect refuses to be examined, the investigators, when they deem it necessary, may conduct a compulsory examination." But there are no legal guidelines on how long DNA samples can be stored, shared, or used, or how their collection can be challenged."Mass DNA collection by the powerful Chinese police absent effective privacy protections or an independent judicial system is a perfect storm for abuses," Richardson said. "China is moving its Orwellian system to the genetic level."Background: Popular Objections to DNA CollectionIndividuals who have had their DNA taken by police have detailed their experiences on social media platforms, including Weibo, Zhihu, Baidu Zhidao, Tieba, and Tianya. In these posts, netizens described officers coming to their homes, schools, and workplaces to collect their samples; none described having been presented any warrant or the visits having been announced in advance. In other cases, people discuss having been required to provide DNA samples when they applied for documents from the police, including residency permits and ID cards. In some other cases, police officers have demanded DNA samples from individuals whom they had taken to the police station for questioning, though in the vast majority of these cases the individuals were not suspects formally detained or arrested for crimes.Some people said online that they "did not want to have their DNA taken" or were "very upset" about having their information taken. In one post on Tianya dated June 28, 2016, a person who was forced by police officers in Zhongshan, Guangdong province, to supply his DNA sample following a routine roadside ID check wondered: "Why was I treated like this? I am not a criminal, but this is worse than a criminal, I've been feeling very upset. I'm afraid what they'd do to my sample."These posts reflect peoples' unease about why their information was collected, whether the collection was legal, would the collection have a negative impact on their lives, and if a criminal record or investigation would follow. There was also anger over a lack of informed consent.In a post on Tieba dated August 6, 2016, a netizen whose DNA was taken as part of the ID application process wrote, "I went to the county police station to get them to re-issue my ID, and they took my blood and DNA sample...why did they take my DNA? [They said] that's the rule. If you don't let us do it we won't issue [your ID] ...now even f***** DNA belongs to the Chinese Communist Party!"The issue of DNA collection has received some press attention. In one case in Shandong province, police collected DNA from more than 5,000 male students in one college in October 2013. The students were given no explanation about why their information was taken, and many "did not understand nor felt comfortable about it." When reached by journalists, the school said it was to cooperate with the police's request to establish a database about migrant populations, but the police said it was to solve a number of theft cases on the campus.Profiling in DNA CollectionPolice notices published in recent years describing these drives typically include broad categories of target populations beyond "suspects and criminals." These categories vary, but typically include: "focus personnel," a broad term referring to anyone authorities perceive as potential threats, such as dissidents, activists, petitioners, and anyone with a prior criminal record; "work targets," another vague term police use to describe persons of interest such as those with administrative infractions to criminal convictions; and migrants (acµa aa ), meaning anyone whose hukou (or "residency permit") is not located in the area, including migrants from the countryside. There are also drives targeting particular establishments hostels, entertainment venues, internet cafes, and rental homes in which DNA is collected from anyone police deem "suspicious." A few notices targeted particular professions: sex workers and locksmiths.This form of broad and discriminatory social profiling appears to be a form of preventive policing. Some of these local police drives targeting migrant workers state as their objective "stability maintenance" a government euphemism for silencing criticism and staving off protests. Examples include:In Shaanxi province, officers from police stations in Baoji City, Shangluo City, and Tongchuan City visited local companies between October and November 2016 to collect the DNA of migrant workers, claiming a need to "ensure stability";A police station in Guiyang City, Guizhou province, waged a campaign to collect information from migrants, including DNA samples and fingerprints, as part of an effort to "construct harmonic society";A police station located in a border town in Jilin province collected 247 samples of DNA from migrants in the area in July 2015. This "improved migrant population information," helped solve crimes, and "strengthened the level of social safety and security."Some peaceful government critics and activists also report that their DNA was collected, typically during interrogations or questioning in police stations:Shen Liangqing, a Hefei activist, had his biometrics taken by the police, including blood samples, twice in 2015, after he was interrogated for accepting an interview of a foreign press and tweeting about the Tianjin chemical explosions of 2015. The police said they needed to "gather citizens' information" but gave no further explanation about what it might be used for, or how it would be stored, according to Shen.Police forcibly took the DNA, photo, fingerprints, and palm prints of a Jiangxi anti-corruption activist Liu Ping during an 11-hour interrogation session in September 2012, during which she was tortured, and told her the information was needed for constructing a "criminal database." Liu is currently serving six years in prison.Guangdong authorities took the DNA and fingerprints of activist He Yanyun after interrogating him about an article on human rights lawyers he wrote in July 2015.Officers taking human rights lawyer Wang Quanping into custody in April 2014, after he attempted to attend the trial of a fellow rights lawyer, told him they had to collect fingerprints, blood, and DNA samples from him. The officers told Wang that this was a regular procedure for everyone brought to the station, in order to "gather citizens' information." After Wang protested, saying he was not suspected of any crime or detained under criminal procedures, the officers did not take his biometrics but subsequently upgraded his case from an administrative case to a criminal case, detaining him for eight days.ExpandMen install a CCTV camera in a shopping street in the town of Kashgar, Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, China, March 23, 2017. State media say measures such as a network of thousands of new street-corner police posts, are aimed to make everyone feel safer.2017 Reuters/Thomas PeterAlarming Trends in XinjiangHuman Rights Watch reported in November 2016 that police have required all passport applicants in Xinjiang not suspects or convicts in a criminal case to supply DNA samples as part of their application. Xinjiang, home to approximately 10 million Muslim Uyghurs, has a long history of state repression.Further investigation by Human Rights Watch found that in September 2016, the Xinjiang regional police bureau issued two calls for tender at 60 million RMB (US$8.69 million) and 20 million RMB (US$2.90 million) for a total of 12 DNA sequencers, 30 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifiers, and 1000 batches of genotyping kits. The purchase indicates that the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau (PSB) intends to build large-scale infrastructure to profile a large number of individuals, according to four DNA experts Human Rights Watch spoke to. However, because the full tender document is not publicly accessible, it is difficult to assess precisely the scope of this infrastructure.In 2016, the Xinjiang PSB also issued a "Notice to Fully Carry Out the Construction of Three-Dimensional Portraits, Voiceprint and DNA Fingerprint Biometrics Collection System" (aaŽa a¼a•a¸‰c»aa ana[deg]canDNAacŒ‡cc"Ÿc‰,ac¯e‡‡e›†c»c»Ÿa»eRc›¸a-'c„ecŸ¥). But the full document is not publicly available. It is unclear who is targeted for such collection; how this information is to be used, shared, or stored; the rationale behind the collecting; or how one challenges the collection. A separate call for tender issued by the Yopurga County Police Bureau, Kashgar, Xinjiang, cited the "notice" and stated that the biometric collection is part of "stability maintenance." Regional authorities have revealed little about these new efforts.Lack of SafeguardsA DNA database allows police not only to search for an exact match, but also a search for those who are related family members. If police have access to a DNA sample from a cousin, nephew, or aunt in the database, they can know that the person they are looking for is a first or second-degree relative and focus their search on the family in question. Ministry of Public Security (MPS) researchers who work on the DNA database say that more complex familial DNA searches are not currently effective given the way the police DNA database is structured. But some provincial authorities, particularly in Henan Province, are attempting to gather additional data, including "Y-STR" DNA information, or Y-chromosome information passed down along the male descendants of families, to systematically map out family trees.While there are MPS internal departmental rules that focus on the administrative or technical aspects of DNA data collection, most are not publicly available. The "Rules on the Construction of the Forensic Science DNA Database System" (ac•ac 'a DNAac•[deg]acRa"a»eRe „eŒGA/T4182003), published in 2003 by the MPS Forensic Center, states that the database consists of data from those who have "violated the law and committed crimes," but it does not further describe or delineate this set. A 2009 MPS document outlines "ten types of cases" and "eight types of individuals" that can be targets for such collection, but Human Rights Watch was unable to find the document online and there is no public information giving further details. A notice issued by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau gives more details: those who have committed "violent, drug-related, sex-related crimes" as well as "anyone who has been subjected to above administrative and public order punishments" should have their DNA taken. The latter group would include individuals who were not convicted of crimes, but merely subjected to administrative detention, a form of deprivation of liberty imposed by the police alone without court decision. In early 2017, the Chinese government issued new draft amendments to its Public Security Administrative Punishments Law, in which a new provision, article 112, was added authorizing police to collect biometrics, including through blood samples, for the purpose of determining victims and perpetrators in minor administrative cases.DNA databases are not inherently illegal and have been justified at times as permissible investigative tools. But to meet international privacy standards enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which China has signed but not ratified, a DNA collection and retention mechanism must be comprehensively regulated, narrow in scope, and proportionate to meeting a legitimate security goal.The United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy has noted that DNA databases can raise human rights concerns, including "potential misuse for government surveillance, including identification of relatives and non-paternity, and the risk of miscarriages of justice." Collection of DNA without the subject's full informed consent can only be justified in very limited circumstances, such as when necessary to the investigation of a serious crime, and must be prescribed by law for reasons that comport with human rights.DNA gathering systems like the one China operates have been ruled violative of privacy rights elsewhere. For example, in 2008 the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) outlawed the collection and indefinite retention of fingerprints, cell samples, and DNA profiles. The European Court, in reaching its conclusion, reasoned that sweeping, indiscriminate DNA databases violated the right to personal privacy. It added that DNA collection may be appropriate in relation to state security and crime prevention, but only if the collection system is heavily regulated by established law and open to the careful scrutiny of a judiciary. Similarly, the United States Supreme Court, in Maryland v. King, ruled that the collection and retention of DNA profiles on people convicted of violent crimes were legal given the limited types of collection, analysis, and use of samples provided by statute.Load-Date: May 16, 2017End of Document

Russia, China Conduct Joint Naval Drills In Baltic SeaThe FrontrunnerJuly 26, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 456 wordsBodyThe New York Times (7/25, Higgins, Subscription Publication, 14.49M) reports China and Russia have conducted joint military exercises for at least a decade, but for the first time on Tuesday, they practiced drills in the Baltic Sea. The NATO alliance "said on Tuesday that it had been aware of plans for the Russo-Chinese naval maneuvers, called Joint Sea 2017, for several weeks," and that "it arranged for allied navies to greet the Chinese vessels last week as they headed for the Baltic Sea." While China, Russia, and NATO "appeared eager to avoid inflaming the tensions," the Times says Moscow and Beijing "share a distaste for Western-style democracy and stress traditional values and the primacy of order, seeing themselves as superior alternatives to Western models rooted in political pluralism."China Denies Jets Operated Dangerously In US Encounter.The AP (7/25, Bodeen) reports China on Tuesday "denied its fighter jet pilots operated dangerously during an encounter with a US surveillance plane in international airspace in which the American pilot took evasive action to avoid a possible collision." Defense Ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang said in a statement that the performance of the pilots of the two J-10 fighters was "legal, necessary and professional." Ren also "criticized frequent close-in surveillance runs by US planes as raising the chance of accidents," and called on the US to stop such "unsafe, unprofessional and unfriendly military activities."WSJournal A1: China Expanding Global Role Domestically, Internationally.In a front-page article, the Wall Street Journal (7/25, A1, Chen, Chin, Subscription Publication, 6.99M) reports that under his signature "China Dream" slogan, President Xi Jinping has expanded his nation's international role in areas like trade and climate change, a direction approved by more than 80 percent of Chinese, according to annual Pew Research Center surveys. The rise of Chinese exceptionalism comes amid growing uncertainties about the US role as an international leader and a shrinking popularity gap between the two nations - Pew Research Center found 47 percent of respondents now view China positively, compared to 49 percent who view the US positively.Chinese Government Appears Poised For Tighter Internet Controls.The Wall Street Journal (7/25, Browne, Subscription Publication, 6.99M) examines whether the Chinese government is pursuing absolute control of the Internet by imposing a blanket prohibition on virtual private networks, or VPNs. Even though the government has already intensified its crackdown on VPNs, and President Xi Jinping's political future is at stake this year, the Journal says partial restrictions are more realistic than a total VPN prohibition.Load-Date: July 26, 2017End of Document

US/China: VOA Needs Thorough, Independent Investigation Into Journalists' SuspensionTargeted News ServiceMay 19, 2017 Friday 9:27 PM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 542 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyPEN America issued the following news release:Voice of America (VOA) should ensure that its investigation into the circumstances surrounding the suspension of five VOA Mandarin Service journalists be comprehensive and fully address allegations regarding attempted outside influence on the news service, a necessary step to ensure continued public trust in the venerable US government-funded media outlet, PEN America said today.On May 2, five VOA journalists were informed that they would be suspended with pay from their employment at VOA, pending the completion of a "full investigation." The suspensions occurred after a live interview conducted on April 19th with fugitive Chinese businessman Guo Wenggui. Guo, who is wanted in China on bribery charges, has made high-profile accusations of corruption against Beijing government officials and other Chinese elites. Such allegations, made on social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter, led to him being briefly suspended from both social media platforms in April.The April 19 VOA interview, in which Guo stated his innocence of the charges against him and repeated prior allegations of government corruption, was abruptly ended approximately an hour into the broadcast. At the time the interview was cut off, Guo was commenting on allegations against Wang Qishan, a senior leader of the Chinese Communist Party. Voice of America cited a "miscommunication" as the reason for the curtailed interview, saying that the segment was only scheduled to be an hour long.Voice of America has stated that the decision to suspend the journalists was "based on the journalistic principles of verification, balance and fairness that are standard industry practice and apply universally to all VOA services." During the interview itself, the journalists noted that China's Foreign Ministry had summoned a member of the VOA staff before the interview to discourage the news outlet from proceeding. VOA has denied that it was subject to pressure from the US government and said that overtures by the Chinese government played no role in their decision to interrupt the Guo interview, or to suspend the journalists.A thorough, independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding the curtailed interview and the conduct of relevant VOA staff and leaders is essential to address claims of improper influence. "The VOA has fiercely safeguarded its reputation for journalistic independence which is integral to its global role," said PEN America Executive Director Suzanne Nossel, "The launch of an independent inquiry is an important step to address questions that have been raised and uphold VOA's storied reputation."PEN America, the free expression advocacy group, has long been engaged on the issue of press freedom in China and specifically the influence of the Chinese government in impairing the work of foreign journalists. Its work includes its September 2016 report Darkened Screen, on restrictions of foreign journalists and media outlets in mainland China, and its January 2015 report Threatened Harbor, on the deteriorating atmosphere for press freedom in Hong Kong.Contact: Sarah Edkins, communications director, 646/779-4830, sedkins@pen.orgCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-5868874 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: May 20, 2017End of Document

Inspiring Memoir 'Powered by Wellesley' Tells the Tale of China's Development & Its Impact to Democracy; A Small Window Into China's SoulPR NewswireJuly 26, 2017 Wednesday 1:37 PM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 482 wordsDateline: GENOA, Nev., July 26, 2017 Body A new book from Jin Lan McCann, a new Chinese immigrant to the United States, offers a first-hand perspective on modern Chinese history, censorship, and her non-traditional education at Wellesley College, which turned her into a force for change. "Powered by Wellesley" (ISBN: 978-0998989990) chronicles McCann's life story through China's Cultural Revolution, economic reform, and subsequent development. Before immigrating, and without a college education, she built a successful business career and became one of the first group of millionaires in China. However, she spent her wealth saving her ex-boyfriend from a death sentence."I was born in Chongqing during the Chinese Cultural Revolution, and I've spent many years studying modern Chinese social history," said McCann. "The book unravels how a largely agrarian, peasant economy leapt into the 21st century as a leader in numerous fields. I'm fascinated with China's integration with the West but also concerned about its impact to the western democracy due to its penetration in every level of western governments and private sectors. The threat is absolutely not illusion."McCann also shares her experiences with censorship.

CHINA'S SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY WORKS TO IMPROVE SCIENCE COMMUNICATIONSStates News ServiceJune 19, 2017 MondayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 913 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS):Joy MaLin Zheng, a leading Chinese communications professional, traveled earlier this spring from Beijing to Wuhan, an ancient city with a growing scientific presence, to address a group of media officers eager to improve their science communication skills.Over the last decade, Lin has coached scientists and engineers from China and other nations about how to most effectively promote scientific discoveries and gain the attention of other scientists, scientific institutions and, most importantly, the public.In 2015, she attended her first international science communication workshop in Chengdu, co-organized by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and EurekAlert!, the global, non-profit news service operated by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. She participated in a similar workshop in Wuhan in April, and this time, not as a participant but as a presenter.As the chief of external relations and media officer for the Chinese Academy of Sciences' affiliated Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Lin now works closely with scientific institutions throughout China and from this position has seen significant changes in how scientists promote their work."I used to have to run after scientists and 'beg' them to talk about their work," she said. More recently, though, scientists are actively reaching out to her when they publish new research findings and are far more willing to follow up with reporters seeking to interview them. "I am really proud of these changes," said Lin.The transformation coincides with the Chinese government's move to increase investment in its science and technology enterprise with an eye toward expanding innovation and, in turn, growing the nation's economy. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, the country's top economic official, said as much in delivering an ambitious draft economic development plan to the National People's Congress in 2016.The plan called for increasing science spending by 9.1%, a level equal to a $41 billion boost over five years, and pledged to reduce bureaucratic barriers for scientists. The effort has led many scientists to look beyond their institutional affiliations and more eagerly seek to publicize their work throughout the scientific community and beyond China's borders.In China, there is a growing public demand for science news and information on a range of topics centered on everyday life, such as air quality, climate change, infectious diseases and vaccination. The heightened interest comes as scientific institutions in the United States face steep spending reduction proposals and as the news industry throughout the Western world continues to adjust to the digital world, said Brian Lin, EurekAlert!'s director of content strategy.News_0614_China_two-thirds.jpgEurekAlert!'s Brian Lin coaches Chinese science communicators at a spring workshop in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. | Chinese Academy of Sciences"There has been and will continue to be significant investment in scientific research in China," said Lin of EurekAlert!. He added that such progress will prompt more Chinese media officers to look for new ways "to share their results with the world."Since 2015, EurkAlert! has worked with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and offered workshops in cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Kunming. The April workshops held in Wuhan, Hefei and Xi'an represented EurkAlert!'s first foray into central China where science and technology is a growing economic focus.EurekAlert! will continue to hold workshops and training sessions for media professionals in China to help them enhance their communications skills, hone their ability to promote science by offering participants the "tools and confidence needed to help their scientists communicate openly the value and challenges of science," added Lin of EurekAlert!.Joining Lin Zheng as a speaker at the EurekAlert! workshops in April were two other media officers from affiliated institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences."We get to understand how the media works," said Lin Zheng, who highlighted the career benefits of participating in such professional development workshops. "I realize my job is to connect journalists with scientists and make sure there are smooth communications between the two sides."Lin of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics said her participation in the workshops both as a speaker and earlier as a participant has already delivered tangible results. A recent study published in the Advances in Atmospheric Sciences, an Institute of Atmospheric Physics journal, gained noteworthy media coverage from over 100 media outlets worldwide.She is nonetheless mindful that her success is something that remains out of reach for many media officers in China. Science communication is still evolving in China and it will take time before it resembles how scientific communities in other countries highlight the value of science, she noted.As the public in China reaches for more information about scientific advances and study findings, China's media and scientific community has been urging the government to increase its spending on efforts to more widely promote science."There is great potential for quality science news and hopefully by extension, evidence-based, scientific thinking to become a part of the public debate on major policy issues," said Lin of EurekAlert!.Load-Date: June 27, 2017End of Document

CHINA: RELEASE TAIWANESE DEMOCRACY ACTIVIST NO CREDIBLE EVIDENCE CITED FOR NATIONAL SECURITY ALLEGATIONSStates News ServiceApril 19, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 796 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Chinese authorities should immediately release a longtime Taiwanese democracy activist who has been detained for a month on suspicion of endangering China's national security, Human Rights Watch said today. Chinese national security laws allow the authorities to deny Li Ming-Che, 42, access to his family and lawyers, leaving him at serious risk of mistreatment."Chinese authorities have offered no credible evidence for the grave allegations against Li Ming-Che," said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. "The authorities should immediately notify Li's family of his whereabouts, and allow his family and lawyer to visit him."Li has been missing since March 19, 2017, after he crossed from Macau into Zhuhai in China's Guangdong province. A friend of his who had planned to meet him in Zhuhai said Li never arrived. Ten days later, China's Taiwan Affairs Office the government agency responsible for cross-strait affairs confirmed at a news conference that the "relevant authorities" had detained Li and placed him under investigation on suspicion of "engaging in activities that endanger national security."Li, a manager at Taipei's Wenshan Community College, has worked for Taiwan's pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party and is a longtime supporter of civil society groups and activists in China. Li had used an account on WeChat, a Chinese social media and messaging app, to discuss human rights issues and Taiwan's democratic transition with Chinese activists, but in 2015 he was blocked from sending group messages. Li has also taken books to Chinese activists and families of detained rights lawyers. On his most recent trip, Li planned to see friends and seek medical treatment for his mother-in-law.On April 10, Li's wife, Li Ching-yu, was prevented from boarding a flight from Taipei to Beijing to try to visit with and deliver medications to her husband. An airline employee at the airport informed her that her taibaozheng a Beijing-issued travel permit necessary for Taiwanese to visit China - had been cancelled. Li Ching-yu told the New York Times that she had not received an explanation for the cancellation. She also said that a Taiwanese person who has ties with Chinese authorities contacted her to say that if she ceased her public campaign calling for her husband's release he would be freed. She said the person told her that if she continued, a confession by her husband would be broadcast on Chinese TV.A spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office warned at a second news conference on April 12 that outside interference with Li's case would "complicate" matters and "harm the interests of the person concerned."Although China's Criminal Procedure Law requires police to notify families within 24 hours of criminal detention, the requirement can be waived in cases involving "national security" and "terrorism," and when the police believe that such notification could "impede the investigation." Similarly, although the Criminal Procedure Law allows lawyer-client meetings within 48 hours of lawyers making such requests, in cases involving "national security," "terrorism," and "major corruption," police approval is required before such meetings can take place.Since President Xi Jinping came to power in March 2013, authorities have apprehended citizens of other countries inside and outside China for their work helping Chinese human rights lawyers and activists or for speaking critically of Chinese leaders. Those detained include a Swedish human rights activist, Peter Dahlin; Gui Minhai, a bookseller also from Sweden; James Wang, an American businessman; and Lee Bo, a British bookseller. Some of the detainees had also been forced to give confessions on state media. Authorities have also used televised confessions to vilify detained journalists, bloggers, activists and lawyers, and increasingly have used national security charges to prosecute and imprison activists solely for their peaceful criticism of the Chinese government.Under international law, a government commits an enforced disappearance when state agents take a person into custody and then deny holding the person, or conceal or fail to disclose the person's whereabouts. "Disappeared" people are often at high risk of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. The use of televised confessions violates the right to a fair trial and can often be linked to torture or other ill-treatment."Beijing's persecution of those who work to advance human rights and justice in China increasingly targets non-citizens," Richardson said. "Repeatedly levelling national security charges against peaceful activists marks another alarming escalation in Xi's campaign against human rights."Load-Date: April 19, 2017End of Document

CHINA COULD ROLL OUT CHONGQING VPN BAN, FINES NATIONWIDE: ACTIVISTSStates News ServiceApril 3, 2017 MondayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 728 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:New rules banning the use of circumvention tools to get around internet censorship in the southwestern Chinese megacity of Chongqing could soon be rolled out nationwide, activists told RFA.Chongqing only recently made public the new regulations, which came into effect last July and ban the city's 50 million residents from "scaling the Great Firewall."Individuals and companies that use tools like virtual private networks (VPNs) to circumvent the complex array of blocks, filters and human censorship that limits what Chinese internet users can see online will be ordered to disconnect, while anyone profiting from such activity will be fined, according to the Chongqing regulations.This could include anyone seeking to read news that the ruling Chinese Communist Party regards as unflattering, businesses wanting to use blocked social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and Google to communicate, and academics seeking access to overseas research.Rights activist Ou Biaofeng said he fears the Chongqing regulations are being piloted in the city and will soon be rolled out nationwide."I think that the government is using Chongqing as a testing ground, and then they will apply it to the whole country," Ou told RFA in a recent interview.He said the impact would be huge."A lot of people use circumvention tools to access information from overseas at the moment," Ou said. "This is going to spread fear among all those people that climb the Great Firewall."New regulationsThe Chongqing rules are the latest in a string of draconian regulations issued by Beijing in a bid to exert complete control over what China's 731 million internet users can see, or post, online.Last November, Beijing issued a raft of new measures that could undermine their use of virtual private networks (VPNs) to get around censorship.The draft regulations would require any websites operating in China to register with a Chinese domain name, which is subject to state control and can be used to shut down entire websites within the country-level .cn top-level domain.And state news agency Xinhua news agency suggested in a Jan. 11 report that the requirement, which sparked concerns at the time over deeper censorship and access by foreign businesses to the Chinese market, is unlikely to be dropped.Xie Jiaye, head of the New York-based Chinese Association of Science and Technology, said he sees the Chongqing rules as part of this strategy."These kinds of controls on information will be of no benefit to China's economic or technological development," Xie told RFA. "In fact, there are no benefits at all to the kind of control and censorship that the Chinese government exercises over the internet."He said he can't see any evidence that controls will be relaxed any time soon."That's not very likely, certainly not during the 10 years President Xi Jinping will be in power," Xie said.The New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) hit out at the ban in a blog post by China director Sophie Richardson."The Chongqing regulation is unprecedented as it places a blanket ban on the use of VPNs and other circumvention methods used to connect to the global internet," Richardson wrote, adding that previous regulatory efforts have focused on providers and let individuals alone."It is unclear whether other local governments will soon follow suit, but the ban has already had a chilling effect among VPN users across the nationmany netizens posted frightened or crying emojis to express their displeasure," she wrote.'Cutting us off'Chongqing resident Zhang Lin said the rules are aimed at ensuring that no voices critical of the government can be heard online in China."They want to suppress people's freedom of expression and stop ordinary people from having a voice," Zhang said. "They want to cut us off from the rest the world, from public opinion in other countries."Fellow Chongqing resident Xu Yuanqing agreed."They want to oppress people, to shut us down so we can't be seen or heard," Xu said. "That way, there won't be any international pressure [on the government].""They shouldn't be allowed to cut us off like this; I hope people overseas will pay attention to what's happening in China."Reported by Xi Wang for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Wong Lok-to for the Cantonese Service.

The Chinese government still needs to review the applications.The trademark requests cover an array of products, from tapestries and video game equipment to snacks and booze. They come on top of 36 applications the company filed in China last year.Ivanka Trump's business, which mostly makes clothing and accessories, says the latest trademark applications were filed to block others from profiting off of her name, not because she wants to sell the products in China.But that's still a problem, says Larry Noble, the general counsel for the nonprofit, nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, a watchdog group.He said the family's continued ties to their businesses raise questions about whether their profit motives could influence U.S. relations with other countries."China knows that to deny these applications would get a negative reaction from the president, and to expedite their approval would get a positive reaction from the president," Noble said."China is a huge market," Noble said, adding that Ivanka Trump's company could "stand to lose a lot if these applications are denied."The Chinese government has insisted that its trademark review practices are carried out in accordance with the law.Attorneys for Ivanka Trump did not respond to a request for comment from CNNMoney for this story.Ivanka Trump resigned from management at her company, and her attorneys have in the past said that she would recuse herself from certain policy matters, like trade agreements, that are specific enough to affect her line of clothing and accessories.But she still has an ownership stake in the company. And though Ivanka Trump's attorney has said the assets were moved into a trust, her client still stands to benefit from the company's profits.Brand experts have told CNNMoney that China is a potentially important market for the Ivanka Trump brand. Ivanka Trump isn't as controversial a figure there as she is in the U.S., and Chinese women tend to idolize her femininity and success, they say.The Ivanka Trump company says the filings are part of the "normal course of business." It said it applied for these trademarks in China in response to a "surge" in unrelated third parties trying to snag the Ivanka Trump name for themselves."It is our responsibility to diligently protect our trademark," the company said in a statement.Noble said the rationale might be true. But he added that it doesn't make the situation any less alarming. If Ivanka Trump wanted to completely avoid conflicts of interest, she should have either sold her entire stake or kept her company out of foreign markets, he said."When you go into government, you make sacrifices," Noble said. "When you're a public servant you're supposed to give 100% of your attention to your work. You're supposed to have the American public as your sole interest."The newly reported trademark applications are not the first time ethics experts have raised concerns.In April, China provisionally granted Ivanka Trump's business three new trademarks on the same day she dined with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago. The company filed the applications in early 2016 -- after Trump entered the race for president but before he won.Those trademarks will be formally registered as long as no objections are raised during a three-month period following their preliminary approval.Ivanka Trump's business now has 18 registered trademarks in China and five provisionally approved. With the latest filings, it also has at least 44 applications that haven't been reviewed by authorities yet.--CNN's Serenitie Wang contributed to this report.Load-Date: June 6, 2017End of Document

Global firms to China: Put new cyber rules on holdCNNMoney.comMay 15, 2017 Monday 4:30 AM ESTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHNOLOGYLength: 428 wordsByline: Alec MacfarlaneBodyChinese President Xi Jinping has been talking up his country's free trade credentials this week, but some of the world's biggest business groups warn that Beijing is about to put up new barriers.Dozens of industry organizations, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have sent a letter to the Chinese government over a new cybersecurity law that's due to take effect next month, calling for it to be delayed.One of the biggest concerns about the new rules is China's plan to conduct security reviews of technology products, which the letter describes as "trade-inhibiting."It also argues that the requirements on issues ranging from data disclosure to encryption could give Chinese companies an unfair advantage over their rivals from overseas. Foreign businesses operating in China usually need to transfer information outside the country, but the new law states that sensitive data must now be stored domestically, a move critics say will hinder trade and innovation.The industry groups, which also include the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry and BusinessEurope, told the Chinese government they fear the measures will "erect trade barriers along national boundaries that effectively bar participation in your market.""Our organizations remain concerned that China's current approach is leading to greater separation rather than integration among our economies," the letter said.According to Chinese authorities, the law is intended to better protect personal information and ensure it is only collected when individuals agree to it -- and also to improve national security.Those who violate the law can have their business activities suspended and their licenses revoked. They can also be fined up to 1 million yuan ($145,000) or even detained for up to 15 days.The letter from the trade groups, which was dated Monday, came amid a huge cyberattack that hit hundreds of thousands of computers around the world, including many in China. Based on software from a trove of spy tools that were either leaked or stolen from the U.S. National Security Agency, the virus took advantage of a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows to try to seize control of data.Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said Tuesday that the attack highlighted the importance of cybersecurity.Some experts say that much of the Chinese law mirrors data privacy measures that other countries have already put in place.

North Korean hackers test China's patiencePolitico.comMay 17, 2017 Wednesday 4:01 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1091 wordsByline: cbennett@politico.com,  (Cory Bennett)Highlight: The spreading malware crisis has security advocates hoping Beijing will finally slap down its aggressive neighbor, something the U.S. has been seeking for years.BodyNorth Korea's hackers already stand accused of disrupting South Korean power plants, trashing Sony Pictures' computers and stealing $81 million from Bangladesh's central bank. But if they also caused this past week's global cyber meltdown, the reclusive regime's cyber operatives may have finally gone too far.That's because the spreading malware crisis' hardest-hit victims include China - the country that some cybersecurity experts say has enabled North Korea's hacking operations by providing network bandwidth and even physical space for thousands of Pyongyang digital warriors to launch attacks on government and corporate computer systems around the world.And that has security advocates hoping that Beijing will finally slap down its aggressive neighbor, something the U.S. has been seeking in vain for years.The North Koreans "generally don't pick on their benefactor," said John Bambenek, manager of threat systems at the cybersecurity company Fidelis, which uncovered suspected digital links between North Korea and the malware blanketing the world.But the wave of so-called ransomware attacks that began Friday have struck China hard, locking up computer networks at government agencies and universities and demanding ransom payments to release them. If North Korea is responsible, even unintentionally, it would be the first known attempt by Pyongyang to digitally pilfer China's coffers at such a scale.The digital strikes came as Beijing and Pyongyang were already at odds over North Korea's erratic military aggression, including a series of ballistic missile tests."This is creating a situation where China is forced to respond," said Carl Wright, executive vice president at TrapX, a cyber firm that studies malware around the globe. "These type of situations, when you combine the physical and cyber together, can definitely be a tipping point."And if China doesn't punish North Korea, some lawmakers and security experts want the Trump administration or an international body to step in - even if that means imposing sanctions on Chinese entities and people that aid Pyongyang's hacking operations.Republican South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds, the chairman of a cyber-focused Armed Services subcommittee, told POLITICO on Tuesday that conclusive proof of North Korean involvement in the ransomware campaign would "certainly strengthen those interests" in imposing fresh penalties on North Korea or China over its digital assistance to Kim Jong Un's regime.Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who chairs a Senate subcommittee overseeing East Asia and international cybersecurity, sent a letter on Tuesday to the U.N. Security Council urging it to slap North Korea with fresh sanctions over both the recent missile launches and its "malicious cyber behavior."Asian experts think China may be amenable to cooperating - to an extent - if the worldwide consensus is that North Korea orchestrated the ransomware ambush."I think in this case they would be open to it," said Adam Segal, a China cyber specialist with the Council on Foreign Relations, adding that Beijing might respond to the threat of U.S. sanctions targeting its banking system.But that cooperation would only go so far, Segal and others cautioned. China's primary goal, they said, is to maintain stability in North Korea and to eradicate the nuclear uncertainty that is quickly pervading the region.China "might take some steps," said Joel Wit, an Asian expert with the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies who oversaw a nuclear deal between the U.S. and North Korea in the 1990s. But "they're going to be finely tuned.""At the end of the day, they're always very careful not to go too far," he added.A Chinese rebuke could involve expelling North Korean hackers or axing Pyongyang's access to China's robust internet, steps that some believe would severely derail the boxed-in country's ability to conduct its digital rampages. Bambenek estimated China could set back Pyongyang's cyber program six to 12 months.Without China as a staging ground, North Korea would have to find another willing partner, scour the black market for tools, or develop its own technology. Each option would put Pyongyang's hackers at greater risk of getting caught, several cyber experts said.But Jenny Jun, co-author of a Center for Strategic and International Studies report on North Korea's digital programs, said Pyongyang may have left behind its digital reliance on China in recent years as the once tech-averse country's hacking skills matured.Much of the evidence of Chinese digital aid to North Korea - tacitly allowing North Korean hackers to work from a Chinese hotel, or letting Chinese-based companies operate as fronts for the development of digital intrusion tools - is based on years-old research. And the tools behind the country's more recent digital ambushes, such as the Sony Pictures strike from late 2014, were developed in-house, Jun said."It is entirely possible they have moved their base to other Southeast Asian countries, with their [internet addresses] just routed or spoofed across different countries," Jun said.Given the lack of concrete information on North Korea, the reality is difficult to ascertain, researchers agreed.Thus far in China, though, the state-controlled media has kept the focus elsewhere - on the general scourge of cybercrime, or the U.S. spy community's role in the outbreak, according to Segal. The hackers behind the digital extortion campaign used a flaw in Microsoft Windows that the National Security Agency had apparently exploited for years - until someone leaked the NSA's hacking tools online and allowed cyber criminals to copy them.The Chinese government itself has stayed mostly silent, Segal added.It could take months before other governments are willing to officially point the finger at North Korea, upping the pressure on China. Assigning blame for cyberattacks is notoriously difficult, and the digital evidence so far - some overlapping code between malware that powered the global attacks and tools used by a North Korean-linked hacking group - is far from conclusive.Even if China decides to act in concert with international partners to stymie North Korea's digital ambitions, the public may never know. Beijing is doggedly committed to retaining its relationship with Pyongyang, regional experts said.The two countries operate "within a narrow band of good relations and bad relations," Wit said.But, he added, "It's always relations."Martin Matishak contributed to this report.Load-Date: May 18, 2017End of Document

CHINA'S STATE MEDIA LAUDS 'SWEEPING VICTORY' AFTER BEIJING REPORTEDLY CATCHES US SPIESStates News ServiceMay 23, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 710 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Chinese officials have refused to deny a weekend report in The New York Times claiming that the Chinese government has systematically dismantled CIA spy operations in China since 2010, while state media lauded the unverified report as a victory for Chinese counterintelligence.The article cited former U.S. officials as saying that, from the final weeks of 2010 through the end of 2012, China had killed at least a dozen of the CIA's sources, and still others were put in jail.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a press conference on Monday that China is indeed engaged in counterintelligence operations, with state security agencies targeting "organizations, personnel and activities" that endanger China's national security and interests.She said the country's counterintelligence agencies were "fully performing their duties with the authorization of the law."However, Hua declined to comment further on the report, saying she was "not apprised of the details."Ran Bogong, former politics professor at Toledo University, appeared to think the report credible."Of course it is taken for granted that China and the United States have set up networks to spy on each other and collective intelligence about the other," Ran told RFA. "It seems that China's destruction of the CIA's networks has seriously impacted on U.S. intelligence operations in China."But he said that China will expect the U.S. to simply reassemble its networks in the country as soon as it is able.'A sweeping victory'Meanwhile, the Global Times newspaper, which operates under the aegis of ruling Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece the People's Daily, said it was unable to verify the accuracy of The New York Times article, but appeared highly satisfied with the story, even warning against trying to rebuild CIA operations in China in future."If this article is telling the truth, we would like to applaud China's anti-espionage activities," the paper said in a commentary on The New York Times article."Not only was the CIA's spy network dismantled, but Washington had no idea what happened and which part of the spy network had gone wrong," the paper wrote. "It can be taken as a sweeping victory."And any attempts by the U.S. to rebuild its spy network in China could meet with the same fate, the paper warned.But it said the story of one CIA source being shot in the courtyard of a government compound was "purely fabricated ... most likely a piece of American-style imagination based on ideology."And Xie Jiaye, head of the New York-based Chinese Association of Science and Technology, also seemed to give credence to the story in The New York Times."Of course both China and the U.S. spy on each other, as do all friendly nations, let alone political or military rivals," Xie said."U.S. spying operations were likely one of the reasons behind Chinese hacker attacks [in recent years]," he added.The Global Times appeared to agree."The CIA has apparently increased its espionage activities in China, which will inevitably lead to China simultaneously strengthening its counterintelligence efforts," the paper warned. "International law will affirm that China's anti-espionage activities are just and legal, while the CIA's spying is illegitimate."Tip-off rewardsThe administration of President Xi Jinping has recently identified a "pressing" need for new measures to guard against foreign spies, official media reported in April.In a bid to comply, police in Beijing offered higher rewards in April to encourage ordinary citizens to tip them off about foreign spies, a move analysts said could put foreign journalists and nongovernmental organization (NGO) workers at risk.Beijing is currently holding Taiwan NGO worker Lee Ming-cheh at an unknown location on spying charges, and draft legislation setting out anti-spying measures has been criticized for allowing too broad a definition of "state secret."Chinese law allows police to detain those suspected of "national security" crimes and hold them under residential surveillance at a secret location for up to six months, with no access to lawyers or family visits.Reported by Gao Shan for RFA's Mandarin Service.

North Korean hackers test China's patiencePolitico.comMay 16, 2017 Tuesday 3:31 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1091 wordsByline: cbennett@politico.com,  (Cory Bennett)Highlight: The spreading malware crisis has security advocates hoping Beijing will finally slap down its aggressive neighbor, something the U.S. has been seeking for years.BodyNorth Korea's hackers already stand accused of disrupting South Korean power plants, trashing Sony Pictures' computers and stealing $81 million from Bangladesh's central bank. But if they also caused this past week's global cyber meltdown, the reclusive regime's cyber operatives may have finally gone too far.That's because the spreading malware crisis' hardest-hit victims include China - the country that some cybersecurity experts say has enabled North Korea's hacking operations by providing network bandwidth and even physical space for thousands of Pyongyang digital warriors to launch attacks on government and corporate computer systems around the world.And that has security advocates hoping that Beijing will finally slap down its aggressive neighbor, something the U.S. has been seeking in vain for years.The North Koreans "generally don't pick on their benefactor," said John Bambenek, manager of threat systems at the cybersecurity company Fidelis, which uncovered suspected digital links between North Korea and the malware blanketing the world.But the wave of so-called ransomware attacks that began Friday have struck China hard, locking up computer networks at government agencies and universities and demanding ransom payments to release them. If North Korea is responsible, even unintentionally, it would be the first known attempt by Pyongyang to digitally pilfer China's coffers at such a scale.The digital strikes came as Beijing and Pyongyang were already at odds over North Korea's erratic military aggression, including a series of ballistic missile tests."This is creating a situation where China is forced to respond," said Carl Wright, executive vice president at TrapX, a cyber firm that studies malware around the globe. "These type of situations, when you combine the physical and cyber together, can definitely be a tipping point."And if China doesn't punish North Korea, some lawmakers and security experts want the Trump administration or an international body to step in - even if that means imposing sanctions on Chinese entities and people that aid Pyongyang's hacking operations.Republican South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds, the chairman of a cyber-focused Armed Services subcommittee, told POLITICO on Tuesday that conclusive proof of North Korean involvement in the ransomware campaign would "certainly strengthen those interests" in imposing fresh penalties on North Korea or China over its digital assistance to Kim Jong Un's regime.Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who chairs a Senate subcommittee overseeing East Asia and international cybersecurity, sent a letter on Tuesday to the U.N. Security Council urging it to slap North Korea with fresh sanctions over both the recent missile launches and its "malicious cyber behavior."Asian experts think China may be amenable to cooperating - to an extent - if the worldwide consensus is that North Korea orchestrated the ransomware ambush."I think in this case they would be open to it," said Adam Segal, a China cyber specialist with the Council on Foreign Relations, adding that Beijing might respond to the threat of U.S. sanctions targeting its banking system.But that cooperation would only go so far, Segal and others cautioned. China's primary goal, they said, is to maintain stability in North Korea and to eradicate the nuclear uncertainty that is quickly pervading the region.China "might take some steps," said Joel Wit, an Asian expert with the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies who oversaw a nuclear deal between the U.S. and North Korea in the 1990s. But "they're going to be finely tuned.""At the end of the day, they're always very careful not to go too far," he added.A Chinese rebuke could involve expelling North Korean hackers or axing Pyongyang's access to China's robust internet, steps that some believe would severely derail the boxed-in country's ability to conduct its digital rampages. Bambenek estimated China could set back Pyongyang's cyber program six to 12 months.Without China as a staging ground, North Korea would have to find another willing partner, scour the black market for tools, or develop its own technology. Each option would put Pyongyang's hackers at greater risk of getting caught, several cyber experts said.But Jenny Jun, co-author of a Center for Strategic and International Studies report on North Korea's digital programs, said Pyongyang may have left behind its digital reliance on China in recent years as the once tech-averse country's hacking skills matured.Much of the evidence of Chinese digital aid to North Korea - tacitly allowing North Korean hackers to work from a Chinese hotel, or letting Chinese-based companies operate as fronts for the development of digital intrusion tools - is based on years-old research. And the tools behind the country's more recent digital ambushes, such as the Sony Pictures strike from late 2014, were developed in-house, Jun said."It is entirely possible they have moved their base to other Southeast Asian countries, with their [internet addresses] just routed or spoofed across different countries," Jun said.Given the lack of concrete information on North Korea, the reality is difficult to ascertain, researchers agreed.Thus far in China, though, the state-controlled media has kept the focus elsewhere - on the general scourge of cybercrime, or the U.S. spy community's role in the outbreak, according to Segal.

China killed CIA sources from 2010 to 2012The Acorn: Drew UniversityMay 22, 2017 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 373 wordsBodyThe Chinese government killed at least 12 USA spies between 2010 and 2012 and imprisoned many, systematically dismantling the CIA's information-gathering operations in China, a media report has said. All told, the Chinese killed or imprisoned 18 to 20 of the CIA's sources in China, said two former senior USA officials, effectively unravelling a network that had taken years to build.In its report, the New York Times cited 10 current or former intelligence officials who spoke anonymously about China wiping out the US's spying network. Official representatives of the personnel administration of the American government admitted that hackers have stolen information on more than 25 million people, including former and current civil servants.An investigation into the breach allegedly caused division between United States officials, with some believing a mole in the CIA to be behind the crisis, while others thought the Chinese had hacked the covert system of contact between the intelligence agency and spies on the ground.In 2012, an official at China's Security Ministry was arrested on suspicion of spying for the US.Whether the U.S. intelligence agency was hacked or whether a spy helped to identify the individuals is unclear. "Not only was the CIA's spy network dismantled, but Washington had no idea what happened and which part of the spy network had gone wrong", the paper said. By 2011, the Central Intelligence Agency realized there was a problem and the investigation into what was happening gained a heightened sense of urgency as more and more people began to disappear. The quality of the CIA's information about the inner workings of the Chinese government then was the best it had been for years, the result of recruiting sources deep inside the bureaucracy in Beijing.By 2013, the joint CIA-FBI probe concluded that China had been successful in crippling the US's intelligence operation in China.The intelligence breach set off a hunt that zeroed in on a former CIA operative who is now living in another Asian country. Those who rejected the mole theory attributed the losses to sloppy American tradecraft in China. Officials say they were meeting in restaurants where even the waiters worked for Chinese intelligence.Load-Date: May 22, 2017End of Document

India and China border stand-off threatens peaceThe Acorn: Drew UniversityJuly 6, 2017 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 488 wordsBodyChina has accused India of using its relations with Bhutan as an excuse to violate China's territory. "It does not belong to Bhutan, still less India", Chinese Foreign Ministry spoesperson Lu Kang said Wedneday."By illegally crossing into another country's territory, India has tread on the basic norms of global relations it had initiated itself", said the spokesperson.He said withdrawal of Indian troops from the area is a "pre-condition" for a peaceful resolution, and there is no scope for a "compromise" on the issue. "The Indian military can choose to return to its territory with dignity, or be kicked out of the area by Chinese soldiers". Find us on Facebook too! The Bhutan side also knows it clearly.The editorial said India would suffer greater losses than it did in 1962, if it incited conflict. It is the first time that Indian troops have crossed the mutually recognised boundary and trespassed into China's territory, triggering a close range face-off between Chinese and Indian border troops."It is true that we have a border dispute with China".The ties between China and India just keep tensing up every day. It said the Indian military will be "kicked out" of Doklam unless it withdraws on its own."Cold war-obsessed India is suspicious" that China is building the road to cut off the Siliguri Corridor, an area held by Indians as strategically important for India to control its turbulent northeast area.The Indian ministry of external affairs had said India was "deeply concerned at the recent Chinese actions and had conveyed to the Chinese government that such construction would represent a significant change of status quo with serious security implications for India".The paper was referring to what Indian Army Chief General Bipin Rawat had said about the situation, saying that India "was ready for a two-and-a-half front war". "It is up to your government policy (whether to exercise military option)". Responding to this the former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who was then only a MP, drove a herd of sheep to the Chinese embassy in Delhi carrying placards reading, "Eat me but save the world".However this time, instead of visible efforts to defuse the situation, analysts say the tone of the rhetoric from the two sides is heating up.The confrontation could spill over into the G-20 summit in Germany later this week where Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi are expected to meet at a gathering of leaders from five emerging economies on the sidelines of the main event in Hamburg. "We have been trying to explore ways to resolve the boundary question with in the Special Representatives mechanism and we have jointly taken measure to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas", Geng said.However, according to the Chinese officials, Indian border guards have obstructed "normal activities" on the Chinese side by opposing the road construction.Load-Date: July 6, 2017End of Document

WhatsApp is being targeted by China's censors, experts sayCNN WireJuly 20, 2017 Thursday 4:01 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 692 wordsByline: By Shen Lu and Rishi IyengarDateline: HONG KONG (CNNMoney) BodyHONG KONG (CNNMoney) --  China's censors are finally catching up to WhatsApp. Unlike most Western media platforms, including its parent company Facebook, the popular encrypted messaging app had managed to escape the attention of Chinese officials. Now it's firmly on their radar. Multiple WhatsApp users contacted by CNNMoney reported they were unable to send images or videos on Tuesday. Cyber experts said they had seen further disruption on WhatsApp servers in China on Wednesday.The servers were not completely blocked but are "largely unavailable," said Charlie Smith of GreatFire.org, a group that monitors internet censorship in the country. "I have also conducted speed tests from China and these sites are not reachable," he told CNNMoney. Nadim Kobeissi, an applied cryptographer at Paris-based startup Symbolic Software, said his team logged into the app via a Chinese server on Tuesday and were unable to send anything other than basic text messages. "We realized that the servers that Whatsapp uses to exchange videos, photos and files were being blocked in the same way they would block Facebook, the BBC etc." Kobeissi said. A WhatsApp spokesperson declined to comment when reached by CNNMoney. The Chinese government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.China has tightened internet censorship across the board in the run-up to the Communist Party's 19th Congress this fall, where a major senior leadership reshuffle is expected. A new cybersecurity law that took effect in June is expected to make it harder for foreign firms to operate in China. "The combination of the new cybersecurity law, and the upcoming Party congress, in addition to restrictions on unregistered VPNs, all point to this being a concerted government effort to crack down on freedom of expression," said Peter Micek, general counsel at digital rights organization Access Now and a teacher of internet policy and governance at Columbia University. A wave of politically sensitive news appears to have prompted an increase in Chinese censorship in recent weeks. In the wake of the death of Liu Xiaobo -- a prominent Chinese Nobel Peace Prize laureate and human rights activist -- last week, censors blocked people from posting the image of an empty chair to pay tribute. The Nobel committee put Liu's medal on an empty chair in the 2010 award ceremony because he was still in prison.CNN's broadcast was blacked out in China every time Liu's images or story appeared.Smith, of GreatFire, believes the WhatsApp crackdown is primarily linked to the activist's death."Censors are working overtime, trying to eliminate all information about him. They must have determined that Chinese were using WhatsApp to share pictures and videos of him and decided to crackdown," he said.Last week, images of Winnie the Pooh were also reportedly censored on Chinese social media because internet users were comparing the cartoon bear to President Xi Jinping. On Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, no results appear on searches for "Winnie the Pooh and Xi Jinping."China has 731 million internet users, and 95% of them access the web on mobile devices, according to data from the China Internet Network Information Center.Western media and tech companies have been trying to crack the market for decades but have largely failed.Facebook, Google, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and YouTube are among the Western services blocked in China.The crackdown has given domestic companies such as Baidu, Youku, Sina and Tencent a huge advantage.Experts say WhatsApp's appearance in the government's crosshairs may also be aimed at helping a local competitor -- Tencent's WeChat. Unlike WhatsApp, WeChat is unencrypted and thus far easier to monitor."The point of these attacks is to coerce the Chinese audience into using more open systems such as WeChat," Kobeissi said. This week's disruption suggests the risk of a full-fledged ban is rising. "A complete block is just a natural progression," said Smith.

A Deep Data Dive into China's Judicial SystemTargeted News ServiceApril 26, 2017 Wednesday 9:30 PM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 790 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyThe Columbia Law School issued the following news release:With support from the Parker School Global Innovation Awards, Ben Liebman and a team of students have constructed an online database of more than 1 million public documents.Lawsuits by individuals seeking assistance from the police to block forced takings of property. Letters from Chinese courts to other government agencies to refer suspected criminal conduct. Documents reducing the sentences of incarcerated individuals. Hundreds of thousands of routine civil cases.These are some of the Chinese court decisions examined in an ongoing research project led by Columbia Law School Professor Benjamin L. Liebman that offers an unprecedented look into the country's rapidly changing judicial system. Over the past 18 months, Liebman--a renowned scholar of Chinese law--and a team of students from Columbia Law School and the Columbia Department of Computer Science have constructed a database of more than 1 million public documents posted online by courts in Henan, a central Chinese province that is home to nearly 100 million people. Now, as a recipient of the Parker School of Foreign and Comparative Law Global Innovation Award, which supports innovative research and teaching on foreign, international, or transnational legal issues, Liebman will be able to expand his team's inquiry to millions of additional opinions.Liebman's project takes advantage of recent efforts by the Chinese government and judiciary to make judicial opinions available online. The project, which is being conducted together with postdoctoral fellow Alice Z. Wang '16, Professor Rachel Stern of the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law, and Professor Margaret Roberts of the University of California, San Diego. The germ of the idea came about during an informal conversation between Liebman and Wang when she was a second-year student at the Law School. The full research team (pictured above, left to right) includes: Michael Jia '19; Tiffany Young '19; Ying Wang '20 CC; Alice Wang '16; Zicheng Xu '18 SEAS; Chuan Tian '18 SEAS; and Yingting Fu '19 (not pictured)."What happens in China matters to the world," said Liebman, the Robert L. Lieff Professor of Law and director of the Law School's Center for Chinese Legal Studies. "The world has long been focused on the question of whether Chinese courts are able to deliver justice. So this is important to policymakers in Washington; it's important to business people; and it's important to people in China."Although scholars in China are also studying the online court decisions, Liebman's project is unique. The project examines not just cases made public, but also what is and what is not made public. Unlike other attempts to use the large volume of data now being made public by China's courts, the Henan Database project will combine analysis of large amounts of data with on-the-ground qualitative research. The project also brings together scholars from political science, law, and computational social science to use computational tools to study Chinese court judgments. For example, an initial forthcoming paper uses a computer science method known as "topic modeling" to analyze more than 30,000 administrative decisions--lawsuits against the government. In the technique, unsupervised machine learning is used to identify patterns of text that are likely to appear together. Liebman said that the technique is already paying dividends. "Our topic model identifies trends in administrative litigation that in the past were largely below the surface or unobserved," he explained. "The topic model also excels at generating future questions for on-the-ground research.""The use of computational tools to study large volumes of court opinions is novel everywhere," Liebman continued. "Our hope is that the upsides from this project won't just be for those studying China, but also will move forward the field of computational tools to study court opinions."The real value of the database is its sheer size, although there are gaps--not all courts put everything online, an issue Liebman called the "missingness" problem. Still, "there's no limit to the academic questions you could ask," he said.In addition to Wang--who majored in electrical engineering as an undergraduate and worked as a coder putting U.S. court documents online before starting at the Law School--Liebman has benefitted from the contributions of several other students who are fluent in Chinese and have strong computer science skills.That he has been able to easily find such smart and skilled students is "a real testament to the strength of the Columbia Law School student body," he said.Copyright Targeted News Services07M-Tagaruma-5846888 07M-TagarumaLoad-Date: April 27, 2017End of Document

US: CHINA RIGHTS ABUSE OVERVIEW AHEAD OF XI-TRUMP SUMMITStates News ServiceApril 4, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 517 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:China's human rights environment continues to deteriorate as Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump prepare to meet at a summit on April 6-7, 2017, at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, Human Rights Watch said today."Torture, disappearances, imprisoning peaceful advocates, destroying religious communities, internet censorship President Xi has plenty to answer for on these subjects," said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. "But will he be asked and asked to change course?"The Chinese government aggressively stepped up its campaign against civil society activists and online speech in the past year. Many peaceful critics of the government remained locked away, including Nobel Peace Laureate Liu Xiaobo and Uighur economist Ilham Tohti. Eight of the human rights lawyers and supporters among the 300 detained during a nationwide raid in July 2015 are still facing trial, while another six have been sentenced; the legal proceedings have fallen far short of international standards.In 2017, President Xi has shown no sign of letting up on his sweeping signature anti-corruption campaign, which is carried out in part through the Chinese Communist Party's own internal disciplinary system, known as shuanggui. This system of arbitrary detention, which has no basis in Chinese law, subjects Party members suspected of violating party rules or engaging in corruption to prolonged sleep deprivation, forced stress positions, deprivation of water and food, and in some cases severe beatings. Chinese authorities have also continued to demolish Larung Gar, a major Tibetan Buddhist institution, expelling monks and nuns, and subjecting them to political re-education, exceptional restrictions on their liberty, and degrading treatment.As one of the many recent steps by Chinese authorities to impose near-total total control of access to information, the government of Chongqing, a city of about 50 million in southwest China, in March made public an unprecedented regulation that bans unauthorized use of internet circumvention tools which allow "netizens" to get around China's "Great Firewall in the city.Also in March, Chinese courts sentenced three activists to sentences ranging from three to four-and-a-half years for supporting democracy in Hong Kong and commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen massacre. And a day after Beijing installed a loyalist in Hong Kong's top governmental position, Hong Kong police charged leaders of the 2014 pro-democracy Umbrella Movement with the crime of "public nuisance."In recent years, Chinese authorities have also detained citizens of other countries inside and outside China such as Taiwanese activist Lee Ming-cheh, Swedish bookseller Gui Minhai, and American businesspeople Sandy Phan-Gillis and James Wang and denying their embassies access."No doubt President Xi will offer soothing words about China's role in the world," Richardson said.

She participated in a similar workshop in Wuhan in April, and this time, not as a participant but as a presenter.As the chief of external relations and media officer for the Chinese Academy of Sciences' affiliated Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Lin now works closely with scientific institutions throughout China and from this position has seen significant changes in how scientists promote their work."I used to have to run after scientists and 'beg' them to talk about their work," she said. More recently, though, scientists are actively reaching out to her when they publish new research findings and are far more willing to follow up with reporters seeking to interview them. "I am really proud of these changes," said Lin.The transformation coincides with the Chinese government's move to increase investment in its science and technology enterprise with an eye toward expanding innovation and, in turn, growing the nation's economy. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, the country's top economic official, said as much in delivering an ambitious draft economic development plan to the National People's Congress in 2016.The plan called for increasing science spending by 9.1%, a level equal to a $41 billion boost over five years, and pledged to reduce bureaucratic barriers for scientists. The effort has led many scientists to look beyond their institutional affiliations and more eagerly seek to publicize their work throughout the scientific community and beyond China's borders.In China, there is a growing public demand for science news and information on a range of topics centered on everyday life, such as air quality, climate change, infectious diseases and vaccination. The heightened interest comes as scientific institutions in the United States face steep spending reduction proposals and as the news industry throughout the Western world continues to adjust to the digital world, said Brian Lin, EurekAlert!'s director of content strategy."There has been and will continue to be significant investment in scientific research in China," said Lin of EurekAlert!. He added that such progress will prompt more Chinese media officers to look for new ways "to share their results with the world."Since 2015, EurkAlert! has worked with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and offered workshops in cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Kunming. The April workshops held in Wuhan, Hefei and Xi'an represented EurkAlert!'s first foray into central China where science and technology is a growing economic focus.EurekAlert! will continue to hold workshops and training sessions for media professionals in China to help them enhance their communications skills, hone their ability to promote science by offering participants the "tools and confidence needed to help their scientists communicate openly the value and challenges of science," added Lin of EurekAlert!.Joining Lin Zheng as a speaker at the EurekAlert! workshops in April were two other media officers from affiliated institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences."We get to understand how the media works," said Lin Zheng, who highlighted the career benefits of participating in such professional development workshops. "I realize my job is to connect journalists with scientists and make sure there are smooth communications between the two sides."Lin of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics said her participation in the workshops both as a speaker and earlier as a participant has already delivered tangible results. A recent study published in the Advances in Atmospheric Sciences, an Institute of Atmospheric Physics journal, gained noteworthy media coverage from over 100 media outlets worldwide.She is nonetheless mindful that her success is something that remains out of reach for many media officers in China. Science communication is still evolving in China and it will take time before it resembles how scientific communities in other countries highlight the value of science, she noted.As the public in China reaches for more information about scientific advances and study findings, China's media and scientific community has been urging the government to increase its spending on efforts to more widely promote science."There is great potential for quality science news - and hopefully by extension, evidence-based, scientific thinking - to become a part of the public debate on major policy issues," said Lin of EurekAlert!.[Category: Science]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-5900500 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: June 21, 2017End of Document

CRU's Beijing analysts conducted a market survey, speaking with industry associations, processing facilities, and secondary plants in China so that we can understand the impact these restrictions will have on the copper and aluminium markets.     (Logo:http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/536199/CRU_Logo.jpg)Our analysis suggests that the policy will have far reaching implications for the copper market and cause the off-shoring of some Chinese scrap processing. The impact on the aluminium market will be small but the policy will hasten the current trend of increasing domestic scrap generation and it will strengthen the current bullish sentiment in the Chinese aluminium industry.Chinese government moves to limit scrap imports The latest news out of China suggests that the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association (CMRA) received a document the central government (including the Ministry of Environmental Protection) on July 25. This document gives notice that domestic scrap processing companies must stop importing the majority of Category 7 scrap from late 2018; namely scrap cables, scrap motors and scrap hardware (HS code: copper 7404,000.10, aluminum7602,0000.10).

How the World Is Taking on Silicon ValleyInsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.May 11, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 Distributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWSLength: 1972 wordsByline: Connor D. Wolf, InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.BodyMay 11--Silicon Valley has been at the forefront of innovative tech, but regions around the world are hoping to emulate and surpass it as an entrepreneurial superpower.The San Francisco Bay Area is home to some of the most successful tech companies in the world. It's also the starting point of countless startups and innovative ideas. The valley has exemplified what it means to be a successful tech center, and now regions around the globe want their own shot at the top."We can name New York, London,  Los Angeles, Tel Aviv, Beijing, Bangalore, Berlin, London, Singapore as top startup cities besides Silicon Valley," Mustafa Ergen, a professor at Koç University in Istanbul, Turkey, told InsideSources. "Seoul, Barcelona, Dubai, Istanbul, Rio, Dublin are few more to cite as thriving."Silicon Valley and other successful tech hubs have similar characteristics that have helped them thrive. They all have an entrepreneurial culture, investors, and the right infrastructure. The Valley has been successful because it mixes a very entrepreneurial culture with eager investors."Today, most of the developed and developing countries are active to promote the entrepreneurship," Ergen, who teaches entrepreneurship and technology management, said. "We are in the entrepreneurial economy and past information economy that succeeded industrial economy. New era requires entrepreneurial mindset, execution capability, and venture capital."Education and training is also another critical component behind successful tech centers. A tech center needs people with advanced computing and engineering skills. Silicon Valley has used foreign work programs to fill its skill gap, but regions around the globe are structuring their education system around those sought after skills."Today, to foster the entrepreneurial mindset, the education system is being converted and an entrepreneurial university system is being designed," Ergen said. "Still, Silicon Valley universities are spearheading and the U.K. is following. Governments are creating great incentives, and local procurement power is on the table for startups to foster."Ergen has seen firsthand how governments have promoted startup communities. The Turkish government, for instance, funded a mobile base station to provide 4G wireless networks in local regions. Sometimes tech centers compensate in areas they're lacking through government initiatives."In China, the way the government works is, the government does whatever it wants," University of Southern California Prof. Kyle Mayer told InsideSources. "They're not bogged down by compromise, and agreements, and those sort of things. They can pretty much put whatever policy they want in place."Mayer adds that the government has been able to invest in projects and establish business friendly regions. China has been successful in this regard because they started laying the groundwork decades ago. Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park in Shanghai was specifically developed to be a leading tech hub."A lot of people around the globe are looking at Silicon Valley and trying to emulate many of the lessons behind why Silicon Valley grew," Mayer, who teaches business management at the USC Marshall School of Business, said. "The one that clearly has the most traction, in many ways, is what China is doing in Shanghai."The Chinese government has built up public investments to make up for a lack of venture capital. It also adopted reforms to make the region more attractive to businesses. The government has worked to build tech hubs in other cities like Beijing and Shenzhen. China is in a very strong position but still faces some problems."It's harder for them to build but they can still provide money, at least through government-controlled aspects," Mayer said. "Of course, China has the added challenge of the intellectual property regime. Here you have patents, trade secrets, you have various ways to protect what you do. In China, that's much harder because they don't really respect intellectual property as much."India has successfully positioned itself as having some of the best internationally known tech hubs. The country has designated several regions just for tech development. The regions have adequate infrastructure and available talent to make them competitive. Furthermore, the talent also tends to be cheaper."Clearly, India is trying to do a lot of things also," Mayer said. "Bangalore particularly, but also other places as well. And they're doing the same thing in trying to attract tech companies."Electronic City was established as a tech hub in Bengaluru, India. It was founded following efforts by the government to liberalize the economy is the early 1990s.  HITEC City in Hyderabad, India, has been a leader in fields like information technology, engineering, health informatics, and bioinformatics."There's a lot of tech-based labor that is there," Mayer said. "It's not just having people who are engineers, it's having the right kind of engineers, and having some star engineers instead of just having good engineers. India has made its mark in the IT community in having cheap and capable engineers."India has several leading tech centers spread out across the country. Mayer adds the government is also working to ensure its universities are providing needed skills. Nevertheless, Silicon Valley is likely safe for now despite all the successful and eager tech centers around the world."I don't think any other region would compete with the Silicon Valley in the near future," Ergen said. "It is all about culture, subjectivity, relationships, talent, venture financial power, and acquisition culture, etc. This creates an engine that updates itself with time."Foreign tech centers have found ways to successfully compete with the Valley. Some regions have started to specialize in more specific aspects of tech. Specialization allows competitors to corner off a part of the overall market when competition is fierce."We can pretty much consider how they should leverage the Valley," Ergen said. "For instance, India is trying to become the software workforce of the Silicon Valley startups to let them scale; Israel is leveraging Silicon Valley for its startups' exit strategy; China is their manufacturing base and trying to attract the venture capital to replicate the successful business plans with China's humongous customer base. Ireland was successful to become the startup hub to enter E.U. market as the Celtic Tiger."Japan is unique in that it has a tradition of innovation but little in the way of a startup community. The country is more focused on a large-firm economy. Tokyo, for instance, has been a leader in robotics and telecommunications. The country has been working to build up a more robust startup community."I suppose we should mention Tokyo because there's a lot of tech," Mayer said. "We shouldn't discount Tokyo. It's more established, and Japan is obviously not growing as fast as an economy as China and India are, but clearly, they have a lot of established tech in Japan."The Japanese government has designated a few regions as tech hubs. Tsukuba Science City was established as a science park as early at the 1960s. Yokosuka Research Park in Yokosuka City, Japan, is home to many wireless and mobile related research and development centers.Silicon Valley should still be weary of being overthrown as the tech leader. While such an upset is unlikely anytime soon, the world is becoming increasingly competitive. Federal policies might even be hurting the Valley by keeping out needed skills with work visa restrictions."One of the other issues that is a potential problem for Silicon Valley, which is not a problem for Hyderabad or Tel Aviv or any other foreign city, is the president trying to reduce the number of H-1B visas," Dr. Gad Selig, dean of industry outreach at the University of Bridgeport, told InsideSources. "But I don't think Silicon Valley is going anywhere anytime soon."Israel tends to pass under the radar for many, but its contributions as a tech innovator are undeniable. Silicon Wadi is a large area along the coastal plains with a high concentration of high-tech industries."One that comes to mind is Tel Aviv, Israel," Selig said. "You probably wouldn't think that way, but the answer is they have more per capita entrepreneurs, and business loans have probably been, I think, probably on par, relative to the population, with Silicon Valley."Intel, IBM, Google, Facebook, Hewlett-Packard, Cisco Systems, Oracle Corporation, Microsoft, and many other leading tech companies have offices in the region. Selig adds Silicon Wadi has been leading in areas like security and media space."Europe hasn't been great in this regard," Mayer said. "Europe is just a tough nut to crack because you have in so many countries, Germany, France, to a degree Italy, they're such strong pro-employment countries, union based countries, that you have to be careful how much work you put in there because you can't pull a lot of that stuff back out."European countries have tried for decades to gain a foothold in emerging technologies. They have plenty of successes when it comes to tech but have lagged behind other regions around the world. France, Germany, and the United Kingdom have established some of the more successful tech hubs in Europe."If I had to bet on a city in Europe emerging over the next 10 or 20 years, I would actually be tempted to say Berlin," Mayer said. "They have some solid universities, they have cheaper real estate than some of the other places in Europe where people can still go, and there's a lot of young people moving to Berlin."Silicon Valley also faces plenty of competition domestically. Silicon Beach within the Los Angeles metropolitan area has been able to attract some of the biggest tech companies. Google, YouTube, BuzzFeed, Facebook, Salesforce, AOL, and Electronic Arts all have offices there. The area is known for its electronic entertainment industry."On the domestic side, L.A. is clearly trying to do something with this," Mayer said. "They're trying to build more of a startup community here. A lot of it geared towards entertainment to a degree, but not all of it. L.A. is very much working to turn the downtown and west side into much more of a hub for innovations."Domestic based tech centers have been established throughout the country. Redmond, Washington, is known for having a thriving tech scene and is even where Microsoft is headquartered. New York City is also working to become the next major tech center."New York City is truly trying to create a technology super city as well," Selig said. "They have incentives, they have incubators, they have all sorts of things."New York City is now on the verge of an educational experiment aimed at providing needed skills and a tech research center. Cornell University is planning to open up a tech-focused campus in the city later this year. The idea is to mix faculty who are involved with technology and entrepreneurship strategy with management professionals."The really interesting one is going on in New York," Mayer said. "You have Cornell which is building a tech campus on that island there in the middle of New York which is going to house both engineering, science, and business all together under one roof."The Kauffman Foundation released a report last year which found Austin, Texas, ranked number one in metro areas with the most startup activity. Silicon Prairie near Dallas has a high concentration of semiconductor manufacturing, telecommunications, and other tech companies. Texas also has a thriving commercial space industry with companies like SpaceX.Follow Connor on Twitter___ (c)2017 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

5 Questions with CEO of Boulder's Solid Power, RoccorColorado Daily: University of Colorado at BoulderJune 30, 2017 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 1Length: 831 wordsBodyDoug Campbell, CEO of Solid Power and Roccor (Courtesy Photo /)As the head of a successful startup, Longmont resident and entrepreneur Douglas Campbell has his dream job. Actually, he as two.Campbell is the CEO of not one, but two of the hottest businesses in the Boulder Valley, Louisville-based Solid Power and Longmont's Roccor.BizWest recently named Solid Power, a manufacturer of batteries for electric vehicles, as the third fastest-growing company in the area, by revenue increase. Aerospace firm Roccor was right behind on the list, as the fourth most rapidly expanding.We managed to get Campbell to carve out 30 minutes from his very busy schedule to sit down and discuss the challenges and rewards of running two companies - and why he won't be doing it forever:1.) What has growth been like at Solid Power and Roccor over the last year, and what's driving it?Last year, Solid Power was at the top of the list because we have 2,000 percent revenue growth. This year it was a more respectable 400 percent. We're moving into a new building around the block that is three times the size of this one, with new lab space. We'll probably double in size in terms of employees. We have 20 people now, we'll probably go to 40 in the next 24 months.That growth is being driven by investment. We are closing on a $15 million Series A round led by an automotive company and a battery cell manufacturer. And we have an agreement with a European original equipment manufacturer for a plan to have model introduction by 2025.AdvertisementAt Roccor, we grew revenue by 300 percent in roughly a year's time. In spring of 2016, we had 12 employees, and we just recently made our 36th or 37th hire. That was driven by a large contract we secured for a commercial satellite constellation.We are the solar array deployment system provider for an 800-satellite system. That was a big deal, it was a really large contract. We can't announce it yet, but the company just recently received its approval from the Federal Communications Commission for the constellation.Author's note: Industry news reports show that Richard Branson- and Qualcomm-backed startup OneWeb received FCC approval June 22 for a 720-satellite system to provide broadband internet service to the U.S.2.) How difficult is it to hire for two companies in this tight labor market?It's tough for Solid Power. It's substantially easier to hire for Roccor. There's a ton of aerospace talent here because the sector is well developed. With Solid Power, we compete directly with Silicon Valley and Boston. Those are the hotbeds of our world. It's hard to pull people out of there. We use a recruiter for every senior-level hire. We have yet to use a recruiter at Roccor.3.) Is the market for Solid Power's products being driven by governments or the private sector?All private. It's all this race for vehicle electrification. Europe and Asia are moving in a big way; they could care less what the U.S. government says. Even U.S. manufacturers - everyone in the industry recognizes it's not a matter of if, but when. And the 10,000 pound gorilla is China.In the U.S., electric vehicles are a fraction of a percent of the auto market. It's 12 to 15 percent in China. The Chinese government has said we are doing this, period. And of course it's not a democracy so when they say we're rolling in this direction, we're rolling in this direction. Europe is following suit.The whole diesel thing with Volkswagen is probably the best thing that could ever happen for electric vehicles because it kind of blew up this whole notion of clean diesel. U.S. manufacturers are being a bit smarter than they were in early 2000's and saying this is the way the industry is going, we need to move in this direction.4.) Do you have a favorite company? Or are they like your children - you love them both equally?I don't have a favorite. They're just so different. Running a venture-backed company (Solid Power) is different because you have a board of investors you have to answer to. Whereas at Roccor, it's much more like we're building this and we'll never have someone outside telling us what to do.Roccor has never taken investment; you can do that with aerospace. You can't do that with a battery company. The industry is too big and you have to make major investments in infrastructure. If I were to leave one, it would probably be Solid Power.5.) Do you have plans to leave Solid Power?I don't know. I have really good senior level talent, so it's worked so far. But my job at Solid Power has been 100 percent to fund raise. Now that we've secured this really large investment, that need kind of diminishes.I have been making noise internally about my concern about my own bandwidth limitations and I have started networking with folks with an angle toward future leadership. It has to be the right person. I don't just want any old douchebag in here running the place.Shay Castle: 303-473-1626, castles@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/shayshinecastleLoad-Date: July 1, 2017End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 25 of 326ChinaCache Receives CDN License from the Chinese Government  Page 28 of 326UK Government Should Urgently Consider New Review Process for Chinese Investment in Sensitive Sectors  Page 31 of 326Even in death, the Chinese government still censors activist Liu Xiaobo  Page 34 of 326Even in death, the Chinese government still censors activist Liu Xiaobo  Page 37 of 326CECC MARKS 28TH ANNIVERSARY OF TIANANMEN MASSACRE WITH BIPARTISAN CONGRESSIONAL LETTER TO CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPING  Page 40 of 326KEY MOMENTS FROM CECC HEARING "GAGGING THE LAWYERS: CHINA'S CRACKDOWN ON HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYERS AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS"  Page 42 of 326Chinese Government Tighten Grip with New Media Regulation  Page 44 of 326Chinese Government Threatens Foreign Media Over Live-Streamed Interview  Page 46 of 326MINISTRY OF COMMERCE REPRESENTING CHINESE GOVERNMENT SIGNED COOPERATION AGREEMENT WITH 14 INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS WHO ATTEND THE BELT AND ROAD FORUM FOR INT....  Page 49 of 326ON SENATE FLOOR, RUBIO CONDEMNS CHINA'S OPPRESSION OF HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST, LAWYER  Page  of Weibo Tumbles After Chinese Government Cracks Down On Social Media Sites  Page 52 of 326Apple to open data center in China with government ties  Page 54 of 326Apple to open data center in China with government ties  Page 56 of 326Apple to open data center in China with government ties  Page 58 of 326Committee of 100 Urges Focus on Mutual Interests in Trump-Xi Summit; C100 Survey Reveals Hopes and Concerns of American and Chinese People for U.S.-China Relati....  Page 60 of 326CypressFirst Comments On Latest Admissions In Third Cypress Semiconductor Disclosure; Executive Chairman Ray Bingham and Cypress Board Admit Bingham Discussed C....  Page 63 of 326Committee of 100 Releases 2017 U.S.-China Public Perceptions Survey; Survey finds that rising levels of distrust could undermine the U.S.-China relationship, Br....  Page 65 of 326REMARKS BY CHINESE AMBASSADOR TO GHANA H.E.
