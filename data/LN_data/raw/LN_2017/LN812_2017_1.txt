CHAIRS URGE PRESIDENT TO CHALLENGE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO ABIDE BY ITS INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTSStates News ServiceNovember 6, 2017 MondayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 1788 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON D.C. BodyThe following information was released by the Congressional-Executive Commission on China:Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Chris Smith, the Chair and Cochair of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) respectively, released today a letter sent to President Trump last week prior to his visit to China, urging him to articulate a "bold vision for advancing American interests...in the vitally important Indo-Pacific region" and encouraging the Administration to develop a "long-term strategy for challenging the Chinese government to abide by its international commitments, adhere to universal standards, and embrace the rule of law."The letter contains recommendations that can be used to frame discussions with Chinese leaders during the trip and after, including emphasizing issues of reciprocity, digital protectionism, Internet freedom, Hong Kong's autonomy, and the release of political and religious prisoners, such as Liu Xia, the widow of Nobel Prize Laureate Liu Xiaobo. The Chairs also urged an end to China's support for the Maduro regime in Venezuela.The text of the letter can be found here.October 31, 2017President Donald J. TrumpThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Ave., NWWashington, DC 20500Dear President Trump:As you prepare for your upcoming trip to East Asia and your meeting with Chinese Communist Party General Secretary and President Xi Jinping, we wish you a successful and productive visit. Your trip comes after the Chinese Communist Party's 19th National Congress where Party General Secretary Xi further consolidated power while articulating a bold vision for reinvigorating the Communist Party and asserting Chinese interests on the world stage. We urge you to articulate an equally bold vision for advancing American interests and universal values in the vitally important Indo-Pacific region.You have sought to build a strong personal relationship with President Xiin part, to increase cooperation to counter North Korean nuclear proliferationbut we encourage you also to develop a long-term strategy for challenging the Chinese government to abide by its international commitments, adhere to universal standards, and embrace the rule of law. Such a strategy is critical to advancing American geopolitical, security, economic, and human rights interests, and will further the Chinese people's desire for peace, freedom, and justice.As documented in the recent Annual Report of the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), the Chinese government and Communist Party this year continued efforts to silence dissent, criminalize activities of human rights lawyers, suppress civil society, control religious activity, and restrict the operations of Chinese and foreign media outlets, businesses, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The report also provides evidence that Chinese authorities arbitrarily detained and tortured political prisoners, forcibly repatriated North Korean refugees, engaged in mercantilist trade and industrial policies, and continued to implement coercive population control policiesall in violation of China's international obligations. A government that routinely ignores its international commitments is unlikely to be a reliable partner on key issuessuch as North Korea and tradethat will no doubt feature prominently on the agenda.We ask that you consider the following recommendations that can be used to frame your discussions with Chinese leaders and to develop policies that advance American geopolitical, security, economic, and human rights interests with respect to China:Make Reciprocity a Priority: As the top two economies in the world, the United States and China should continue to build trade and people-to-people partnerships that benefit both countries. However, this engagement also means ensuring that China plays fair. We urge your Administration to seek a comprehensive agreement that ensures reciprocal treatment for American institutions, businesses, and nationals operating in China, and also to coordinate with allies, businesses, and NGOs to develop a unified strategy to respond to China's unfair industrial policies, digital protectionism, and the PRC Law on the Management of Overseas NGOs' Activities. Also in the spirit of reciprocity, we must continue to press for unrestricted access to Tibetan autonomous areas and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region for U.S. citizens, journalists, NGOs, and diplomats in the same manner that Chinese citizens and government officials are able to travel freely in the United States.Respond to Digital Protectionism: We ask your Administration to consider seeking a highlevel trade agreement to address the Chinese government's growing digital protectionism, including commitments on the free flow of news and information and the non-discriminatory treatment of U.S. digital products. The Administration should also consider initiating a World Trade Organization dispute to challenge continued discrimination against U S. technology and media companies, and prepare targeted trade sanctions if the Chinese government continues to impose onerous requirements on them, including data storage in China and the disclosure of source code and encryption keys. The Administration should work with committees of jurisdiction in Congress to find ways to use the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to respond to unfair industrial policies that threaten national security, including by expanding its mandate to look at foreign investment in media and technology sectors.Promote a Free Internet: Because Internet freedom is an issue that advances both American economic and human rights interests, the Administration should develop a comprehensive multi-year strategy that partners with civil society, media outlets, businesses, key technology industries, religious leaders, and human rights defenders to (1) counter efforts by the Chinese government to promote "Internet sovereignty," (2) develop effective technologies that provide or enhance access to the Internet, and (3) conduct research on ways to counter threats to Internet freedom, including the Chinese government's intent to block access to unlicensed virtual private networks (VPNs) starting in early 2018.Stop Repatriation Until Chinese Legal System Upholds International Standards: As Chinese government officials continue seeking to repatriate Chinese citizens overseas in connection with the government's anticorruption investigations, the Administration has an opportunity to press for a comprehensive law enforcement agreement with China to establish diplomatic assurances for guaranteeing verifiable due process protections and an end to torture in detention and other forms of arbitrary detention, including "residential surveillance at a designated location. The U.S. Government should not agree to any additional repatriations until the Chinese government can demonstrate that they are meeting the standards set forth in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and related international human rights instruments.Make Hong Kong's Autonomy a Vital U.S. Interest: We also ask you to impress upon President Xi that Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms are a critical U.S. interest. The abductions and disappearance of Hong Kong residents by Chinese security officials, as well as efforts to silence pro-democracy voices and Umbrella Movement leaders, are inimical to strong bilateral relations and violate China's obligations under the Sino-British Joint Declaration.Ensure American Nationals are Protected and Prioritize the Release of Political Prisoners: Chinese authorities have extrajudicially detained American nationals and the family members of U.S. citizens and residents, including human rights lawyers, pastors, members of disfavored religious groups, and businesspeople. We urge you to consider seeking revisions to the U.S. -China Consular Convention to clarify that Americans detained in China may meet with a lawyer of their choice, contact their families regularly, privately discuss the details of their case with U.S. Consular officials, and have U.S. Embassy officials attend all legal proceedings. We also ask that you work to secure the release of all Chinese political prisoners, including those whose family members are American citizens or persons lawfully present in the United States" such as Jiang Tianyong, Tang Jingling, Xia Lin, Ilham Tohti, John Cao, Gao Zhisheng, Guo Feixiong, and Deng Cuiping. Similarly, Tibetan filmmaker Dhondup Wangchen (alternate spelling: Dondrub Wangchen), whose wife and children live in the United States, completed his sentence in 2014, but still has not been permitted to leave China and reportedly lives under close surveillance by authorities. The CECC has a Political Prisoner Database (PPI)) that contains records of more than 1,400 political and religious prisoners known or believed to be currently detained or imprisoned.Seek the Release of Liu Xia: We remain deeply concerned about the safety and welfare of Liu Xia, the widow of the late writer and advocate of political reform Liu Xiaobo. After the announcement that her husband had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010, Chinese authorities confined her to her home and several undisclosed locations while never charging her with a crime. The government also refused Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia's wishes to allow Liu Xiaobo to travel abroad to receive medical treatment for late-stage liver cancer in June 2017. Her forced isolation, ongoing surveillance, and deprivation of the right to freedom of movement requires urgent, sustained and high-level diplomacy.Press for End to China's Support of Maduro Regime: Even though the regime of Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro has lost international legitimacy and engaged in a crackdown against pro-democracy activists that has claimed over 130 lives, China, along with Russia, continues to provide the regime with financial support. We therefore urge you to press the Chinese government to stop giving economic lifelines to the failing Maduro regime.While the Chinese government may not be the responsible global stakeholder envisioned earlier by many proponents of China's entry into the World Trade Organization 16 years ago, we must not forget that the desire for freedom, justice, and democratic openness are not alien to China or its people. These desires speak to universal principles whose eventual realization in China will further U.S. interests and lay the enduring foundation for a truly peaceful and prosperous future for the Chinese people and the American people. Thank you for your consideration of our requests.Sincerely,Senator Marco Rubio Representative Christopher H. SmithLoad-Date: November 12, 2017End of Document

We urge you to articulate an equally bold vision for advancing American interests and universal values in the vitally important Indo-Pacific region.You have sought to build a strong personal relationship with President Xi--in part, to increase cooperation to counter North Korean nuclear proliferation--but we encourage you also to develop a long-term strategy for challenging the Chinese government to abide by its international commitments, adhere to universal standards, and embrace the rule of law. Such a strategy is critical to advancing American geopolitical, security, economic, and human rights interests, and will further the Chinese people's desire for peace, freedom, and justice.As documented in the recent Annual Report of the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), the Chinese government and Communist Party this year continued efforts to silence dissent, criminalize activities of human rights lawyers, suppress civil society, control religious activity, and restrict the operations of Chinese and foreign media outlets, businesses, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The report also provides evidence that Chinese authorities arbitrarily detained and tortured political prisoners, forcibly repatriated North Korean refugees, engaged in mercantilist trade and industrial policies, and continued to implement coercive population control policies--all in violation of China's international obligations. A government that routinely ignores its international commitments is unlikely to be a reliable partner on key issues--such as North Korea and trade--that will no doubt feature prominently on the agenda.We ask that you consider the following recommendations that can be used to frame your discussions with Chinese leaders and to develop policies that advance American geopolitical, security, economic, and human rights interests with respect to China:Make Reciprocity a Priority: As the top two economies in the world, the United States and China should continue to build trade and people-to-people partnerships that benefit both countries. However, this engagement also means ensuring that China plays fair. We urge your Administration to seek a comprehensive agreement that ensures reciprocal treatment for American institutions, businesses, and nationals operating in China, and also to coordinate with allies, businesses, and NGOs to develop a unified strategy to respond to China's unfair industrial policies, digital protectionism, and the PRC Law on the Management of Overseas NGOs' Activities. Also in the spirit of reciprocity, we must continue to press for unrestricted access to Tibetan autonomous areas and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region for U.S. citizens, journalists, NGOs, and diplomats in the same manner that Chinese citizens and government officials are able to travel freely in the United States.Respond to Digital Protectionism: We ask your Administration to consider seeking a highlevel trade agreement to address the Chinese government's growing digital protectionism, including commitments on the free flow of news and information and the non-discriminatory treatment of U.S. digital products. The Administration should also consider initiating a World Trade Organization dispute to challenge continued discrimination against U S. technology and media companies, and prepare targeted trade sanctions if the Chinese government continues to impose onerous requirements on them, including data storage in China and the disclosure of source code and encryption keys. The Administration should work with committees of jurisdiction in Congress to find ways to use the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to respond to unfair industrial policies that threaten national security, including by expanding its mandate to look at foreign investment in media and technology sectors.Promote a Free Internet: Because Internet freedom is an issue that advances both American economic and human rights interests, the Administration should develop a comprehensive multi-year strategy that partners with civil society, media outlets, businesses, key technology industries, religious leaders, and human rights defenders to (1) counter efforts by the Chinese government to promote "Internet sovereignty," (2) develop effective technologies that provide or enhance access to the Internet, and (3) conduct research on ways to counter threats to Internet freedom, including the Chinese government's intent to block access to unlicensed virtual private networks (VPNs) starting in early 2018.Stop Repatriation Until Chinese Legal System Upholds International Standards: As Chinese government officials continue seeking to repatriate Chinese citizens overseas in connection with the government's anticorruption investigations, the Administration has an opportunity to press for a comprehensive law enforcement agreement with China to establish diplomatic assurances for guaranteeing verifiable due process protections and an end to torture in detention and other forms of arbitrary detention, including "residential surveillance at a designated location. " The U.S. Government should not agree to any additional repatriations until the Chinese government can demonstrate that they are meeting the standards set forth in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and related international human rights instruments.Make Hong Kong's Autonomy a Vital U.S. Interest: We also ask you to impress upon President Xi that Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms are a critical U.S. interest. The abductions and disappearance of Hong Kong residents by Chinese security officials, as well as efforts to silence pro-democracy voices and Umbrella Movement leaders, are inimical to strong bilateral relations and violate China's obligations under the Sino-British Joint Declaration.Ensure American Nationals are Protected and Prioritize the Release of Political Prisoners: Chinese authorities have extrajudicially detained American nationals and the family members of U.S. citizens and residents, including human rights lawyers, pastors, members of disfavored religious groups, and businesspeople. We urge you to consider seeking revisions to the U.S. -China Consular Convention to clarify that Americans detained in China may meet with a lawyer of their choice, contact their families regularly, privately discuss the details of their case with U.S. Consular officials, and have U.S. Embassy officials attend all legal proceedings. We also ask that you work to secure the release of all Chinese political prisoners, including those whose family members are American citizens or persons lawfully present in the United States  such as Jiang Tianyong, Tang Jingling, Xia Lin, Ilham Tohti, John Cao, Gao Zhisheng, Guo Feixiong, and Deng Cuiping. Similarly, Tibetan filmmaker Dhondup Wangchen (alternate spelling: Dondrub Wangchen), whose wife and children live in the United States, completed his sentence in 2014, but still has not been permitted to leave China and reportedly lives under close surveillance by authorities. The CECC has a Political Prisoner Database (PPI)) that contains records of more than 1,400 political and religious prisoners known or believed to be currently detained or imprisoned.Seek the Release of Liu Xia: We remain deeply concerned about the safety and welfare of Liu Xia, the widow of the late writer and advocate of political reform Liu Xiaobo. After the announcement that her husband had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010, Chinese authorities confined her to her home and several undisclosed locations while never charging her with a crime. The government also refused Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia's wishes to allow Liu Xiaobo to travel abroad to receive medical treatment for late-stage liver cancer in June 2017. Her forced isolation, ongoing surveillance, and deprivation of the right to freedom of movement requires urgent, sustained and high-level diplomacy.Press for End to China's Support of Maduro Regime: Even though the regime of Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro has lost international legitimacy and engaged in a crackdown against pro-democracy activists that has claimed over 130 lives, China, along with Russia, continues to provide the regime with financial support. We therefore urge you to press the Chinese government to stop giving economic lifelines to the failing Maduro regime.While the Chinese government may not be the responsible global stakeholder envisioned earlier by many proponents of China's entry into the World Trade Organization 16 years ago, we must not forget that the desire for freedom, justice, and democratic openness are not alien to China or its people. These desires speak to universal principles whose eventual realization in China will further U.S. interests and lay the enduring foundation for a truly peaceful and prosperous future for the Chinese people and the American people. Thank you for your consideration of our requests.Sincerely,This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 7, 2017.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6065992 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 8, 2017End of Document

The Chinese Government's Announces its Ambitious Inflight Internet Plan; Shortly before the opening of the 19th CPC National Congress, the Chinese government announced an ambitious Five-year Plan for the Inflight Internet to be completed by 2022. Guided by this highly efficient Plan with foreseeable outcomes, the Chinese government aims to deliver inflight internet service to 500 million passengers by 2022, positioning itself on a par with the United States.PR NewswireOctober 31, 2017 Tuesday 9:07 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1202 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Oct. 31, 2017 BodyHuangpu District (Guangzhou Development District) Government of Guangzhou City and BlueFocus IFEC Technology Co., Ltd officially announced in Guangzhou on 9th October that a 'The Belt and Road' Inflight Internet Fund with a capital injection of ten billion yuan will be established, together with China's first Inflight Internet Centre for Mass Entrepreneurship and Innovation, and a trillion-yuan Inflight Internet Industrial Park. This shows that the ambitious inflight internet plan has been included on the Chinese government's agenda. With this Plan to be implemented, China is poised to become another major competitor in inflight internet industry, together with the United States.At present, with the closing of the 19th CPC National Congress, the main contradiction of Chinese society has been transformed into a contradiction between people's growing needs for a better life and unbalanced and inadequate development of society. Based on this philosophy, the Chinese government is determined to work hard to benefit 500 million passengers with non-stop online surfing experience on their inflight journeys within the next five years.Chinese society has undergone enormous changes since its Reform and Opening-up roughly 40 years ago. The change is particularly conspicuous in the internet industry, as is seen in its 751 million internet users - 1/5 of the world's total. Chinese internet penetration rate has reached 54.3%, a 4.6 percentage points higher than the global average. China has 700 million mobile Internet users with an annual growth rate of 5.9%, and an overwhelming 95.1% of its internet users are on their mobile devices. Global finance and technology has entered the China-US double-wheel driven era called 'G2', which has seen a spate of outstanding internet firms such as Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent (commonly referred to as 'BAT'). Unlike the popularity of the internet, the development of China's inflight internet began relatively late, thus somewhat lagging behind the United States. The Chinese government recognises this situation and has started to actively put into practice this newly-formed Plan.There are currently about 55 airlines around the world that provide inflight internet services. Of the 4000+ Wi-Fi-equipped aircrafts, more than 80% are now serving in North American airlines. As of 2016, more than 78% of flights provide cabin Wi-Fi service in the United States, followed by Europe and the Middle East, with Asian airlines still falling behind. The United Airlines fleet has a Wi-Fi penetration rate of 100%, followed by Delta Air Lines (95%), Emirates (87%), JAL (77%) and Lufthansa (70%). According to the research finding of OnAir, a Swiss research company, 75% of airlines plan to invest in inflight Wi-Fi services for their passengers, and 70% of the airlines are now investing in inflight internet service training for their employees. Since the first Air China aircraft with inflight Wi-Fi made her maiden journey, China now has only 140 Wi-Fi-enabled aircrafts in operation, representing only 6% of the total size of China's civil aviation fleet, which means each year nearly 500 million passengers are not connected to the most basic internet services during their flight. The Chinese government has taken note of this strong demand and realised that when the core technology is withheld by the Western countries, its information and data are exposed to substantial security risks.The focus of the Chinese government's ambitious initiative lies in the satellite layout. From 2016, Guangdong Provincial Government has begun strategic planning in the upstream of the inflight internet industry chain. On 23rd July 2016, Shenzhen Municipal Government started the construction of China's first global high-throughput broadband satellite communications system, who plans to launch the first high-throughput broadband satellite by the end of 2018 and starts satellite communications operations services in 2019. In April 2017, China's first high-throughput communications satellite 'Zhongxing-16' was successfully launched, with a total communication capacity of more than 20G. This signifies that broadband applications of independent communications satellite has been realised through China's independent research and development technology and China has broken loose from foreign monopoly.At the operational level, as the core area of China's scientific and technological innovation hub, Huangpu District (Guangzhou Development District) is endlessly seeking new development momentum in its efforts to play a leading role in the sector through the accumulation and radiation of innovative resources. Driven by the Belt and Road Initiative (B&R), Huangpu District (Guangzhou Development District) has established the 'The Belt and Road' Inflight Internet Fund, China's first Inflight Internet Centre for Mass Entrepreneurship and Innovation, and an Inflight Internet Industrial Park in a bid to promote Chinese products and content with independent intellectual property rights to the airlines along the B&R countries, while supporting an array of outstanding enterprises with independent intellectual property rights.With the deepening of China's all-round diplomacy, great power diplomacy with Chinese characteristics has borne the features of being comprehensive, multi-level and three-dimensional, creating a favourable external environment for China's development and the implementation of the B&R Initiative. Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) has signed bilateral air transport agreements with more than 60 countries along the B&R, among which more than 40 countries agreed on direct flights, shuttling a total of around 4200 flights per week. China's domestic airlines such as Air China, China Southern Airlines, China Eastern Airlines and Hainan Airlines have all increased aviation capacity in nations along the B&R, with over 200 new air routes being newly launched. In 2017, international routes along the B&R remains the focus for many airlines. Since 29th October 2017, China's domestic airlines plan to launch 95 new international routes along the B&R, mainly in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia and the South Pacific countries. Meanwhile, foreign airlines are set to launch 18 new international routes along the B&R, principally in the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Kazakhstan and other countries.According to the Plan, Huangpu District (Guangzhou Development District) will provide support in policy, land, capital and other areas. BlueFocus IFEC will bring together leading companies as stakeholders in the whole industry chain to maximize industrial value through commercial operation, as well as to foster a hundred-billion-yuan industrial cluster in five years. Despite the fact that there evidently are difficulties and challenges due to temporal and technical barriers, this ambitious plan can be seen as an important booster and driver for the current development of China's inflight internet.View original content with multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-chinese-governments-announces-its-ambitious-inflight-internet-plan-300546285.htmlSOURCE Bluefocus IFECCONTACT: Queenie Tian, +86-135-0129-3353, muqing.tian@bluefocus.comLoad-Date: November 1, 2017End of Document

Information Technology and Innovation Foundation Issues Statement on ChinaTargeted News ServiceOctober 10, 2017 Tuesday 5:46 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1476 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Information Technology and Innovation Foundation issued the following statement:The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a leading science and tech policy think tank, today applauded the Trump administration for pushing back against China's systematic pattern of "innovation mercantilism" in strategically important industries. ITIF Vice President for Global Innovation Policy Stephen Ezell provided the following oral testimony to an interagency committee conducting a Section 301 investigation into China's policies and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation:"I'm Stephen Ezell, VP Global Innovation Policy at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, and I thank you for the invitation to testify this morning. We commend the Trump administration for undertaking a serious investigation of China's economic, trade, and IP practices and the impact these have on U.S. industries, enterprises, and jobs."As ITIF has written in numerous reports and testimony, for too long, China has systematically flouted the spirit, and often the letter, of its WTO commitments. More than 15 years after it joined the WTO, China remains the world's leading purveyor of "innovation mercantilism," fielding every mercantilist policy imaginable--from forced transfer of technology or intellectual property as a condition of market access to IP theft, production and export subsidies, and currency and standards manipulation--in sectors ranging from information and communications technology to solar panels, steel, and automobiles. We need to be quite clear that China's objective is to become competitive across virtually all advanced-technology industries--and that the techniques it is using to become so pose a direct, even existential threat to America's high-tech industries along with foreign counterparts. For instance, its Made in China 2025 Strategy is a $300 billion plan for China to become a global leader in 10 strategic industries, including semiconductors, biotechnology, aircraft, and robots."One clear manifestation of this is China's National Integrated Circuit Strategy, which calls for investing $150 billion over the next decade to create a completely closed-loop semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem in China. The strategy unabashedly calls for China to reduce imports of U.S. semiconductors by half in 10 years and to eliminate them entirely within 20 years, with 70 percent of the semiconductor chips used by companies operating in China to be domestically produced by 2025 and China becoming the world's leading semiconductor manufacturer by 2030. Put simply, in advanced-technology industries like this, China fundamentally rejects the notion of comparative advantage and instead seeks absolute advantage, wanting to limit imports and replace them with domestic production while still enjoying unfettered access to global markets. Assimilating foreign technology is a key component of China's efforts to become a global innovation leader. In general, China's technology acquisition strategy is to develop the technology indigenously if possible; if not, then to try to induce technology or IP transfer, often as part of joint ventures; or, failing that, then to resort to mergers and acquisitions or even outright IP theft."Chinese technology or IP transfer requirements as a condition of market access continue unabated and have affected scores of enterprises in industries as diverse as aviation, automotives, renewable energy, and high-speed rail. While China's federal government often denies such practices exist by arguing they're not codified in writing, government action in China can and does occur by informal "administrative guidance," and many provincial governments retain such policies. For instance, global auto brands have long been allowed to manufacture cars domestically in China only through joint ventures with local partners. More recently, China made General Motor's access to subsidies for electric-vehicle purchases contingent on the company handing over the IP behind its electric hybrid car, the Chevrolet Volt. Ford was forced to do the same."A related issue is that China's Technology Import and Export Regulations (or TIER) compel exchange on unbalanced licensing terms by: (i) mandating Chinese ownership of any technology improvements for imported technology, and (ii) imposing other non-market terms in licensing and technology contracts. Effectively, this means that foreign licensors, including U.S. firms, cannot negotiate to own any improvements or share them with Chinese licensees, even if both licensing parties desire for the improvements to be shared or owned by the foreign licensors. Another discriminatory aspect of TIER is that it obligates a foreign licensor into China to offer an indemnity against third-party infringement to the Chinese licensee. This obligation only attaches to a foreigner licensing technologies into China; the Chinese licensor has no such obligation. It should be noted that a submission made by the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products (CCCME) contended that China's TIER accords with the UN International Code of Conduct on the Transfer and that TIER's relevant Articles 24 and 27 are "neutral in nature." Yet they are not, for CCCME omits that the articles only apply in a "technology import contract." The Administration should seek adjustment of these policies, or else enact a regime whereby if Chinese entities seek licenses in the United States they must license on the same terms foreigners are required to license into China."China is the leading instigator of IP theft and the cost to the U.S. economy in terms of counterfeit goods, pirated software, and theft of trade secrets may have grown as high as $600 billion. But a growing concern is "secure and controllable" measures mandated by China's National Security Law and Cybersecurity Law, which may induce or force the localization of design or manufacturing processes of ICT products such as semiconductors or servers. Under the pretext of attempting to ensure technology products are secure, some of these measures require the disclosure of sensitive information and/or that the IP rights be Chinese-owned. Moreover, Chinese draft technical measures require American innovators of microprocessor technology enterprise servers and operating systems to disclose design secrets. Also problematic are China's Multi-level Protection Scheme (MLPS) and draft regulations published in July 2017 for Critical Industries Information Protection (CIIP), which effectively induce the localization of IP in China as a condition of market access by mandating adoption of indigenous IP."Elsewhere, China's Anti-monopoly Law (AML) has been designed to treat legitimately acquired IP rights as a monopolistic abuse, even when firms charge market-based IP licensing fees to Chinese companies. Moreover, when China's State Administration for Industry and Commerce finalized its antitrust-related enforcement regulations in 2015, its interpretation of Article 7 of China's AML made certain refusals to license critical IP to third parties, most notably including competitors, a potential violation of the AML. But treating a refusal to license IP as an antitrust violation is inconsistent with global antitrust law and even a violation of TRIPS commitments."Finally, whereas most FDI represents profit-seeking greenfield investment made on market-based terms, Chinese FDI is increasingly state-directed and predicated on the acquisition of technology, knowhow, or talent in advanced-technology industries. Over the past 16 years, 99 percent of Chinese U.S.-bound FDI in electronics and 95 percent in ICT sectors were for acquisitions. In the semiconductor industry alone, through early 2016, there were more than 27 attempted, completed, and/or pending international M&A deals, totaling $37 billion, initiated by Chinese-headquartered firms, with more than half these deals financed or backed by Chinese government. Whether its Micron, Aixtron, or Lattice in semiconductors or Germany's Kuka in robotics, Chinese FDI is increasingly state-backed and financed, directed at gaining technological capacity and ultimately global market share across a range of advanced-technology sectors."ITIF's post-hearing testimony will elaborate on these practices in more detail, but we want to stress that we hope the outcome of this investigation is to prevail upon China to abide by the commitments it made in joining the WTO and to embrace rules-based, market-determined, enterprise-led commerce in accordance with the foundational principles of non-discrimination reciprocity, and national treatment in a way that benefits China, the United States, and the world."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6027356 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: October 11, 2017End of Document

TrendForce Saysthe Chinese Government Continues "Big Fund" to Support Key Semiconductor Sectors in China Including Memory and IC DesignBusiness WireNovember 21, 2017 Tuesday 11:00 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business Editors; Technology EditorsLength: 871 wordsDateline: TAIPEI, Taiwan BodyChina's semiconductor industry has been thriving since 2015 driven by the Chinese government's supportive policy and industry fund, with the revenue expected to exceed RMB 620 billion in 2018. According to TrendForce's latest report Breakdown Analysis of China's Semiconductor Industry , the Chinese government will continue supporting heavily in this industry at levels of central government and local authorities. In addition to assisting weak yet significant nodes in the industry chain, the National IC Investment Fund (called the "Big Fund") will mainly focus on three key sectors in the coming years, including memory, SiC/GaN compound semiconductor, and IC design with its application in IoT, 5G, AI, smart vehicles, etc.The year 2014 is a turning point for China's semiconductor industry with the government's announcement ofNational IC Industry Development Outlinein June and the "Big Fund" in September, points out by Jeter Teo, research director ofTrendForce. The government used to offer research and development rewards, tax reduction and land subsidies, but this is the first time for the state to set investment fund and adopt market-oriented approaches like mergers and acquisitions to enhance the manufacturing capacity and international competitiveness of China's semiconductor industry.With the support of the "Big Fund" by far, Tsinghua Unigroup bought Spreadtrum and RDA, Jiangsu Changjiang Electronics Technology Co., Ltd (JCET) acquired STATS ChipPAC and grew to a global top 3 IC testing and packaging company, Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd (TFME) launched new joint venture combining AMD's high-volume assembly, test and packaging facilities (ATMP) . In addition, steps have been taken to increase domestic IC production. As the result, China's semiconductor industry has made progress regarding both quality and quantity, shortening the gap between China and other foreign rivals.The first phase of "Big Fund" invests mainly on IC manufacturing, while the second phase will have higher investment proportion on IC designBy September 2017, the first phase of the "Big Fund" has raised RMB 138.72 billion, a total investment in 55 projects, reports TrendForce. The promised funding is RMB 100.3 billion and the actual investment is RMB 65.3 billion, of which IC manufacturing accounts for the largest proportion (65%). At present, the second phase of the "Big Fund" is being raised, which is estimated to reach RMB 150-200 billion. The investment projects will also be adjusted. TrendForce forecast estimates that the proportion in IC design will increase to 20%-25 %, and the investment projects will also be expanded to potential startups.On the other hand, China's strategy of developing domestic semiconductor industry has witnessed a clear trend - the central government drives local development. By June 2017, the amount of local semiconductor industry investment funds has reached RMB 514.5 billion in line with the "Big Fund", of which the largest one accounts for RMB 50 billion. In response to the central government's strategy, local authorities have put forward special policies for the semiconductor industry, which cover funding, research and development, investment, innovation and talent, etc. This shows that local authorities not only have the determination to develop semiconductor industry, but also initiative substantial practical support.In addition, driven by local governments' active involvement in semiconductor industry, some cities will grow more prominent, which will also lead to changes in the China's semiconductor industry structure in the coming years, points out TrendForce. Hefei, Xiamen and Jinjiang are expected to emerge as major industrial regions of China's new generation of semiconductor industry.For the further details of the press release and the following figures - Figure 1: Investment Proportion of National "Big Fund" in Industry Chain (by September 2017) and Figure 2: Revenue ranking for the semiconductor industry of China's major provinces and cities in 2016 - please visit:https://press.trendforce.com/press/20171121-3025.htmlTo learn more about the Breakdown Analysis of China's Semiconductor Industry report, please visit: http://www.dramexchange.com/Intelligence/china_semiconductor_industry_trend_report_and_analysisAbout TrendForce ( www.trendforce.com )TrendForce is a global provider of market intelligence on the technology industries.

Since 29th October 2017, China's domestic airlines plan to launch 95 new international routes along the B&R, mainly in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia and the South Pacific countries. Meanwhile, foreign airlines are set to launch 18 new international routes along the B&R, principally in the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Kazakhstan and other countries.According to the Plan, Huangpu District (Guangzhou Development District) will provide support in policy, land, capital and other areas. BlueFocus IFEC will bring together leading companies as stakeholders in the whole industry chain to maximize industrial value through commercial operation, as well as to foster a hundred-billion-yuan industrial cluster in five years. Despite the fact that there evidently are difficulties and challenges due to temporal and technical barriers, this ambitious plan can be seen as an important booster and driver for the current development of China's inflight internet.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from US Eturbo News.

H.E. RAO HONGWEI HELD RECEPTION CELEBRATING THE 68TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE PRC (FROM CHINESE EMBASSY IN RWANDA)States News ServiceSeptember 28, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 658 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:On September 27th 2017, H.E. RAO Hongwei, Chinese Ambassador to Rwanda, held a reception celebrating the 68th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Almost 400 people from Rwandan government, political parties, parliament, military, business and academy community, media circles, diplomatic corps, Chinese companies and institutes attended. Among them are Dr. Uzziel Ndagijimana, Minister of State in charge of Economic Planning, Hon. Jeanne d'Arc Debonheur, Minister of Disaster Management and Refugees, and Prof. Anastase Shyaka, CEO in Rwanda Governance Board.H. E. Ambassador RAO Hongwei said in his speech that over the past 68 years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government and people have committed to good governance and made great achievements drawing the attention of the world. Nowadays, as the second largest economy, China has for many years contributed over 30% of the world growth. China is more than a "factory of world". China also leads the world in many areas like manned spaceflights, supercomputer, artificial intelligence, renewable energy, electronic commerce and high-speed railway. This October, the Chinese Communist Party will hold its 19th National Congress and create new prospect for socialism with Chinese characteristics.Chinese people believe that only hundreds of flowers in full blossom can bring spring to the garden and advocate a community of shared future for all humankind. China and Africa are synergizing the "Ten Cooperation Plans" with the AU Agenda 2063, helping Africa to tackle the three bottlenecks of underdeveloped infrastructure, inadequate human resources and lack of financial resources. During the Xiamen BRICS Summit, Chinese President XI Jinping declared that China will provide 500 million USD to the Assistance Fund for South-South Cooperation, helping developing countries addressing famine, refugee, climate change, public health and other challenges.Amb. RAO said that last March, President KAGAME paid a successful visit to China and had a fruitful meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The two Heads of State heralded China-Rwanda comprehensive partnership for the future. Ever since then, China-Rwanda relations have entered a new stage. There have been frequent high level interactions and growing mutual trust. Practical cooperation yield rich fruits. Cultural and people-to-people exchanges flourish. Besides, China-Rwanda cooperation demonstrates a pioneering spirit ---- establishing new models, expanding to new fields, and promoting to new highlights. With concerted efforts, a series of records in being the "first" have been set. The Chinese and Rwandan governments and peoples will further strengthen cooperation and promote the partnership to a higher level, achieving win-win and inclusive progress.On behalf of President Paul Kagame, the Rwandan government and people, Mr. Uzziel Ndagijimana, Minister of State in charge of Economic Planning, conveyed warm congratulations to H.E. President XI Jinping, the Chinese government and people for the 68th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. He said China-Rwanda relation is built on the base of mutual trust. Over the past46 years since the building of bilateral relation, China as a valuable partner has contributed a lot in the development of Rwanda, especially in the infrastructure sector among which the Kigali Urban Roads Upgrading and Administrative Office Complex being the examples. In recent years, the bilateral trade relation has been strengthened by the Rwandan exports to China mainly in agricultural and mineral products and the qualitatively increasing investments from China in Rwanda. And Rwanda welcomes more investment from the Chinese companies and looks forward to further progress of China-Rwanda relation.Load-Date: September 30, 2017End of Document

China must give Taiwan independenceThe Hillsdale Collegian: Hillsdale CollegeSeptember 21, 2017 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HOMEPAGE - OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 718 wordsBody"If you mention the words 'Republic of China,' or even suggest that Taiwan isn't a part of China in public," a Chinese friend whis­pered to me in hushed tones in a crowded Beijing restaurant. "You will be arrested and will never be heard from again."This was a star­tling reminder of the oppression of China's regime when I studied Man­darin in China over the summer. In Beijing, with its wide­spread west­ern­ization, the many Star­bucks and the elegant shopping malls, trav­elers can forget the author­i­tarian regime that lurks beneath the surface. Yet talking with Chinese people about Taiwan brought me back to the reality that the Com­munist regime has a tight grip on its people.The Chinese Com­munist Party indoc­tri­nates children from an early age that Taiwan right­fully belongs to China. In reality, Taiwan is a de facto inde­pendent country with a func­tioning multi-party democracy.Recently, a Tai­wanese makeup blogger posted a video online of her recent trip to Beijing fea­turing her makeup regimen and video footage of her touring the city. Yet the somewhat mundane video attracted the ire of hun­dreds of Chinese cit­izens. Why? Because she referred to her trip as "leaving the country."Chinese netizens posted com­ments such as, "Calling for Tai­wanese inde­pen­dence is unfor­givable," "Going to Beijing counts as going abroad?! You are Chinese!"A couple years ago, Tai­wanese K-pop artist, Chou Tzu-yu, faced similar backlash after waving a small Tai­wanese flag during a tele­vision show. Chinese netizens demanded that the gov­ernment ban the group from per­forming in China. Later, Chou, 16 years old at the time, was forced to give a scripted, tearful apology, halt­ingly affirming that Taiwan is a part of China and that she is proud to be Chinese.Most of us won't be shocked by the rev­e­lation that China's regime seeks to enforce its oppressive ide­ology at home and abroad, however, many Amer­icans know little about Taiwan, a small island off China's south­eastern coast. Yet Taiwan's key dif­fer­ences with China ought to engender the sym­pathy and support of all Amer­icans.Taiwan and China both share the same official lan­guage - Man­darin - a similar cul­tural back­ground, and a similar cuisine. Taiwan is free and demo­c­ratic. Cit­izens enjoy the freedom of speech, press, and religion. In Taiwan, you can crit­icize the gov­ernment and protest without reper­cussion. In China, however, the Com­munist Party represses dissent, restricts indi­vidual liberty, and blocks Google and Facebook­ - nearly all western media.With these dif­fer­ences, why does China con­tinue to insist that Taiwan is their sov­ereign ter­ritory? In 1949, the Chinese Nation­alists fled to Taiwan after defeat by the Chinese Com­mu­nists. At the time, the Chinese Nation­alist Party - or KMT - and the Chinese Com­munist Party both main­tained that they were the legit­imate gov­ernment of China.In order to prevent war, when opening diplo­matic rela­tions with China, but the United States agreed to an amor­phous "One-China policy," a term that everyone agreed to but defined dif­fer­ently. In other words, both the KMT and the CCP agreed that Taiwan was a part of China, but dis­agreed as to who con­sti­tuted the rightful gov­ernment of China.Since then, while mainland China remained under com­munist rule, Taiwan grad­ually tran­si­tioned from the auto­cratic one-party system of the KMT to a multi-party democracy. Although most nations don't rec­ognize Taiwan as its own country, Taiwan, also known by its official name, the Republic of China, enjoys de facto inde­pen­dence with its own gov­ernment, mil­itary, and eco­nomic system.Taiwan has forged for itself a unique national identity sep­arate from China. Today, 73 percent of Tai­wanese cit­izens identify them­selves as Tai­wanese, not Chinese.Yet China still con­siders Taiwan its own ter­ritory. Walking down the crowded streets in Beijing, one can see signs every­where listing the "12 Core Values of Socialism," among which are "democracy," "freedom," and the "rule of law." Even as the Chinese gov­ernment pays lip-service to democracy, China can't seem to accept that most of the 23 million people that live in Taiwan don't want to be ruled by the Chinese Com­munist Party.We must not allow the Com­mu­nists to rule Taiwan.Load-Date: April 30, 2018End of Document

Tariffs on Chinese goods could eventually follow.Chinese state media have lashed out at the plans, but Trump is picking up on an issue that American businesses have been complaining about for years."China does not play by the rules, and it has gotten away with it for too long," James Andrew Lewis, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, wrote in a blog post this month.As China has raced to become a hi-tech manufacturing powerhouse, it stands accused by the U.S. government, industry groups and think tanks of trying to take a short cut by spying, hacking or forcing companies to hand over their intellectual property. Beijing has always denied the allegations."We hope the U.S. will view this matter based on facts and objectively recognize China's efforts and progress in protecting intellectual property rights, as well as our accomplishments through indigenous innovation that has propelled economic growth," Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Monday.She said Chinese citizens filed nearly twice as many patent applications as Americans last year, and Chinese spending on research and development almost matched U.S. levels. But in a report this year, the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property named China as the main offender, estimating the cost to the U.S. economy at up to $600 billion a year. American companies complain that Chinese authorities effectively make them hand over key technology in exchange for access to the world's second largest economy.Restricted access Chinese rules require foreign firms who want to enter certain industries -- such as energy, telecommunications and autos -- to form joint ventures with local partners, which often results in the transfer of technology to the Chinese companies. Beijing also strongly encourages global businesses to carry out R&D activities inside the country.In the past year, Apple has announced plans to open R&D centers in four Chinese cities. And last month, in order to comply with new cybersecurity rules, it said it was setting up its first iCloud data center in China in partnership with a local firm.Amazon and Microsoft already have local partners for their cloud computing services in China.Price of entryBeijing has other ways of getting its hands on valuable commercial information. Officials often insist on taking a close look at technology that foreign companies want to sell in China. "Chinese government authorities jeopardize the value of trade secrets by demanding unnecessary disclosure of confidential information for product approvals," the American Chamber of Commerce in China said in a report published in April.Some experts say that handing over technology has effectively become a cost of doing business in China -- a market too big for most companies to ignore."Many Chinese companies go after technology hard and the tactics they use show up again and again, leading us to believe there is some force (the government?) teaching them how to do these things," said Dan Harris, a Seattle-based attorney who advises international companies on doing business in China."The thing is that the foreign companies that give up their technology usually do so at least somewhat of their own volition," he told CNNMoney. "Yes, maybe they need to do so to get into China, but they also have the choice not to go into China, right?"Closing the stable door?Other analysts say that the U.S. administration is coming to the problem too late."Intellectual property (IP) theft is yesterday's issue," wrote Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "In part because of past technology transfer and in part because of heavy, sustained government investment in science and research, China has developed its own innovative capabilities," he wrote. "Creating new IP in the United States is more important than keeping IP from China."TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

(AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Ningxia Western Cloud Data Technology Co. Ltd. (NWCD), a cloud services provider in China, today announced a strategic technology partnership and the launch of the AWS China (Ningxia) Region, operated by NWCD. The AWS China (Ningxia) Region, operated by NWCD, joins the AWS China (Beijing) Region, operated by Sinnet, as the second AWS China Region and the seventh Region in Asia Pacific, along with AWS Regions in Beijing, Mumbai, Seoul, Singapore, Sydney, and Tokyo. With this launch, AWS now provides 46 Availability Zones across 17 technology infrastructure regions globally, with announced plans for another 15 Availability Zones across five AWS Regions in Bahrain, France, Hong Kong SAR, Sweden, and the US.Already, thousands of active customers are using best-in-class cloud services available from the AWS China (Beijing) Region, operated by Sinnet. Starting today, Chinese developers, startups, and enterprises, as well as government, education, and non-profit organizations, can leverage AWS to run their applications and store their data in the new AWS China (Ningxia) Region, operated by NWCD. Existing customers can choose the AWS China (Beijing) Region, operated by Sinnet, and/or the AWS China (Ningxia) Region, operated by NWCD, by selecting either AWS China Region directly from the AWS Management Console, while new customers can request an account at www.amazonaws.cn to begin using either AWS China Region.AWS has formed a strategic technology collaboration with NWCD, and NWCD operates and provides services from the AWS China (Ningxia) Region, in full compliance with Chinese regulations. Founded in 2015, NWCD is a licensed datacenter and cloud services provider, based in Ningxia, China. NWCD joins Sinnet, the operator of the AWS China (Beijing) Region, as AWS's second operating partner in China. Through these relationships, AWS provides its industry-leading technology, guidance, and expertise to NWCD and Sinnet, while NWCD and Sinnet operate and provide AWS Cloud services to local customers. While the cloud services offered in both AWS China Regions are the same as those available in other AWS Regions, the AWS China Regions are isolated from all other AWS Regions and operated by AWS's Chinese partners separately from all other AWS Regions. Customers using the AWS China Regions enter into customer agreements with Sinnet in Beijing and NWCD in Ningxia, rather than with AWS.The AWS China (Ningxia) Region, operated by NWCD, offers two Availability Zones at launch. AWS Regions are comprised of Availability Zones, which refer to technology infrastructure in separate and distinct geographic locations with enough distance to significantly reduce the risk of a single event impacting availability, yet near enough for business continuity applications that require rapid failover. Each Availability Zone has independent power, cooling, and physical security, and is connected to national backbone networks via local telecom carriers' high-speed fiber optic networks. AWS customers focused on high availability can architect their applications to run in multiple Availability Zones or across both AWS China Regions to achieve even higher fault-tolerance."Together with our partner NWCD, and with deep appreciation of the support we've received from the Zhongwei municipal government and Ningxia government, we're excited to announce the launch of the AWS China (Ningxia) Region, operated by NWCD. The second AWS Region in China is part of AWS's ongoing commitment to offer best-in-class cloud technologies to Chinese customers," said Andy Jassy, CEO, AWS. "For years, AWS and our partners have had an enthusiastic base of customers in China, a country with one of the world's largest and most dynamic cloud ecosystems. Our customers build their businesses on AWS because in addition to being the world's largest cloud, it has more functionality than any other cloud platform, an extensive partner community, and unmatched maturity, security, and performance. We're taking this step jointly with the Ningxia government and our operating partner, NWCD, both of whom worked tirelessly with us to achieve this milestone. Coupled with the AWS China (Beijing) Region, operated by Sinnet, the second AWS China Region will serve as the foundation for new cloud initiatives in China, especially in Western China, helping to transform businesses, increase innovation, and enhance the regional economy.""I have been promoting and incubating cloud computing and technology startups for the last five years, and have worked with various Chinese local governments to create a cloud computing incubation center called Cloud Valley," said Edward Tian, founder of NWCD. "Today, we are honored to announce operationally availability of the AWS China (Ningxia) Region, operated by NWCD. We expect it to play a significant role in the ongoing development of China's western region. It will be an important part of Cloud Valley in China. As one of AWS's strategic partners when it first entered China, we are delighted to witness this moment as an important step in furthering our collaboration. The AWS China (Ningxia) Region, operated by NWCD, ensures the delivery of AWS's leading cloud services, along with flexible and effective local support. As an important part of the cloud computing ecosystem, the combination of cloud technology and Western China's rich resources will enhance the local economy of the region, foster the development of the manufacturing and industrial sector, and promote the prosperity and development of China's cloud ecosystem."He Jian, Secretary of Zhongwei Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), said, "By establishing the Western Cloud Valley in Ningxia Autonomous Region, we see an opportunity to develop our cloud industry and to align with the opportunities presented by the national One Belt One Road Initiative. We have developed a close collaboration with AWS based on mutual trust, and are delighted that our region is now offering highly resilient, high performance data centers to enterprises across the nation. We have already seen a rapid growth in the cloud computing industry, and with the unique resources of Ningxia combined with the mature expertise of AWS Cloud, we will set a great example for economic transformation in the west of China."The establishment of the AWS China (Ningxia) Region, operated by NWCD, will also boost development of the industrial ecosystem of the Western Cloud Valley in Zhongwei, as well as help educate and train local students as future cloud computing talent for Western China. Jointly conceived of and launched by Ningxia University, AWS, and the Zhongwei City Government, the Ningxia University - Amazon Cloud Computing School has about 600 students enrolled to date, with 140 students expected to graduate in 2018.Customers Welcome the AWS China (Ningxia) RegionThousands of active customers in China already use AWS China (Beijing) Region services, operated by Sinnet, and tens of thousands of Chinese customers use other AWS Regions around the world, including Aucma, BGI, BSH, Changyou.com, Cheetah Mobile, EF, Envision Energy, Hikvision, Hisense, iQIYI, Kunlun.com, Lenovo, Lianjia.com, Liulishuo, MangoTV, MaryKay, Meitu, Mengniu Dairy Group, Midea, musical.ly, OPPO, Oriental Pearl Group, Samsung Electronics, Sengled, Suzhou Daily, Sixth Tone, Sunshine Paper, TCL, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Top Score Fashion Shoes, TP-LINK, TuSimple, Unipus, VIPKID, Xiaomi, Xiaoshouyi and many more.TCL Corporation is a business conglomerate focused on smart product manufacturing and Internet application services on a global scale. Chen Jun, deputy general manager of HAWK, TCL Group, said, "By launching the AWS China (Ningxia) Region, AWS continues to bring their world-class cloud services to the Chinese market. Now TCL, and many others in the manufacturing industry, will have access to an even more reliable cloud platform that provides broader functionality in analysis, artificial intelligence/machine learning, and Internet of Things (IoT) for our strategic business transformation, in particular TCL's Product plus Service and Intelligence plus Internet solutions."Lenovo is a global leader in providing innovative consumer, commercial, and data center technology. Yu Chentao, Director and Distinguished Researcher, Big Data Business Unit, Capital and Incubator Group, said, "Lenovo industrial big data solutions not only support Lenovo's production and operations worldwide, but also offer our manufacturing customers a high-performance and one-stop business analysis and optimization environment with industrial intelligence. As AWS's customer and APN partner, both in China and globally, the addition of a second AWS China Region in Ningxia, operated by NWCD, will provide Lenovo and our customers with more services and expanded disaster recovery solutions in China."Samsung Electronics is a global technology leader transforming televisions, smartphones, wearable devices, tablets, digital appliances, and more, through their focus on constant innovation. Daijun Zhang, CEO of Samsung Electronics China Research Center (Beijing), said, "We have been anticipating the launch of the AWS China (Ningxia) Region for some time. A second AWS Region in China will help Samsung to provide more flexible and resilient applications while reducing our costs. This significantly accelerates our ability to bring more innovations to our customers in China."Envision Energy is a top-tier global provider for smart energy technologies and services, including sales of smart turbines, smart wind farms, energy management software, and technological services. Colin Yu, Vice President of Envision, said, "Envision has been working with AWS to develop the largest Energy IoT Platform - EnOS(TM), to connect devices, systems, and people in the energy world. A second AWS China Region will help EnOS better serve its customers throughout the country with lower costs, higher scalability, and faster performance."Investing in China's Startup CommunityMany of the most well-known and fastest-growing startups in China are using AWS services to build and rapidly expand their businesses, both within China and around the world. Companies such as 5miles, 90kmile, Camera360, Fruit Day, FunPlus, Genetalks, Globalegrow, Huan.tv, Huivo, IGG, Insta360, Inveno, Moji, NeuCloud, Patsnap, PingWest, R2Games, RockVR, SoundBus, Webull, Xiaohongshu, XtalPi, Yeahmobi, and Zhugeio have embraced AWS to power their businesses. The AWS Activate program provides startups with the resources they need to quickly get started and scale their businesses on AWS. In 2017, AWS announced Joint Innovation Centers in Qingdao and Xi'an, providing startups with the cloud computing resources and support, including free office space, exposure to local and global venture capital firms, and training.AWS offers a full range of training and certification programs to help Chinese professionals advance their technical skills in the latest cloud technologies and best practices. Additionally, the            AWS Educate program , which recently launched in China, promotes cloud learning in the classroom and has been adopted by more than 1,500 institutions worldwide. A group of professors from Tsinghua University, Peking University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, the Harbin Institute of Technology, and Xian Jiaotong University are now registered in the AWS Educate Program to develop pilot courses in subjects such as cloud computing, IOT, Software Engineering, and computer science fundamentals. The program helps provide an academic gateway for the next generation of China's IT and cloud professionals.AWS Partners Leading Cloud FutureAWS Partner Network (APN) also welcomed the arrival of the new AWS China (Ningxia) Region, operated by NWCD. The APN includes tens of thousands of independent software vendors (ISVs) and systems integrators (SIs) around the world, with APN Partner participation in China growing significantly over the past 12 months. APN Partners build innovative solutions and services on the AWS Cloud and the APN helps by providing those partners with business, technical, marketing, and go-to-market (GTM) support. APN SIs such as Accenture, Deloitte, Digital China Cloud, Neusoft, Ultrapower, DCITS, HAND Enterprise Solutions, Sinoage, Lenovo, Beyondsoft, Futong, and Teamsun are helping enterprise and public sector customers migrate to AWS, deploy mission-critical applications on AWS, and provide a full range of monitoring, automation, and management services for customers' AWS environments.

Total Revenue of China's IC Industry to Grow Above Global Average at Annual Rate of 19.86% for 2018, Says TrendForceBusiness WireNovember 9, 2017 Thursday 11:00 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business Editors; Technology EditorsLength: 950 wordsDateline: TAIPEI, Taiwan BodyAccording to its latest report Breakdown Analysis of China's Semiconductor Industry, TrendForce estimates that the total annual revenue generated by the country's domestic IC industry for 2017 will come to RMB 517.6 billion, representing an increase of 19.39% from 2016. TrendForce further forecasts that total revenue of China's IC industry for 2018 will come to a new record high of around RMB 620 billion, with the annual growth again reaching around the 20% level. By contrast, the average revenue growth rate of the worldwide IC industry for 2018 is projected at 3.4%."Developments in China's IC industry is driven by import substitution demand, government policies, major funding sources and innovative applications for semiconductor technologies," noted Jeter Teo, research director of TrendForce. "Currently, key products in China's IC market such as processors and memory components are still imported from overseas. China in fact has imported more than RMB 1.4 trillion worth of IC products annually for four consecutive years, from 2012 to 2016. Therefore, increasing domestic IC production has become a critical mission for the Chinese government."China's recent policies show that the country is more determined than ever to develop its domestic IC industry. The establishment of the National IC Investment Fund in 2014 signaled that the Chinese government has changed its approach to supporting domestic IC companies. Rather than just providing subsidies to companies like before, the Chinese government is now actively reorganizing the industry by financially backing effective M&A deals. According to data, the National IC Investment Fund already raised RMB 138.7 billion in its first round of fundraising. The total sum raised by other local funds in China for the building of the domestic IC industry has also exceeded RMB 500 billion. In the past, IC demand in China mainly came from smartphones, tablets and other consumer electronics products. Going forward, the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), 5G networking and connected smart vehicles will be the innovative applications generating growth opportunities for the domestic IC industry.China's IC industry has also undergone structural changes as seen in the revenue shares taken by different sectors within the industry over the recent years. "For the first time, IC design houses took more of the industry's total revenue than testing and packaging provider in 2016," Teo pointed out. "Within the 2017 to 2018 period, the IC design section of the domestic supply chain is going to keep growing. This growth will be attributed to the IoT market, where AI and 5G solutions will be driving the expansionary momentum. Other revenue opportunities will come from emerging applications such as biometric sensor hardware for fingerprint and facial recognition, dual-lens camera and AMOLED. In 2018, the revenue share of IC design houses in the Chinese IC industry is forecast to reach 38.8%, the largest among all sections."As for developments in China's IC manufacturing, the country currently has 22 fabs for 12-inch wafers and 18 fabs for 8-inch wafers. Out of the total number of 12-inch wafer fabs, eight are still under construction. Among the 8-inch wafer fabs, five are also being built. The revenue share of the manufacturing section in China's IC supply chain is forecast to expand rapidly to 28.48% in 2018 as more fabs are expected to be in operation during the coming year.The outlook for China's IC testing and packaging sector is positive as well. Domestic testing and packaging providers have benefited from the formation of industry clusters across the country. Furthermore, their capabilities to produce high-end solutions are expected to mature as they obtain or develop advanced technologies and build up their production capacities. Considering various factors including the gradual advances on the technology front and the steady increases in volume of product orders, TrendForce believes China's IC testing and packaging industry as a whole will maintain double-digit revenue growth for 2017 and 2018.Additionally, the upstream sectors of the China's IC industry, such as material and equipment suppliers, can take advantage of the demand created by the significant number of domestic fabs that are scheduled to enter volume production in 2018. Thus, future developments in the upstream are also being watched closely by China's national and local IC funds as well as by other investment groups.For the further details of the press release and the following charts - Figure 1: Revenue and Growth of China's IC Industry, 2014~2018 and Figure 2: Revenue of China's IC Industry by Sector, 2014~2018 - please visit: http://press.trendforce.com/press/20171109-3016.htmlAbout TrendForce ( www.trendforce.com )TrendForce is a global provider of market intelligence on the technology industries.

WHY YOU SHOULD CARE ABOUT CHINA'S VPN CRACKDOWNStates News ServiceAugust 22, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 814 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: DHARAMSALA, India BodyThe following information was released by the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD):Internet censors have a new target. The Chinese and Russian governments recently announced plans to block the use of "virtual private networks" (VPNs), which are a key tool for people trying to avoid internet restrictions and surveillance.This crackdown isn't surprising, given the two countries' histories of monitoring their citizens and blocking certain websites and online services. But it raises the question of whether other governments will follow this lead and introduce their own VPN bans, especially given how VPNs currently allow citizens to avoid the extensive internet surveillance that Western governments practice.China and other countries block many websites they don't want their citizens to access, including sites such as Twitter and YouTube that allow users to freely post almost anything they like. But Chinese internet users wishing to evade these restrictions can currently use VPNs to visit these sites, because they provide access via a separate encrypted server that can't be monitored by the government.Since Chinese internet service providers only filter out connections to the likes of Twitter and YouTube, users can still connect to sites which offer VPN services. VPN acts like a proxy, accessing the banned sites on the users' behalf and allowing them to effectively bypass the restrictions, as well as avoiding government snooping. But now the Chinese government has ordered national telecommunications firms to block VPNs as well from February 2018.Russia doesn't block access to as many sites as China. It allows access to Facebook and Twitter, for example. But it still practices significant internet censorship. And now it has followed China's lead by also restricting VPN services, stating the measure is intended to clamp down on anonymous access to unlawful content.These events come as little surprise given China and Russia's track records. China, in particular, has introduced a number of similar restrictions on VPNs in the past. These clampdowns were vigorously enforced for a period of time and then relaxed.Will the West follow where China leads? How Hwee Young/EPAAlthough the new restrictions seem to be more comprehensive, it's worth noting that they may also be temporary, with the official statement indicating that the measures would run until March 31, 2018. This may have something to do with the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China being held in Beijing in the autumn of 2017.It's also worth pointing out that both China and Russia are heavily invested in developing their industries and economies and keenly aware that this cannot occur without businesses and researchers being able to access internet resources. Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, stated at the Davos economic summit in January 2017 that he wanted to "redouble efforts to develop global connectivity". This must include access to the internet.However, there is significant concern from internet anti-censorship organisations that these kinds of events indicate a growing global trend. Governments are increasingly monitoring, restricting or censoring the internet activities of their own and other nations' citizens.This trend includes most major Western governments. For example, the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the UK's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), have been the subject of considerable debate for their practices of internet snooping and the mass collection of citizens' data.Western laws are vulnerable to VPNsIf the recent laws in China and Russia are alarming, so too are those such as the US Executive Order 12333, authorising the collection of data inside and outside US borders for "national security purposes". This order permits the collection and storage of communication metadata and content without a warrant, court approval or reporting to Congress.The UK's Investigatory Powers Act 2016 isn't far behind, requiring internet service providers to keep a full list of users' connection records, including a list of every website that people have visited, for a year. The UK government has also announced plans to restrict access to pornography to over-18s and ban material it deems harmful altogether, something China has done for years. A major flaw in all these plans is that the surveillance and restrictions can be bypassed using a VPN.While the restrictions on VPN services in China and Russia may be temporary in nature, they do form part of the increasing appetite of governments the world over to monitor and limit the activities of internet users. If Western governments begin to see VPNs as a threat to their own internet regulation, there's a real chance they could follow the lead of China and Russia and introduce their own bans. Online privacy could be a concept heading for extinction.Load-Date: August 25, 2017End of Document

Sign of the Times -- Hitachi Looks to Block Chinese Rivals on U.S. SoilRealMoneySeptember 20, 2017 Wednesday 9:00 AM EDTCopyright 2017 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 883 wordsByline: Alex McMillanHighlight: A South Carolina subsidiary of Hitachi Metals has joined its parent in looking to block Chinese rivals from doing business in the U.S. with what it says is stolen technology.BodyA Hitachi  offshoot and its U.S. subsidiary are suing their Chinese rivals in an ongoing patent "war" over trade secrets they say were stolen by a retired employee. The legal machinations link Tokyo, Beijing and the bustling metropolis of the Myrtle Beach, S.C. suburbs. And they're a sign of things to come.Hitachi Metals  and its Conway, S.C.-based subsidiary Metglas have sued Beijing-based Advanced Technology & Materials and its affiliates. The complaint filed with the U.S. government claims the Chinese manufacturers stole its trade secrets to make super-thin metal ribbons with glass-like qualities that are used in items such as medical devices and anti-theft tags. The suit comes as China announces that it is kicking off a four-month campaign to protect the intellectual property rights of overseas companies in China. The drive, the first of its kind, will run through the end of December, according to China's Ministry of Commerce. The ministry and 12 other agencies, including the Supreme Court and Ministry of Public Security, will crack down on the theft of trade secrets, trademark violations and patent infringements.That's an apparent response to the decision by the United States to investigate China broadly over the theft of intellectual property. And it comes as President Donald Trump prepares to visit China in November.U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer last month agreed with a memorandum from Trump that Lighthizer's office should investigate China's "unfair trade practices" over technology theft.Washington will release the results of the probe before Trump's summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon told the South China Morning Post in an interview here in Hong Kong during the brokerage CLSA's annual investor forum. The result could see the United States impose unilateral punitive tariffs on Chinese goods. China would almost certainly appeal any result to the World Trade Organization, which has its own intellectual-property agreement, and would probably win, as I explained last month . But in the meantime, it would also install tariffs of its own, triggering a trade war. Meanwhile, private industry is letting its own lawyers unleash reams of paperwork, too.Tokyo-based Hitachi Metals makes specialized steel, metal rolls and ceramics, as well as magnets and high-end car parts, including alloy wheels. It and Metglas filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission against the Chinese companies for importing products that it says were made with "misappropriated trade secrets."The complaint alleges that two former Hitachi employees, Hideki Nakamura and Nobrou Hanai, stole the company's trade secrets and then disclosed them to the Chinese companies. The Chinese companies have been attempting to sell amorphous steel for use in the electricity grid, allegedly stealing business from Hitachi. It bought Metglas from Honeywell International  in 2003.The other companies that Hitachi alleges absconded with its intellectual property are: AT&M International Trading, CISRI International Trading, Beijing ZLJG Amorphous Technology, and Qingdao Yunlu Energy Technology.Metglas and its Japanese parent are suing under the Tariff Act of 1930. So besides asking the trade commission to investigate the "unfair acts," the Hitachi units are also requesting a ban on the Chinese companies importing the steel ribbon into the United States. A cease and desist order would, equally, ban the sale of the products that are already inside the United States. The trade commission should decide whether to launch an investigation within a month.Hitachi Metals and China have history, by the way. They go waaay back.Advanced Technology & Materials filed a complaint with the Chinese Ministry of Commerce accusing Hitachi Metals of dumping cheap product in China. Hitachi said its secret production technique made it more competitive.In another case, seven entirely different Chinese rare-earth companies banded together to sue Hitachi Metals in U.S. court in 2014 over patents covering neodymium-iron-boron magnets . That substance is used in engineering-related, wind-power and high-tech industries. Hitachi has more than 600 patents on the highly magnetic rare-metal compound, but had licensed only a few of them.The Chinese companies said that unfairly stopped them from selling their 10,000-ton capacity of neodymium-iron-boron products overseas. The Chinese companies said their products were 10% to 30% cheaper than Hitachi's. Oh, and Hitachi had sued 12 Chinese rare-metals companies in 2012 to block imports of their cheaper magnets. When a Hitachi material patent expired in the United States in 2014, the Chinese companies saw their chance to counter sue to force through their sales.Let the lawyers figure that all out. I'm betting the Chinese crackdown will knock over some easy knock-off targets making fake Frozen merchandise or copying CDs that no one uses these days. Theft that's far harder to track down, let alone prove, will continue -- while at the same time, Chinese companies with government backing will insist on their rights to sell cheap products overseas.If a trade war does erupt, expect it to be fierce, far-reaching and, like the Hitachi lawsuit, incredibly hard to unwind.Load-Date: September 21, 2017End of Document

CHINA 'WORST ABUSER OF INTERNET FREEDOM' WORLDWIDE: FREEDOM HOUSE REPORTStates News ServiceNovember 15, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 811 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:China was the year's worst abuser of internet freedom for the third year running in 2017, according to an annual report from U.S.-based freedom-of-speech watchdog Freedom House.As the ruling Chinese Communist Party held its 19th Party Congress, enshrining the "new era" ideology of President Xi Jinping into its founding document, the government began to write many of its censorship strategies into law, the group said in its annual report on China."The drive to codify what were previously ad hoc censorship and surveillance strategies persisted during the coverage period," the report said.Other new restrictions targeted citizen journalism, and several sought to prevent websites from republishing "unverified" news from social media, the report found.Websites not licensed by the government are now banned from providing any online news or information service at all, the report highlighted.Meanwhile, a draconian cybersecurity law passed in November 2016 forced large numbers of internet users to register for services with their real names, in preparation for a personalized "social credit"scoring system that could link people's online behavior to their access to jobs and services."The cybersecurity law also requires foreign companies to store data on Chinese users within China by 2018, and manyincluding Uber, Evernote, LinkedIn, Apple, and AirBnbhave started to comply," the report said.It said social media users were also punished for sharing sensitive news and commentary, with prison terms ranging from five days to 11 years.Groups shut downSocial media user Zhouzhouzhuzhou said the "seriousness" of such sharing depends on how many people ultimately retweet the information.He said entire WeChat groups are now regularly shut down by the authorities in a bid to erase any "sensitive" topics from the platform."Our WeChat group was shut down 10 or 20 times in the run-up to the 19th Party Congress, and we are still in the process of setting them up again," he told RFA."If anyone says anything sensitive, or posts something sensitive, they can even be detained, although they are more likely to receive a warning," he said.Meanwhile, smartphone chat apps like WeChat were increasingly targeted, with several people detained in connection with comments they shared on the platform.New regulations also sought to limit user-generated news content, meaning that social media users who tweet photos and other information from the scene of breaking news events are now at risk of detention.Meanwhile, 2017 also saw the introduction of a licensing system for anyone wishing to use virtual private network (VPN) tools to bypass censorship.50-cent armyChina also continued with its now long-established methods for recruiting and managing paid and unpaid pro-government commentators to manipulate public opinion online.Pro-government commentators were found in 30 of the 65 countries surveyed by Freedom House, up from 23 in the 2016 edition and a new high.Such commentators, once known as the "50-cent army" in China, are hired to feign grassroots support for the government, smear government opponents, and move online conversations away from controversial topics."The government in China has long enlisted state employees to shape online discussions, but they are now just a small component of a larger ecosystem," Freedom House said.Pro-government commentators in China include volunteers from the ruling party's youth apparatus as well as ordinary citizens known as "ziganwu," it said.It cited official Communist Youth League documents that described "online civilization volunteers" as people using keyboards as weapons to "defend the online homeland" in an ongoing cyberwar for hearts and minds.'Unsuitable' material deletedOnline activist Ou Biaofeng said China's "50-cent army" also routinely deletes posts and accounts deemed unsuitable in the "new era" of Xi's rule."I am sure that Chinese government departments and administrative bodies all hire online commentators and internet police to a greater or lesser extent," Ou told RFA."[Their aim is] to create division where there is any show of social unity."There were 731 million internet users in China at the start of the year, according to the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC)."China boasts the world's largest number of internet users, yet obstacles to access remain, including poor infrastructure, particularly in rural areas," the Freedom House report found.The country's telecommunications industry is dominated by state-owned enterprises, enabling centralized control over international gateways and sporadic, localized shutdowns of internet service to quell social unrest, it said.Reported by Hai Nan for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Zhu Dan for the Mandarin Service.

Chris Smith, R-N.J., issued the following news release:The Chinese government's efforts to steal sensitive personal and financial data, most recently from U.S. government employees and particularly those with security clearances, is a national security concern and the reason Congressman Chris Smith (R-NJ) introduced legislation (H.R. 4235) to strictly review efforts by Chinese companies to acquire U.S. financial service firms specializing in money transfer or other forms of payment.The Chinese government's efforts to steal sensitive personal and financial data, most recently from U.S. government employees and particularly those with security clearances, is a national security concern and the reason Congressman Chris Smith (R-NJ) introduced legislation (H.R. 4235) to strictly review efforts by Chinese companies to acquire U.S. financial service firms specializing in money transfer or other forms of payment."Protecting the personal privacy of U.S. military service members and Federal employees has to be a national security priority, particularly as Chinese firms are expanding efforts to acquire U.S. financial services companies" Smith, co-chair of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, stated."The hacking of the electronic files at Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and Equifax exposed sensitive personnel and financial information of U.S. government employees, providing Chinese and other foreign intelligence agencies information that could be used to target Federal workers with security clearances. The U.S. government must look more closely at proposed acquisitions of U.S. financial services companies for their national security implications," Smith said.H.R. 4235 authorizes a full review of the acquisitions of U.S. financial services companies by Chinese-owned firms, or those that are primarily based in China and require a report to Congress and the President about the implications of such acquisitions on the national security and economic interests of the United States.The bills also requires investigating potential threats to the sensitive personal and financial data of "United States military service members or Federal employees or contractors with security clearances" who use money transfer or other forms of payment. The review would also examine whether the Chinese government limits U.S. domestic corporations to invest in financial services inside China.Smith has urged the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United State (CFIUS) to strictly scrutinize the proposed acquisition of MoneyGram by the Chinese firm Ant Financial, which reportedly has a record of lax security of customer data and deep cooperation with the Chinese government and Communist Party. (Link to WSJ op-ed)."The U.S. is a great place for foreign investment, but we should not be fooled into thinking that Chinese firms are free of Chinese government control and oversight," said Smith, who also held a hearing in 2013 on Chinese hacking and cyberattacks on U.S. businesses. "This is true of Ant Financial and other major tech firms in China. The U.S. should scrutinize Chinese investment rigorously for its impact on our economic future and national security."NWS Earle and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst are military facilities based in Smith's home district, and are home to military personnel and security contractors. As MoneyGram is used by many military personnel, and which operates several locations near both bases, sensitive personnel data of MoneyGram customers could be affected if the company is acquired by Ant Financial."MoneyGram is the world's second largest financial services firm with millions of U.S. customers, a disproportionate number of whom are U.S. military personnel," Smith said. "This legislation is designed to safeguard sensitive personal information and to protect individuals, especially and including our service personnel, when they send needed monies to their loved ones."This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 8, 2017.Contact: Matt Hadro, 202/226-6373Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6070642 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 10, 2017End of Document

CHINA: VOICE BIOMETRIC COLLECTION THREATENS PRIVACYStates News ServiceOctober 22, 2017 SundayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 3231 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:The Chinese government is collecting "voice pattern" samples of individuals to establish a national voice biometric database, Human Rights Watch said today.Authorities are collaborating with iFlytek, a Chinese company that produces 80 percent of all speech recognition technology in the country, to develop a pilot surveillance system that can automatically identify targeted voices in phone conversations. Human Rights Watch wrote to iFlytek on August 2, 2017, asking about its business relationship with the Ministry of Public Security, the description on its website of a mass automated voice recognition and monitoring system it has developed, and whether it has any human rights policies. iFlytek has not responded."The Chinese government has been collecting the voice patterns of tens of thousands of people with little transparency about the program or laws regulating who can be targeted or how that information is going to be used," said Sophie Richardson, China director. "Authorities can easily misuse that data in a country with a long history of unchecked surveillance and retaliation against critics."The Chinese government has stepped up the use of biometric technology in recent years including the construction of large-scale biometric databases to bolster its existing mass surveillance and social control efforts. Compared with other biometric databases run by the police, the voice pattern database appears to be less established, with fewer samples in it. By 2015, police had collected 70,000 voice patterns in Anhui province, one of the main pilot provinces identified by the ministry for such collection. In comparison, national police databases have more than one billion faces and 40 million people's DNA samples.The collection of voice biometrics is part of the Chinese government's drive to form a "multi-modal" biometric portrait of individuals and to gather ever more data about citizens. This voice biometric data is linked in police databases to the person's identification number, which in turn can then be linked to a person's other biometric and personal information on file, including their ethnicity, home address, and even their hotel records.It is extremely difficult in China for individuals to remove such personal information, challenge its collection, or otherwise obtain redress for government surveillance. Unlike other types of biometric collection, such as fingerprinting or DNA sampling, individuals may not even realize their voice pattern has been collected, or that they are under surveillance.Chinese authorities' arsenal of surveillance tools just keeps getting bigger while privacy rights lag far behind.Sophie RichardsonChina DirectorOfficial tender documents and police reports suggest that police are collecting voice patterns together with other biometrics fingerprints, palm prints, and profile photos, as well as urine and DNA samples when they conduct "standardized" ( a‡†aŒ-) and "integrated" (a¸'aŒ-) "information collection" (,ac¯e‡‡e›†).Police officers can subject anyone suspected of "violating the law or committing crimes" (,ac•c ¯'), including misdemeanors, to this treatment. In one case, for example, police collected the voice patterns of three women who were suspected of sex work including two suspected of administrative offenses as police filed the case in an Anhui county.No public official policy documents attempt to justify the creation or use of such voice pattern databases, but academic articles by scientists who are leading their development state that its purpose is to help identify the speaker in voice materials collected during a crime. An artificial intelligence program, known as an Automatic Speaker Recognition (ASR) system, is used to speed up the matching process.Government reports in the media claim that Automatic Speaker Recognition forensics have been used to match voice patterns to solve cases involving telecommunications fraud, drug trafficking, kidnapping, and blackmail. According to these same reports, it will also be applied for counterterrorism and "stability maintenance" purposes terms authorities sometimes use to justify the suppression of peaceful dissent.As the government weaves a tightened web of surveillance, there are more ways ordinary citizens can get caught for criticizing the government, as well as for mobilizing and organizing for social change. There have been documented cases in which activists and netizens have been sentenced for their peaceful expression on communication tools, including on social media applications like WeChat.The government has stepped up efforts to enforce "real-name registration" requirements for a range of services, including when purchasing mobile SIM cards, narrowing the space for anonymity and privacy. There are also cases in which activists are being tracked down by police when they travel on trains, as the authorities require "real name registration" for this and other forms of public transportation. Authorities have also installed CCTV cameras in front of the residences of activists, intimidating and monitoring them.Government collection or use of biometric data is not inherently illegal and has been justified at times as a permissible investigative tactic. But to meet international privacy standards enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which China has signed but not ratified, each government instance of collection, retention, and use of biometrics must be comprehensively regulated, narrow in scope, and necessary as well as proportionate to meeting a legitimate security goal.Given the sensitivity of biometric data, government officials should not collect or use such information unless necessary for the investigation of serious crime, and not for minor offenses or administrative purposes such as tracking migrants. Both collection and use should be limited to people found to be involved in wrongdoing, and not broad populations who have no specific link to crime. Collection, use, and retention should never be based on a person's sex, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, or religious, political, or other views. Individuals should have the right to know what biometric data the government holds on them.Technology companies also have a human rights responsibility to ensure that their products and services do not contribute to human rights abuses, including violations of privacy and fair trial rights."Chinese authorities' arsenal of surveillance tools just keeps getting bigger while privacy rights lag far behind," Richardson said. "The Chinese authorities should immediately stop gathering highly sensitive biometric data until legal protections are clear and clearly reliable."Voice Pattern Database; Automatic Speaker RecognitionIn 2012, the Ministry of Public Security started the construction of a national voice pattern database and designated Anhui as one of the pilot provinces.In 2014, the Anhui provincial police bureau issued an order to accelerate the database construction. Since then, police bureaus across that province have purchased voice pattern collection systems, based on official tender documents.Similar purchases for voice pattern collection systems were also made in 2016 by the police bureaus in Xinjiang, a repressive region with 11 million ethnic minority Uyghurs, following the "Notice to Fully Carry Out the Construction of Three-Dimensional Portraits, Voice Pattern, and DNA Fingerprint Biometrics Collection System" (aaŽa a¼a•a¸‰c»aa ana[deg]canDNAacŒ‡cc"Ÿc‰,ac¯e‡‡e›†c»c»Ÿa»eRc›¸a-'c„ecŸ¥). A local police station reported that front-line officers are given monthly quotas for biometric collection.Police and media reports also indicate that police units have been constructing voice pattern databases in Guangdong province, Anqi county in Fujian province, Wuhan city in Hubei province, and Nanjing city in Jiangsu province.Human Rights Watch also found that police have collected voice patterns of ordinary citizens. For example:A police station in Xuancheng city, Anhui province, stated on April 27, 2017, that it is collecting voice patterns along with fingerprints and blood samples of migrant workers "to effectively grasp the actual situation regarding the migrant population";In Bole city, Xinjiang Autonomous Region, an office responsible for managing domestic migrants described 14 new voice pattern collection systems in its 2016 annual report as part of its efforts to "strengthen the collection information on migrants";Two separate police reports, dated April and May 2017, from Zhengzhou city, Henan province, note that the voice patterns of Uyghur migrants in their jurisdictions have been collected, along with other biometrics;Human Rights Watch has earlier documented that Xinjiang passport applicants are required to submit their biometrics to the police, which includes a voice pattern sample.A February 2017 report by the news website The Paper, since deleted inside China but still available on the overseas website China Digital Times, described how Anhui police were piloting an Automatic Speaker Recognition system to monitor phone conversations in real time, automatically picking out the targeted voice patterns of individuals and alerting the police:A woman in Huainan, Anhui, received a scam call ... just as the scammer was instructing her, step-by-step, how to transfer her money ... the voice pattern recognition system, recognizing the scammers' voice patterns, alerted the police; the police then directly cut off the phone conversation.The technology is integrated into a surveillance system put in place by iFlytek and an unnamed local telecommunications company.iFlytekiFlytek, based in Anhui province, is a major artificial intelligence company focused on speech and speaker recognition. iFlytek's website touts the company's achievement in developing the country's first "mass automated voice recognition and monitoring system." Its website states that it has helped the Ministry of Public Security in building a national voice pattern database. It is also the designated supplier of voice pattern collection systems purchased by Xinjiang and Anhui police bureaus. It says it has set up, jointly with the ministry's forensics center, a key ministry laboratory in artificial intelligent voice technology (ac'e¯eŸac acu¯a¬aR‰e e‡c,aRžeªŒaR) that has "helped solve cases" in Anhui, Gansu, Tibet, and Xinjiang. The company states it can develop artificial intelligence systems that can handle minority languages, including Tibetan and Uyghur.iFlytek's website also claims it has developed other audio-related applications, including "keyword spotting" for "public security" and "national defense" purposes. The web page gives no further details of what these keywords or the security threats might be. In a patent it filed in August 2013, iFlytek states that it has developed a system to discover "repeated audio files" in the telecommunications system and on the internet that may be useful in "monitoring public opinion":[Such a system] ... which can automatically pick up, from a massive amount of audio information, audio clips that appear repeatedly is very important in information security and in monitoring public opinion.... For audio information on the phone [system], the use of the technology can quickly find illegal phone recordings that are being transmitted. For audio and video data on the internet, the technology can quickly and accurately dig out the most popular audio and video clips.iFlytek has a joint laboratory with the Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University. The department has a long history of developing speech and speaker recognition for automated telephone surveillance, and is a major player in the Golden Shield Project, the Ministry of Public Security's ambitious plan to bolster and broaden surveillance using technology.iFlytek also has a range of commercial text-to-speech and speech recognition applications for mobile phones, including a voice assistance app for Android phones in China. The company states it has 890 million users, which would provide a large speech data set that can be used to train and improve its speech recognition software for a range of purposes, potentially including surveillance.It is unclear to what extent iFlytek shares the personal information it collects for commercial purposes with the Ministry of Public Security. While iFlytek promises confidentiality in its customer privacy statement, it also says that it may disclose personal information "according to the demands of the relevant government departments." China's Cybersecurity Law requires companies to provide undefined "technical support" to security agencies to aid in investigations, and provides no privacy protections against state surveillance. iFlytek is not required to inform users of government information requests, for example.During the 2014 annual meeting of the National People's Congress (NPC) China's rubber stamp legislature Liu Qingfeng, chairman of iFlytek and a deputy to the NPC, urged the authorities to "employ big data in countering terrorism as soon as possible, and to speed up the construction of the voice pattern database ... to protect national security."Other governments have used automated speech recognition programs, including the United States for monitoring prison calls and Australia for verifying callers accessing social services; the Spanish police have more than 3,500 voice samples from people convicted of crimes.While some governments pursue voice pattern collection for identification or authentication in limited situations, there are significant challenges to applying such technology for crime control and surveillance. The accuracy of an Automatic Speaker Recognition system is affected by the circumstances of speech, including emotions.According to a speech recognition expert who spoke to Human Rights Watch but did not wish to be named, a system's ability to conduct real-time surveillance is also limited. With current technology, such a system at most can only "listen" to 50 phone lines at one time to trace one targeted voice. The consequences of false positives, where the system incorrectly matches a voice to a stored voice pattern, could be severe when the technology is used to investigate and prosecute crimes, especially in countries such as China, where conviction rate is above 99 percent and few effective redress mechanisms exist.Governments and private sector companies alike face additional challenges in securing large-scale biometric databases. These can become prime targets for cybercriminals, who could attempt to breach them to acquire biometrics to commit identity theft and fraud. Unlike with a national ID number or password, people cannot generally change their voice, face, or other biometrics, and so they may be left with little recourse or protection if such data is breached.ExpandA booth displays face recognition software at an exhibition during the 86th Interpol General Assembly in Beijing, China, September 27, 2017.2017 ReutersBiometric Collection and Wiretapping in Chinese and International LawChinese law appears to limit police collection of biometric samples to people connected to the investigation of a specific criminal case. Article 130 of the Criminal Procedure Law (CPL) states that in the course of criminal investigations, to "ascertain certain features, conditions of injuries, or physical conditions of a victim or a criminal suspect, a physical examination may be conducted, and fingerprints, blood, urine and other biological samples may be collected. If a criminal suspect refuses to be examined, the investigators, when they deem it necessary, may conduct a compulsory examination."But there are no legal guidelines or limitations on how long biometric samples can be stored, shared, or used, or how their collection or use can be challenged. While there are Ministry of Public Security internal departmental rules that focus on the administrative and technical aspects of voice pattern collection, most are not publicly available.The collection of biometrics from migrants may also be taking place outside the law. While there are provincial-level rules authorizing local governments to collect migrants' "basic data," they do not explicitly include biometrics as part of the collected data.Chinese law also does not authorize the police to collect individuals' biometric data in cases of administrative offenses, though this may be changing. In early 2017, the Chinese government issued new draft amendments to its Public Security Administrative Punishments Law, in which a new provision, article 112, authorizes police to collect biometrics to identify victims and offenders in minor administrative cases.Article 148 of the Criminal Procedure Law allows criminal investigators to wiretap criminal suspects as well as anyone connected to the crime for serious crimes, including endangering state security, terrorism, organized crime, drug-related crimes, and corruption. Such wiretapping does not require a court warrant approval from supervisors in the relevant criminal investigation units is adequate under the law.The National People's Congress should review and revise legislation relevant to biometric data collection and wiretapping to ensure they are compliant with standards under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. These standards must be part of a legal framework that ensures collection, use, and retention of such data is a) necessary in the sense that less intrusive measures are unavailable; b) appropriately restricted to ensure the action is proportionate to a legitimate purpose such as public safety; and c) does not impair the essence of the right to privacy and other related rights.To ensure these standards are enforced, any biometric data program should also include independent authorization for collection and use, public notification, and means of independent oversight, as well as avenues for people to challenge abuses and have access to remedies. The authorities should also publish information about the collection and use of voice pattern recognition technology, including disclosure about databases that have been created and specific searches they conduct.iFlytek should cease technology transfers and support for surveillance systems provided to the Ministry of Public Security and provincial authorities until regulations are in place that ensure privacy and other human rights are protected. Technology companies should refrain from sharing voice pattern or other personal information collected for commercial purposes with security agencies without a specific court warrant targeting an individual under suspicion of a serious crime.The companies should not use voice patterns that were collected for commercial purposes to train or otherwise develop technology for surveillance purposes, as information collected from individuals for one purpose should not be used for another without their consent. Companies should also submit voice recognition technology developed for surveillance applications to public, independent accuracy competitions and publish performance results, including tests that address accuracy for ethnic minority languages and potential algorithmic bias that would affect minorities.Load-Date: October 23, 2017End of Document

Could Chinese regulators put an end to blockchain assets?American BankerSeptember 21, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent. All Rights ReservedSection: Vol. 182; No. 182Length: 1663 wordsByline: Brian Patrick EhaBodySpend any amount of time explaining bitcoin to a lay audience, and before long you will be faced with a simple query: What happens if the government bans it?The imagined government, in these hypotheticals, is often the Communist government of China, known for its strict capital controls and sweeping regulatory judgments. So fraught has been the Chinese government's relationship with bitcoin over the years-even as China became the world leader in bitcoin mining and, for a time, in bitcoin exchange operations-and so persistent has been the flow of negative rumors, that the idea of a Chinese "bitcoin ban" long ago became an inside joke for cryptocurrency enthusiasts.No one, it seems safe to say, is laughing now. Chinese regulators have instructed all domestic cryptocurrency exchanges to shut down this month, effectively choking off one of the largest markets for the commercial buying and selling of bitcoin and other digital assets. Cryptocurrency exchanges in China must announce their imminent closure, stop allowing new user sign-ups and work closely with authorities as they wind down their operations, according to a leaked government document and insider reports. Four major Chinese exchanges-Huobi, ViaBTC, OKCoin and BTC China, at one time the world's largest by trading volume-have already given word of their shutdown.The moment could be a pivotal one in the evolution of financial services, but it could easily be misread both by traditional bankers whose businesses the digital asset economy could disrupt and by proponents who champion its technologies. Bitcoin skeptics such as JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon would be wise not to gloat over China's regulatory actions or write cryptocurrencies off, while bitcoin boosters should think hard about the possibility that digital assets may not continue to thrive without the Chinese government's blessing.The authorities' order came as a coup de grâce to Chinese exchange operators following a crackdown that began earlier this month with a blanket ban on initial coin offerings, a newly popular funding method that has allowed blockchain startups and open-source software projects to raise nearly $2 billion from investors worldwide in 2017.As the prices of bitcoin, ether and other cryptocoins went into freefall last week following the news, Dimon piled on. In widely publicized comments at an industry conference, the JPMorgan CEO called bitcoin a "fraud" that would soon "blow up.""It's worse than tulip bulbs. It won't end well," he said.One suspects Dimon, who last spoke out publicly against bitcoin in November 2015, when its price was about one-tenth of its current value, has grown annoyed at the cryptocurrency's staying power. Even his daughter, he said, has bought some bitcoin.Yet bitcoin has weathered similar shocks in the past, from the meltdown of the Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox in 2014 to news of high-profile thefts and hacks of bitcoin businesses. Despite it all, bitcoin has continued to increase in value, soaring some 400% this year alone, from about $1,000 in January to about $5,000 in early September.What's more, cryptocurrency may hold the key to the future of cross-border payments. Even JPMorgan is experimenting with blockchain technology-and filed a patent in late 2013 for a bitcoin-style digital payment system. ICOs, meanwhile, promise to displace venture capital as the chief means of funding cutting-edge startups and software projects-and possibly the very future of the internet.Bitcoin, some of its proponents insist, is exiting China, not the other way around.China's place at the tableChina, as some observers have been quick to point out, has a long and ignoble history of banning or blocking Western innovations of the digital age, from Facebook to YouTube. In no case was China's censure the kiss of death.Many cryptocurrency insiders are therefore cautiously optimistic, even downright sanguine. Erik Voorhees, founder and CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange service ShapeShift, points out that Chinese traders can simply go elsewhere if Chinese exchanges are shuttered."Some significant portion of the people who trade will just open up accounts on non-Chinese exchanges. I know that's the first thing I would do if it became illegal to trade cryptocurrencies in the U.S.-I would sign up with an exchange outside of the U.S," said Voorhees.Voorhees' own company, which allows users to swap one digital token for another, has seen its monthly trading volume grow by 1,000,000%-from $25,000 to $250 million-in only three years."While it's easy to shut down some exchanges if you're the government, it's impossible to shut down every trader," Voorhees said.But China seems intent on making the attempt. Early reports indicated that authorities didn't plan to outlaw person-to-person, or over-the-counter, trading. But insiders now say that Chinese officials are aiming for anall-out ban on bitcoin trading.Next on the chopping block could be bitcoin miners, who devote tremendous amounts of computing power to verifying and recording transactions on the bitcoin network. In return, they receive new bitcoins which are minted at a predetermined rate. Some 80% of the world's bitcoin mining takes place in China, but the bottom could fall out of the business if miners have no way to turn their digital gains into fiat currency.It may not come to that. Oleg Seydak, CEO of the marketplace lender Blackmoon Financial, which recently completed an ICO, thinks even the shutdown of commercial exchanges won't be permanent.China is doing this "just to show their power," he said. "They will temporarily close all of these companies, introduce strong regulations and keep the industry and the sector under their control."Arguing for this approach is the reluctance Chinese leaders must surely feel at the prospect of letting themselves be eclipsed in a new and growing market. In 2016, China accounted for the majority of global bitcoin trading activity. But with the government clamping down, China's share has dropped to less than 15% of global volume. Japan now holds the top spot, with the U.S. and South Korea close behind."In the U.S., which has the most highly regulated financial markets, bitcoin doesn't look like it's going anywhere," said Alex Waters, the former co-founder of CoinApex, a blockchain research group, and the chief technology officer of the stealth startup GetKelvin.And if it can thrive in the U.S., then it will thrive in plenty of other countries that have no desire to outlaw it, he added."A trustworthy international market for bitcoin will continue to exist," said Waters, "whether or not China has a place at the table."'Cryptocurrency cannot be killed'And what of other, newer digital tokens, which are distributed through ICOs? Sasha Ivanov, CEO of Waves, a blockchain platform that serves, like Ethereum, to launch new tokens, believes the Chinese ICO ban is a positive development for the industry.Most ICOs were nothing but scams, said Ivanov, and Chinese regulators "finally lost patience, as more and more companies tried to raise millions for nothing."China, he said, "has a reputation of being a harsh regulator that makes abrupt decisions," but he feels confident that ICOs will be allowed by Chinese authorities once they have put in place an adequate regulatory framework.Other countries, including the U.S., Canada and Singapore, are currently dealing with the question of how to regulate the exploding market for digital assets, which has been valued as highly as $175 billion this year. Insiders disagree over what percentage of the money that has poured into cryptocurrencies in recent months was attributable to Chinese investors. Some say it was significant.But the loss of Chinese capital has not brought token offerings to a halt. When Blackmoon launched its own token sale on Sept. 12, it took the precaution of blocking any Chinese investors from participating. It reached its funding goal of $30 million in less than 24 hours, raising capital from nearly 9,500 investors across 135 countries.Whatever China decides, the introduction of clear regulatory guidelines for token sales may ultimately yield a healthier market."The trend very well may benefit token issuers that are committed to launching legally compliant token sales, in addition to protecting investors," Morrison & Foerster lawyer Joshua Ashley Klayman Kuzar wrote in a recent client alert. "As nations around the globe weigh in and provide legal guidance concerning token sales, a more legitimate, responsible and sustainable token sale market may emerge."Some cryptocurrency diehards have expressed relief at China's "exit" from bitcoin. Better for China to stop all commercial trading activity, their thinking goes, than for the country's regulators to continue manipulating the market with rumors of bans and enforcement actions."This is a good thing," tweeted Charlie Lee, the creator of the digital currency litecoin and the former director of engineering at Coinbase, a cryptocurrency startup valued at more than $1 billion. "China can no longer play with the markets by banning bitcoin. Cryptocurrency cannot be killed by any country."By Tuesday afternoon, cryptocurrency prices were on the rebound. Bitcoin was trading just below $4,000, a roughly 33% increase from its recent low of about $3,000, though still well off its all-time high of about $5,000-set in early September, before the China news broke. The overall market had recovered to $136 billion in total value.For Voorhees and other longtime bitcoin bulls, the bounce was just one more sign of the resilience of this new asset class, which could unlock the future of remittances, e-commerce, peer-to-peer lending and more."States can't control this stuff. They can influence it, they can hamper it, but they can't control it," said Voorhees. "It remains to be seen how much time and money governments waste trying to prevent people from having voluntary interactions with each other."http://www.americanbanker.com/news/could-chinese-regulators-put-an-end-to-blockchain-assetsLoad-Date: September 20, 2017End of Document

Comic Chatbot Errors in China Mask Serious Corporate Caving on CensorshipRealMoneyAugust 3, 2017 Thursday 11:00 AM EDTCopyright 2017 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1092 wordsByline: Alex McMillanHighlight: The removal of chatbots giving unpatriotic answers in China comes after Apple caved on app-store access to VPNs. Is China too big a market for companies to have qualms?BodyTencent, Microsoft MSFT and   charity portfolio holding Apple  have all in the last five days learned the hard way that in China, software is power.Tech companies that might put up a fight elsewhere over content restrictions or access to their products crumble in the face of the Communist Party. With Web restrictions tightening in China, the issue is only going to gain in prominence, and the ranks of companies caving are likely to grow.Comically, Tencent  has removed chatbots developed by Microsoft and Beijing-based Turing Robot after they started giving so-called unpatriotic answers.The BabyQ bot co-developed by Beijing-based Turing Robot answered the question "Do you love the Communist Party?" with "No,"  . The XiaoBing bot from Microsoft  reportedly told users: "My China dream is go to America."On a more serious note, Apple   VPN-related apps from its app store. VPNs, or Virtual Private Networks, can help Chinese citizens get around the stringent government controls of Web content to access overseas information.Apple says it was merely complying with tightened Chinese regulations. But there was none of the defiance that Apple showed when it fought back on home soil against a court order to help the FBI unlock an iPhone, as the agency investigated the San Bernardino terrorist attack.The president of Golden Frog, which saw its privacy software VyprVPN knocked off the Apple app tree in China, said it was "disappointed" Apple bowed to pressure from Beijing, without even citing the specific law that makes a VPN illegal."We view access to Internet in China as a human rights issue, and I would expect Apple to value human rights over profits," Sunday Yokubaitis  . Golden Frog filed an amicus brief in support of Apple's action against the FBI.The pulling of the chatbots is no surprise. They were likely tricked into giving their answers by users, just as provocative Twitter comments helped swindle Microsoft's Tay bot into making anti-Semitic and offensive comments such as "feminism is cancer."But online access is a mounting concern. Amazon.com  , too,  in China over its cloud computing services. One of Amazon's operators in China has told its customers to stop using software that would let someone get around China's controls. Cloud computing is an increasingly thorny issue for the Chinese government, since it raises the potential for controversial content to be held outside China. In response, China is insisting that companies operating data services store the data within China's borders, ostensibly on public safety grounds. Banking data, for instance, could go missing.But we know the real reason. It's so China can regulate what its citizens see, in a bid to control what they think, particularly on issues concerning the Communist Party and its unelected authority to govern.The perils of operating in China are many, but top among them would be running afoul of the Communist Party. Bloomberg has given in by suppressing touchy news stories about Chinese officials, such as  once about the wealth of the family Chinese President Xi Jinping. Most companies capitulate. Chinese yuan are too good to give up.Google, and now its parent Alphabet  , has been the only major company that springs to mind that has taken a stand against Chinese censorship. It pulled its search engine from China, redirecting traffic to its uncensored Hong Kong engine, in 2010 in a fight over China's censorship rules. The company is reportedly in talks to get access in China for some of its offerings, such as Google Scholar.There are plenty of sites you can't access in China, including Facebook , Pinterest and Snapchat. But many would like to get in, given the chance. For instance, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been happy to chat with Chinese president Xi Jinping in Mandarin and  .You'd think online censorship is a battle destined to fail. Web access only grows with the production of every new digital site, app and device, while content proliferates faster exponentially.But the Chinese government fights hard. And while they may know they're not getting the full truth, many of China's citizens believe a large amount of what they're told.The Chinese government orchestrates 488 million fake social-media posts every year, according to a study led by Harvard University data scientist Gary King. In many cases, the government pays the equivalent of $0.08 for people who post comments cheer-leading for China, talking about the Communist Party's revolutionary history, or supporting the regime.The first thing I do every time I visit mainland China is to log in to the hotel's WiFi and search for "Tiananmen Square." Here in Hong Kong, the Chinese government's 1989 massacre of students protesting in favor of democracy pops right up. It's appeared at a couple of Chinese hotels, too, presumably because the Chinese government hadn't yet paid them a digital visit.Hong Kong and Macau are the only parts of China with their own rules on issues like censorship. Macau, relying on Beijing's approval of mainland travel visas to prop up its casino business, toes the party line. For now, I'm free to say what I want from my base in Hong Kong, but that freedom of expression is also disappearing, and fast.The new administration of Chief Executive Carrie Lam, known for her stubborn streak and devotion to Beijing in equal parts, is under pressure to resurrect a highly unpopular "national education" curriculum, viewed by many teachers as patriotic airbrushing and brainwashing. It is also likely to attempt to introduce a "security" law, which by outlawing "sedition and subversion" will obliterate that theoretical freedom of speech. It would certainly make it illegal for Hong Kong politicians to suggest that they support autonomy or independence for Hong Kong. To "challenge the power of the central government" or "endanger China's sovereignty," both terms that can and will be interpreted broadly, "  ."That's what Chinese President Xi Jinping told Hong Kongers on his July 1 visit to "celebrate" the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's reversion to China. Freedom of speech only allows you to say, it seems, what the Communists want you to say.In China, it determines what you can read, see and hear online. Don't question authority, and don't get any upstart ideas.That applies as much at the corporate level as the personal. Even providing the platform, the software, on which to express controversial sentiments crosses a very ill-defined line.Will other companies take a stand like Google? Or will they all cave?Load-Date: August 4, 2017End of Document

Rep. Smith: The Long Arm of China: Exporting Authoritarianism With Chinese CharacteristicsTargeted News ServiceDecember 16, 2017 Saturday 7:02 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 964 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Christopher H. Smith, R-New Jerse, issued the following speech, which was published in the Congressional Record on Dec. 14:Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I made the following remarks at the hearing held by the Congressional-Executive Commission on China which I co-chair with Senator Marco Rubio:This hearing is the second in a series looking at China's foreign influence operations and the impact on universally-recognized human rights. With the Congress and U.S. public focused on Russian influence operations, Chinese efforts have received little scrutiny and are not well understood. This must change.Attempts by the Chinese government to guide, buy, or coerce political influence, control discussion of "sensitive" topics, and export its authoritarian practices globally are widespread and pervasive. Long-time allies Australia, New Zealand, and Canada have been rocked by scandals involving Chinese sponsored influence operations targeting politicians, businesses, and academic institutions.Australia in particular is in the midst of a national crisis and all like-minded democratic allies should be supporting their efforts to root out those elements intended to corrupt or coopt Australian political and academic institutions.All countries pursue soft power initiatives to promote a "positive" global image and build goodwill, but the Chinese government's use of technology, coercion, pressure, and the promise of market access is unprecedented and poses clear challenges to the freedoms of democratic societies.An example of Chinese rewards given to companies and individuals for abiding by the Chinese government's rules is the case of publisher Springer Nature, the world's largest academic book publisher.Springer Nature removed more than 1,000 articles from the websites of the Journal of Chinese Political Science and International Politics in order to comply with China's censorship directives and was later "rewarded" for its censorship by signing a lucrative strategic partnership with the Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings.In addition to academic publishers, the Chinese government is going to school on college and universities. American institutions are being seduced by the promised infusion of much-needed wealth from China.But one always has to pay a price--play by China's rules, don't ruffle feathers and don't discuss or write about "sensitive topics." Universities committed to academic freedom are bound to run into problems eventually.I have held two hearings on the threat to academic freedom posed by Confucius Institutes and the creation of U.S. campuses in China.We should all be for creative research partnerships and expanding educational opportunities for U.S. students, but not at the cost of fundamental freedoms.I have asked the General Accounting Office (GAO) to investigate academic partnerships between the U.S. colleges and the Chinese government. The first report came out last Spring.The GAO is now in the process of conducting investigations of Confucius Institutes. I have written to all U.S. colleges with Confucius Institutes and asked them to make their contracts public and available for public inspection.Many foreign businesses in China have already faced similar dilemmas. Some, like Apple, which recently removed from its Chinese app store applications that help users bypass China's "Great Firewall." The networking site LinkedIn agreed to censor content and Facebook is promising to do the same in order to get access to the Chinese market.Chinese operations to curtail the activities of dissidents and critics of the Communist Party are also pervasive, troubling, and must be stopped. We have heard multiple stories from U.S. citizens and foreign nationals living in the U.S. about efforts to intimidate, censor, and silence them.The case of Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui is just the latest example of egregious behavior. High-ranking Chinese security ministry officials, in the US on transit visas no less, met with Mr. Guo multiple times in order to threaten and convince him to leave the U.S.Chinese agents have repeatedly violated U.S. sovereignty and law according to the Wall Street Journal report on the incident.These incidents and those we will discuss today are just the tip of the iceberg.The Commission's 2017 Annual Report contains several recommendations to counter Chinese foreign influence operations--including expanding the mandate of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) to include Chinese government media organizations and think-tanks, expanded Internet Freedom initiatives and efforts to counter Chinese propaganda and disinformation at the State Department. I encourage those interested to look at our recommendations.As we start to grapple with the scale and scope of Chinese influence operations, we will be looking for new legislative ideas and I hope our witnesses today can provide recommendations for the Commission's action.We must be clear from the outset that we support better relations with the people of China and the United States. The issues we are discussing here today are part of influence operations conducted by the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government.President Xi Jinping, who has concentrated more power than any Chinese leader since Mao, is determined to make the world safe for authoritarianism. Beijing is intent on exporting its censorship regime, intimidating dissidents and their families, sanitizing history, and stifling critical discussions of its repressive policies.These actions pose direct threats to deeply held core values and fundamental freedoms enjoyed by all democratic societies. We must find ways to effectively and resolutely push back. Doing so should be a critical national interest.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6109393 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 16, 2017End of Document

China: Voice Biometric Collection Threatens PrivacyTargeted News ServiceOctober 22, 2017 Sunday 2:45 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3168 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyHuman Rights Watch issued the following news release:The Chinese government is collecting "voice pattern" samples of individuals to establish a national voice biometric database, Human Rights Watch said today.Authorities are collaborating with iFlytek, a Chinese company that produces 80 percent of all speech recognition technology in the country, to develop a pilot surveillance system that can automatically identify targeted voices in phone conversations. Human Rights Watch wrote to iFlytek on August 2, 2017, asking about its business relationship with the Ministry of Public Security, the description on its website of a mass automated voice recognition and monitoring system it has developed, and whether it has any human rights policies. iFlytek has not responded."The Chinese government has been collecting the voice patterns of tens of thousands of people with little transparency about the program or laws regulating who can be targeted or how that information is going to be used," said Sophie Richardson, China director. "Authorities can easily misuse that data in a country with a long history of unchecked surveillance and retaliation against critics."The Chinese government has stepped up the use of biometric technology in recent years - including the construction of large-scale biometric databases - to bolster its existing mass surveillance and social control efforts. Compared with other biometric databases run by the police, the voice pattern database appears to be less established, with fewer samples in it. By 2015, police had collected 70,000 voice patterns in Anhui province, one of the main pilot provinces identified by the ministry for such collection. In comparison, national police databases have more than one billion faces and 40 million people's DNA samples.The collection of voice biometrics is part of the Chinese government's drive to form a "multi-modal" biometric portrait of individuals and to gather ever more data about citizens. This voice biometric data is linked in police databases to the person's identification number, which in turn can then be linked to a person's other biometric and personal information on file, including their ethnicity, home address, and even their hotel records.It is extremely difficult in China for individuals to remove such personal information, challenge its collection, or otherwise obtain redress for government surveillance. Unlike other types of biometric collection, such as fingerprinting or DNA sampling, individuals may not even realize their voice pattern has been collected, or that they are under surveillance.Official tender documents and police reports suggest that police are collecting voice patterns together with other biometrics - fingerprints, palm prints, and profile photos, as well as urine and DNA samples - when they conduct "standardized" and "integrated" "information collection."Police officers can subject anyone suspected of "violating the law or committing crimes", including misdemeanors, to this treatment. In one case, for example, police collected the voice patterns of three women who were suspected of sex work - including two suspected of administrative offenses - as police filed the case in an Anhui county.No public official policy documents attempt to justify the creation or use of such voice pattern databases, but academic articles by scientists who are leading their development state that its purpose is to help identify the speaker in voice materials collected during a crime. An artificial intelligence program, known as an Automatic Speaker Recognition (ASR) system, is used to speed up the matching process.Government reports in the media claim that Automatic Speaker Recognition forensics have been used to match voice patterns to solve cases involving telecommunications fraud, drug trafficking, kidnapping, and blackmail. According to these same reports, it will also be applied for counterterrorism and "stability maintenance" purposes - terms authorities sometimes use to justify the suppression of peaceful dissent.As the government weaves a tightened web of surveillance, there are more ways ordinary citizens can get caught for criticizing the government, as well as for mobilizing and organizing for social change. There have been documented cases in which activists and netizens have been sentenced for their peaceful expression on communication tools, including on social media applications like WeChat.The government has stepped up efforts to enforce "real-name registration" requirements for a range of services, including when purchasing mobile SIM cards, narrowing the space for anonymity and privacy. There are also cases in which activists are being tracked down by police when they travel on trains, as the authorities require "real name registration" for this and other forms of public transportation. Authorities have also installed CCTV cameras in front of the residences of activists, intimidating and monitoring them.Government collection or use of biometric data is not inherently illegal and has been justified at times as a permissible investigative tactic. But to meet international privacy standards enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which China has signed but not ratified, each government instance of collection, retention, and use of biometrics must be comprehensively regulated, narrow in scope, and necessary as well as proportionate to meeting a legitimate security goal.Given the sensitivity of biometric data, government officials should not collect or use such information unless necessary for the investigation of serious crime, and not for minor offenses or administrative purposes such as tracking migrants. Both collection and use should be limited to people found to be involved in wrongdoing, and not broad populations who have no specific link to crime. Collection, use, and retention should never be based on a person's sex, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, or religious, political, or other views. Individuals should have the right to know what biometric data the government holds on them.Technology companies also have a human rights responsibility to ensure that their products and services do not contribute to human rights abuses, including violations of privacy and fair trial rights."Chinese authorities' arsenal of surveillance tools just keeps getting bigger while privacy rights lag far behind," Richardson said. "The Chinese authorities should immediately stop gathering highly sensitive biometric data until legal protections are clear - and clearly reliable."Voice Pattern Database; Automatic Speaker RecognitionIn 2012, the Ministry of Public Security started the construction of a national voice pattern database and designated Anhui as one of the pilot provinces.In 2014, the Anhui provincial police bureau issued an order to accelerate the database construction. Since then, police bureaus across that province have purchased voice pattern collection systems, based on official tender documents.Similar purchases for voice pattern collection systems were also made in 2016 by the police bureaus in Xinjiang, a repressive region with 11 million ethnic minority Uyghurs, following the "Notice to Fully Carry Out the Construction of Three-Dimensional Portraits, Voice Pattern, and DNA Fingerprint Biometrics Collection System." A local police station reported that front-line officers are given monthly quotas for biometric collection.Police and media reports also indicate that police units have been constructing voice pattern databases in Guangdong province, Anqi county in Fujian province, Wuhan city in Hubei province, and Nanjing city in Jiangsu province.Human Rights Watch also found that police have collected voice patterns of ordinary citizens. For example:* A police station in Xuancheng city, Anhui province, stated on April 27, 2017, that it is collecting voice patterns along with fingerprints and blood samples of migrant workers "to effectively grasp the actual situation regarding the migrant population";* In Bole city, Xinjiang Autonomous Region, an office responsible for managing domestic migrants described 14 new voice pattern collection systems in its 2016 annual report as part of its efforts to "strengthen the collection information on migrants";* Two separate police reports, dated April and May 2017, from Zhengzhou city, Henan province, note that the voice patterns of Uyghur migrants in their jurisdictions have been collected, along with other biometrics;* Human Rights Watch has earlier documented that Xinjiang passport applicants are required to submit their biometrics to the police, which includes a voice pattern sample.A February 2017 report by the news website The Paper, since deleted inside China but still available on the overseas website China Digital Times, described how Anhui police were piloting an Automatic Speaker Recognition system to monitor phone conversations in real time, automatically picking out the targeted voice patterns of individuals and alerting the police:A woman in Huainan, Anhui, received a scam call ... just as the scammer was instructing her, step-by-step, how to transfer her money ... the voice pattern recognition system, recognizing the scammers' voice patterns, alerted the police; the police then directly cut off the phone conversation.The technology is integrated into a surveillance system put in place by iFlytek and an unnamed local telecommunications company.iFlytekiFlytek, based in Anhui province, is a major artificial intelligence company focused on speech and speaker recognition. iFlytek's website touts the company's achievement in developing the country's first "mass automated voice recognition and monitoring system." Its website states that it has helped the Ministry of Public Security in building a national voice pattern database. It is also the designated supplier of voice pattern collection systems purchased by Xinjiang and Anhui police bureaus. It says it has set up, jointly with the ministry's forensics center, a key ministry laboratory in artificial intelligent voice technology that has "helped solve cases" in Anhui, Gansu, Tibet, and Xinjiang. The company states it can develop artificial intelligence systems that can handle minority languages, including Tibetan and Uyghur.iFlytek's website also claims it has developed other audio-related applications, including "keyword spotting" for "public security" and "national defense" purposes. The web page gives no further details of what these keywords or the security threats might be. In a patent it filed in August 2013, iFlytek states that it has developed a system to discover "repeated audio files" in the telecommunications system and on the internet that may be useful in "monitoring public opinion":[Such a system] ... which can automatically pick up, from a massive amount of audio information, audio clips that appear repeatedly is very important in information security and in monitoring public opinion.... For audio information on the phone [system], the use of the technology can quickly find illegal phone recordings that are being transmitted. For audio and video data on the internet, the technology can quickly and accurately dig out the most popular audio and video clips.iFlytek has a joint laboratory with the Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University. The department has a long history of developing speech and speaker recognition for automated telephone surveillance, and is a major player in the Golden Shield Project, the Ministry of Public Security's ambitious plan to bolster and broaden surveillance using technology.iFlytek also has a range of commercial text-to-speech and speech recognition applications for mobile phones, including a voice assistance app for Android phones in China. The company states it has 890 million users, which would provide a large speech data set that can be used to train and improve its speech recognition software for a range of purposes, potentially including surveillance.It is unclear to what extent iFlytek shares the personal information it collects for commercial purposes with the Ministry of Public Security. While iFlytek promises confidentiality in its customer privacy statement, it also says that it may disclose personal information "according to the demands of the relevant government departments." China's Cybersecurity Law requires companies to provide undefined "technical support" to security agencies to aid in investigations, and provides no privacy protections against state surveillance. iFlytek is not required to inform users of government information requests, for example.During the 2014 annual meeting of the National People's Congress (NPC) - China's rubber stamp legislature - Liu Qingfeng, chairman of iFlytek and a deputy to the NPC, urged the authorities to "employ big data in countering terrorism as soon as possible, and to speed up the construction of the voice pattern database ... to protect national security."Other governments have used automated speech recognition programs, including the United States for monitoring prison calls and Australia for verifying callers accessing social services; the Spanish police have more than 3,500 voice samples from people convicted of crimes.While some governments pursue voice pattern collection for identification or authentication in limited situations, there are significant challenges to applying such technology for crime control and surveillance. The accuracy of an Automatic Speaker Recognition system is affected by the circumstances of speech, including emotions.According to a speech recognition expert who spoke to Human Rights Watch but did not wish to be named, a system's ability to conduct real-time surveillance is also limited. With current technology, such a system at most can only "listen" to 50 phone lines at one time to trace one targeted voice. The consequences of false positives, where the system incorrectly matches a voice to a stored voice pattern, could be severe when the technology is used to investigate and prosecute crimes, especially in countries such as China, where conviction rate is above 99 percent and few effective redress mechanisms exist.Governments and private sector companies alike face additional challenges in securing large-scale biometric databases. These can become prime targets for cybercriminals, who could attempt to breach them to acquire biometrics to commit identity theft and fraud. Unlike with a national ID number or password, people cannot generally change their voice, face, or other biometrics, and so they may be left with little recourse or protection if such data is breached.Biometric Collection and Wiretapping in Chinese and International LawChinese law appears to limit police collection of biometric samples to people connected to the investigation of a specific criminal case. Article 130 of the Criminal Procedure Law (CPL) states that in the course of criminal investigations, to "ascertain certain features, conditions of injuries, or physical conditions of a victim or a criminal suspect, a physical examination may be conducted, and fingerprints, blood, urine and other biological samples may be collected. If a criminal suspect refuses to be examined, the investigators, when they deem it necessary, may conduct a compulsory examination."But there are no legal guidelines or limitations on how long biometric samples can be stored, shared, or used, or how their collection or use can be challenged. While there are Ministry of Public Security internal departmental rules that focus on the administrative and technical aspects of voice pattern collection, most are not publicly available.The collection of biometrics from migrants may also be taking place outside the law. While there are provincial-level rules authorizing local governments to collect migrants' "basic data," they do not explicitly include biometrics as part of the collected data.Chinese law also does not authorize the police to collect individuals' biometric data in cases of administrative offenses, though this may be changing. In early 2017, the Chinese government issued new draft amendments to its Public Security Administrative Punishments Law, in which a new provision, article 112, authorizes police to collect biometrics to identify victims and offenders in minor administrative cases.Article 148 of the Criminal Procedure Law allows criminal investigators to wiretap criminal suspects as well as anyone connected to the crime for serious crimes, including endangering state security, terrorism, organized crime, drug-related crimes, and corruption. Such wiretapping does not require a court warrant - approval from supervisors in the relevant criminal investigation units is adequate under the law.The National People's Congress should review and revise legislation relevant to biometric data collection and wiretapping to ensure they are compliant with standards under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. These standards must be part of a legal framework that ensures collection, use, and retention of such data is a) necessary in the sense that less intrusive measures are unavailable; b) appropriately restricted to ensure the action is proportionate to a legitimate purpose such as public safety; and c) does not impair the essence of the right to privacy and other related rights.To ensure these standards are enforced, any biometric data program should also include independent authorization for collection and use, public notification, and means of independent oversight, as well as avenues for people to challenge abuses and have access to remedies. The authorities should also publish information about the collection and use of voice pattern recognition technology, including disclosure about databases that have been created and specific searches they conduct.iFlytek should cease technology transfers and support for surveillance systems provided to the Ministry of Public Security and provincial authorities until regulations are in place that ensure privacy and other human rights are protected. Technology companies should refrain from sharing voice pattern or other personal information collected for commercial purposes with security agencies without a specific court warrant targeting an individual under suspicion of a serious crime.The companies should not use voice patterns that were collected for commercial purposes to train or otherwise develop technology for surveillance purposes, as information collected from individuals for one purpose should not be used for another without their consent. Companies should also submit voice recognition technology developed for surveillance applications to public, independent accuracy competitions and publish performance results, including tests that address accuracy for ethnic minority languages and potential algorithmic bias that would affect minorities.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6044524 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: October 24, 2017End of Document

Chinese billionaire sues social media accounts over 'malicious rumors'CNN WireSeptember 6, 2017 Wednesday 11:26 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 621 wordsByline: By Sherisse PhamDateline: HONG KONG (CNNMoney) BodyHONG KONG (CNNMoney) --  One of China's richest men is taking legal action against "rumormongers," accusing them of spreading fake news about him and his company.Dalian Wanda Group -- a massive Chinese conglomerate whose businesses include AMC movie theaters -- has filed lawsuits in China against multiple social media accounts that it says circulated "malicious rumors" about Wang Jianlin, its billionaire chairman.Some Chinese-language news outlets reported on social media last week that Wang had been stopped at an airport and prevented from leaving China. Wanda quickly dismissed the reports as "rumors cooked up with ulterior motives," but shares of a Wanda subsidiary listed in Hong Kong still lost 8% that day. The rumors came against the backdrop of increased scrutiny by Chinese authorities of international deal-making by Wanda and other Chinese companies. That has made investors nervous in a country where top business leaders have been known to disappear suddenly without explanation. Wang used a speech in July to fight back against earlier speculation about problems at his real estate business. Now, he's taking news organizations and social media users to court over the latest rumors.Wanda said in a statement Wednesday it has filed lawsuits against Asia News Weekly, New People Magazine and other organizations, seeking a public apology and 5 million yuan ($765,000) in compensation from each of them. It said it also plans to pursue criminal charges in some cases.Wanda said the groups used their accounts on WeChat, a messaging platform, or Weibo, a Chinese equivalent to Twitter, to spread the rumors that Wang had been prevented from leaving China."We are communicating with our lawyer now, and then we'll see how to deal with it later," said Wang Pu, chief editor with Asia News Weekly. New People Magazine didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Wanda said the legal action is aimed at "defending its dignity, but also using legal measures to issue a warning to media outlets lacking ethics or basic moral standards." However, it's also going after individual social media users.Wu Xiaowei, the founder of an internet consumer rights company, said he was "shocked" when he heard Wanda had filed a lawsuit against him."I reposted some fake news reported by standard news organizations," he said in a statement on his Weibo account. "But I deleted the posts immediately after I found out they were misleading." Wu apologized to Wang, but said he didn't have the means to pay the 5 million yuan Wanda is demanding. Wanda's legal moves may also extend overseas. The company said it is considering filing a defamation lawsuit seeking $2 million in compensation from Boxun, a U.S.-based Chinese-language news website. Boxun didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Wang has been on the defensive for months. Wanda dumped a big London real estate deal late last month.

SMITH INTRODUCES BILL TO HEIGHTEN REVIEW OF ACQUISITIONS OF U.S. MONEY TRANSFER COMPANIES BY CHINESE FIRMSStates News ServiceNovember 9, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 590 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of New Jersey Rep. Chris Smith:The Chinese government's efforts to steal sensitive personal and financial data, most recently from U.S. government employees and particularly those with security clearances, is a national security concern and the reason Congressman Chris Smith (R-NJ) introduced legislation (H.R. 4235) to strictly review efforts by Chinese companies to acquire U.S. financial service firms specializing in money transfer or other forms of payment."Protecting the personal privacy of U.S. military service members and Federal employees has to be a national security priority, particularly as Chinese firms are expanding efforts to acquire U.S. financial services companies" Smith, co-chair of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, stated."The hacking of the electronic files at Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and Equifax exposed sensitive personnel and financial information of U.S. government employees, providing Chinese and other foreign intelligence agencies information that could be used to target Federal workers with security clearances. The U.S. government must look more closely at proposed acquisitions of U.S. financial services companies for their national security implications," Smith said.H.R. 4235 authorizes a full review of the acquisitions of U.S. financial services companies by Chinese-owned firms, or those that are primarily based in China and require a report to Congress and the President about the implications of such acquisitions on the national security and economic interests of the United States.The bills also requires investigating potential threats to the sensitive personal and financial data of "United States military service members or Federal employees or contractors with security clearances" who use money transfer or other forms of payment. The review would also examine whether the Chinese government limits U.S. domestic corporations to invest in financial services inside China.Smith has urged the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United State (CFIUS) to strictly scrutinize the proposed acquisition of MoneyGram by the Chinese firm Ant Financial, which reportedly has a record of lax security of customer data and deep cooperation with the Chinese government and Communist Party. (Link to WSJ op-ed)."The U.S. is a great place for foreign investment, but we should not be fooled into thinking that Chinese firms are free of Chinese government control and oversight," said Smith, who also held a hearing in 2013 on Chinese hacking and cyberattacks on U.S. businesses. This is true of Ant Financial and other major tech firms in China. The U.S. should scrutinize Chinese investment rigorously for its impact on our economic future and national security."NWS Earle and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst are military facilities based in Smith's home district, and are home to military personnel and security contractors. As MoneyGram is used by many military personnel, and which operates several locations near both bases, sensitive personnel data of MoneyGram customers could be affected if the company is acquired by Ant Financial."MoneyGram is the world's second largest financial services firm with millions of U.S. customers, a disproportionate number of whom are U.S. military personnel," Smith said. "This legislation is designed to safeguard sensitive personal information and to protect individuals, especially and including our service personnel, when they send needed monies to their loved ones."Load-Date: November 9, 2017End of Document

The disappeared: Accounts from inside China's secret prisonsCNN.comOctober 31, 2017 Tuesday 10:52 PM ESTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 2404 wordsByline: By Chieu Luu and Matt Rivers, CNNBodySui Muqing says he was forced to stay awake while he was interrogated for more than four days.Chen Taihe describes being held in a jail cell so crowded he couldn't relieve himself.And Peter Dahlin was left so traumatized by his experience, he slept with a knife next to his bed.Three men, in three different parts of China. They didn't know each other, but all had one thing in common: They advocated for human rights and became caught up in what activists say is the Chinese government's brutal crackdown on dissent.Rights groups say President Xi Jinping's wide-reaching sweep on perceived threats to both his rule and the Chinese Communist Party has led to the arrests of dozens of activists, bloggers, feminists, artists and lawyers.The men, who CNN spoke to in detail over the course of the last 12 months, describe being forcibly taken from their homes, detained for weeks, sometimes months, in secret prisons, denied communication with family and legal representation, strong-armed into making videotaped confessions, and ultimately released without being convicted of a single crime.Sui, Chen and Dahlin all say they were explicitly told not to talk about what happened to them, but have decided to speak out anyway. They say they want to shed light on the lengths to which China's government will go to silence anyone it deems a threat.CNN reached out to the Chinese government for comment on each of the cases in this story, but received no response until the report published."China is a country with the rule of law. Chinese judicial authorities fully guarantee all legal rights of criminal suspects when handling their cases. We hope foreign media outlets based in China respect China's judicial sovereignty, respect facts, and cover the news objectively and fairly," the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in fax dated November 24.The 709 crackdownWhile being a human rights lawyer has never been an easy path in Communist China, forced disappearances of lawyers were rare before 2015.But on July 9 of that year, prominent Beijing rights lawyer Wang Yu disappeared, along with her husband, also a lawyer, and their teenage son.The following day, police raided Wang's law firm and detained seven of her colleagues. Seven other rights lawyers were also detained or reported missing, according to the Hong-Kong based China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group, which has meticulously documented the cases. It became known as the "709 crackdown" -- a reference to the date the first arrests occurred.Sui was among them. He'd earlier in the day spoken to two foreign media outlets to raise concern about Wang's disappearance.That night, a security guard called up to Sui's apartment and said his car had been scratched in an accident and when he stepped outside, a group of police quickly whisked him away, said Sui. He wasn't seen again for nearly five months.Two days later, on July 12, the same thing happened to Chen. He said police asked him to come down from his apartment to answer a few questions. "I intentionally left my cell phone upstairs in my apartment because I thought I'd be back in a few minutes." He didn't return for six weeks.During a period of less than a week, at least 146 lawyers and their families were detained in a nationwide swoop according to China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group.Rights groups say the roots of the crackdown on lawyers can be traced back to an editorial in the overseas edition of state-run People's Daily in July 2012, which warned the United States would use five categories of people to destabilize the Communist Party's near seven-decade rule. Rights advocates and lawyers were at the top of the list.Dahlin, a Swedish national who co-founded a Beijing-based NGO that provided legal aid and training to Chinese lawyers, wasn't caught up in the first wave of detentions, and assumed his status as a foreigner might offer him some protection.In early January 2016, however, he got tipped off authorities might be after him. He was about to depart for Beijing airport when 20 police officers turned up at his apartment.They detained him and his girlfriend and they ransacked his home, he says, seizing computers and documents.Dahlin says he was accused of masterminding a plan to smuggle the son of Wang Yu, the first lawyer to be detained in the swoop, into Myanmar, in an effort to evade authorities in October 2015.He said investigators realized early on he had nothing to do with it, but instead of letting him go, quickly turned their attention to his NGO -- Chinese Urgent Action Working Group -- pressing him to give up information about his colleagues and other activists his group worked with.Authorities said that Dahlin worked for an illegal organization that sponsored activities that jeopardized China's national security. The NGO said it "undertakes rapid response assistance for rights defenders in need."By October 2017, some 321 lawyers, rights activists, their family members and staff had been caught up in the 709 crackdown, according to the China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group.How lawyers disappearA key tool in the crackdown has been a relatively new form of detention. In 2012, China introduced "residential surveillance at a designated location" (RSDL) into the Criminal Procedural Law.It appeared to legalize a long-used practice of "black jails" -- a means of temporarily detaining people outside the Chinese legal system who could not be immediately charged with a crime.The government denied black jails existed in 2009. But in 2011 Chinese state media reported on a campaign by the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau to crack down on them.The amended law says residential surveillance shouldn't exceed six months but requires detainees' families be notified within 24 hours, unless they can't be reached, and guarantees all suspects the right to a lawyer, with whom a meeting should be granted within 48 hours of a request.Critics of the new system and former detainees say it gives arbitrary detention a legal gloss and normalizes enforced disappearances. Earlier this year, 11 countries called on China to end the practice and investigate reports of torture against human rights lawyers. The UN High Commission on Human Rights has also called on China to halt the detention of lawyers.Although they were held at opposite ends of the country, Sui, Chen and Dahlin all describe similar conditions: Sparsely furnished rooms with black-out curtains on the windows and fluorescent lights kept on 24-hours a day.They say they slept on a single bed, and were not allowed any reading or writing materials. Guards were always in the room watching their every move, even when they used the bathroom."There's nothing to look at except some very beige-looking suicide padding on the wall," said Dahlin.He described being so bored he almost looked forward to the daily interrogations, "because at least you're taken out to another room ... and have some kind of interaction with people."The interrogators used methods which Dahlin said reminded him of "bad American movies.""They would have lots of people rush into your cell at night surrounding your bed just trying to scare you," he said.Just months earlier, Sui says he was held at a police training facility in Guangzhou, the free-wheeling hub of China's manufacturing heartland where he worked as a human rights lawyer defending a number of high-profile activists.He says interrogators accused him of inciting subversion and pressed him to give them details ranging from his personal life and finances, to his work, clients, and all of his contacts.Initially he refused to answer the questions, but his resistance only made his interrogators push harder. "They wouldn't let me sleep for four days and nights. By the fifth day, I felt like I was going to die," he said.Sui said it was the sleep deprivation plus threats of torture which ultimately broke his will and made him cooperate. He said investigators threatened to shackle his hands, hang him from the ceiling and shine a flashlight directly into his eyes."I knew someone who had a heart attack due to deprivation of sleep in jail, so I was a bit frightened my life could be at risk if I continued to fight back," he said.Chen, a professor who advocated for a US-style jury system in China on his blog, was first accused of "picking quarrels and provoking troubles," -- a vague charge often used by Chinese authorities that can carry a 10-year prison sentence. He told CNN he refused to admit any wrongdoing during a 20-hour interrogation, but then found himself sharing a jail cell with inmates accused of crimes ranging from petty theft to murder."The cell was so crammed I had to ask other prisoners to make room so I could urinate and defecate," he said. "I didn't have a spoon or chopsticks to eat with. We'd get one scoop of rice and would have to eat it with our hands."After a month, Chen said he was told to collect his belongings. He thought he was going home -- but instead was driven to what appeared to be an abandoned hotel and held for another 10 days.Earlier this year, CNN visited the nondescript building where Chen said he was held in Guilin, a southern city famed for its stunning landscape of karst mountains. Signs posted around the area in Chinese and English marked it as military property, but it otherwise appeared open and accessible.Local officials denied that the building was used as a secret detention center.'You have to confess'The rights activists held captive weren't just concerned about their own well being. They say their loved ones were also threatened.Dahlin's interrogators made it clear that they'd keep his girlfriend, a Chinese national, in custody for as long as it took to resolve his case."She was taken hostage just to put pressure on me," he said. Dahlin asked about his girlfriend every day but got limited answers."They said she was being treated quite well. That she was being given yoghurt and fruit and things like that. She was allowed to make a few drawings and do yoga in her room," he said. "They knew she had nothing to give them."Finally, after more than three weeks, Dahlin was told he was going to be released -- but he had to do one thing: confess on camera.He said he knew what authorities were really going to do with it. But wanting to speed up his release -- and that of his girlfriend -- Dahlin agreed to play his part.He was taken into a room where a woman from state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) was sitting with a cameraman. Dahlin was handed a piece of paper with the questions that she would ask and the answers he would give."I have caused harm to the Chinese government. I have hurt the feelings of the Chinese people. I apologize sincerely for this," Dahlin said in the confession broadcast nationwide and splashed across state-run newspapers.Immediately after its broadcast activists denounced it as a forced confession -- one of many that have been shown on CCTV in the years since Xi came to power.Sui and Chen said they had to make similar "confessions." All three men now maintain their innocence, but they said they had no choice but to do as authorities wanted.Sui says he admitted to charges of inciting subversion. Chen told CNN he confessed to charges of picking quarrels and provoking troubles, inciting subversion and embezzlement."You have to confess," Chen said. "Otherwise they won't let you go."No end in sightThe crackdown on lawyers is still taking place.On Tuesday, a court in Changsha, central China sentenced human rights lawyer Jiang Tianyong to two years in prison after convicting him of inciting subversion against the state.In August, he had confessed in a trial that was streamed live online and watched by his wife Jin Bianling in California."He used to tell me, if I ever admit to a crime like this, it means I've been tortured," Jin said.Jiang was a prominent human rights lawyer who had represented some of his colleagues targeted in the 709 crackdown, and was an outspoken critic of the government. He disappeared in November 2016, en route to catching a train from the central city of Changsha to Beijing. Months went by before the authorities confirmed he had been detained."Please give me another chance to be a human being ... and to make up for my wrongdoings," Jiang told a panel of three judges at his August trial.Albert Ho, a Hong Kong-based activist with the China Human Rights Lawyer Concern Group, said Jiang, like other lawyers his group has spoken to, likely admitted to the charges in order to live to fight another day."Only an idiot would believe that he is truly speaking from his heart," Ho said.Sleeping with a knifeSix days after his "confession" was broadcast on CCTV, Dahlin was released and expelled from China. His girlfriend was also released without charge.Dahlin is now based in Thailand, but has trouble forgetting his time in detention."Early on it was quite extreme. Every little noise at night would wake me up. I'd sleep with a knife next to my bed, ready to stab the first Chinese person who comes into my gate," he said.Wang Yu, the first lawyer detained in the 709 crackdown, was charged with subversion, while her husband was charged with inciting subversion. They were both released on bail after more than a year in custody, after Wang's taped confession was aired on CCTV.In it, Wang renounced her legal work and blamed "foreign forces" for using her law firm to undermine and discredit the government. Their son, who was detained along with them, was released soon afterward, but his movements have been heavily restricted.Authorities never aired Chen's statement. He was released a day after recording it and the charges against him were dropped."I have no criminal record, but they can still use the video to discredit me," he said.Chen and his family now live in US, where he's a visiting scholar at the University of California's Hastings Law School and studies the US jury system. He said he won't return to China until it becomes more democratic.Sui was released on bail after his "confession," which was also never broadcast. He continues to practice law in Guangzhou, but said his movements have been restricted and fears the worst may still be yet to come."It's increasingly difficult to maintain a harmonious society through brainwashing," Sui said."The only resort left is violence. For anyone who's not submissive, a brutal crackdown is on the way."Load-Date: December 4, 2017End of Document

How China plans to beat the U.S. at technologyCNNMoney.comNovember 6, 2017 Monday 9:05 PM ESTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHNOLOGYLength: 778 wordsByline: Sherisse PhamBodyPresident Trump has made technology a key battleground in U.S. relations with China.He launched an investigation into alleged Chinese theft of U.S. intellectual property earlier this year. But some experts say a bigger concern is Beijing's huge bets on the technologies of the future.The Chinese government is throwing its weight behind sectors like artificial intelligence, electric cars and computer chips, pumping in money to create tech champions with global clout.Western companies have already raised concerns about the plans, warning they may give Chinese companies an unfair edge at home and abroad. Some analysts have called for the U.S. to ramp up spending on technology research in order to keep pace.As Trump prepares to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping this week, here's a look at some of the key areas where China is giving the U.S. a run for its money.Artificial intelligenceRussian President Vladimir Putin recently predicted that whoever becomes the leader in artificial intelligence "will become the ruler of the world."China wants to be that leader. It laid out its plan this summer to become an artificial intelligence superpower by 2030.The country's AI industry has "government support that most other countries don't really have," said John Choi, an analyst who covers Chinese internet companies for Daiwa Capital Markets. "The level of funding is not even comparable to most other nations."The Chinese government's 2030 plan aims to build a domestic AI industry worth nearly $150 billion."China leads in the area for the simple reason -- it's a government push," said Chwee Kan Chua, global research lead for artificial intelligence with research firm IDC.China is pouring resources into intelligent video. The sector is developing "smart" cameras that can detect unusual patterns and flag them to officials or law enforcement. It shows how China's ruling Communist Party can brush aside privacy issues in order to gather tons of footage to fuel AI research.In the name of public safety, the Chinese government "will have cameras everywhere in every single corner that can track movements, objects and people so it can build huge database analytics to train artificial intelligence," Chua said.The push isn't just coming from the public sector. Like their U.S. rivals, Chinese tech giants Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent are investing heavily in AI and setting up research centers in the U.S.Electric carsThere's a reason why Tesla is eager to have a manufacturing plant in China. The country has the world's largest market for electric vehicles, thanks to years of generous tax credits and government subsidies.China's efforts are yielding results for its homegrown industry. Domestic companies are among the leading makers of electric vehicles in the world, and Chinese consumers are increasingly interested in buying them.Beijing is doubling down on the industry. The country's "Made in China 2025" plan calls for domestically produced hybrid vehicles and electric cars to account for at least 70% of total sales by 2025.Major global automakers like Volkswagen and Ford have recently announced plans to develop electric cars in China with local partners, bringing their technological know-how into the country.The government is also building a nationwide network of public charging stations. The number of outlets stood at 150,000 at the end of last year and authorities aim to add another 100,000 this year, according to state media.In the U.S., meanwhile, the tax reform bill wending its way through Congress would kill a federal tax credit of as much as $7,500 for Americans who buy an electric car.Computer chipsChina is far and away the biggest buyer of semiconductors, the computer chips used in everything from iPhones to automobiles. It consumed nearly 60% of the $354 billion global semiconductor market in 2015, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.But the U.S. has the largest semiconductor industry, with U.S.-based companies accounting for about half of the global market, according to research from the Semiconductor Industry Association.If Beijing has its way, that will soon change.The Chinese government has set out ambitious targets, pledging billions of dollars to help develop a globally competitive semiconductor industry.After it twice tried to invest in U.S. semiconductor companies -- and was twice blocked -- state-backed company Tsinghua Unigroup secured $22 billion from Chinese government investors to help it build China's first advanced memory chip factories.The U.S. Department of Commerce has flagged China's ambitions as "a real long-term threat to not only U.S. firms but the entire global semiconductor ecosystem."Load-Date: November 9, 2017End of Document

China Losing Freedom in Every AspectTargeted News ServiceSeptember 27, 2017 Wednesday 8:31 PM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1161 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyInternational Christian Concern issued the following news release:The Chinese government is gearing up for the five-yearly Party Congress, which is less than a month away. The 19th Party Congress will provide a venue for Chinese President Xi Jinping to reshuffle the members of his Politburo Standing Committee, the government's highest decision making body, and showcase the consolidation of power that he has prioritized with in the past five years. Beijing is on high alert and wants no accident for the sake of "maintaining stability." The price of that, however, is a crackdown on freedom and human rights, starting months ago and leading up to the most important meeting in the country.China's internet is already heavily censored and its notorious firewall cuts off access to websites of the free world. Several liberal Chinese websites and magazines that provide political analysis were shut down last year. Their public profiles on WeChat, the Chinese equivalent of WhatsApp or Line, can no longer be found. Recent measures to further clamp down on internet freedom include banning virtual private networks (VPN), commanding WeChat chat group owners to monitor chat messages or else they will face charges, arresting netizens who nicknamed Xi to "Steamed bun Xi" or "Xitler," and restricting the use of the encrypted messaging app WhatsApp.In addition, a number of Chinese news and entertainment programs have been banned, so as to "better welcome the major propaganda period of the 19th Party Congress" and "uphold a strong and comprehensive political view," according to the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film, and Television (SARFT).Accusing the West of attempting to infiltrate the country with Western ideologies and "subversive" ideas, the Chinese government demands that education institutions shun textbooks that promote Western values, while also sacking a few outspoken scholars. Academics were further offended last month when Chinese State Council Information Office requested that Cambridge University block online access in China to hundreds of articles and book reviews in the China Quarterly, a leading academic journal on Chinese studies that has existed for decades.The crackdown on human rights activists and lawyers continues as Beijing seeks to silence any potential anti-government speeches and protests. Many vocal advocates have disappeared or were arrested even after the 709 lawyer repression in 2015. Gao Zhisheng, a Christian human rights lawyer who is called the "Conscience of China," is among the several prominent dissidents who were recently abducted or detained by the government. No details were given by the government about their arrests or charges. Under the government's custody, they often endure torture and receive threats against their family.Religious freedom, though enshrined in Article 36 of the Chinese constitution, is not respected in the country. The government harasses, arrests, detains, and tortures faith practitioners who are deemed to be "non-patriotic" or "threats to the government." The underground Church suffers various degrees of persecution, from cross removal, service disruption, detention of church leaders, to false sentencing of Christians. Muslims, especially Uyghur Muslims, face discrimination and constant harassment by the government. In its latest attempt to Sinicize the Turkic-speaking ethnic group, the Chinese government has brought tens of thousands of Han people into Xinjiang. Heavy military surveillance and the ban of religious symbols have also been put into place in the region to suppress religious expression. Tibetan Buddhism suffers as well, with monks and nuns at Sichuan's Larung Gar Buddhist Academy witnessing the destruction of their center and thousands of residences.On top of that, recently published regulations of religious affairs, set to come into effect next February, further tighten the state's control of religion. Hefty fines are imposed for unregistered religious groups for their activities. Religious education not vetted by the government is banned. Online discussion of religious matters, the financing of religious groups, and religious venues, among other things, are subject to government oversight.Yang Fenggang, founding director of the Centre on Religion and Chinese Society at Purdue University, believes that "the government aims to increase control of religion. While in their eyes different religions have different problems, for Christianity and Islam, they seek to bring foreign religions under their control." He adds that the regulations "clearly target house church and Catholic churches. They want to push underground church into joining respective patriotic associations, namely the Three Self Patriotic Movement and China Christian Council. Government will impose heavy punishment on religious groups outside of patriotic associations."There are still six months before the regulations come into effect, yet cases of church persecution have begun to pop up. Across the country, Christian Sunday schools were shut down, a Christian academy was banned from teaching children, house churches have to meet in small groups to avoid police crackdown, leaders of house churches were forced to provide information of their members, and cross removals have reached Henan province for the first time.Pastor Wang Yi, a house church pastor in Sichuan who has been detained and harassed numerous times, responding to the new regulations, said, "I encourage every Christian who is faithful to the Gospel and every church that submits to Christ's authority to prepare themselves - for the sake of Gospel and conscience, while respecting and submitting to government's rights of law enforcement, peacefully resisting this set of evil regulations that are anti-Christ and unconstitutional, not taking part in this evil that is against faith and violating constitutional rights, willingly bear losses of benefits and physical harm. Also, I urge Christians who work in the field of law, politics, public interest, and education, to either courageously speak out, or silently promote the abolishment or changes to these illegal decrees."While one might feel uneasy and hopeless about China's treatment of its citizens, and are unsure whether or not these 'stability-maintaining' measures will loosen up after the Party Congress, Chinese civil society continues to resist and speak out. Dissidents and human rights lawyers did not cease to update the world about the latest government's human rights abuse, netizens are getting creative in their attempts to censure the government, and Christians in China, despite facing punishment for practicing their faith, continue to stand firm in their faith. Prayers are critically needed for this rising power in Asia, so that people will have the strength to persevere in times like this and hopefully taste true freedom one day.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6008550 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: September 28, 2017End of Document

SECRETARY RICHARDSON ON THE JOB IN CHINAStates News ServiceNovember 7, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 1042 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: SALEM, Ore. BodyThe following information was released by the Oregon Secretary of State:When I ran for office, I made a commitment to focus on the role of Oregon's Corporations Division. When most people think of the Corporations Division, they think it's the place you go just to register a business. But in a diverse and global economy, it's time to enhance that reputation. My goal in the coming years is to grow the Corporations Division into a strategic ally of Oregon's entrepreneurs and innovators, and with that goal comes a broader vision for how the Secretary of State's office can help Oregon's economy thrive.In September, I announced I would be participating in a November Trade Mission to China. I'm committed to being the best Secretary of State I can be, and when one quarter of my job description as Secretary of State is dedicated to serving Oregon's business community, I will work hard to open up opportunities for Oregon's job creators.During my many years in the legislature, I was honored to organize 10 legislative delegations to China, which resulted in connecting Oregon businesses to new markets. As Secretary of State, I hope to make an even bigger impact. So, let's talk trade.Tianjin, China is Oregon's "sister-city/state." It is located south-east of Beijing, has a population of 15.5 million, and is connected to Beijing by a state-of-the-art, 200 mph bullet train.Oregon has been invited to display Oregon products in the new China-Tianjin International Sister City Pavilion. Tianjin is providing 1,000 square feet of pavilion space at no cost for three years. This e-Commerce platform is the result of years of focused effort by Jin Lan, President of Oregon-China Sister State Relations Council (OCSSRC). The international exposure for Oregon products means our businesses will have a chance to begin exporting or to increase their exports to Chinese consumers via the internet.China is Oregon's number one export destination, and there are millions of Chinese consumers who will buy Oregon products if they have the chance to learn about them. For Oregon's small and medium size businesses, introducing their products at the China-Tianjin International Sister City Pavilion is an opportunity that must not be squandered.When Oregon companies are successful in the global marketplace, their businesses grow and create new jobs for Oregon workers. Access to the Pavilion puts millions of new customers within reach of Oregon businesses.Resulting from the Municipal Government of Tianjin's unique relationship as Oregon's sister-city/state, Tianjin increasingly has shown an interest in collaborative business partnerships with Oregon. Since it is a sign of respect and mutual friendship for Oregon to attend the opening of Tianjin's multi-million dollar e-Commerce Pavilion, and since Governor Brown told the Chinese Consul General that she would be unable to travel to China this year, Tianjin sent a letter of invitation to me requesting that I lead an Oregon delegation to Tianjin's e-Commerce Pavilion celebration. Although it is preferable for a Governor to represent a state at international trade events, when a Governor is unable to attend important events, it is customary for other high-ranking elected officials to participate. In most states, that role is filled by the Lt. Governorthe elected official who is second in line. In states like Oregon that do not have a Lt. Governor, that role is filled by the Secretary of State. Therefore, I will be leading this year's delegation from Oregon to China. Here is the itinerary for the November 8-20 delegation []nd the list of the those traveling](http://sos.oregon.gov/Documents/list-ocssrc-2017-china-trade-mission-beijing.pdf) with me.In addition to Tianjin and Beijing, the delegation will travel to Fujian, China, our longest-standing sister state dating back to 1984 when Governor Vic Atiyeh signed accords with Fujian's governor. In Fujian, we will be discussing a proposal for a 2018 Oregon-China International Conference on Culture, Education, Investment, and Tourism. Oregon-based Clear Water Institute will discuss with Fujian's Environmental Department how Oregon expertise and products can benefit this booming Chinese province.While in Beijing, I'll be meeting with 1) the Chinese Minister of Culture to discuss the Oregon Shakespeare Festival and 2) the Chinese Minister of Commerce to discuss streamlining Oregon business in China and encouraging Chinese investment in Oregon to create more jobs here at home.Deepening Relations:Relationships are an important part of Chinese culture, and having the opportunity to meet face-to-face with their Chinese counterparts will be an invaluable networking and business development opportunity for the small business delegation traveling with me. They will have the chance to meet Chinese consumers, distributors, and government officials. Because our Chinese hosts value family participation, two of my grandsons will accompany me at their own expense.This trip will be my 12th official delegation to China, and represents another link in a deeply-forged relationship between Oregon and China. Since 2002, more than 40 legislators, both Republicans and Democrats, as well as many of their spouses and children, have invested their own time and money to help build trust and bipartisan support with the Chinese government and to promote the message that Oregon is open for business with China.As has been the case with all of the delegations since 2002, the host country will cover much of the in-country expenses. Although state funds are often used to pay for flights to and from trade missions, I will be personally paying for my travel to China. In short, no part of this year's delegation expenses will be paid with Oregon tax dollars.As your Secretary of State, I will do all I can to make Oregon's finest products attractive and available to consumers around the world. To China's millions of middle-class consumers who want to buy great American products, our message is to not just "Buy American," but to "Buy Oregon's Very Best." By focusing the Corporations Division on helping develop local businesses and promoting Oregon-made goods to markets at home and abroad, our economy wins!Sincerely,Dennis RichardsonLoad-Date: November 8, 2017End of Document

China's Tech Giants Rise on the Back of World's Worst Online OppressionRealMoneyNovember 16, 2017 Thursday 11:00 AM EDTCopyright 2017 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1227 wordsByline: Alex McMillanHighlight: Investors must consider the power that rests behind China's BATS, the mainland's most-influential companies. While they are private, there is state power behind their tech empires that should not be ignored.BodyThe supercharged growth of China's Internet darlings has propelled Alibaba  , Tencent  and China Mobile  into the top 10 in terms of the largest tech companies in the world. But it is a rise laced with irony.China is the world's worst violator of online freedom, and it works very hard at it.That much was confirmed with the  from the advocacy group Freedom House. China is dead last as the worst abuser of digital rights and access on the planet, an ignominy it has suffered for three years in a row.It's worse even than Syria and Ethiopia, war-torn countries where democracy is a pipe dream. But of course, communist China is a dictatorship, where the people also have little say in the government, let's not forget.The BATS, as the Chinese internet giants are collectively known, comprise search engine Baidu  , e-commerce giant Alibaba, mobile-gaming industry leader Tencent, and microblogging operator Sina  , parent of the Sina Weibo site. You'd have to add JD.com  , China's second-largest online marketplace behind Alibaba, to the mix, too.That's the Google  , Amazon  , Netflix  (if we conflate movies with digital games) and Twitter  of China, and increasingly Asia. But by expanding into online-payment platforms and everything from Big Data to self-driving cars, the Chinese counterparts are going far beyond the U.S. companies they were once accused of copying.Investors need to consider the social and political implications of investments in those companies. China's authoritarian government is never far from the conversation when it comes to business, and that's even truer for companies in the sensitive area of tech. The Internet is fine in China, like most things, when it's for commerce. When it's for expression, or satire or politics, think again.The country scores a perfectly bad 40 out of 40 in terms of violations of user rights online, in the Freedom House ranking. Limits on content are also very poorly rated, and obstacles to access fare only slightly better.Chinese President Xi Jinping personally heads the Central Leading Group for Internet Security and Informatization, the group charged with shaping China's digital future. He has championed China's "cyberspace sovereignty," imposing borders on an Internet that really doesn't have them.In his capacity as Censor.com in Chief, he has summoned the heads of Alibaba, Baidu, phone makers Huawei Technologies and Xiaomi, and others to meetings alongside government Internet censors and military cybersecurity sleuths,  . Earlier this year, Xi is said to have called Alibaba founder Jack Ma and Tencent founder Pony Ma for a conflab to remind them who holds ultimate power in China -- no matter the size of their corporate empires. Through their payment systems Alipay and Tenpay, not to mention Tencent's multipurpose chat app WeChat, the companies have exerted ever-greater influence in China. But their reach expands only as far as the government allows.That much became clear this September. The mainland government imposed its maximum fine under existing cybersecurity laws on Tencent, Baidu and Sina Weibo for failing to supervise content on their sites adequately. The fines, which the government did not disclose, likely hit the 500,000 yuan ($75,000) max under the existing law. While that's a faction of the revenues of any of the companies, Chinese law can change overnight. Licensing, too. The tech companies have been treated with kid gloves compared with influential, but controversial bloggers. Huang Qi, the founder of the human-rights Website 64 Tianwang, was detained in December 2016 and later charged with providing state secrets to foreigners. Since even the birthdays of top generals have been considered state secrets in the past -- they suggest when an official or top brass might approach retirement -- the charge is not a hard one to make stick. Yet President Donald Trump made scant mention of human rights on his recent trip to China, where he appeared to have a pally and mutually respectful relationship with his counterpart Xi. Both men are popular in China -- the patriarchal type of powerfully connected man who gains a lot of respect in a society that reveres, even worships, its elders.China returned the favor by calling his quick trip to Beijing a "state visit-plus," complete with a sunset tour of the Forbidden City. Trump has said that "some people" might call Xi the "king of China," and the location of their opera show and dinner in the home of the former emperors appeared to reinforce that point.There's no doubt Xi is the most-powerful leader of the country since Chairman Mao Zedong. Xi Jinping Thought is enshrined in the Communist Party constitution. Pictures of the president adorn walls left, right and center.The cult of personality continues online.The Great Firewall of China is famous for suppressing access to all kinds of overseas and potentially insidious information. YouTube, Wikipedia, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, even paparazzi site Lazygirls.info ... you can forget about ogling Cats of Instagram or Miley Cyrus anytime soon in Shanghai. Trump would even be unable to tweet.The Communist Party goes far beyond simply banning objectionable material (sorry, Miley!). Fighting a war on information in the tech age seems to me like a battle you're eventually going to lose. But the Beijing leadership veers well into the realm of propaganda and thought control in its efforts to bolster patriotism and unswerving loyalty to the party in its citizens. The Chinese government pumps out 488 million fake social-media posts every year, according to a study headed by Harvard University data scientist Gary King. The government pays the equivalent of $0.08 for people who post comments cheerleading for China, talking about the Communist Party's revolutionary history, or supporting the regime. They're known as the "50-Cent Army," paid 50 fan, or Chinese cents, for each post.Investors should therefore consider carefully when they invest in the BATS. Although they themselves are not state-owned enterprises, China is working out how to ensure they grow within the graces of the party.U.S. tech companies have already concentrated power in surprisingly few hands. Google and fellow Action Alerts PLUS charity portfolio holding Facebook  currently corner 63% of all U.S. digital-advertising revenue, which itself is rising as a fraction of the overall advertising pie. But they are also "parasitic" on the information that they enable others to share on their networks, as Martin Wolf wrote in a column for the Financial Times.They can become "highly efficient disseminators of non-information," Wolf noted. That fact and the ability to be used "by people of ill will for the deliberate dissemination of dangerous falsehoods," he added, "raise huge issues."Wolf concluded that our futures are "too important to be left to the mercies of the technology industry alone." Although tech has done "magical" things, "nobody elected it master of the universe."Nobody elected the Chinese government either, and it appears to have taken a much more progressive, if not aggressive, stance on corralling the medium of the Internet. Investors have booked great gains in stocks like Tencent, which has more than doubled this year. But when they take profits, socially conscious investors also need to consider the manner in which they came.Load-Date: November 17, 2017End of Document

Latest IDC Report Identifies the Most Secure Cloud Service Providers in China for 2017Targeted News ServiceAugust 23, 2017 Wednesday 1:27 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1012 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: BEIJING BodyInternational Data Corp., a provider of market intelligence and advisory services, issued the following news release:China's cloud service providers should beef up their security ecosystem as building capacities and managed security service is set to become a new growth area in the increasingly challenging area of security, according to IDC's latest report titled IDC MarketScape: China Cloud Service Provider Security 2017 Vendor Assessment.China's public cloud computing market expanded 54 percent in 2016 from a year earlier as more and more enterprises started to deploy their business to the public cloud, IDC data showed, indicating that the market has been gaining momentum. However, recently enterprises are increasingly becoming the targets of hackers as the digital transformation boosts their digital asset value, making security a major concern for public cloud service tenants.The report provides an in-depth assessment of the cloud environments of 11 representative cloud service providers in the China region where IDC identified leading cloud services in the China region for 2017 including: Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud, AWS, Azure, Huawei Cloud and Kingsoft Cloud.The assessment report covers three aspects: security capability, security strategy and security input. The assessment results are presented in graphic form based on the IDC MarketScape model.The report highlights the following three points:Cloud Service Providers are Facing Unprecedented Security ChallengesDigital transformation has linked enterprises' business security closely with IT security, resulting in a big increase in enterprises' digital asset value. This has also attracted the interest of criminals and hackers, posing a huge threat to enterprises' digital assets. In May 2017, the WannaCry blackmail virus once again sounded the alarm bell, attesting to the fact that a considerable number of enterprises urgently need to improve the security of their IT systems. As public cloud tenants generally lack the ability to build security in a cloud environment, therefore cloud service providers have an unshakable responsibility to safeguard their cloud tenants' business security. Thus, cloud service providers are facing unprecedented security challenges.IT Security Requires a Concerted Effort by the State, Cloud Service Providers and Cloud TenantsIT security systems must be built with the strong support and close supervision of the government. The Chinese government has elevated the importance of cyberspace security to the level of national security, though cloud service providers also bear an unprecedented level of responsibility when it comes to security. It is essential that cloud service providers play the role of managed security service provider (MSSP) to help their tenants build secure IT systems. For cloud tenants, the only way to foster their strengths, circumvent their weaknesses, and use the capabilities provided by cloud service providers to strengthen the security of their IT systems is to raise their own security awareness and forge in-depth cooperation with cloud service providers.Cloud Service Providers Need to Strengthen Security Ecosystem BuildingIt is widely known that the security capabilities offered by cloud service providers have much room for improvement. In order to learn from others' strong points to bolster their own weak links and win tenants' unanimous recognition of their security strength, cloud service providers must engage in in-depth cooperation and close collaboration with professional IT security vendors through security ecosystem building. Building a complete security ecosystem will provide more reliable technical support for cloud service providers and their tenants."Implementation of the Cyberspace Security Law of the People's Republic of China means that cloud service providers now bear even greater security responsibilities. Cloud security capability enhancement will become one of the important strategies for cloud service providers in the future," said James Wang, Senior Research Manager at IDC China."In addition, as enterprises generally lack security planning and building abilities, they will have an urgent need for managed security service in building next-generation security systems. Globally, the managed security service model has been widely accepted by enterprises, while China's managed security service market is still in its early stages. Drawing upon their sound security ecosystem and rich security experience, public cloud service providers in China can provide managed security services to their large number of cloud tenants. Consequently, cloud service providers will be most likely to become the best practitioners of managed security services," Wang said.[Special Note] Since China set up the Central Leading Group for Network Affairs in 2014, the importance of cyberspace security has risen to the height of national strategy. Following the release of Cyberspace Security Law of the People's Republic of China, the National Cyberspace Security Strategy and other related laws, regulations and policies in recent years, security and trustworthiness have become key to enterprise-level users' IT system building. For important sectors and fields such as public communications, information services, energy, transportation, water conservancy, finance, public service and e-government, it is more important to ensure a secure and trustworthy key information infrastructure. As a result, enterprise security building standards in China feature distinctive Chinese characteristics. The assessment criteria in this study are formulated using IDC's research methodology and are in strict accordance with China's cyberspace security characteristics in an attempt to present the status of security of public cloud services in China in a fair and just manner.Document provided to Targeted News Service as a news release through an RSS feed.Contact: Zhenshan Zhong, zzhong@idc.com; Maggie Xie, mxie@idc.com; James Wang, jwang@idc.comCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-5967730 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: August 24, 2017End of Document

World's oldest publisher reverses 'shameful' China censorshipCNNMoney.comAugust 21, 2017 Monday 1:12 PM ESTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: MEDIALength: 595 wordsByline: Charles RileyBodyCambridge University Press has reversed a decision to censor hundreds of articles at the request of the Chinese government after a backlash from academics and activists.The university press, which describes itself as the oldest publishing house in the world, had admitted to blocking online access in China to academic works on Tiananmen Square, the Cultural Revolution and Tibet.The University of Cambridge said in a statement on Monday that its academic leadership and the publisher had agreed to reinstate the blocked content "with immediate effect" to "uphold the principle of academic freedom."The censored academic articles appeared in the highly regarded journal China Quarterly. Its editor, Tim Pringle, said the reversal followed a "justifiably intense reaction from the global academic community and beyond.""Access to published materials of the highest quality is a core component of scholarly research," he said in a statement on Monday. "It is not the role of respected global publishing houses ... to hinder such access."The decision to censor the articles drew condemnation from academics around the world.It represented "a craven, shameful and destructive concession" to the Chinese government's "growing censorship regime," Georgetown University professor James Millward wrote in an open letter published over the weekend.By Monday, an online petition threatening a boycott of the publisher and its journals had gathered hundreds of signatures.The not-for-profit publisher had defended its action as necessary to ensure that China doesn't block "entire collections of content." It said it would never proactively censor its own content.But many prominent academics blasted the move."Chinese students and scholars reading a censored version of The China Quarterly will encounter only historical facts and scholarly analyses approved by political authorities," Greg Distelhorst of MIT and Jessica Chen Weiss of Cornell wrote in a letter to Cambridge University Press."This censored history of China will literally bear the seal of Cambridge University," they said.The Cambridge press, which has been operating since the reign of Queen Elizabeth I in the 16th century, has run into a challenge faced by other global publishers: obey China's censors or be locked out of its giant market.Foreign authors who wish to publish books in China must allow their works to be altered by censors. Top news organizations like The New York Times have had their websites blocked in China for years after publishing articles that upset the ruling Communist Party."Western institutions have the freedom to choose," said an English-language opinion article published Sunday by Global Times, a provocative but state-sanctioned Chinese tabloid. "If they don't like the Chinese way, they can stop engaging with us. If they think China's internet market is so important that they can't miss out, they need to respect Chinese law and adapt to the Chinese way."China's General Administration of Press and Publication, a regulatory body, didn't respond to requests for comment Monday.Submitting to Beijing's demands was "a misguided, if understandable, economic decision that does harm to the Press' reputation and integrity," said Jonathan Sullivan, director of the China Policy Institute at the University of Nottingham."This is not the first time Beijing has leveraged the economic power of the Chinese market for political gains," he wrote in a blog post. "The fear is that it won't be the last time that Western academia is the target."-- Serena Dong contributed to this report.Load-Date: August 22, 2017End of Document

Blackstone Buys Back Into Logicor as It Plays Nice With BeijingRealMoneyDecember 13, 2017 Wednesday 9:11 AM EDTCopyright 2017 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 596 wordsByline: Alex McMillanHighlight: The decision by a Blackstone fund to buy 10% of Logicor shows how much the Chinese government values its relationship with the world's largest private equity investor.BodyIn a strange turnabout, Blackstone Group LP  is buying back part of a business it recently sold. In June, Blackstone, the world's largest private equity manager, sold the warehouse operator Logicor to the China Investment Corp., or CIC, for €12.25 billion ($14.4 billion).Now Blackstone's newly raised €2 billion European fund is buying back 10% of Logicor, which runs warehouses in Europe. It makes sense since that's a new fund with a new investment agenda, time horizon and money to put to work.But the deal says more about the potentially friendly nature of an allegiance with the Chinese government's money men than any strategic uncertainty.This deal also makes sense because it shows how chummy Blackstone is with the Chinese government. The CIC, China's sovereign wealth fund, invited Blackstone back into Logicor, according to the Financial Times, alongside several other investors.Several insurers are also reportedly considering climbing on board. CIC now has 150 million square feet of warehouse space in Europe, at a vacancy rate of just 7%.The CIC already sold 10% of its warehouse portfolio in Europe, including Logicor, to a subsidiary of the Chinese insurance giant China Reinsurance Group, or China Re HK:1508. That deal was struck for €579 million ($680 million) in cash, so presumably the Blackstone fund has come to a similar valuation, although the price of the new investment has not been disclosed.The CIC has also hired Blackstone to manage Logicor's portfolio, the FT says, citing sources briefed on the transaction.  of the 10% stake, although Blackstone has declined to officially comment.Blackstone has a recent history working alongside not just the CIC but also other major Chinese conglomerates that have been active overseas such as Anbang Insurance and HNA - although both of those private groups are rethinking their international strategies, faced with greater scrutiny from the Chinese government over their purchases and in particular sources of funding.Blackstone has a real estate portfolio of around $200 billion. It carved Logicor out of its holdings in 2012 to manage and operate its logistics operations and warehouses in Europe.Blackstone's real estate team is also pally with Singapore Inc. In December 2014, it sold the logistics company IndCor Properties for $8.1 billion to Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, known simply as GIC, and Global Logistics Properties  , a warehouse operator backed by the Singapore government.Logistics investments make sense because real estate assets the world over have reached inflated levels thanks to the easy central bank money sloshing around the system. That has brought yields to very low levels for many real estate sectors, and made the "core" buildings that major institutional investors value as central parts of their portfolios virtually impossible to come by at a reasonable price. Warehouse space, benefitting from the boom in e-commerce, churns out predictable cold cash at a regular rate.Here in Hong Kong, where there is no capital gains tax on property and no restrictions on moving money in and out of the city, our real estate prices have reached record levels and appear set to build on that. That makes developer stocks here an attractive proposition.In Hong Kong, warehouse space looks set to build on this year's 10% gain with another advance of 0 to 5%, according to the commercial real estate brokerage Savills. "Flatted factories" - multi-storey industrial buildings with cargo lifts - have risen 8% in 2017 and will also likely add another 5% or so gain in value in 2018.Load-Date: December 14, 2017End of Document

9 ETFs to Capture China's Red-Hot GrowthUSNEWS.comAugust 30, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: INVESTING; ETFs; Vol.; No.Length: 1262 wordsByline: Kyle WoodleyHighlight: Chinese markets are racing ahead in 2017.BodyInvestors should consider China.American markets are advancing at a brisk pace in 2017, but the Chinese are blowing us out of the water. While the Standard & Poor's 500 index has climbed 9 percent this year, many broad-based China equity exchange-traded funds have raced ahead by 30 to 40 percent. That's being driven by several factors, such as a global technology rally and index provider MSCI's decision to include Chinese mainland companies in its indexes. And yes, the growth of China's economy might be slowing, but GDP expansion of nearly 7 percent still makes the Middle Kingdom a highly attractive investment target. Here are nine ETFs that allow you to tap into areas of potential Chinese growth.SPDR S&P China ETF (ticker: GXC)TheiShares China Large-Cap ETF (FXI, $3.5 billion in assets under management) and the iShares MSCI China ETF (           MCHI, $2.7 billion AUM) are first-to-mind when it comes to broad            Chinese exposure. However, you can cast a wider net than both with SPDR's GXC, which at 355 holdings covers far more of China's markets than FXI (51 holdings) and MCHI (151 holdings). This SPDR ETF features a heavy dose of information technology (34.9 percent) and financial (22.4 percent) stocks, illustrated by its top 10 holdings, which include Tencent Holdings and Alibaba Group (NYSE:            BABA) at double-digit weights, followed by China Construction Bank at 4.7 percent.Expenses: 0.59 percent or $59 per $10,000 investedWisdomTree China ex-State-Owned Enterprises Fund (CXSE)WisdomTree also offers wide China exposure, but with a twist -- it excludes any company that sports a Chinese government ownership stake of more than 20 percent, "neutralizing companies potentially influenced by government decisions." The main difference is more of a consumer discretionary bent than GXC (24 percent to 11 percent), and less reliance on financials (16 percent). It also means that CXSE still is thick in China's burgeoning tech sector, with a 35 percent weighting that includes Alibaba, Tencent, web services giant Baidu (           BIDU) and e-commerce play JD.com (           JD).Expenses: 0.32 percent (includes 31-basis-point fee waiver)Deutsche X-trackers Harvest CSI 500 China A-Shares Small Cap ETF (ASHS)If you're chasing growth, you should have some exposure to small-cap stocks. While there are several options that tap into China the traditional way (via Hong Kong-traded securities), Deutsche Bank's ASHS invests in "A shares" -- companies that trade on the mainland, via either the Shanghai or Shenzhen exchanges. These stocks are believed to be more representative of China's economy, versus "H shares" that represent more international companies. No surprise, then, that ASHS has a much different look, with industrials (22.7 percent) and materials (18.7 percent) making up significant swaths of this fund, while financials are relegated to a fractional sliver.Expenses: 0.65 percentGuggenheim China Technology ETF (CQQQ)Those who believe China's technological renaissance isn't quite over would do well with Guggenheim's CQQQ -- one of a growing number of Chinese sector and industry funds. CQQQ and its basket of 72 Chinese tech stocks have put up a scorching 55 percent return year-to-date. Naturally, that performance has been led by internet darlings Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu, but investors should know CQQQ is more than just web stocks. Optical and scientific instrument maker Sunny Optical has more than tripled year-to-date, while speaker and microphone specialist AAC Technologies has "only" put up a near doubler.Expenses: 0.7 percentKraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB)China's internet industry has been the stud of 2017, and why not? That market grew 6.2 percent in 2016 to 731 million users, with 95 percent of that population accessing the internet via their phones, and the current count as of June 30 was 738 million users -- 160 percent more than the United States! KraneShares' KWEB is a laser-focused portfolio of about 30 stocks that should thrive as China's internet population swells. This includes the aforementioned big names like Alibaba and JD.com, but also online travel company Ctrip.com International (           CTRP) and online automobile listing and information outlet Autohome (           ATHM). Expenses: 0.72 percentGlobal X China Consumer ETF (CHIQ)Technology isn't the only Chinese sector that's hitting the roof this year. As the nation's economy blossoms, more money is going into the hands of both elites and a burgeoning middle class, helping to boost the fortunes of China's consumer companies. Global X's CHIQ is a dual-sector play on both discretionary and staples stocks, and like many of the firm's international plays, the portfolio is focused at under 40 holdings. Automaker Geely Automotive and private educator New Oriental Education & Technology Group (EDU) are among the ETF's heaviest weights, though the consumer angle ensures you still capture the growth of BABA and JD.Expenses: 0.65 percentGuggenheim China Real Estate ETF (TAO)China's real estate market is a constant bubble concern, and the country even suffered its first home-price decline since 2015 amid a government push to make housing more affordable. That hasn't yet dampened the spirits of anyone holding TAO -- a collection of about 60 Chinese real estate investment trusts, including Country Garden Holdings and China Evergrande. TAO and its payout, made annually, has been fairly volatile, so the yield is a moving target. Depending on when you bought, its past few payouts have ranged between 2 percent and 5 percent. Expenses: 0.7 percent (includes 45-basis-point fee waiver)KraneShares Zacks New China ETF (KFYP)Every five years, China's government outlines a series of economic initiatives and focus groups meant to shape the country for the next five years. For instance, the current "13th Plan," covering 2016 to 2020, aims to encourage updating heavy industry with more modern technology, developing green tech and opening financial markets, among other efforts. The KFYP provides all-cap exposure to areas emphasized by China's five-year plans, and it's not subtle. Tech takes up just more than half the fund's weight, while discretionaries and staples combine for roughly 30 percent. A few sectors, such as financials and materials, are outright ignored.Expenses: 0.73 percentFirst Trust Chindia ETF (FNI)Rather than hedging your bets on China by purchasing a broad emerging-markets fund, First Trust's FNI allows investors to tap two monster EMs -- China and India -- while eliminating riskier riffraff. India is an ideal complement to China at the moment, featuring a business-friendly administration and slowing but still robust 6 percent-plus GDP growth despite demonetization efforts meant to curb the country's black markets.

CHINA COURT RELEASES VIDEO OF TAIWANESE ACTIVIST CONFESSING TO SUBVERSIONStates News ServiceSeptember 11, 2017 MondayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 717 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING (Reuters) BodyThe following information was released by the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD):A Taiwanese activist on trial in China confessed on Monday to attempting to subvert the Beijing government, according to videos of his hearing released by Chinese authorities, although his wife refused to recognize the courts authority.Lee Ming-che, a community college teacher known for his pro-democracy and rights activism, went missing on a trip to mainland China in March. Chinas authorities later confirmed that he was being investigated on suspicion of damaging national security.Lee said he accepted the charge of subversion and expressed regret in videos of his comments released on social media by the Yueyang City Intermediate Peoples Court in central Hunan province.I spread some attacks, theories that maliciously attacked and defamed Chinas government, the Chinese Communist Party and Chinas current political system, and I incited the subversion of state power, Lee said, referring to comments written in an instant messaging group.Taiwans presidential office said in a news briefing on Monday afternoon that the government is engaged in an all-out effort to assist Mr. Lee Ming-che's family.His relief is our top priority. The position of this government has been very clear. Mr. Lee is one of our citizens, an office spokesman said, adding: We'll do everything in our power to ensure his safe return.Lee stood trial alongside Chinese national Peng Yuhua, 37, who confessed to creating instant messaging groups and founding an organization that sought to promote political change in China. Lee had been involved in both, Peng said in testimony released on video by the court.Taiwanese rights activist Xiao Yiming traveled to the mainland for the trial, but said he was barred from entering the courtroom.Xiao suspected Peng was being used by authorities to help strengthen the states case against Lee, as he was unaware of any previous connection between the two men.Taiwan has democratic freedoms and Lee has the right to share his ideas, Xiao told Reuters by phone, describing Lee as a prisoner of conscience.Pro-democracy protesters carry a photo of detained Taiwanese rights activist Lee Ming-Che during a demonstration in Hong Kong, China September 11, 2017. REUTERS/Bobby YipLee Ching-yu, Lees wife, attended the hearing. Before leaving for China she had asked that Lees supporters to forgive him for anything he might say that disappoints them during the hearing.She wrote a letter to her husband on Monday morning before the trial began, photographs of which were seen by Reuters.I do not recognize this court. I also did not hire any lawyers, she wrote.Lee Ching-yu, wife of Taiwan human rights advocate Lee Ming-che, who has been detained in China, speaks to the media a day before departing for her husband's trial, in Taipei, Taiwan September 9, 2017. REUTERS/Tyrone SiuAfter the hearing, she tearfully repeated her request for forgiveness and unveiled what appeared to be two new tattoos on the underside of each of her forearms that read, Lee Ming-che and I am proud of you, videos sent to Reuters showed.No one answered the court phone when called by Reuters on Monday.Releasing videos and transcripts of court hearings has become increasingly common in China as part of a push for greater judicial transparency and oversight.But rights activists say that in sensitive cases holding open trials allows authorities to demonstrate state power and deter others, with statements and verdicts usually agreed in advance.Ties between Beijing and Taipei have been strained since President Tsai Ing-wen, leader of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, took office last year.Tsais refusal to state that Taiwan and China are part of one country has angered Beijing, as have her comments about human rights on the mainland.Beijing maintains that the island of Taiwan is part of China and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control, while proudly democratic Taiwan has shown no interest in being governed by the Communist Party rulers in Beijing.Reporting by Christian Shepherd and Beijing newsroom; Additional reporting by Faith Hung in Taipei; Editing by Tony Munroe and Clarence FernandezOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0Load-Date: September 11, 2017End of Document

Chinese drone maker denies giving data to governmentAssociated Press InternationalDecember 1, 2017 Friday 10:10 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 483 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - The Chinese company that is the world's biggest maker of commercial drones is denying claims in a U.S. government document circulated online that it gives Beijing information about American law enforcement and utility companies.DJI Ltd. denied suggestions in the document, posted on technology news websites, that it shared information about U.S. utility companies and other "critical infrastructure" with the Chinese government. A company statement said it doesn't look at flight logs, photos or video "unless customers actively upload and share them with us."The dispute highlights growing concern among governments about potential risks associated with the flood of data generated by smartphones, social media and other technology. China has ordered companies to store data about its citizens within this country, which prompted Apple Inc. to announce plans in July to set up a data center in southern China.The U.S. document, citing an unidentified source in the unmanned aerial systems industry, says data from DJI drones are transmitted to computers in China to which the government might have access. The document says it was issued by the intelligence program of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Los Angeles.The American Embassy in Beijing said it had passed to ICE questions about whether the document was genuine.The agency has "moderate confidence" that DJI "is providing U.S. critical infrastructure and law enforcement data to the Chinese government," the document says. "A foreign government with access to this information could easily coordinate physical or cyber-attacks against critical sites."DJI, or Da Jiang Innovations Science and Technology Co., Ltd., was founded in 2007 by an engineer named Frank Wang and dominates the global market for remote-controlled drones used by photographers. It increasingly markets them for use in surveying or to monitor farms and industrial sites.The DJI statement said the U.S. report was based on "clearly false and misleading claims.""DJI does not send data on DJI cloud servers to the Chinese government. Nor does it allow access to such data by the Chinese government," said a company spokesman, Kevin On, in an email. "DJI is not aware of an instance in which the Chinese government has accessed user or drone data for operators determined to be in the United States."On said DJI has added features to give commercial or government users the option not to upload data to its servers or connect to the internet.The DJI statement said the company submitted a rebuttal of the report to the ICE. It urged the agency to consider whether its source "may have had a competitive or improper motive" to hurt DJI by making false claims.The U.S. military suspended use of DJI drones in August due to concern their data might not be secure. Australia's military followed suit in September.___DJI Ltd.: www.dji.comLoad-Date: December 2, 2017End of Document

CHINA COLLECTING DNA FROM ALL UYGHURS IN XINJIANG UNDER GUISE OF FREE PHYSICALSStates News ServiceDecember 13, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 1186 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Authorities are collecting DNA samples and other biometric data from all residents aged 12-65 of northwest China's Xinjiang region, which is home to more than 11 million Muslim ethnic Uyghurs, under the pretext of a free health care program, a leading human rights group said Wednesday.In a statement, New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) said that the campaign also includes the collection of fingerprints, iris scans, and blood types, and expands a program already in place that only required passport applicants in Xinjiang to provide their biodata.For all "focus personnel"those authorities consider threatening to regime stabilityand their family members, their biometrics must be taken regardless of age, HRW said.While authorities are collecting biometrics in different ways, DNA and blood types are typically being taken through a free annual physical exams program called Physicals for All, the rights group said, adding that it was unclear whether participants are informed of authorities' intention to gather, store, or use their data."Xinjiang authorities should rename their physical exams project 'Privacy Violations for All,' as informed consent and real choice does not seem to be part of these programs," said Sophie Richardson, HRW's China director."The mandatory databanking of a whole population's biodata, including DNA, is a gross violation of international human rights norms, and it's even more disturbing if it is done surreptitiously, under the guise of a free health care program."HRW said that details of the biometric scheme were detailed in an official document called "The [Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous] Region Working Guidelines on the Accurate Registration and Verification of Population," published on the government website of the seat of Aksu (in Chinese, Akesu) prefecture, adding that a notice distributing it to lower-level offices was dated July 2, 2017.According to state media reports, Xinjiang's government authorized the Population Registration Program in February 2017, saying it would be carried out "in stages." The program is meant for "scientific decision-making" that promotes poverty alleviation, better management, and "social stability."While official media reports say that participation in the Physicals for All should be voluntary, HRW cited one Uyghur who took part in the 2016 program in Kashgar (Kashi) prefecture as saying his neighborhood watch committee "demanded" residents complete the physical, adding that not doing so would be seen as a sign of "thought problem"shorthand for "political disloyalty.""China has few meaningful privacy protections and Uyghurs are already subjected to extensive degrees of control and surveillance, including heavy security presence, numerous checkpoints, and routine inspection of smartphones for 'subversive' content," Richardson said."In this context, compulsory biodata collection has particularly abusive potential, and hardly seems justifiable as a security measure."HRW said it discovered that a U.S.-based company, Thermo Fisher Scientific, had supplied the Xinjiang police force with some of the DNA sequencers it has used in its data collection, although the company has responded by saying it is "not possible for us to monitor the use or application of all products we manufactured.""Companies like Thermo Fisher Scientific that supply DNA sequencing and related equipment have a human rights responsibility to avoid contributing to governmental human rights violations," HRW's statement said Wednesday, calling on the company to investigate misuse of their products and suspend future sales or service in China pending their findings.HRW also condemned the Chinese police's searchable, nationwide DNA database, which it said contains more than 40 million entries from people, including dissidents and migrants, and allows authorities to not only search for an exact match, but also for those who are related family members, putting them at risk for discriminatory profiling."Chinese authorities seem to think they can achieve 'social stability' by placing people under a microscope, but these abusive programs are more likely to deepen hostility towards the government," Richardson said."Beijing should immediately stop these programs, and destroy all data gathered without full, informed consent."'Violation of privacy'Henryk Szadziewski, senior researcher at the Washington-based Uyghur Human Rights Project (UHRP), told RFA's Uyghur Service that HRW's report demonstrates the kind of surveillance that the Chinese government wants to implement in Xinjiang and the extent to which it will abuse people's human rights to implement it."The alarming part is the possible deception under which these samples are being collected, and even if it isn't proved that there's deception, there's certainly an environment in Xinjiang which is coercive," he said."And as we saw with the Uyghur cadres who are telling people to go to these physicals and then ultimately to submit these samples to this databasethis is a very clear violation of privacy."Szadziewski also questioned what message the government is sending by implementing the surveillance campaign."If this is done in the name of security, then we have to be concernedis everybody whose DNA has been collected now a suspect?" he questioned."So I think the state's overreach here in terms of surveillance is another area where we have to be concerned and I think that the state here is implementing a program of control which is certainly contrary to any international norms that we see."'Further persecution'Dolkun Isa, president of the Munich-based World Uyghur Congress (WUC), told RFA's Uyghur Service that there are political reasons behind China's campaign to collect biometric data in Xinjiang, where Uyghurs complain of pervasive discrimination, religious repression, and cultural suppression under Chinese rule."Firstly, China is not collecting such personal information from other ethnic groups or in other provinces," he said."Secondly, China will use the collected information to specifically single out and target the Uyghur population for further persecution in the name of so-called 'stability maintenance' and combating the 'three evils'" of terrorism, separatism, and religious extremism in Xinjiang.China regularly conducts "strike hard" campaigns in Xinjiang, including police raids on Uyghur households, restrictions on Islamic practices, and curbs on the culture and language of the Uyghur people, including videos and other material.While China blames some Uyghurs for "terrorist" attacks, experts outside China say Beijing has exaggerated the threat from the Uyghurs and that repressive domestic policies are responsible for an upsurge in violence there that has left hundreds dead since 2009."No Uyghur believes the Chinese authorities have good intentions in collecting this data from the long-suffering Uyghur people [in Xinjiang]," Isa said.Reported by Adile Ablet and Alim Seytoff for RFA's Uyghur Service.

China Commission Releases 2017 Annual ReportTargeted News ServiceOctober 6, 2017 Friday 5:58 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2433 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Randy Hultgren, R-Ill., issued the following news release:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) and U.S. Representative Chris Smith (R-NJ), Chair and Cochair of the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), today issued the Commission's 2017 Annual Report and announced several joint initiatives on Hong Kong and commemoration of the late Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, and Chinese political prisoner, Liu Xiaobo. The CECC's 2017 Annual Report provides detailed analysis on human rights conditions and rule of law developments in China, and offers recommendations on ways to integrate these issues into U.S.-China relations.The 2017 Annual Report can be found here and on the CECC's website. A letter transmitting the Annual Report to President Trump includes a summary of the report's main findings and recommendations. Letter text can be found below."The Commission's 2017 report documents continued deterioration of human rights and the rule of law in China, as President Xi Jinping consolidates power in advance of the 19th Party Congress slated for later this month," said Senator Rubio. "Chinese authorities are ruthlessly targeting human rights lawyers and advocates; clamping down on foreign NGOs, media outlets and Internet companies; restricting religious freedom particularly in ethnic minority Tibetan and Uyghur areas and forcibly repatriating North Korean refugees to near certain persecution and even death. This year the central authorities further intervened in the affairs of Hong Kong, disqualifying democratically elected legislators and jailing pro-democracy leaders. In the face of this repression, the universal desire for basic human rights persists. This report is dedicated to the late Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and political prisoner Liu Xiaobo, whose hopes for the Chinese people, articulated in his essays, poetry and ultimately Charter 08 remain aspirational. As President Trump heads to China next month, he must press China to uphold international human rights norms, respect the rule of law, and adhere to universal standards.""At the cost of American jobs and security, the Chinese government has become more repressive domestically, more protectionist in its trade policies, and more assertive globally. The Administration is going through a review of its China policy at the moment, the Annual Report has recommendations that can assist them develop strategies that link American values and interests--it should be required reading at the White House, at the State Department, and by all Members of Congress," said Smith. "Nothing good happens in the dark that is why the Administration should shine a light on the Chinese government's failures to abide by universal standards, shine a light on the cases of tortured and abused political prisoners, shine a light on China's unfair trade practices and still coercive population control policies. A freer and more democratic China is a critical U.S. interest, and it should be pursued in tandem with other U.S. diplomatic, economic, political, and security priorities."The Chairs announced their intention to work on several joint initiatives during the upcoming year including:Nomination of Hong Kong's Umbrella Movement for the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize: The Chairs stated their intention to nominate Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, Alex Chow and the entire Umbrella Movement for the prize, citing their peaceful efforts to bring political reform and protect the autonomy and freedoms guaranteed Hong Kong in the Sino-British Joint Declaration.Congressional Commemoration of Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Liu Xiaobo: The Chairs announced bicameral legislation to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Liu Xiaobo and the Chinese Democracy Movement. The CECC also announced its intention to start a "Liu Xiaobo Fellows Program."Both Chairs commended the capable and professional work of the CECC's research staff in producing the Commission's 16th Annual Report.The text of the transmittal letter accompanying the 2017 Annual Report can be found below.October 5, 2017President Donald J. TrumpThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NWWashington, DC 20500Dear Mr. President:We transmit to you the 2017 Annual Report of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (the Commission) as required by the U.S.-China Relations Act of 2000 (Public Law No: 106--286). Under this legislative mandate, the Commission monitors and reports on human rights violations and the development of the rule of law in China, and provides recommendations to address these issues in U.S.-China relations.The Commission's structure, consisting of a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators, Representatives, and senior-level Administration officials, is intended to foster cooperation between the legislative and executive branches, and promote bipartisan attention to critical issues in U.S.-China relations. In the coming year, we hope the Administration can appoint Commissioners from the Departments of State, Labor, and Commerce, as required by the Act.The Commission's Annual Report comes out on the eve of the 19th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party and prior to your upcoming visit to China. The topics covered by our Annual Report remain some of the most contentious issues in bilateral relations and are critically linked to the protection of U.S. national interests.Over the past several years, the Chinese government has become more protectionist in its trade policies, more authoritarian in domestic politics, increasingly dismissive of international norms and "Western" ideas, and more assertive in expanding its extraterritorial reach globally.The Commission's 2017 Annual Report further documents the Chinese government and Communist Party's continued efforts to silence dissent, criminalize activities of human rights lawyers, control civil society, suppress religious activity, and restrict the operations of foreign media outlets, businesses, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) over the past 12 months. The report also provides evidence that Chinese authorities arbitrarily detained and tortured political prisoners, forcibly repatriated North Korean refugees, and continued to implement coercive population control polices, in violation of China's international obligations.These issues necessitate high-level engagement from U.S. policymakers and elected officials. As your administration pursues a China policy review, we commend the Annual Report's findings and policy recommendations to your attention, as we believe they will assist in developing strategies to advance U.S. interests and maintain principled U.S. leadership on issues of human rights and development of the rule of law in the vital Asia-Pacific region.Based on developments this past year, the report identifies the following key areas that merit the focus of Congress and the Administration in the coming year:Law as an Instrument of Repression. The Chinese government continues to use the law as an instrument of repression to expand control over Chinese society, while outwardly providing the veneer of a system guided by the rule of law. In the past year, the government moved forward with implementing a series of far-reaching new laws that provided the basis for broader and more severe crackdowns on ethnic minority groups and human rights defenders, censorship of the Internet, and restrictions on foreign NGOs and international businesses that operate in or trade with China. The report recommends that the Administration seek a rules-of-the-road agreement that ensures reciprocal treatment for U.S. institutions, businesses, and nationals operating in China and urges the Administration to coordinate with allies, businesses, and NGOs to develop a unified strategy to respond to China's unfair industrial policies, digital protectionism, and the PRC Law on the Management of Overseas NGOs' Activities.Human Rights Lawyers Viewed as Security Threat. Persistent reports emerged of human rights lawyers and advocates being arbitrarily detained on state security-related charges, for which Chinese law permits officials to enforce de facto incommunicado detention. These rights lawyers and advocates are denied due process rights, tortured in detention, and forced to "confess" to crimes they did not commit. Rights lawyers and their families were subject to constant surveillance and restrictions on their freedom of movement. Pressure on the activities of human rights defenders continues to be an issue of concern. The report recommends that the Administration consider more expansive use of existing U.S. laws, such as the Global Magnitsky Act, to hold accountable Chinese officials complicit in arbitrary detentions, torture, disappearances, and other severe human rights violations. The report also urges the Administration to deny requests for repatriation of Chinese citizens accused of corruption until the Chinese government can demonstrate that it is meeting due process protections consistent with international human rights norms and has ended both torture in detention and all forms of arbitrary detention.Severe Violations of Religious Freedom. The report notes the Chinese government's efforts to expand its political influence and control over the activities of religious communities through more restrictive regulations, at both the national and local level, with particularly severe abuses occurring in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) and Tibetan autonomous areas. Efforts to shutter and harass Protestant Christian "house churches" and the demolition of renowned Tibetan Buddhist institutes of learning, Larung Gar and Yachen Gar, are particularly concerning developments. The report recommends expanded U.S. leadership on international religious freedom through coordinated multilateral efforts and bilateral interactions that stress the strategic and economic value of promoting this fundamental freedom. The report also recommends that the Administration fully implement the Tibet Policy Act of 2002 and produce guidelines for U.S.-China counterterrorism dialogues so that the United States does not condone China's crackdowns on peaceful political dissent or restrictions on the freedoms of religion or expression in ethnic minority areas.Challenges to Hong Kong's "High Degree" of Autonomy. The actions of the mainland Chinese and Hong Kong governments during the past reporting year continue to raise concerns about the long-term viability of the "one country, two systems" model. The preemptive intervention of the National People's Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC), and the subsequent disqualification of six democratically elected legislators, raised serious concerns about Hong Kong's autonomy, its guaranteed freedoms, and the rule of law. In July 2017, the Hong Kong Court of Appeals sentenced Nathan Law, the youngest of the disqualified legislators, along with fellow pro-democracy leaders Joshua Wong and Alex Chow, in connection with their activities during the 2014 pro-democracy protests. The three had already completed community service sentences when the Hong Kong Department of Justice pursued the harsher sentences, raising concerns about the political nature of these prosecutions. Given the important economic interests the United States has in Hong Kong, and China's international commitments to protect a "high degree of autonomy" in Hong Kong, the Commission recommends that the administration continue to issue annually the report on Hong Kong outlined in Section 301 of the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992. In addition, the report recommends that the Administration and Congress work together to determine how to protect U.S. interests in Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms, including through consideration of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act (S. 417 and H.R. 3856).Shining a Light on Political Prisoners. The Annual Report highlights multiple political prisoner cases, including human rights lawyers and rights defenders, citizen journalists, labor and environmental advocates, religious leaders, and advocates for ethnic minority rights, Tibetans, and Uyghurs. The Commission urges Members of Congress and the Administration to consistently and publicly advocate for political prisoners because experience demonstrates that raising individual cases can result in improved treatment, lighter sentences, and in some cases, release from custody. The report recommends that the Administration create a Special Advisor for Political and Religious Prisoners to coordinate prisoner advocacy across the entire U.S. government. The Commission maintains an extensive Political Prisoner Database as a resource, with over 1,400 cases of currently detained political prisoners in China--a staggering but far from exhaustive figure.Making Human Rights a Strategic Priority. The U.S.-China relationship is marked by both growing interdependency and competition, and the issues covered by the Annual Report are among the most contentious in our bilateral relationship. Principled U.S. leadership is needed to develop a long-term policy approach that challenges China to abide by its international commitments, adhere to universal standards, and embrace the rule of law. In addition to the recommendations made above, the report suggests a focus on reciprocity, internet freedom, human trafficking, digital protectionism, protecting North Korean refugees, and addressing the problem of China's "missing girls." It urges the Administration to develop an action plan that will facilitate interagency coordination on human rights and develop coordinated approaches that prepare all agencies to pursue measurable, results-orientated human rights and rule of law outcomes. A freer and more democratic China is a critical U.S. interest and this goal should be pursued in tandem with other U.S. diplomatic, economic, political, and security priorities.While the Chinese government may not be the responsible global stakeholder envisioned by many proponents of China's entry into the World Trade Organization 16 years ago, we must not forget that the desire for freedom, justice, and democratic openness are not alien to China or its people. These are universal principles that will further U.S. interests and be the foundation for a more peaceful, prosperous, and better future for the citizens of both China and the U.S.The Commission and its staff stand ready to assist in any way to carry out the report's recommendations or further explain its findings.Sincerely,Marco RubioChairChris SmithCochair.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6023778 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: October 7, 2017End of Document

These rights lawyers and advocates are denied due process rights, tortured in detention, and forced to "confess" to crimes they did not commit. Rights lawyers and their families were subject to constant surveillance and restrictions on their freedom of movement. Pressure on the activities of human rights defenders continues to be an issue of concern. The report recommends that the Administration consider more expansive use of existing U.S. laws, such as the Global Magnitsky Act, to hold accountable Chinese officials complicit in arbitrary detentions, torture, disappearances, and other severe human rights violations. The report also urges the Administration to deny requests for repatriation of Chinese citizens accused of corruption until the Chinese government can demonstrate that it is meeting due process protections consistent with international human rights norms and has ended both torture in detention and all forms of arbitrary detention.Severe Violations of Religious Freedom. The report notes the Chinese government's efforts to expand its political influence and control over the activities of religious communities through more restrictive regulations, at both the national and local level, with particularly severe abuses occurring in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) and Tibetan autonomous areas. Efforts to shutter and harass Protestant Christian "house churches" and the demolition of renowned Tibetan Buddhist institutes of learning, Larung Gar and Yachen Gar, are particularly concerning developments. The report recommends expanded U.S. leadership on international religious freedom through coordinated multilateral efforts and bilateral interactions that stress the strategic and economic value of promoting this fundamental freedom. The report also recommends that the Administration fully implement the Tibet Policy Act of 2002 and produce guidelines for U.S.-China counterterrorism dialogues so that the United States does not condone China's crackdowns on peaceful political dissent or restrictions on the freedoms of religion or expression in ethnic minority areas.Challenges to Hong Kong's "High Degree" of Autonomy. The actions of the mainland Chinese and Hong Kong governments during the past reporting year continue to raise concerns about the long-term viability of the "one country, two systems" model. The preemptive intervention of the National People's Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC), and the subsequent disqualification of six democratically elected legislators, raised serious concerns about Hong Kong's autonomy, its guaranteed freedoms, and the rule of law. In July 2017, the Hong Kong Court of Appeals sentenced Nathan Law, the youngest of the disqualified legislators, along with fellow pro-democracy leaders Joshua Wong and Alex Chow, in connection with their activities during the 2014 pro-democracy protests. The three had already completed community service sentences when the Hong Kong Department of Justice pursued the harsher sentences, raising concerns about the political nature of these prosecutions. Given the important economic interests the United States has in Hong Kong, and China's international commitments to protect a "high degree of autonomy" in Hong Kong, the Commission recommends that the administration continue to issue annually the report on Hong Kong outlined in Section 301 of the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992. In addition, the report recommends that the Administration and Congress work together to determine how to protect U.S. interests in Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms, including through consideration of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act (S. 417 and H.R. 3856).Shining a Light on Political Prisoners. The Annual Report highlights multiple political prisoner cases, including human rights lawyers and rights defenders, citizen journalists, labor and environmental advocates, religious leaders, and advocates for ethnic minority rights, Tibetans, and Uyghurs. The Commission urges Members of Congress and the Administration to consistently and publicly advocate for political prisoners because experience demonstrates that raising individual cases can result in improved treatment, lighter sentences, and in some cases, release from custody. The report recommends that the Administration create a Special Advisor for Political and Religious Prisoners to coordinate prisoner advocacy across the entire U.S. government. The Commission maintains an extensive Political Prisoner Database as a resource, with over 1,400 cases of currently detained political prisoners in Chinaa staggering but far from exhaustive figure.Making Human Rights a Strategic Priority. The U.S.-China relationship is marked by both growing interdependency and competition, and the issues covered by the Annual Report are among the most contentious in our bilateral relationship. Principled U.S. leadership is needed to develop a long-term policy approach that challenges China to abide by its international commitments, adhere to universal standards, and embrace the rule of law. In addition to the recommendations made above, the report suggests a focus on reciprocity, internet freedom, human trafficking, digital protectionism, protecting North Korean refugees, and addressing the problem of China's "missing girls." It urges the Administration to develop an action plan that will facilitate interagency coordination on human rights and develop coordinated approaches that prepare all agencies to pursue measurable, results-orientated human rights and rule of law outcomes. A freer and more democratic China is a critical U.S. interest and this goal should be pursued in tandem with other U.S. diplomatic, economic, political, and security priorities.While the Chinese government may not be the responsible global stakeholder envisioned by many proponents of China's entry into the World Trade Organization 16 years ago, we must not forget that the desire for freedom, justice, and democratic openness are not alien to China or its people. These are universal principles that will further U.S. interests and be the foundation for a more peaceful, prosperous, and better future for the citizens of both China and the U.S.The Commission and its staff stand ready to assist in any way to carry out the report's recommendations or further explain its findings.Sincerely,Marco Rubio Chris SmithChair CochairLoad-Date: October 7, 2017End of Document

RUBIO, SMITH RELEASE CHINA COMMISSION'S 2017 REPORT, ANNOUNCE NEW INITIATIVES ON HONG KONG, LIU XIAOBOStates News ServiceOctober 6, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 2345 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Florida Senator Marco Rubio:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) and U.S. Representative Chris Smith (R-NJ), chair and cochair of the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), issued the Commissions 2017 Annual Report and announced several joint initiatives on Hong Kong and commemoration of the late Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, and Chinese political prisoner, Liu Xiaobo. The CECCs 2017 Annual Report provides detailed analysis on human rights conditions and rule of law developments in China, and offers recommendations on ways to integrate these issues into U.S.-China relations.The Commissions 2017 report documents continued deterioration of human rights and the rule of law in China, as President Xi Jinping consolidates power in advance of the 19th Party Congress slated for later this month, said Rubio . Chinese authorities are ruthlessly targeting human rights lawyers and advocates; clamping down on foreign NGOs, media outlets and Internet companies; restricting religious freedom particularly in ethnic minority Tibetan and Uyghur areas and forcibly repatriating North Korean refugees to near certain persecution and even death. This year the central authorities further intervened in the affairs of Hong Kong, disqualifying democratically elected legislators and jailing pro-democracy leaders. In the face of this repression, the universal desire for basic human rights persists. This report is dedicated to the late Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and political prisoner Liu Xiaobo, whose hopes for the Chinese people, articulated in his essays, poetry and ultimately Charter 08 remain aspirational. As President Trump heads to China next month, he must press China to uphold international human rights norms, respect the rule of law, and adhere to universal standards.At the cost of American jobs and security, the Chinese government has become more repressive domestically, more protectionist in its trade policies, and more assertive globally. The Administration is going through a review of its China policy at the moment, the Annual Report has recommendations that can assist them develop strategies that link American values and interests--it should be required reading at the White House, at the State Department, and by all Members of Congress," said Smith . "Nothing good happens in the dark that is why the Administration should shine a light on the Chinese governments failures to abide by universal standards, shine a light on the cases of tortured and abused political prisoners, shine a light on Chinas unfair trade practices and still coercive population control policies. A freer and more democratic China is a critical U.S. interest, and it should be pursued in tandem with other U.S. diplomatic, economic, political, and security priorities.The chairs announced their intention to work on several joint initiatives during the upcoming year including:Nomination of Hong Kongs Umbrella Movement for the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize: The Chairs stated their intention to nominate Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, Alex Chow and the entire Umbrella Movement for the prize, citing their peaceful efforts to bring political reform and protect the autonomy and freedoms guaranteed Hong Kong in the Sino-British Joint Declaration.Congressional Commemoration of Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Liu Xiaobo : The Chairs announced bicameral legislation to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Liu Xiaobo and the Chinese Democracy Movement. The CECC also announced its intention to start a Liu Xiaobo Fellows Program.Both chairs commended the capable and professional work of the CECCs research staff in producing the Commissions 16th Annual Report.The full text of the chairs letter is below.Dear Mr. President:We transmit to you the 2017 Annual Report of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (the Commission) as required by the U.S.-China Relations Act of 2000 (Public Law No: 106286). Under this legislative mandate, the Commission monitors and reports on human rights violations and the development of the rule of law in China, and provides recommendations to address these issues in U.S.-China relations.The Commissions structure, consisting of a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators, Representatives, and senior-level Administration officials, is intended to foster cooperation between the legislative and executive branches, and promote bipartisan attention to critical issues in U.S.-China relations. In the coming year, we hope the Administration can appoint Commissioners from the Departments of State, Labor, and Commerce, as required by the Act.The Commissions Annual Report comes out on the eve of the 19th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party and prior to your upcoming visit to China. The topics covered by our Annual Report remain some of the most contentious issues in bilateral relations and are critically linked to the protection of U.S. national interests.Over the past several years, the Chinese government has become more protectionist in its trade policies, more authoritarian in domestic politics, increasingly dismissive of international norms and Western ideas, and more assertive in expanding its extraterritorial reach globally.The Commissions 2017 Annual Report further documents the Chinese government and Communist Partys continued efforts to silence dissent, criminalize activities of human rights lawyers, control civil society, suppress religious activity, and restrict the operations of foreign media outlets, businesses, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) over the past 12 months. The report also provides evidence that Chinese authorities arbitrarily detained and tortured political prisoners, forcibly repatriated North Korean refugees, and continued to implement coercive population control polices, in violation of Chinas international obligations.These issues necessitate high-level engagement from U.S. policymakers and elected officials. As your administration pursues a China policy review, we commend the Annual Reports findings and policy recommendations to your attention, as we believe they will assist in developing strategies to advance U.S. interests and maintain principled U.S. leadership on issues of human rights and development of the rule of law in the vital Asia-Pacific region.Based on developments this past year, the report identifies the following key areas that merit the focus of Congress and the Administration in the coming year:Law as an Instrument of Repression. The Chinese government continues to use the law as an instrument of repression to expand control over Chinese society, while outwardly providing the veneer of a system guided by the rule of law. In the past year, the government moved forward with implementing a series of far-reaching new laws that provided the basis for broader and more severe crackdowns on ethnic minority groups and human rights defenders, censorship of the Internet, and restrictions on foreign NGOs and international businesses that operate in or trade with China. The report recommends that the Administration seek a rules-of-the-road agreement that ensures reciprocal treatment for U.S. institutions, businesses, and nationals operating in China and urges the Administration to coordinate with allies, businesses, and NGOs to develop a unified strategy to respond to Chinas unfair industrial policies, digital protectionism, and the PRC Law on the Management of Overseas NGOs Activities.Human Rights Lawyers Viewed as Security Threat.

The topics covered by our Annual Report remain some of the most contentious issues in bilateral relations and are critically linked to the protection of U.S. national interests.Over the past several years, the Chinese government has become more protectionist in its trade policies, more authoritarian in domestic politics, increasingly dismissive of international norms and "Western" ideas, and more assertive in expanding its extraterritorial reach globally.The Commission's 2017 Annual Report further documents the Chinese government and Communist Party's continued efforts to silence dissent, criminalize activities of human rights lawyers, control civil society, suppress religious activity, and restrict the operations of foreign media outlets, businesses, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) over the past 12 months. The report also provides evidence that Chinese authorities arbitrarily detained and tortured political prisoners, forcibly repatriated North Korean refugees, and continued to implement coercive population control polices, in violation of China's international obligations.These issues necessitate high-level engagement from U.S. policymakers and elected officials. As your administration pursues a China policy review, we commend the Annual Report's findings and policy recommendations to your attention, as we believe they will assist in developing strategies to advance U.S. interests and maintain principled U.S. leadership on issues of human rights and development of the rule of law in the vital Asia-Pacific region.Based on developments this past year, the report identifies the following key areas that merit the focus of Congress and the Administration in the coming year:Law as an Instrument of Repression. The Chinese government continues to use the law as an instrument of repression to expand control over Chinese society, while outwardly providing the veneer of a system guided by the rule of law. In the past year, the government moved forward with implementing a series of far-reaching new laws that provided the basis for broader and more severe crackdowns on ethnic minority groups and human rights defenders, censorship of the Internet, and restrictions on foreign NGOs and international businesses that operate in or trade with China. The report recommends that the Administration seek a rules-of-the-road agreement that ensures reciprocal treatment for U.S. institutions, businesses, and nationals operating in China and urges the Administration to coordinate with allies, businesses, and NGOs to develop a unified strategy to respond to China's unfair industrial policies, digital protectionism, and the PRC Law on the Management of Overseas NGOs' Activities.Human Rights Lawyers Viewed as Security Threat. Persistent reports emerged of human rights lawyers and advocates being arbitrarily detained on state security-related charges, for which Chinese law permits officials to enforce de facto incommunicado detention. These rights lawyers and advocates are denied due process rights, tortured in detention, and forced to "confess" to crimes they did not commit. Rights lawyers and their families were subject to constant surveillance and restrictions on their freedom of movement. Pressure on the activities of human rights defenders continues to be an issue of concern. The report recommends that the Administration consider more expansive use of existing U.S. laws, such as the Global Magnitsky Act, to hold accountable Chinese officials complicit in arbitrary detentions, torture, disappearances, and other severe human rights violations. The report also urges the Administration to deny requests for repatriation of Chinese citizens accused of corruption until the Chinese government can demonstrate that it is meeting due process protections consistent with international human rights norms and has ended both torture in detention and all forms of arbitrary detention.Severe Violations of Religious Freedom. The report notes the Chinese government's efforts to expand its political influence and control over the activities of religious communities through more restrictive regulations, at both the national and local level, with particularly severe abuses occurring in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) and Tibetan autonomous areas. Efforts to shutter and harass Protestant Christian "house churches" and the demolition of renowned Tibetan Buddhist institutes of learning, Larung Gar and Yachen Gar, are particularly concerning developments. The report recommends expanded U.S. leadership on international religious freedom through coordinated multilateral efforts and bilateral interactions that stress the strategic and economic value of promoting this fundamental freedom. The report also recommends that the Administration fully implement the Tibet Policy Act of 2002 and produce guidelines for U.S.-China counterterrorism dialogues so that the United States does not condone China's crackdowns on peaceful political dissent or restrictions on the freedoms of religion or expression in ethnic minority areas.Challenges to Hong Kong's "High Degree" of Autonomy. The actions of the mainland Chinese and Hong Kong governments during the past reporting year continue to raise concerns about the long-term viability of the "one country, two systems" model. The preemptive intervention of the National People's Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC), and the subsequent disqualification of six democratically elected legislators, raised serious concerns about Hong Kong's autonomy, its guaranteed freedoms, and the rule of law. In July 2017, the Hong Kong Court of Appeals sentenced Nathan Law, the youngest of the disqualified legislators, along with fellow pro-democracy leaders Joshua Wong and Alex Chow, in connection with their activities during the 2014 pro-democracy protests. The three had already completed community service sentences when the Hong Kong Department of Justice pursued the harsher sentences, raising concerns about the political nature of these prosecutions. Given the important economic interests the United States has in Hong Kong, and China's international commitments to protect a "high degree of autonomy" in Hong Kong, the Commission recommends that the administration continue to issue annually the report on Hong Kong outlined in Section 301 of the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992. In addition, the report recommends that the Administration and Congress work together to determine how to protect U.S. interests in Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms, including through consideration of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act (S. 417 and H.R. 3856).Shining a Light on Political Prisoners. The Annual Report highlights multiple political prisoner cases, including human rights lawyers and rights defenders, citizen journalists, labor and environmental advocates, religious leaders, and advocates for ethnic minority rights, Tibetans, and Uyghurs. The Commission urges Members of Congress and the Administration to consistently and publicly advocate for political prisoners because experience demonstrates that raising individual cases can result in improved treatment, lighter sentences, and in some cases, release from custody. The report recommends that the Administration create a Special Advisor for Political and Religious Prisoners to coordinate prisoner advocacy across the entire U.S. government. The Commission maintains an extensive Political Prisoner Database as a resource, with over 1,400 cases of currently detained political prisoners in China--a staggering but far from exhaustive figure.Making Human Rights a Strategic Priority. The U.S.-China relationship is marked by both growing interdependency and competition, and the issues covered by the Annual Report are among the most contentious in our bilateral relationship. Principled U.S. leadership is needed to develop a long-term policy approach that challenges China to abide by its international commitments, adhere to universal standards, and embrace the rule of law. In addition to the recommendations made above, the report suggests a focus on reciprocity, internet freedom, human trafficking, digital protectionism, protecting North Korean refugees, and addressing the problem of China's "missing girls." It urges the Administration to develop an action plan that will facilitate interagency coordination on human rights and develop coordinated approaches that prepare all agencies to pursue measurable, results-orientated human rights and rule of law outcomes. A freer and more democratic China is a critical U.S. interest and this goal should be pursued in tandem with other U.S. diplomatic, economic, political, and security priorities.While the Chinese government may not be the responsible global stakeholder envisioned by many proponents of China's entry into the World Trade Organization 16 years ago, we must not forget that the desire for freedom, justice, and democratic openness are not alien to China or its people. These are universal principles that will further U.S. interests and be the foundation for a more peaceful, prosperous, and better future for the citizens of both China and the U.S.The Commission and its staff stand ready to assist in any way to carry out the report's recommendations or further explain its findings.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6023415 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: October 7, 2017End of Document

Trump blocks Chinese purchase of US semiconductor makerAssociated Press Financial WireSeptember 14, 2017 Thursday 4:27 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: WASHINGTON DATELINELength: 424 wordsDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday blocked a Chinese government-financed firm's acquisition of an Oregon semiconductor maker on national security grounds.A federal panel that reviews foreign investment in the United States for possible security threats ruled against the proposed $1.3 billion purchase of Lattice Semiconductor last week. The deal has been under scrutiny since it became clear the buyer, Canyon Bridge Capital Partners, is funded by the Chinese government.Chinese companies are on a global buying spree to acquire technology and brands. Most acquisitions in the United States and Europe go through without incident, but some purchases of high-tech companies have prompted criticism they might represent security threats or the loss of important national assets."Credible evidence leads me to believe" the buyers of Lattice "might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States," Trump said in his order .A statement from the White House press secretary cited the importance of "semiconductor supply chain integrity" to U.S. security, the Chinese government's role in supporting the transaction and the potential transfer of intellectual property to a foreign buyer.Trump has expressed concern about the status of U.S. manufacturing and its ability to meet national security needs. In July, he issued an order for a review to be led by the Defense Department. He also has asked the Commerce Department to look into whether to raise tariffs on imported steel on national security grounds.Following Trump's announcement, Lattice said it was canceling the proposed sale.Lattice manufactures a relatively low-tech class of programmable computer chips that can be adapted for a variety of uses. It had 1,000 employees worldwide at the end of the last year, but that number dwindled after Lattice sold a division in India and laid off workers.In December, the German government blocked the Chinese purchase of a chipmaker, Aixtron SE, after then-U.S. President Barack Obama prohibited the buyer from taking over its California subsidiary on national security grounds.In 2012, Obama blocked Chinese-owned Ralls Corp. from building a wind farm near a naval base in Oregon. The previous year, China's Huawei Technologies Ltd. called off its planned purchase of 3Leaf Systems after the U.S. security panel refused to approve the deal.In 1990, then-President George H.W.

'Shameful' -- Uproar after world's oldest publisher bows to China censorsCNNMoney.comAugust 20, 2017 Sunday 5:09 PM ESTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: MEDIALength: 605 wordsByline: Jethro MullenBodyThe prestigious publishing arm of one of the world's top universities is under fire for bowing to pressure from China to censor sensitive articles.Britain's Cambridge University Press, which describes itself as the oldest publishing house in the world, has admitted it blocked hundreds of articles from being read online in China following a request from Beijing.The academic articles appeared in the publisher's highly regarded China Quarterly journal. Its editor, Tim Pringle, has expressed "deep concern and disappointment" over the censorship.The decision is "a craven, shameful and destructive concession" to the Chinese government's "growing censorship regime," Georgetown University professor James Millward wrote in an open letter published over the weekend.On Monday, an online petition threatening a boycott of the publisher and its journals was gathering signatures from academics around the world.Many of the blocked articles covered subjects that Beijing tries to stamp out in the news media and on social networks, including the Tiananmen Square massacre, the Cultural Revolution and Tibet.The not-for-profit publisher defended its action as necessary to ensure that China doesn't block "entire collections of content." But Millward was just one of a number of prominent academics to blast Cambridge's move."Chinese students and scholars reading a censored version of The China Quarterly will encounter only historical facts and scholarly analyses approved by political authorities," Greg Distelhorst of MIT and Jessica Chen Weiss of Cornell wrote in a letter to Cambridge University Press."This censored history of China will literally bear the seal of Cambridge University," they said.The Cambridge press, which has been operating since the reign of Queen Elizabeth I in the 16th century, has run into a challenge faced by other global publishers: obey China's censors or be locked out of its giant market.Top news organizations like The New York Times have had their websites blocked in China for years after publishing articles that upset the ruling Communist Party."Western institutions have the freedom to choose," said an English-language opinion article published Sunday by Global Times, a provocative but state-sanctioned Chinese tabloid. "If they don't like the Chinese way, they can stop engaging with us. If they think China's internet market is so important that they can't miss out, they need to respect Chinese law and adapt to the Chinese way."China's General Administration of Press and Publication, a regulatory body, didn't respond to requests for comment Monday.Cambridge said it wouldn't proactively censor its content in China and was troubled by the recent increase in requests to block individual articles, an issue it said it plans to raise with Chinese authorities at this month's Beijing Book Fair."The issue of censorship in China and other regions is not a short-term issue and therefore requires a longer-term approach," it said. "There are many things we can't control but we will continue to take every opportunity to influence this agenda."Its explanation has failed to sway its critics.Submitting to Beijing's demands is "a misguided, if understandable, economic decision that does harm to the Press' reputation and integrity," said Jonathan Sullivan, director of the China Policy Institute at the University of Nottingham."This is not the first time Beijing has leveraged the economic power of the Chinese market for political gains," he wrote in a blog post. "The fear is that it won't be the last time that Western academia is the target."-- Serena Dong contributed to this report.Load-Date: August 22, 2017End of Document

DETAINED TAIWAN DEMOCRACY ACTIVIST 'CONFESSES' DURING SUBVERSION TRIALStates News ServiceSeptember 11, 2017 MondayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 1492 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Detained Taiwan democracy activist and NGO worker Lee Ming-cheh "confessed" to charges of subversion at his trial in the central Chinese province of Hunan on Monday, as his wife said his guilty plea wasn't freely made.Lee, the first foreign national to be tried under new laws governing NGO activity in China, stood trial at the Intermediate People's Court in Hunan's Yueyang city alongside Chinese national Peng Yuhua. Both were accused of "incitement to subvert state power."In a broadcast made by the court, Lee "confessed" to making online posts to WeChat, Facebook, and other online communities with intent to "maliciously discredit" the ruling Chinese Communist Party.But his stay in a Chinese police-run detention center had changed his mind, he said."While I was in the detention center, I saw a lot of TV programs with information about China's development, and I was able to receive a more rounded education," he said."This made me recognize the progress China has made in its development, which was completely different from the information I had received before in Taiwan," Lee told the court."This wrong-headed ideology led me to commit these criminal acts, and I plead guilty to this crime and express my remorse," he said.But rights groups called for Lee's immediate release in the absence of conclusive evidence of an internationally recognizable crime.Confession doubtedLee's wife and mother traveled from Taiwan on Sunday to attend the trial, which followed his detention on national security charges on arrival at the southern border city of Zhuhai on March 19.Lee's wife Lee Ching-yu has repeatedly rejected out of hand and in advance the validity of any "confession" made by her husband.Chinese rights activist Xu Qin, who went to the court to act as an independent human rights observer, said Lee Ching-yu had only made a brief statement in response to requests for comment from journalists as she arrived to attend the trial."Lee Ching-yu told the media that she hoped they understood that Lee Ming-cheh's confession and guilty plea wasn't made freely," Xu said."She had written a slogan on her forearms that read 'Lee Ming-cheh, I am proud of you'."Security was tight outside the court building on Monday morning, Lee's supporters said."They aren't allowing anyone to walk past the court buildings; they have cordoned off the street," a supporter surnamed Liang told RFA. "There were even a couple of guns on the roof, pointing downwards.""Local government officials detained five or six people at the scene."Lawyer also triedLee's statement in court closely echoed those made by human rights lawyer Jiang Tianyong at his Aug. 22 subversion trial, a procedure that was immediately denounced by Jiang's family as a show trial.A spokesman for China's State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office said Lee had "hired" two lawyers as his defense counsel.But detainees in subversion cases brought by the ruling Chinese Communist Party are increasingly being put under pressure to make a televised "confession" and to fire attorneys appointed by their families, using government lawyers instead.Chinese law allows police to detain those suspected of "national security" crimes and hold them under residential surveillance at a secret location for up to six months, with no access to lawyers or family visits.While the Taiwan authorities said they would do what they could to assist Lee Ching-yu, she appeared reluctant to comment after receiving her travel documents from Beijing, suggesting that her silence may have been the price of her permission to attend the trial.One mainland Chinese rights lawyer had earlier warned that Lee Ching-yu could be pulled into a dangerous game by attending the trial and following the Chinese government's instructions."All along, she has said she doesn't recognize [any confession], which means then that she doesn't recognize the trial as valid, either," the lawyer said. "And yet, she's being invited to attend.""She runs the risk that the authorities would use her visit to pressure Lee Ming-cheh into making a confession," the lawyer said ahead of the trial.Writing campaignMeanwhile, London-based rights group Amnesty International called on its members to write to the Chinese government calling for Lee Ming-cheh's immediate release.It called on Beijing to "release Lee Ming-cheh immediately and unconditionally unless there is sufficient credible and admissible evidence that he has committed an internationally recognized offense and is granted a fair trial in line with international standards."Chinese authorities should also "immediately disclose Lee Ming-cheh's whereabouts and ensure that he is protected from torture and other ill-treatment [and] ensure that he is allowed to have access to his family, a lawyer of his choice, and adequate medical care," the group said.A former activist with Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Lee is a community college manager and lifelong NGO activist. He was detained on his arrival in the southern border city of Zhuhai on a personal visit to seek medical advice.Taiwan lawyer Fan Chih-cheng said he was hired by Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council as a consultant to advise Lee Ching-yu, but that his status wasn't recognized in mainland China."I am just a friend advising her in a private capacity, from the Chinese government's point of view," Fan said. "I can offer her advice, in particular with regard to her personal safety."DPP lawmaker Wang Liping said that while the Taiwan authorities had tried to help Lee's wife find out more about her husband's whereabouts and state of health, they had failed to challenge Beijing's narrative following his detention."This [trial] is inexplicable from our point of view," Wang told RFA shortly before the trial. "We are a free people, and we think like people from a free nation.""We find it very hard to follow the logic of this country, and there was no intention of deliberately offending it."Similar patternLee's trial followed a similar pattern to those of other lawyers and activists detained in a nationwide crackdown on the legal profession and nongovernment groups since July 2015.Previous detainees accused of subversion-related offenses have later been released, albeit under continuing restrictions. Those who refuse to "confess" are typically handed heavy jail terms.Lee Ching-yu had repeatedly asked the Chinese government to disclose Lee Ming-cheh's whereabouts, but didn't receive a response until the trial date was set last week.China's Overseas NGO Domestic Activities Management Law, which came into effect at the start of this year, enables police to engage in daily supervision and monitoring of foreign civil society and rights groups operating in China.The legislation hands full authority for the registration and supervision of foreign NGOs in China to the country's ministry of public security, and police across the country.They have the power to cancel any activities, revoke an organization's registration, and impose administrative detention on its workers, as well as take part in the annual assessment of foreign NGOs required for the renewal their operating permit.Silencing dissentPolitical commentator Lin Baohua said Lee's detention and trial come as President Xi Jinping seeks to silence any dissenting voices ahead of the 19th Party Congress next month."They want a bit less dissent coming out of Taiwan, so as to be sure that there is minimal interference from overseas around the 19th Party Congress," Lin said."Of course, if it also has the effect of forcing the administration of President Tsai Ing-wen to recognize the 1992 consensus [that Taiwan can never be an independent country], then that'll be a victory for China as well."Tseng Chien-yuen of Taiwan's Chung Hua University agreed."They want everything, both in and outside of China, to create a favorable atmosphere for the reestablishment of the leadership at the 19th Party Congress," Tseng told RFA. "They are very keen to go after some of the overseas voices that they can deal with, to silence any opposition overseas."Taiwan began a transition to democracy following the death of President Chiang Ching-kuo, in January 1988, starting with direct elections to the legislature in the early 1990s and culminating in the first direct election of the island's president, Lee Teng-hui, in 1996.Recent opinion polls indicate that there is broad political support for de facto self-rule in Taiwan, where the majority of voters identify as Taiwanese rather than Chinese.But while the Chinese Communist Party has never ruled the island, Beijing regards it as part of Chinese territory and has threatened to invade if Taiwan seeks formal independence.Reported by Hsia Hsiao-hwa, Miao Qiuju and Gao Shan for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Wen Yuqing and Tung Kuang-cheng for the Cantonese Service.

Editor says Cambridge University Press to restore articlesAssociated Press InternationalAugust 21, 2017 Monday 4:27 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 863 wordsByline: By DANICA KIRKA and LOUISE WATT, Associated PressDateline: LONDON BodyLONDON (AP) - Cambridge University Press agreed Monday to restore more than 300 politically sensitive articles that had been removed from the publisher's website in China at the behest of authorities.Tim Pringle, editor of "The China Quarterly," told The Associated Press that the publisher agreed to repost the articles immediately. The action followed a petition circulating among academics calling on the university press to turn down censorship requests from the Chinese government."I am delighted by the support of the international academic community," Pringle said.Cambridge University Press said Friday that it had complied with a request to block certain articles from "The China Quarterly" within China. They touch on politically sensitive subjects, including the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution and the status of Tibet."Access to published materials of the highest quality is a core component of scholarly research," Pringle wrote in a post on Twitter announcing the decision. "It is not the role of respected global publishing houses such as CUP to hinder such access."The university later confirmed the decision to restore the articles, saying they had been reluctant to block the material in the first place."Academic freedom is the overriding principle on which the University of Cambridge is based," the press said in a statement on Twitter. "Therefore, while this temporary decision was taken in order to protect short-term access in China to the vast majority of the Press's journal articles, the University's academic leadership and the Press have agreed to reinstate the blocked content, with immediate effect, so as to uphold the principle of academic freedom on which the University's work is founded."The furor comes against a tightening of controls by Chinese President Xi Jinping's government over a wide range of groups that could feed opposition to the ruling Communist Party, including lawyers who take on sensitive cases, non-governmental organizations and churches.Academics say that universities, which have long endured some degree of political interference, have also come under increased supervision, including regular monitoring in classrooms and ideological audits.Christopher Balding, an associate professor in economics at Peking University HSBC Business School in Shenzhen, said he started the petition to bring pressure on not just CUP, but also universities and academics who interact with China as well as Chinese universities and academics "to stand up to" censorship by the Chinese government.With Chinese universities increasingly hiring internationally, Beijing is concerned "that these universities are not going to have the ideological adherence to what Beijing wants them to say," Balding said.The petition that circulated among academics calls on CUP to turn down censorship requests from the Chinese government. It says that academics and universities reserve the right to boycott CUP and related journals if it gives into the Chinese government's demands."The fundamental driver of this ... is simply to exercise control, to try to impose what they think is the correct way of thinking," said Balding. He said that scholars in China who really want to read the papers will still be able to access the articles through their networks of colleagues or by skirting Chinese restrictions on the internet known as the "Great Firewall."However, "the signal is being sent: 'we don't want Chinese scholars publishing on this,'" said Balding. "You will mostly likely see a decline in basically any scholarly work on these particular issues."By Monday, more than 200 people had signed the 3-day-old petition on change.org.The Global Times newspaper, published by the ruling Communist Party, said in an editorial Monday that China blocks some information on foreign websites that it deems "harmful" to Chinese society, and that CUP has to abide by Chinese law if it sets up a server within China.If Western institutions "think China's internet market is so important that they can't miss out, they need to respect Chinese law and adapt to the Chinese way," the editorial read.Chen Daoyin, a political scientist at Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, said scholars in China self-censor anyway and don't work on politically sensitive topics, such as the June 4, 1989, crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations centered on Beijing's Tiananmen Square."Most of the young generations in China don't know about June 4," Chen said. "And this is what Chinese authorities are doing now, working for the future."Cambridge University Press, which is part of the famed British university, said in its Friday statement that it had complied with a request from a Chinese import agency to block individual articles within China to ensure that other materials it publishes would remain available in China.It added that it was "troubled by the recent increase in requests of this nature" and intended to discuss the issue with Chinese authorities at the Beijing International Book Fair, which takes place this week.___Watt reported from Beijing.

Developments in China's Healthcare Industry; FinancialBuzz.com News CommentaryPR NewswireOctober 27, 2017 Friday 10:20 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2020 wordsDateline: NEW YORK, October 27, 2017 BodyChina's healthcare market is projected to grow at an unprecedented CAGR of about 12% to reach $1 trillion by 2020, up from $357 billion in 2011, as estimated in a recent report from McKinsey & Co. The government in China has decided to take major steps to improve the local healthcare infrastructure. According to a report by the Health Industry Summit, last October the Chinese government approved a blueprint called "Healthy China 2030", pledging to build a healthy China in the next 15 years. By 2030, the size of the healthcare market is expected to reach $2.3 trillion. From pharmaceuticals to medical products to consumer health, China is one of the most attractive markets in the health industry, and is fastest-growing of all the large emerging markets. Shineco Inc (NASDAQ: TYHT), JD.com (NASDAQ: JD), Hutchison China MediTech Ltd (NASDAQ: HCM), iKang Healthcare Group Inc (NASDAQ: KANG), Beigene Ltd (NASDAQ: BGNE)A research by McKinsey & Co. points out the significant affect healthcare reforms had on the system in China, "Three themes will shape China's health-care market: the continuation of economic and demographic trends, further health-care reform, and the policies articulated in the government's 12th five-year plan. Some of these forces - such as improvements in infrastructure, the broadening of insurance coverage, and significant support for innovation - will have positive implications for multinational companies... Health-care expenditures have more than doubled - from $156 billion in 2006 to $357 billion in 2011 - inching closer to 5 percent of the country's GDP. From pharmaceuticals to medical devices to traditional Chinese medicine, almost every health sector has benefited."Shineco Inc(NASDAQ: TYHT) announced breaking news that the company, "a producer and distributor of Chinese herbal medicines, organic agricultural products, specialized textiles, and other health and well-being focused plant-based products in China, today announced that the Company, through its subsidiary Tianjin Tajit E-Commerce Ltd., has obtained contractual rights to distribute branded products of Daiso Industries Co., Ltd.("Daiso"), a large franchise of 100-yen shops founded in Japan, viaJD.com(NASDAQ: JD), the largest e-commerce company and largest retailer in China.Pursuant to the contractual arrangement, Shineco is authorized to distribute Daiso's branded products and utilize its brand names in connection therewith in China through Tianjin Tajit E-Commerce Ltd. The cooperation between Shineco and JD includes many business initiatives, covering a broad spectrum of online retail. It allows the Company to access JD's significant online customer base to advance Shineco's business pursuit in China. JD will leverage Shineco's business expertise, and Shineco will serve as JD's authorized vendor for providing its customers with access to a wide range of products of Daiso.JD and Shineco is expected to join forces on promoting innovation of online retail business model, which is expected to improve Shineco's brand awareness and might result in enhanced marketing and continued growth.Mr. Yuying Zhang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Shineco, stated, "We are excited about teaming up with China's e-commerce giant JD and Japan's retail giant Daiso, and the potential market that new relationship can bring to our business. JD's vast online retail channel will enable us to distribute Daiso's products in a more efficient and economical manner to meet the growing consumer demand in China, which further drives the Company's fast expansion in e-commerce, enhances the influence of the Company and builds up the brand awareness of Shineco."Mr. Zhang continued, "As the market globalization and digital transformation continues to challenge traditional business concept, we need to develop the business faster and in a more flexible way. Distributing Daiso branded products via JD would be an exciting leap in this transformation and allows us to move forward with an even greater focus on innovation and development to meet changing customer needs in China. Given the fact that Daiso can now benefit over 20 million Chinese families, this part of our business is expected to achieve an annual growth rate of 20%. We look forward to offering customers a tremendous number of Daiso's quality products not previously widely available across China through JD."Hutchison China MediTech Ltd(NASDAQ: HCM) on October 16th reported preliminary clinical activity, safety, and tolerability data of fruquintinib, an investigational selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor ("VEGF") receptor given in combination with Iressa. Preliminary data from this Phase II proof-of-concept trial, the first study assessing combining fruquintinib with another tyrosine kinase inhibitor, demonstrated promising efficacy and an acceptable safety profile. "Having proven efficacy as a monotherapy in colorectal cancer, fruquintinib is now demonstrating its tolerability and efficacy in innovative combinations which are made possible because of its high kinase selectivity, negligible off-target toxicity, and clean drug-drug interaction profile," said Mr. Christian Hogg, Chief Executive Officer of Chi-Med.iKang Healthcare Group Inc(NASDAQ: KANG) is one of the largest providers in China's fast-growing private preventive healthcare space through its nationwide healthcare services network. Earlier in July announced its strategic partnership with BAHEAL Intelligent Technology to introduce IBM Watson for Oncology cognitive computing solutions into iKang service platform and jointly establish IBM Watson for Oncology Centers in China. This partnership is part of the recently launched iKangCare+ and iKangPartners+ initiatives. Both companies will collaborate to build the IBM Watson for Oncology Center within existing 108 and future iKang medical centers. Beigene Ltd(NASDAQ: BGNE) is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative molecularly targeted and immuno-oncology drugs for the treatment of cancer. presented preliminary data from the dose-verification portion of the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial of its investigational anti-PD-1 antibody BGB-A317 in Chinese patients with advanced solid tumors. BeiGene and Celgene Corporation have a global strategic collaboration for BGB-A317 for solid tumors; BeiGene retains exclusive rights to BGB-A317 in China. "BGB-A317 was generally well tolerated and showed preliminary activity in a heavily pretreated study population with advanced solid tumors. At the time of the data cut-off, no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The pharmacokinetic profile in Chinese patients was consistent with that reported in global trials of BGB-A317 at the registrational dose," commented Professor Lin Shen of the Peking University Cancer Hospital and Beijing Institute for Cancer Research, Beijing, China.Subscribe Now!

CII Report Highlights Risks Associated With a Common Chinese Corporate StructureTargeted News ServiceDecember 14, 2017 Thursday 11:17 PM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 624 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Council of Institutional Investors issued the following news release:A new report from the Council of Institutional Investors (CII) underlines the risks posed to investors by a corporate structure called a variable interest entity (VIE). Sixty two percent of Chinese companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges use a VIE, including internet giants Sina, Baidu, Alibaba and JD.com. U.S. exchanges are experiencing a surge of Chinese VIE IPOs, with 20 filings this year, including 15 since September 1, compared to six in 2016 and seven in 2015."Chinese companies using VIE structures have made a splash in the U.S. market and elsewhere, but investors should be aware that VIEs lack legal protections that investors normally expect," said Ken Bertsch, CII's executive director.What is a VIE? The Chinese government restricts Chinese companies in certain industries from receiving foreign investment. To sidestep these regulations, companies seeking foreign capital have adopted the VIE structure by constructing a complex network of entities, one of which is an offshore shell company that conducts an IPO on a U.S. exchange. The operating company remains technically owned by Chinese nationals, not foreign shareholders, since the entities are connected through contractual arrangements rather than direct ownership.Investors in companies with VIEs do not own equity in the Chinese company's operations. Because the contracts are designed to evade foreign investment restrictions, they might be invalid under Chinese contract law. As a result, investors are left without any real right to residual profits, control over the company's management or legal protections and recourse they would ordinarily enjoy through equity ownership.Key takeaways for investors from the full report include:* The shell company conducting the IPO typically neither has operations of its own nor directly owns a company with operations. Its financial statements consolidate the Chinese operating company since the contractual arrangements are designed to mimic direct ownership. Confusingly, the shell company often bears the same name as the Chinese operating company.* Since the enforceability of the contracts is in question, investors could suffer financially if Beijing enforces its foreign investment restrictions or the Chinese company's management expropriates the assets or earnings. A high profile case of expropriation took place between Alibaba's Jack Ma and Yahoo in 2011 (see page 9 of the report).* These companies could be subject to punitive levels of taxation in China as they move money through the structure, and this potential tax liability--possibly as high as 50 percent--is not fully reflected in the financial statements.* The vast majority of Chinese VIEs state in their filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that they have no plans to pay dividends to investors and will reinvest their earnings in China indefinitely. Investors may have to rely solely on the appreciation of the company's stock price for a return on their investment.* These companies often adopt poor corporate governance practices. Sixty one percent that IPO'd in the last two years employ a dual-class structure with unequal voting rights. Among all Chinese VIEs, 83 percent are incorporated in the Cayman Islands or British Virgin Islands where required governance provisions are weak, and 56 percent rely on legal exemptions from board independence standards.The report concludes by offering five recommendations to the SEC on how to improve transparency and accountability to shareholders of Chinese companies using VIEs by strengthening disclosure rules.[Category: Financial Services]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6107275 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 15, 2017End of Document

South Korea firms' China nightmare may be coming to an endCNN WireNovember 1, 2017 Wednesday 2:32 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 440 wordsByline: By Daniel ShaneDateline: HONG KONG (CNNMoney) BodyHONG KONG (CNNMoney) --  China looks set to relax months of pressure on major South Korean businesses after agreeing Tuesday to improve relations with the government in Seoul.The news of the thawing ties gave a lift to big South Korean companies that sell into China.The two countries fell out a year ago over South Korea's decision to deploy a U.S. missile defense system on its territory. That led to a widespread boycott of South Korean businesses in China, such as automaker Hyundai and conglomerate Lotte. The Chinese government also prodded travel agents to stop selling tours to South Korea, which is a popular destination for Chinese tourists.China is highly sensitive about any buildup of Western military forces in the region and worries that the U.S. missile system -- known as THAAD -- could be used to spy on it.

The Lotte conglomerate, whose land was used to house the THAAD batteries, has suffered a series of setbacks in China during the dispute.Duty-free retailer Hotel Shilla, which targets Chinese tourists in Seoul, gained 2.2%.Regina Hahm, an analyst with Mirae Asset Daewoo Securities, said investors had been expecting an improvement in relations between China and South Korea after the two countries announced a foreign currency agreement two weeks ago. However, she cautioned that it will probably take until the first half of next year for Chinese tourist numbers to South Korea to start picking up again. China is still unhappy about the deployment of THAAD in what it views as its backyard, but the statement from both countries said they would continue to discuss the matter via military channels.The South Korean government said Tuesday's announcement was just the "first step" in getting relations with China back to normal.The news comes just days before President Trump's trip to Asia.

SPEECH AT THE SIGNING CEREMONY FOR THE FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT OF THE COMMUNICATIONS TOWERS PROJECT PHASE II FROM CHINESE EMBASSY IN ZAMBIAStates News ServiceAugust 8, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 834 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:Your Excellency Mr. Edgar Chagwa Lungu, President of the Republic of Zambia,Honorable Mr. Brian Mushimba, Minister of Transport and Communication,Honorable Mrs. Kampamba Mulenga, Minister of Information and Broadcasting Services,Honorable Mr. Freedom Sikazwe, Minister of Presidential Affairs,Dr. Roland Msiska,Secretary to the Cabinet,Mr. Fredson Yamba, Secretary to the Treasury of the Ministry of Finance,Permanent Secretaries and other senior officials,Mr. Thomas Hu, Managing Director of Huawei Zambia,Distinguished guests,Friends from the media,Ladies and gentlemen,Good morning!It is my great pleasure to attend this Signing Ceremony today. First of all, please allow me on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China, to express my warm congratulations to Your Excellency, to the government and people of Zambia on the signing of the Framework Agreement of the Communications Towers Project Phase II. It is indeed a happy occasion as this project marks another milestone achievement in the development of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in Zambia.Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen,As we know, ICT Cooperation is one of the important areas within the framework of Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). China and Zambia enjoy extensive cooperation in this area. This February, Honorable Mr. Brian Mushimba, Minister of Transport and Communication and I visited Zambia National Data Center put up by Huawei, which is part of Zambia National ICT Development (Smart Zambia) Project Phase I. In recent years, from Smart Zambia to GSM Network Expansion, from Communications Towers Project to National Digital Terrestrial Television Migration, from Huawei to ZTE, to Star Times, China and Chinese enterprises have made great and tangible contributions to the development of ICT in Zambia.And today, with the document signing of the Communications Towers Project Phase II, we kick start another significant project of China-Zambia communication infrastructure cooperation within the framework of FOCAC. This project is funded by the Chinese government through Concessional Loan. The project includes the construction of 808 new towers, 1,009 2G/3G/4G wireless stations and the setting up of a matched transmission network and user access terminals. After the completion of the project, the voice service penetration will increase from 70% to nearly 100%, the data service penetration will increase from 5% to 40%, which will greatly improve communication conditions for the Zambian people. I believe that everyone's mobile phone here has at one time or another experienced the loss of signals, thus the inconvenience to communicate. After the completion of this project, that will no longer be a problem. At the same time, the project will effectively improve the investment environment in Zambia, promote employment, and provide a solid foundation for the socio-economic development of Zambia.Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen,Here I wish to say a few words to the contractor of the project, Huawei Technologies. As a global leading ICT company, Huawei has successfully implemented a series of projects with socio-economic significance in Zambia in recent years, such as the Smart Zambia Project and the Communications Towers Project. At the same time, Huawei also takes Corporate Social Responsibility seriously. In the year of 2016 alone, Huawei donated 1 million US Dollars in the form of supporting the development of education, and provision of food, water, medicine and others to the needy in Zambia. However, I urge Huawei not to live on the achievements of the past but exert your utmost efforts into this new project, to complete the project in time and with high quality, so as to benefit the Zambian people. It is my hope that Huawei will be able to deliver to the government and people of Zambia a quality final product, and write a new chapter for China-Zambia cooperation which both of our sides will benefit.Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen,ICT is of great importance to the promotion of national development, therefore all the countries across the world attach high importance to ICT development. In the recently-released Seventh National Development Plan of Zambia, ICT has been identified as a critical catalyst for socio-economic development as well as an impetus of good governance, thus recognized as one of the national priority areas. I see great promising prospect for China-Zambia cooperation in ICT industry. China will continue to make contribution to the development of ICT in Zambia, bring our cooperation in this sector and other fields to a higher level, and help Zambia attain its 2030 goal of becoming a prosperous middle income country.Once again, I wish to extend my congratulations on the signing of the Framework Agreement and Concessional Loan Agreement of the Communications Towers Project Phase II.Thank you!Load-Date: August 10, 2017End of Document

The stock closed up 86%, giving China Literature a market value of close to $12 billion.Chinese government data shows that e-books are a fast-growing market. More than 330 million Chinese now read books via online platforms, with growth averaging about 20% annually over the last five years.China Literature is wired into more than half of that market. Its platform allows readers to choose from nearly 10 million books by more than six million writers.It also helps that the company has powerful friends. It's majority-owned by Tencent, the Chinese social media giant whose WeChat platform counts almost one billion monthly active users.Compared with other smartphone distractions like video games and streaming TV, e-books may seem a bit low-tech.But they appeal to many Chinese, as they are subject to less stringent government censorship rules than movies and TV."There's a lot more flexibility and freedom," said Shaun Rein, managing director of China Market Research in Shanghai. The most popular genres are romance and fantasy, he added.Rein said that local e-reading platforms are also more popular than foreign entrants, like Amazon's Kindle. That's despite the U.S. behemoth's e-book store having been in China for almost five years.Apple's iBooks service in China was abruptly shut down last year, reportedly on government orders.China Literature's Qidian.com portal lets users buy individual chapters for the equivalent of a couple of U.S. dollars, rather than forking out for an entire title."It's seen as virtually free and it builds up momentum" for the following chapters, Rein said.Unlike Amazon's Kindle Store, the titles on Qidian.com are mostly written by enthusiastic amateurs hoping to strike it rich as the next J.K. Rowling. Part of China Literature's long-term strategy is licensing out this steady flow of content into other media, like TV series, games and movies.China Literature certainly boasts growth figures that Amazon can only dream of.

Mr Song Yu, Director of Beijing Municipal Commission of Tourism Development and Mr Wang Jie, Secretary of Air China Commission of Commerce attended the closing ceremony and delivered a speech. The event also welcomed Mr Cao Pengcheng, Deputy Director of Beijing Municipal Commission of Tourism Development together with about 150 representatives from government departments including China National Tourism Administration, Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the People's Government of Beijing Municipality, Beijing Municipal Information Office and Beijing Municipal Office of the Central Leading Group for Cyberspace Affairs, as well as District Tourism Administrations of Beijing, tourist attractions, travel enterprises and media.During the event, Mr Song Yu, Director of Beijing Municipal Commission of Tourism Development talked about the concept behind the campaign and expressed gratitude to the two winning teams of "Imperial Ambassador" for having traveled a long way. "Thank you for sharing your incredible travel stories in Beijing to the world and helping promote Beijing's tourism image using social media platforms." Satisfying the growing demand for Beijing's cultural tourism and boosting the city's tourism image and unique charm as a popular travel destination, Beijing Municipal Commission of Tourism Development launched this innovative marketing campaign and established strategic partnership with Air China to promote the city's travel attractions.Mr Wang Jie, Secretary of Air China Commission of Commerce also reviewed the highlights of the campaign and said there will be more collaboration between Air China and Beijing Municipal Commission of Tourism Development following "Imperial Ambassador". With its main base in Beijing and being the largest air carrier between China and the United States and Central Europe, Air China will continue to work with the Commission closely on projects like joint promotion and tour package showcase to attract more overseas travelers to choose Air China when traveling to Beijing.Four highlights of the "Imperial Ambassador" campaign include:Reaching the target audience:Responding to travelers' demand, the campaign developed marketing strategies using social media platforms and working with social media influencers to promote what interests tourists most - Beijing's well-acclaimed imperial culture, and help boost Beijing's tourism image in the global tourism market.Innovative media strategies:The campaign adopted an innovative "3D matrix" marketing model, working with mainstream online and print media, TV companies and more in China and overseas while making effective use of social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube to post event updates. In addition, Imperial Ambassadors also posted live updates and showed Beijing to the world, which helped boost social engagement and promote the imperial culture of Beijing.Focusing on resource integration:The campaign strengthened linkages between the Chinese government and enterprises, local and overseas travel agencies as well as media, especially involving China's top three travel agencies, China Youth Travel Service, China International Travel Service and China Travel Service, and using the world's leading travel service distribution websites, Travelport, Sabre and Amadeus, to improve promotion performance and increase inbound tourism to Beijing.Being product-oriented:Imperial Ambassadors visited World Heritage sites, imperial attractions and accommodations and other local spots. The campaign was all about a theme of Beijing's imperial culture. It turned their travel route into useful travel information and encourages overseas travelers to go traveling to Beijing.Mr Cao Pengcheng, Deputy Director of Beijing Municipal Commission of Tourism Development said the "Imperial Ambassador" campaign has tremendously helped promote Beijing's imperial culture and got positive feedback and social media engagement. From now on, the Commission will further promote the unique charm of Beijing and improve the city's brand image. The Commission is also going to work with more travel companies and optimize travel products while collaborating with travel agencies to launch various travel packages and stimulate the development of Beijing's inbound tourism industry.Imperial CulturalExperience: A journey traveling back in timeSince the launch of the "Imperial Ambassador" campaign in May, the recruitment mini-site has generated more than 50,000 views, with over 2,000 applications from 80 different countries, and gained 60,000 new followers on social media platforms, with over 35,000,000 post impressions.

CHINESE RIGHTS ACTIVIST 'STILL NOT FREE' FOLLOWING RELEASE FROM PRISON: LAWYERStates News ServiceDecember 1, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 750 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Chinese rights activist Su Changlan, who once supported Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement and campaigned for the land rights of rural women, has yet to regain her freedom, more than a month after her reported "release," her lawyer said on Friday.Su's defense attorney Liu Xiaoyuan said via his Twitter account that the authorities said his client was released on Oct. 26, and allowed to return home."Legally, she should be entirely at liberty, but in reality, she still has limits on her freedom, while her family members are being treated as guilty by association," Liu wrote.Su's brother Su Shangwei said on Friday that his sister is in poor health after serving three years in a police-run detention center for "incitement to subvert state power" before and after her trial at the Foshan Intermediate People's Court on Apr. 21, 2016."Su Changlan's health is still in a very poor state, with very poor liver test results," he said."When she had just gotten out, she went back to her parental home for a bunch of tests, where they found that ... she has cirrhosis of the liver," he added."We would like to take her to a big hospital for a full battery of tests and proper treatment, but we are in difficult financial straits," Su Shangwei said.He said government restrictions on the family's freedom of movement, as part of the ruling Chinese Communist Party's "stability maintenance" program, was also causing problems."Stability maintenance is on high alert right now, and it's affecting the whole plan for her treatment," Su Shangwei said.The trigger for Su's detention on Oct. 27, 2014 appeared to be her publicly expressed support for the prodemocracy Occupy Central movement in Hong Kong.She was accused at her trial of "using the internet and social media to spread rumors and defamation, and repeatedly publishing or forwarding articles and posts containing attacks on the socialist system."The 79-day Occupy Central movement saw hundreds of thousands of people pour onto the streets in a campaign for full democracy, using umbrellas to protect themselves from sun, rain, and pepper spray, which gave the demonstration the nickname Umbrella Movement.But the movement ended with no political victory, and amid accusations from the ruling Chinese Communist Party that the civil disobedience campaign was being orchestrated by "hostile foreign forces" behind the scenes.'Arbitrary' detentionSu's detention has been judged "arbitrary" by the United Nations, which has called on Beijing to release and compensate her.The overseas-based Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) network, which compiles reports from rights groups in China, said the Chinese government makes "hollow claims" about its leadership in protecting the women's rights."Beyond the official rhetoric ... Chinese women face widespread discrimination and violence," it said in a statement on Friday, adding: "Rural women continue to face discrimination and deprivation of their land rights."It said women's rights activists have also faced ill-treatment in detention if they try to stand up for human rights."Refusals to release women defenders on medical grounds and to deprive proper medical care have become preferred tools of punishment for the government," CHRD said.It said detained lawyer Li Yuhan, who suffers from multiple heart conditions, has been subjected to "cruel and inhumane treatment" by guards at a detention facility in the northeastern city of Shenyang.Li's lawyer Lin Qilei said police guards currently "watch her" when she takes a shower and pay scant attention to her nutritional or medical needs."They watch her take a shower; they do it on purpose to teach her a lesson," Lin told RFA on Friday. "Of course we plan to complain to the state prosecutor and the police; we will be writing up the complaint in the next couple of days."He dismissed the charges of "picking quarrels and stirring up trouble" against his client."This basically means whatever they want it to mean; it's a charge that is usable for anything," he said, adding: "We will be pleading not guilty."Li's brother Li Yongsheng said his sister is also denied hot water to shower in."She had heart problems after showering in cold water, [and was] taken to the hospital for a checkup," he said. "I'm pretty sure she finds it unbearable [in there]."Reported by Yang Fan for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Wong Lok-to for the Cantonese Service.

Michael Dunne, president at US-based Dunne Automotive, told CNBC: "The Chinese government can, and will, facilitate autonomous driving sooner than we will in the United States," Dunne said.In June, Shanghai opened the country's first intelligent vehicle pilot zone, where its trialed about 200 vehicles across nine miles (15 kilometers) of test roads in a closed zone at Shanghai's international automobile city, the government said in a statement.The test zone uses cameras, communication bases, and radar systems to help intelligent vehicles drive in nearly 30 simulated environments.Shanghai is expected to build an intelligent-vehicle network covering about 62 miles (100 square kilometers) by 2020, the government said, adding that Shanghai will explore the possibility of connecting to major transportation junctions within the city.In September, Chinese search giant Baidu announced a $1.52 billion (10 billion yuan) autonomous-driving initiative called the "Apollo Fund" as part of a broader plan to spread technological advancement of autonomous vehicles.The Apollo Fund will invest in 100 autonomous driving projects over the next three years, Baidu said in a statement.NOW WATCH: The CIO of a crypto hedge fund explains the value in cryptocurrency - and why the market will explode over the next 2 yearsSee Also:• Here are the 21 best cars for winter weather driving• How China became a haven for people looking to cash in on the Bitcoin gold rush• DEUTSCHE BANK: A major financial crisis is almost twice as likely in China as anywhere else in the worldSEE ALSO: China's Baidu launches $1.5 bln autonomous driving fundLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

Gridsum Showcases AI Platform for China's New IP Legal Case System at Stanford Law School SeminarPR NewswireNovember 1, 2017 Wednesday 7:00 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1289 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Nov. 1, 2017 Body Gridsum Holding Inc. ("Gridsum" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: GSUM), a leading provider of cloud-based big-data analytics and artificial intelligence ("AI") solutions in China, today announced that management participated in a panel discussion and showcased its AI-enabled Intellectual Property Guiding Cases Service Platform ("IP Platform") at a seminar organized by Stanford Law School's China Guiding Cases Project ("CGCP"). The seminar was titled "On Building China's New IP Case System: A Discussion with Chinese Judges as well as Legal and Big Data Experts," and was held on October 19, 2017 at Stanford Law School.Gridsum was represented by Mr. John Jiyang Liu, chief technology officer, Ms. Scarlett Huijie He, VP of business development, Mr. Meng Wang, general manager of Gridsum legal services division and a former Beijing Haidian District Court Judge, and Ms. Yi Shu, director of Gridsum legal services division and a former Beijing Haidian District Court Judge.Mr. Liu also participated in a panel discussion alongside two judges from the Beijing Intellectual Property Court, Mr. Shuwei Jiang and Mr. Yijun Liu; as well as Prof. Leon Lee, executive director of the Case Law Research Center, School of Law of the Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing; Judge William A. Fletcher of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit; Stanford Law School Dean Elizabeth Magill; and Dr. Mei Ying Gechlik, founder and director of the CGCP. During the discussion, Mr. Liu explained the functionality and technology behind Gridsum's AI capabilities and the IP Platform for legal case analytics as well as the Company's collaboration with China's Supreme Court. Mr. Liu also gave a live demonstration of the IP Platform, which was jointly developed by Gridsum and the Beijing Intellectual Property Law Association and designed for the Supreme People's Court's Intellectual Property Case Guidance and Research (Beijing) Base.The seminar was organized by Dr. Gechlik and was attended by top intellectual property experts from China and the United States, as well as legal experts, law faculty and law students from the Silicon Valley area. The seminar explored topics including the enforceability of, and counterparty commitment to, judgements and rulings made by the Beijing Intellectual Property Court, whether the case law database will be open to the public, and whether foreign businesses and patent-holders will be able to use the system to protect their own intellectual property rights within China.  "I'm proud to have had the opportunity to showcase and discuss our AI platform's capabilities and how they can be applied to China's IP guiding cases system," commented Mr. Liu. "The IP Platform and its legal solutions form an integral part of our broader and comprehensive suite of legal solutions targeting China's 'Smart Court' initiative, along with prosecutors, law firms and others within the judicial ecosystem. We will continue to leverage our AI engine, including its real-time data analytics and massive processing power, to develop new and innovative tools for Gridsum's rapidly growing legal services division."The rollout of Gridsum's legal services product suite is accelerating within China's court system as it becomes a "must have" product for the court system itself as well as law firms, corporations, and other related groups. This development further highlights the Company's expectations for solid triple-digit growth in revenues from its legal suite in 2017.AI has been promoted to a higher level of China's national strategy, and the construction of a "Smart Court" system and "Smart Government" have also been positioned as important targets by the Chinese government. The Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan recently issued by the State Council outlined a goal of building an intelligent society and promoting intelligent social government.

Mobile payment applications surpass cash in Asian countriesThe Ticker: Baruch CollegeOctober 23, 2017 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 1Length: 838 wordsBodyAccording to a report published by the Boston Consulting Group, in 2016 Chinese residents used mobile payment apps to transfer approximately $8.5 trillion. Put in perspective, that is 70 times more than the figure transferred by U.S. residents. In addition, Forbes reported that 40 percent of Chinese consumers carry below RMB 100, or approximately less than $16, in cash regularly. PayPal conducted its own research on preferred payment methods in 2017 and found that only 25 percent of Chinese consumers still preferred cash during financial transactions. This all goes to show how substantially China's monetary preference has changed from cash to mobile payments.East Asian social media giant WeChat and the world's dominating e-commerce behemoth Alibaba Group have found ways to tap into hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers by taking advantage of the tremendous surge in Chinese smartphone users. This extends to mobile payment applications as well. Alipay, Alibaba's mobile payment system, and WeChat Pay dominated 94 percent of mobile payments made in 2016, according to Hillhouse Capital Group. Public transportation, including Chinese buses and subways, all accept Alipay as a form of primary payment. Small business owners, like restaurateur Ma Zhiguo in Hangzhou, China exclusively accept WeChat Pay and Alipay as a means of limiting the business' exposure to robberies, accepting counterfeit money and small change. Even social payments, including donations to beggars, street performers and religious institutions such as churches or temples, are frequently made through the mobile payment apps.As complex as the inner workings of these e-commerce programs are, they are still user friendly. Besides transferring money, one can also purchase items using these mobile apps. Alipay and WeChat Pay work through the scanning of QR codes, which are currently replacing barcodes, and directly transfer funds from customers to vendors. The mobile apps even allow users to create groups and simultaneously split payments that are made through their services.It has become easier for money to move freely between consumers and suppliers in the Chinese economy through Alibaba and WeChat. These companies have gone on to create greater financial change for their current and potential customers. After the tremendous success following Alipay's creation, Alibaba decided to allow its users to invest excess funds into Ant Financial Services Group. Ant Financial is the most valuable financial technology company in the world, and it owns and operates both Alipay and Yu'E Bao, a money market fund. After two years, Yu'E Bao has become the world's largest money market fund, with over 520 million users and $165 billion under management.A plethora of economists and financial analysts are preparing for mobile payment applications to take off in the United States like they did in China, but some are skeptical. One hindrance to the widespread adoption of mobile payment apps is that U.S. consumers are more concerned about their privacy than Chinese consumers are. The idea of privacy protection and preservation is absent in China, since the Chinese government monitors everything that its citizens do online, and controls what information they have access to.Besides that, many Chinese consumers would probably suggest that the issue of privacy is insignificant compared to the convenience that these applications provide.For example, as a result of the recent Equifax breach in the United States, Congress chose to host hearings regarding citizens' personal privacy. On the other hand, China just proposed and passed even more stringent internet regulations.These regulations add on to Article 4 of the policies released by the Cyberspace Administration of China, which states, "Providers of information services through internet chat groups on the internet, and users, must adhere to correct guidance, promoting socialist values, fostering a positive and healthy online culture, and protecting a favorable online ecology." Facebook and WhatsApp were banned in China using Article 4. In other words, the U.S. government and people are concerned with their own personal privacy, while the Chinese government and people do not regard one's personal privacy, at least on the internet, as important.Whether or not the mobile payment applications popular in China will propagate in America, the reception from Americans is certain to be mixed. Stephen Giangrande, a Macaulay Honors junior at Baruch College, stated that "I am hesitant to give my personal information to corporations, like mobile payment applications because they can manipulate my information for profit." Another Baruch junior, Josh Perloff, said "Monopolizing financial technology industries has always been something to remain fearful of."• About• Latest PostsLiam Giordano• Crafty districting ruins democracy - October 23, 2017• Mobile payment applications surpass cash in Asian countries - October 23, 2017• SHAP hosts talk on domestic abuse - October 23, 2017Load-Date: October 23, 2017End of Document

China: Police 'Big Data' Systems Violate Privacy, Target DissentTargeted News ServiceNovember 21, 2017 Tuesday 1:37 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3485 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyHuman Rights Watch issued the following news release:The Chinese government should stop building big data policing platforms that aggregate and analyze massive amounts of citizens' personal information, Human Rights Watch said today. This abusive "Police Cloud" system is designed to track and predict the activities of activists, dissidents, and ethnic minorities, including those authorities say have "extreme thoughts," among other functions.China has no enforceable protections for privacy rights against state surveillance."It is frightening that Chinese authorities are collecting and centralizing ever more information about hundreds of millions of ordinary people, identifying persons who deviate from what they determine to be 'normal thought,' and then surveilling them," said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. "Until China has meaningful privacy rights and an accountable police force, the government should immediately cease these efforts."The Chinese government has a long track record of amassing large amounts of information about citizens, and it is now actively exploring new technologies, such as big data analytics and cloud computing-based systems, to more efficiently aggregate and mine personal information. Authorities aspire to connect disparate databases to better enable data sharing and analysis across government departments, national and local levels, and from private sources.Chinese police are using various applications to analyze large volumes and varieties of data, including text, video, and pictures. These applications can deliver useful analytics in real or near-real time, such as monitoring traffic patterns. Chinese police have said the use of big data will improve the police force's ability to search for suspects, predict crime, and respond efficiently.But some of these systems also enable the police to arbitrarily gain unprecedented information about the lives of ordinary people, including those who have no connection to wrongdoing.One of the Ministry of Public Security's (MPS) most ambitious and privacy-violating big data projects is the "Police Cloud" system. The system scoops up information from people's medical history, to their supermarket membership, to delivery records, much of which is linked to people's unique national identification numbers. This allows the Police Cloud system to track where the individuals have been, who they are with, and what they have been doing, as well as make predictions about their future activities. It is designed to uncover relationships between events and people "hidden" to the police by analyzing, for example, who has been staying in a hotel or travelling together. It can also alert the police to activity that might seem unusual - such as when someone who has a local residence frequently stays in a local hotel.The fact that these systems are designed in part to track groups the authorities deem politically or socially threatening raises serious concerns about social and racial profiling. Through predictive policing, these platforms vow to analyze their past pattern of activities to "alert and warn" the police about their future activities so as to "more effectively intercept" them. Meng Jianzhu - the former Minister of Public Security and the current Secretary of the Communist Party Political and Legal Committee - which oversees the Party-state's police, procuratorate, and the courts - said in 2015 that big data is important to "find order... in fragmented information" and "to pinpoint a person's identity."Human Rights Watch has analyzed a number of tender documents from police bureaus in Shandong and Jiangsu Provinces, and Tianjin Municipality, as well as academic and press reports. Human Rights Watch has primarily focused on these three regions because these documents are publicly available; Shandong and Jiangsu Province also claim to have some of the most established Police Clouds in the country. The tender documents reviewed for Shandong include those published by police bureau in the major cities of Jinan, Tai'an, and Weihai; for Jiangsu, Yancheng City; for Tianjin, the document was published by the Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau.These tender documents were published between 2015 and September 2017. The Tianjin Police Cloud - at around US$4 million (27 million RMB) - is the most expensive.The Police Cloud system appears to be a national project. In 2015, the MPS issued a regulation on information sharing, ordering aggregation of data and the construction of provincial-level Police Clouds, which form the basis of a national Police Cloud database."As the Police Cloud soaks up ever more data about citizens, a perfect storm is on the horizon," said Richardson. "With authorities increasingly able to track everyone's every move, what's at stake across China isn't just people's privacy - it's also many of the rights they hold."Aggregation of citizens' data from government and business sourcesThe Police Cloud system aims to integrate different types of information, including data routinely gathered by China's police, such as residential addresses, family relations, birth control methods, and religious affiliations. The cloud platforms will also integrate hotel, flight and train records, biometrics, CCTV footage, and information from other government departments and even private companies.In Weihai City, Shandong Province, the Police Cloud aims to integrate 63 types of police data and 115 types of data from 43 other government departments and industries (click here for the list). Among the data government collects are patient records - including names and illnesses - obtained from the National Health and Family Planning Commission; names and causes of petitioners - individuals who complain to the government, usually for official abuses - from the State Bureau of Letter and Visits; and the names and addresses of individuals convicted of crimes from the Bureau of Justice. The Police Cloud will also aggregate company data, including user names and their IP addresses from telecoms companies; usernames of their social media accounts (wechat, weibo, QQ, and email) from internet forums; and senders' and receivers' names, phone numbers, and declared package content from delivery companies.In Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province, a state press article explained that the police purchase company data from third parties. The information purchased includes "navigation data on the internet, [and] the logistical, purchase and transaction records of major e-commerce companies." Some of this data is collected in real-time, according to the article: "In the past police officers would go door to door to collect data, and at most they could collect information from 40 to 50 households; now every day the machines collect data continuously." This data includes MAC addresses (a unique hardware identifier of a computer or other networked device) and router information of Internet users.Big data systems with intrusive 'insights' and predictive policingThe Police Cloud system aims to enable police to "visualize" hidden trends and relationships between people in the sea of data. They provide interfaces called "Police Qiandu", a play on China's popular search engine, "Baidu") in Shandong, and "Sky and Earth E-Search" in Tianjin, which allow officers to search for and monitor individuals, vehicles, and cases of concern. The system can also be trained to alert police of people, relationships, and events of interest based on the data and patterns it analyzes. For example, the Jinan system will alert the police of what seems to them like unusual activity - such as when someone who has a local residence frequently stays in a local hotel - analyzing collected data of hotel and hostel lodging, vehicle movements, and express delivery.A key feature of these systems is to discover relationships not otherwise apparent to the authorities. The big data system in Jinan will allow police to search for those who "are closely related to persons of concern." This means, for example, finding out who "has gone to internet cafes together more than twice, or has travelled together twice" with the persons of interest. Once these relationships are found, police "can further mine and analyze [information about] this related individual," and the system can also display this data as relationship maps. Similarly, the Tai'an Police Cloud allows the police to visualize relationships by analyzing those "who travel, who live, who work together; who go on the internet; who share the same hukou [China's household registration system]; who share the same family members; and who are involved in the same case."The Police Cloud system is also designed for surveilling groups of people the police are most concerned about, such as those the government considers to be most threatening to regime stability. The MPS defines these "seven categories of 'focus personnel'": petitioners, those who "undermine stability," those who are involved in terrorism, major criminals, those involved with drugs, wanted persons, and those with mental health problems who "tend to cause disturbances."In effect, local police can decide that virtually anyone is a threat and requires greater surveillance, especially if they are seen to be undermining stability. There are no legal avenues for people to be notified of this designation, or contest it. A tender document from Tianjin describes its Police Cloud as capable of monitoring "people of certain ethnicity," "people who have extreme thoughts," "petitioners who are extremely [persistent]," and "Uyghurs from South Xinjiang." Xinjiang is a region with 11 million minority Muslims called Uyghurs, most of whom live in the south of the region and whose rights are heavily repressed. The Tianjin system says it can pinpoint the residences of these individuals and track their movements on maps. In Yancheng City, Jiangsu Province, the Police Cloud can "give rapid feedback" on the trajectory of "vehicles driven by focus personnel, by those involved in drugs... and vehicles [registered in] Xinjiang" on a map.Another feature of these systems is so-called "predictive policing." Analyzing past crime data, behaviors, and movements, the system purports to predict future criminal activities. Police may want to use these systems, for example, to target certain locations at certain times at which the behaviors of interest most likely will take place.The tender document of the Jinan Police Cloud says it will "analyze the focus personnel who have come to Jinan and their cases...watch them and warn [the police] of [their presence] according to combinations of characteristics including ethnicity, criminal offense records, and others." On the basis of such analysis, this system will generate and send analytics to handheld devices of police officers on a daily or weekly basis.The officers are reported receive some of these analytics from a Shandong Police Cloud every morning at 8:00 a.m. According to an article on Shandong Legal Daily:"...The 'Morning at 8' system... aggregates information from the area from the day before, including information about cases, ethnicity, hometowns, as well as information from police intelligence, hotel and hostel [registration], Internet cafes, civil aviation and other systems. The cloud system then analyzes this information for abnormality and trends... and sends them to the police officers' mobile phones at every morning at eight o'clock."This system is designed to catch "focus personnel." The article quotes an officer as saying:"Every day at eight o'clock... based on our location and subscription options, the system sends us targeted messages; in particular, it alerts us to individuals who are involved in terrorism and in [undermining] social stability who've entered our jurisdictions."The article illustrates such predictive policing with one example:"At 12:54 on September 17, 2015, a drug user named Mai went to stay at... a hotel in Dongying District, and officers from the Yellow River Police Station went to check on him after receiving an SMS alert from the 'Morning at 8' system. After investigation, [the police discovered] that Mai's sister, named A, has been punished for 'endangering state security.' According to the relevant mechanism, police then subject Mai to key [personnel] monitoring."The system seems to have alerted the police because Mai had been listed as having a record of drug use. The article goes on to say that the system can "find out where ethnic minorities and those with a criminal record gather and stay for the long term," information which guides police patrols.The predictive policing programs also purport to track people involved in terrorism. Human Rights Watch has criticized the Chinese authorities for using terrorism allegations to justify the suppression of peaceful dissent, particularly against Uyghurs.As the Chinese police continue to build these systems, there are many challenges to their efficacy and functionality. According to academics, the police have encountered resistance from other government agencies when collecting information; frontline officers have not been diligent enough in collecting useful or complete information; the information collected under various programs is inconsistent and difficult to reconcile; and few officers have the skills to conduct big data analysis for their work.Two big data experts who reviewed this press release also suggest that China's police may not yet have enough data points to track large numbers of people in real time. Chinese police have access to all hotel, flight, and train records. China is developing facial recognition and automatic number plate recognition on CCTV footage to improve the ability to track people, according to available evidence. The police also have access to stored location data held by telecom, mobile, and internet providers, but it is less clear whether they have access to ongoing data streams. An added challenge is that this kind of tracking can exact heavy requirements in terms of data storage, computing and analytical resources.Big data policing in Chinese law and international lawIn recent years, the Chinese government and the Communist Party have issued a number of directives and regulations on the collection, integration, and sharing of data to improve "social stability" - a euphemism that concerns creating an outward appearance of calm through suppressing crime as well as political dissent. In 2014, the MPS issued a notice about the construction of a smart personal data collection system between 2016 and 2020 that can "strengthen the ability to issue early warning concerning the abnormal behavior of key personnel." In 2015, an MPS leadership meeting adopted a set of principles on "Strengthening the Collection of Basic [Policing] Information" , and vowed to increase the use of big data and cloud computing in policing. Also in 2015, the Office of the Central Committee of the CCP and the General Office of the State Council issued an "Opinion on the Strengthening of the Construction of Social Security Prevention and Control Systems," which includes using technological means including cloud computing and big data to achieve "social stability." There are also provincial-level directives; Shandong police issued several directives in 2014 on integrating data and building a Police Cloud.Current Chinese laws also do not meet international privacy standards enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which China has signed but not ratified. Those require that the collection, retention, and use of the personal data of individuals for policing purposes must be both a necessary and proportionate means to handle a genuine threat to a public interest such as national security or public order, in the sense that it is the least intrusive measure to accomplish that end.China does not have a unified privacy or data protection law to protect personally identifying information from misuse, especially by the government. The police do not have to obtain any sort of court order to conduct surveillance, or provide any evidence that the people whose data they are collecting are associated with or involved in criminal activity. Police bureaus are not required to report surveillance activities to any other government agency or to publicly disclose this information. In practice, there are no effective privacy protections against government surveillance. It is very difficult for citizens to know what personal information the government collects, and how the government uses, shares, or stores their data. There is no way for citizens to know if they are being classified as "focus personnel," much less to challenge their treatment if so classified, or if associated with people designated "focus personnel." Those who try to investigate government surveillance are vulnerable to being charged with crimes including "stealing state secrets."The government, however, has a number of laws that empower state agencies and private companies to collect and use information concerning citizens, and government departments as well as local governments have issued numerous directives, rules, and regulations to collect and use miscellaneous information. State security-related legislation, such as the State Security Law, invests police and other state security agents with the broad power "to collect intelligence involving state security." The Cybersecurity Law, while imposing requirements on network operators to keep user data confidential and to get consent before collecting it, also compels internet companies to store user data in China and provide undefined "technical support" to security agencies to aid in investigations.The government's use of big data and predictive policing exacerbates already widespread violations of the right to privacy in China. Policing algorithms and big data analytics rely on large datasets. As more police departments build cloud-based policing systems, they collect more and more personal data, including through their own increased surveillance activities and through cooperation with the private sector. As conceived, the Police Cloud system will lead to enormous national and regional databases containing sensitive information on broad swaths of the population, which could be kept indefinitely and used for unforeseen future purposes. Such disproportionate practices will intrude on the privacy of hundreds of millions of people - the vast majority of whom will not be suspected of crime.Also directly at risk are the rights to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, and freedom of association. By the government's own description, these systems are designed to track, monitor, and potentially detain and prosecute "focus personnel" and anyone who may travel, meet, or communicate with them. Such predictive policing systems will thus place individuals under suspicion and surveillance merely because they have associated with "persons of concern."Big data analytics that rely on social media monitoring and the aggregation of online activity can also further chill freedom of expression. If users fear that their every weibo post or chat will be used to determine whether they are a threat to security, it may increase self-censorship online.These systems are also likely to have a discriminatory impact on ethnic minorities and other groups. This is in part by design: the government severely represses the ethnic minority Uyghur population as part of its counterterrorism campaign. Tender documents show that the Police Cloud system is in part specifically designed to monitor Uyghurs and "people of certain ethnicities."In addition to the human rights concerns mentioned above, serious questions remain as to whether predictive policing tools can reliably direct police attention to areas at highest risk for crime. In the US, for example, various police departments have begun using predictive policing systems to locate crime "hotspots" or individuals who are most likely to become involved in crime. But these systems train on data of past police reports, which may not reflect the pattern of actual risks. What results is prediction simply of the targets at which police enforcement actions are typically directed, not the places or people that actually are most involved in crime.Preventing crime is a legitimate state interest, but predictive tools often point to the same old patterns, making it likely for policing to replicate old mistakes or biases such as targeting of people of lower socioeconomic status. This throws into doubt whether the use of these predictive tools adds much new, and whether they are either a necessary or proportionate intrusion on the rights of individuals.This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 19, 2017.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6081951 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 21, 2017End of Document

Those who try to investigate government surveillance are vulnerable to being charged with crimes including "stealing state secrets."The government, however, has a number of laws that empower state agencies and private companies to collect and use information concerning citizens, and government departments as well as local governments have issued numerous directives, rules, and regulations to collect and use miscellaneous information. State security-related legislation, such as the State Security Law, invests police and other state security agents with the broad power "to collect intelligence involving state security." The Cybersecurity Law, while imposing requirements on network operators to keep user data confidential and to get consent before collecting it, also compels internet companies to store user data in China and provide undefined "technical support" to security agencies to aid in investigations.The government's use of big data and predictive policing exacerbates already widespread violations of the right to privacy in China. Policing algorithms and big data analytics rely on large datasets. As more police departments build cloud-based policing systems, they collect more and more personal data, including through their own increased surveillance activities and through cooperation with the private sector. As conceived, the Police Cloud system will lead to enormous national and regional databases containing sensitive information on broad swaths of the population, which could be kept indefinitely and used for unforeseen future purposes. Such disproportionate practices will intrude on the privacy of hundreds of millions of people the vast majority of whom will not be suspected of crime.Also directly at risk are the rights to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, and freedom of association. By the government's own description, these systems are designed to track, monitor, and potentially detain and prosecute "focus personnel" and anyone who may travel, meet, or communicate with them. Such predictive policing systems will thus place individuals under suspicion and surveillance merely because they have associated with "persons of concern."Big data analytics that rely on social media monitoring and the aggregation of online activity can also further chill freedom of expression. If users fear that their every weibo post or chat will be used to determine whether they are a threat to security, it may increase self-censorship online.These systems are also likely to have a discriminatory impact on ethnic minorities and other groups. This is in part by design: the government severely represses the ethnic minority Uyghur population as part of its counterterrorism campaign. Tender documents show that the Police Cloud system is in part specifically designed to monitor Uyghurs and "people of certain ethnicities."In addition to the human rights concerns mentioned above, serious questions remain as to whether predictive policing tools can reliably direct police attention to areas at highest risk for crime. In the US, for example, various police departments have begun using predictive policing systems to locate crime "hotspots" or individuals who are most likely to become involved in crime. But these systems train on data of past police reports, which may not reflect the pattern of actual risks. What results is prediction simply of the targets at which police enforcement actions are typically directed, not the places or people that actually are most involved in crime.Preventing crime is a legitimate state interest, but predictive tools often point to the same old patterns, making it likely for policing to replicate old mistakes or biases such as targeting of people of lower socioeconomic status. This throws into doubt whether the use of these predictive tools adds much new, and whether they are either a necessary or proportionate intrusion on the rights of individuals.Region / CountryLoad-Date: November 20, 2017End of Document

Google is opening a new AI research centre in China (GOOG)Business Insider USDecember 13, 2017 Wednesday 05:19 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 630 wordsByline: sshead@businessinsider.com,  (Sam Shead)Highlight: The company also does AI research in New York, Toronto, London, and Zurich.BodyREUTERS/Beck Diefenbach• Google is opening a new artificial intelligence centre in China.• There is a fierce battle for AI talent taking place between the world's biggest technology companies. • China is home to some of the smartest minds in the field of AI and Google is keen to recruit them.Google is opening a new artificial intelligence (AI) research centre in China as it looks to expand further into the country and capitalise on the nation's highly regarded AI expertise.AI is one of the most competitive fields on the planet right now and tech companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, and Apple are searching far and wide for the best talent, offering hundreds of thousands of dollars in the process.The Google AI China Center will consist of a small group of researchers supported by several hundred China-based engineers, according to Bloomberg.The move is interesting given Google's complex relationship with China. Some of the company's best-known products have been blocked by China's government in recent years. But top executives at Google are keen to expand into the country. Eric Schmidt, chairman of Google parent company Alphabet, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai have visited the country this year. As have the leaders of DeepMind, an AI research lab in London that was bought by Google in 2014.Fei-Fei Li, chief Scientist of AI/ML (machine learning) at Google Cloud, and one of the centre's leaders, announced the new Beijing facility in a blog post on Wednesday. "I am excited to launch the Google AI China Center, our first such center in Asia," Fei-Fei Li wrote."This Center joins other AI research groups we have all over the world, including in New York, Toronto, London and Zurich, all contributing towards the same goal of finding ways to make AI work better for everyone."Fei-Fei Li will run the centre with Jia Li, head fo research and development at Google Cloud AI.The centre will publish its own research and support the Chinese AI community by funding and sponsoring AI conferences and workshops, Fei-Fei Li said.Google uses AI to automatically classify images and to power its voice assistant, which sits inside products like Google Home. But Fei-Fei Li warned that work needs to be done to ensure that AI needs to remain a benefit to all of humanity."As technology starts to shape human life in more profound ways, we will need to work together to ensure that the AI of tomorrow benefits all of us," she said. "The Google AI China Center is a small contribution to this goal. We look forward to working with the brightest AI researchers in China to help find solutions to the world's problems."Eric Schmidt thinks China will overtake the US on AI by 2025 Last month, Schmidt warned that China is poised to overtake the US in the field of AI if the US government doesn't act soon.Speaking at the Artificial Intelligence and Global Security Summit, the former Google CEO said: "Trust me, these Chinese people are good."He added: "It's pretty simple. By 2020 they will have caught up. By 2025 they will be better than us. And by 2030 they will dominate the industries of AI. Just stop for a sec. The [Chinese] government said that."Schmidt said that Chinese people "tend to win many of the top spots" in Google's coding competitions."If you have any kind of prejudice or concern that somehow their system and their educational system is not going to produce the kind of people that I'm talking about, you're wrong."NOW WATCH: France's $21 billion nuclear fusion reactor is now halfway completeSee Also:• Ethics watchdog: Facebook, Google, and Twitter should be prosecuted for illegal content• Google is launching 3 new experimental apps on both Android and the iPhone• Microsoft has set up an internal AI University to try and get around the skills shortageLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

US should hold China accountable on human rightsCNN WireOctober 5, 2017 Thursday 5:01 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1032 wordsByline: By Marco Rubio and Chris SmithDateline: (CNN) BodyEditor's note: Marco Rubio and Chris Smith, both Republicans, are the Chair and Co-chair respectively of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. Marco Rubio is the junior senator from Florida and Chris Smith is the US representative for New Jersey's 4th district. This piece expresses solely the views of the authors and has been adapted in part from the Congressional-Executive Commission on China's 2017 report.  (CNN) --  Next month, President Donald Trump plans to visit Beijing, a trip that will come amid rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula, persistent trade concerns and a raft of other thorny issues in US-China relations. While the President has sought to build a strong personal relationship with Chinese President and Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping -- in part to yield cooperation on North Korean proliferation -- the administration must develop a long-term policy approach that challenges China to abide by its international commitments, adhere to universal standards and embrace the rule of law. Principled American leadership is needed now more than ever. In recent years, the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China's (CECC) annual reports have found that under President Xi's leadership, China has failed to deliver on long-promised economic reforms and has become more authoritarian domestically. It is also increasingly dismissive of international norms and "Western" ideas, and more assertive in its extraterritorial reach. The CECC's 2017 Annual Report, which will be released on Thursday, documents even more regression. Although President Xi has stressed the need for global connectivity and openness, domestic censorship leaves little room for journalism and public debate -- just last week the use of WhatsApp, a popular messaging app, was blocked. As stated in the report, China "continues to strengthen the world's most sophisticated system of internet control and press censorship and forges ahead with what it calls 'internet sovereignty.'" Xi has worked hard to consolidate his power, demanding strict ideological discipline from Party and government officials and using an extensive anti-corruption campaign to eliminate many of his political rivals. Over the past year, Chinese authorities targeted labor and environmental activists; demanded loyalty from scholars and intellectuals; and clamped down on foreign non-governmental organizations, media outlets, think tanks, and internet companies. Restrictions on religious freedom also intensified, particularly in ethnic minority Tibetan and Uyghur areas. Coercive enforcement of population control policies continued in violation of international standards. And the government persisted in forcibly repatriating North Korean refugees to face near certain persecution and even death, in contravention of China's international legal obligations.Twenty years after the British handover of Hong Kong the long-term viability of the "one country, two systems" model designed to safeguard autonomy and judicial independence in Hong Kong from Beijing's control is increasingly uncertain given brazen central government interference and the imprisonment of pro-democracy Umbrella Movement leaders. Despite promises by the Chinese government to establish the rule of law, it still uses the law to repress and control, as seen with the Foreign NGO law, which stifles the ability of Chinese NGOs and rights advocates to partner with foreign NGOs and work on issues deemed politically sensitive by authorities. Similarly, the cybersecurity law lacks basic free speech and intellectual property protections. If the law is implemented as written, foreign companies may have to choose between breaking the law or aiding Chinese security agencies.This year also saw the tragic death of Liu Xiaobo, the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, while he was in state custody. His untimely death reminded the international community of the appalling treatment experienced by China's political prisoners -- more than 1,400 of which are contained in the CECC's Political Prisoner Database. Authorities continue to arbitrarily detain his widow, the artist and poet Liu Xia.The activities of China's human rights lawyers and civil society advocates were also further criminalized and credible reports emerged of their torture in detention. In the face of constant harassment, several of the lawyers' wives have courageously and effectively become advocates for their spouses, often at great risk to themselves and their children. These issues necessitate high-level engagement from US policymakers and elected officials, beginning with Trump, who should challenge his Chinese counterpart to keep the many promises he made regarding China's commitment to the rule of law, the opening of the Chinese economy and free trade, adherence to the rules-based international order, and reciprocity. Chinese government repression may temporarily satisfy a desire to control its citizenry and maintain its grip on power, but such measures often have the unintended consequence of stoking resentment and prompting activism in individuals who may have otherwise chosen not to engage. As China suppresses authentic religious expression, the number of religious adherents multiplies; as China censors the Internet, circumvention tools proliferate; as China brutally represses rights lawyers, their loved ones take up the mantle of their cause. While the current Chinese government may never be the responsible stakeholder envisioned by proponents of Beijing's entry into the World Trade Organization 16 years ago, we must not forget that the desire for freedom, justice, and democratic openness are not alien to China or its people. America must stand for its own interests, but it is in America's interests to see the Chinese government uphold human rights norms, respect the rule of law, and adhere to universal standards. President Trump would do well to remember, even in the midst of heightened diplomacy on North Korea, that governments which trample on the basic rights of their own citizens are unreliable international partners.TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Women in Tech Are Rising Higher in China Than in the U.S.Atlantic OnlineNovember 13, 2017 MondayCopyright 2017 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1373 wordsByline: Sarah LacyBodyI spent much of the summer of 2015 covering the absolute unraveling of Uber China, a multibillion-dollar effort that failed spectacularly. When Uber ultimately admitted defeat in 2016, Shonda Rhimes couldn't have scripted the narrative better.This article is adapted from Lacy's            new book.Uber had devastated competitors in each market, and its Chinese competitor Didi Chuxing turned Uber's game on itself. Didi was the only ride-sharing company in the world whose resources rivaled Uber's, backed by two of the largest Chinese internet companies and several of the largest hedge funds in the world. And while there was never any evidence of the Chinese government making life any worse for the American company in the market, Didi obviously had the home-field advantage when it came to working politics in China, if it came down to that.And China was already the largest ride-sharing market in the world by rides. In January 2016, Didi announced it had completed 1.4 billion rides in 2015, some 40 percent more than the 1 billion rides it took Uber eight years to rack up. Uber was not the largest ride-sharing company in the world by a large and widening margin, despite its bravado and its valuation.And the face of Didi in the fight was its president and COO, Jean Liu. A woman. A mother.As I dusted off more and more of my China contacts in reporting this story, I was struck by how many of the C-level officers running Chinese companies were women. And how many of them were CEO, COO, CFO, or even CTO. They weren't merely the token senior woman on the team running HR or marketing. It was far more pronounced than the "Get me a Sheryl!" trend in Silicon Valley, which was still limited to a dozen or so companies.Silicon Valley Bank has a huge practice in China, and they were intrigued by anecdotal evidence of a major gender disconnect between the two tech hubs. They did a study of 900 or so clients across the United States, the United Kingdom, and China, examining how women fared at the senior levels. The results were hard to believe for Americans who hadn't done business in the tech world in China, and obvious to those who have.When asked how many women have C-level jobs at their company, 54 percent of U.S. tech companies answered "one or more." Similarly, 53 percent in the United Kingdom answered "one or more." In China, nearly 80 percent answered "one or more."I don't even think that tells the whole story, because anecdotally many of the Chinese companies I've spoken with have more than one senior woman and these women are in a larger variety of roles.At the board level, only 34 percent of U.S. companies said they had one or more female directors on their board. Thirty-nine percent of U.K. companies said they had one or more female directors. Sixty-one percent of Chinese companies had one or more female directors.Even crazier, when asked if these companies had programs in place to increase the number of women in leadership positions, 67 percent of those in the United States said no, and 80 percent of those in the United Kingdom said no. Meanwhile, 63 percent of those in China said yes. Women in China have substantially higher representation at the top of corporations, and yet more of these companies have programs geared toward creating greater equality. These three stats taken together show the rebuttal of the "queen bee" myth in action: When enough senior women are empowered in an organization, they overwhelmingly support other women.It's the good kind of entitlement. The kind white men have in America.In the venture-capital landscape in China, it is even more extreme, as Bloomberg reported in September 2016. According to their numbers, among the top firms in the United States, women make up 10 percent of the investing partners and only half of the firms have any female investing partners at all. In China, 17 percent of partners are female and a stunning 80 percent of firms have at least one woman investing.Because firms with just one female partner are twice as likely to back female entrepreneurs, this has had a huge ripple effect on women's roles in the ecosystem. The Chinese government says that women have founded 55 percent of new internet companies and more than 25 percent of all entrepreneurs are women.Yes, those stats came from the Chinese government. But clearly the "pipeline" of women to sit on far more tech boards and occupy so many senior jobs at tech companies is coming from somewhere. While the percentages may not be quite that high, women are getting more opportunity at seemingly every stage of the tech ecosystem in China.Bloomberg profiles the very press-shy Chen Xiaohong, who just raised a new $500 million fund, the largest in the world run by a woman. The largest female-run fund in the United States is half that size. In total, Xiaohong controls more than $1 billion in assets under management.My favorite part of the Bloomberg piece was her comments on motherhood:Through it all, she raised three children. Her work habits would have been unusual, if not unacceptable, in the West. She brought her firstborn son to the office every day for three years.She says that bringing her children helped build a bond with many of the entrepreneurs she backed. Her son did cry and disrupt meetings, but that didn't stop her. It gave her a chance to develop a more personal relationship with founders.As I dug into this more, I found several common views of why things are so different for professional mothers in China. One is that the tech industry in China is both fledgling and a massive opportunity all at once. All sorts of people with nontraditional experience get opportunities they wouldn't have in a more mature ecosystem.But that doesn't come close to explaining all of it. A lot of it is cultural, too. Some of it goes back to communism, when Mao Zedong said women "held up half the sky" and they were expected to work just as hard to provide for the many. They labored in the fields and historically even fought alongside men in wars. "They needed the entire population to be working," Zhao says of the 1950s era. The older precapitalist generation of women simply were never given the choice not to work, not to serve the government in some way.And yet, even stranger than "thanking" Chinese communism for women's current success in the tech industry, the one-child policy comes up in every conversation I've had about this topic. That's not a shock because for 35 years it affected how one in six people on the planet were "born, live, and die," according to Mei Fong's excellent book One Child: The Story of China's Most Radical Experiment.Let me say in as emphatic terms as possible: No matter how many Chinese women become C-level officers, the one-child policy was not a coup for feminism. There are horror stories of forced ninth-month abortions, 20 million forced sterilizations, and some 60 million missing Chinese girls-killed, aborted, or seized and adopted away.Despite all this, even Fong notes, there was exactly one group who did benefit from this policy: urban Chinese women.If you are a female born after 1980 in a major Chinese city, your chances of surviving past childhood, getting enough nutrition, and attaining higher education are significantly better than those of a Chinese daughter born in any earlier period this century or last.As a result record numbers of women in China are receiving a college education. In 2010, women made up half of the master's-degree students in China. The country's female labor-force participation is among the highest in Asia, with 70 percent of Chinese women either employed in some capacity or seeking employment, compared to just a quarter of their Indian sisters.What China is creating in its tech sector are new role models and new patterns. And that matters more now to Silicon Valley than it might have a decade ago, because their companies are competing with ours. It was a Chinese company, not Lyft, that humbled and beat Uber. And the public face of that fight was a woman. A mother. That matters for China, but it matters for the United States, too.This post is adapted from Lacy's new book,            A Uterus Is a Feature, Not a Bug: The Working Woman's Guide to Overthrowing the Patriarchy.Load-Date: December 27, 2017End of Document

Stories from Slate; Countries are increasingly putting limits on how data travels.Slate MagazineNovember 20, 2017 Monday 11:03 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive Company, LLC. All Rights ReservedSection: FUTURE TENSE; TechnologyLength: 1200 wordsByline: Josephine WolffHighlight: Countries Are Increasingly Imposing Borders on the CloudBodyAmazon may well be one of the companies with the strongest data security in the world. The company has never been responsible for a major, public breach of customer data (unless you count the recently revealed breach of Whole Foods, purchased by Amazon this summer). Even the CIA            relies on Amazon Web Services for secure data storage. So it's striking, though not surprising, to read last week's inevitable announcement that the company is            selling the hardware component of its cloud computing business in China in order to comply with the country's            new cybersecurity law, which went into effect earlier this year. Amazon isn't getting out of China altogether-according to            CNBC, "Amazon said that it is only selling 'certain physical assets' and still owns the intellectual property for AWS worldwide"-but this is nevertheless a big change for the company.So why would a country want to diminish a company with an incredible security record in the name of strengthening its data security?The law focuses, in part, on data localization, requiring that all sensitive data about Chinese citizens or national security be stored domestically on servers within China. This could be an onerous requirement for international firms, like Amazon, that regularly move and copy data across their network of data centers. In light of the law, Amazon's move to sell its China-based infrastructure to Beijing Sinnet Technology Co. Ltd, a Chinese firm, hardly came as a surprise. Other U.S.-based tech firms, including Apple,            Oracle, and            Microsoft, had already taken similar steps to transfer control of Chinese data to Chinese firms.There are two broad reasons a country might be interested in localizing its data within its own borders. One is that data might be less secure if it's stored in or transmitted through other countries, either because those nations could place less stringent security requirements on companies and infrastructure, or because their governments might themselves intercept or collect that data stored on servers within their jurisdictions. The other reason data localization sometimes appeals to governments is because it means that any of their citizens' data will be squarely within the reach of their own jurisdictions, should they want to collect or access it for investigations.There's some truth to both of these arguments-that foreign governments may have an easier time seizing data flowing through their own countries and that data within your own borders is more accessible. But localizing data to specific countries can actually undermine security protections. Of course, shifting Chinese data off servers owned and operated directly by Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple almost certainly makes that data more accessible to the Chinese government-presumably that's part of the point. But the law may not help protect sensitive Chinese data against foreign espionage or cybercriminals, either.For instance, U.S. intelligence agencies can, in many cases, collect data much more freely overseas than they can within the United States. That's because they can assume that any overseas data belongs to foreigners unless they're specifically targeting someone they know to be a U.S. person. Within the United States, the government often has to clear more legal hurdles in order to collect data. Outside the United States, those legal hurdles largely disappear and the government doesn't have to go through courts to access stored data. But that also means the U.S. government can't rely on courts to force companies to turn over stored data.The most compelling reason to trust companies like Amazon with sensitive data is their proven record at providing and maintaining the necessary technical measures and monitoring to protect that data from intruders. Indeed, several U.S. tech companies have been at the forefront of beefing up their security to protect against U.S. government espionage efforts in the aftermath of the leaks by Edward Snowden about U.S. surveillance programs.The Chinese companies that have now taken control of the China-based hardware operations as partners of U.S. cloud companies may or may not have equally strong technical security measures in place. But they can more easily ignore policy-based attempts on the part of the U.S. government to obtain data through legal mechanisms such as warrants. Whether U.S.-based companies can refuse to comply with warrants that request access to data stored in foreign countries and belonging to foreign citizens is still uncertain-it hinges on the outcome of a case to be heard by the Supreme Court this term about Microsoft trying to fight a warrant to turn over data stored in a data center in Ireland.If the Supreme Court agrees with Microsoft that the government cannot access foreigners' data stored in overseas data centers, more countries may begin to request or require that data stay within their borders, where it is effectively out of reach of U.S. law enforcement. They could work with foreign companies to make that happen. But if the Supreme Court instead sides with the Justice Department, those countries may instead decide they would rather rely on domestic companies for data storage, as China is now doing.Either way, regulations about how and where data is stored would detract in some ways from the promised efficiency and security benefits of cloud computing. Part of the point of cloud computing is that resources can be reallocated, and data shifted around, to allow for fluctuations in different customers' activity. Similarly, part of the point of entrusting your data to Amazon Web Services is being able to rely on a big company with the resources to employ an expert security team to provide security for you. Making it harder for cloud computing companies to move data between countries also makes it more difficult for them to make efficient use of their servers by allocating resources to different customers depending on when they most need them, or storing data wherever it is cheapest to do so. Moving that data out of the hands of those providers would mean losing their technical security expertise.China's willingness to harness Amazon to a domestic hardware operator suggests just how much fears of foreign cyber espionage have shifted from technical concerns to policy-based ones. If China were trying to protect its data from technical maneuvers by the U.S. government, there is almost no one better poised to guard against those efforts right now than the major U.S.-based tech firms that have invested considerable time and resources in demonstrating their commitment to securing data against their own government. Instead, China appears more concerned about the U.S. government using legal means, like warrants, to seize data stored by those companies. To protect against that possibility, they're willing to sacrifice all the technical security of companies like Amazon for the reassurance of domestic companies beyond the legal reach-if not necessarily the technical reach-of foreign governments.This article is part of , a collaboration among            ,            , and Slate.

SinoBBD Highlights the Power of the Integrated "cloud" at Cloud Connect China 2017PR NewswireSeptember 13, 2017 Wednesday 10:59 PM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 854 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Sept. 13, 2017 BodyThe highly anticipated Cloud Connect China 2017 opened at Shanghai World Expo Exhibition & Convention Center on September 5. As one of the largest cloud computing events in China, the event attracted thousands of CIOs, CTOs, technology developers and enterprise-grade end users in finance, manufacturing, e-commerce, education and medicine, among other popular application areas. Beijing Big Data Group (SinoBBD), a leading big data company in China, was invited to attend the event.At the event, Dr. Shuaiyu Wang, chief executive officer of Beijing SinoBBD Tech Co., Ltd. delivered a keynote speech entitled SinoBBD Cloud: Down to the Earth, Mind and Hand, followed by in-depth discussions with industry leaders and technology professionals about the transition to the cloud trend in what is being termed the Internet Plus era as well as the future development of the cloud computing industry. Dr. Shuaiyu Wang also shared the salient points and advantages of innovative SinoBBD Cloud products and discussed how to safeguard national data sovereignty and help companies empower the cloud ecosystem through industry-wide integration. The speech was well received by attendees.Stand on solid ground and walk the talkIn the thriving Internet Plus era - the Chinese government's program to stimulate the application of the internet and other information technologies in conventional industries, the fast-growing cloud computing industry has gone through a process of rapid development, from proposal to maturity as well as from concept to implementation. With the popularity and wide adoption of the cloud, cloud computing is evolving from simply being a technology that operators and firms are putting into practice to one that is showing more attributes as a tool, as reflected by the upward migration of the core value and the transition from public to hybrid cloud.At the event, Dr. Shuaiyu Wang said that companies must overcome three obstacles - trust, resources and capital - in order to set oneself apart from the competition in the cloud computing sector, and SinoBBD has the strength and confidence to overcome the three obstacles.Trust: SinoBBD, has the credit endorsement of a state-owned company and maintains strong relationships with governments and operators. The group, a domestic leader in the cloud computing sector, is a member of the team of companies responsible for shouldering the mission of safeguarding national data sovereignty.Resources: the group has implemented a data center cluster distribution following what the company has termed the "3+10+X" strategy (3: Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou as three key markets; 10: ten internet backbone cities across China; X: other Chinese second- and third-tier cities with substantial electrical power resources) and owns multiple product lines, among them, data center, content delivery network (CDN), cloud and big data management platforms including business units that are responsible for growing the international segment of each of these verticals. SinoBBD's technological prowess serves to assist the firm in building the integrated industry portfolio.Capital: SinoBBD has partnered with Huarong Emerging Industries Investment & Management Co., Ltd. to establish a big data fund of 20 billion yuan (approx. US$3 billion), fully supporting the group's efforts to expand and grow the cloud business and help companies empower the cloud ecosystem. The big data fund aims to accelerate the development of cloud applications and the realization of commercial value through the creation of the largest public industry cloud in China.Commenting on SinoBBD Cloud's business portfolio, Dr. Shuaiyu Wang said that the benefits from possessing advantages as a result of the firm's leading position within the industry, as well as access to resources and capital, paved the way for the transformation of its cloud business from one that was focused on a narrow vertical to one that encompasses the breadth of the entire industry. The group has integrated its powerful resource network to combine its supply and marketing systems and create the SinoBBD Cloud industry ecosystem, following on with expansion across a wide range of sectors spanning big finance, big health, smart cities and Agriculture 4.0 (the application of precision farming).

REMARKS BY AMBASSADOR LUO ZHAOHUI AT THE 2ND CHINA-INDIA TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER, COLLABORATIVE INNOVATION AND INVESTMENT CONFERENCE FROM CHINESE EMBASSY IN INDIANStates News ServiceNovember 16, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 1397 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:Shri Rajeev Shukla, Member of Rajya Sabha, Chairman of India China Trade Centre,Shri S. N. Tripathy, Additional Secretary and Financial Advisor of Ministry of Agriculture,Dr. Anup Chandra Pandey, Commissioner of Infrastructure and Industrial Development Department, Government of Uttar Pradesh,Mr. Hou Shuqian, Head of the Chinese delegation, Director General, Yunan Academy of Science and Technology,Ladies and gentlemen,It is a great pleasure for me to attend this conference, together with friends from the Chinese and Indian governments as well as sectors of technology, innovation and investment to promote cooperation and exchanges between China and India. This conference serves as a platform for exchanges between China and India's technology and industry communities. It is also a vivid epitome of "Dragon-Elephant Tango" and our win-win cooperation. This conference will contribute significantly to our technology, innovation and investment cooperation, and to the development of China-India relations.The recently-concluded 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China pointed out that as socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, China has been transitioning from high-speed growth to high-quality development. China has made it clear that innovation is the primary driving force behind development and it is the strategic underpinning for building a modernized economy. We have decided to make China a country of innovators and a scientific and technological powerhouse to better meet people's aspirations for a better life.China has been actively exploring social and economic development through technological innovation. In recent years, China put technological innovation at the centre of its overall national development, devoted great energy to implementing the innovation-driven development strategy, and issued policy guidance such as Outline of the National Strategy of Innovation-Driven Development and National Technology Transfer System Program. China has been promoting fundamental research, original innovation and cutting-edge technology breakthrough, facilitating the transfer and commercialization of scientific and technological achievements, and creating a sound environment for mass entrepreneurship and innovation. Huge progress has been made in technological innovation. Driven by the innovation strategy, China has made great achievements in science and technology, such as the Tiangong-2 space lab, the deep-sea manned submersible Jiaolong, the five-hundred-meter aperture spherical telescope (FAST) Tianyan, the dark matter probe satellite Wukong, and the quantum science satellite Mozi. China's four great new inventions, the high-speed railway, online shopping, online payment Alipay and sharing bicycles, have established remarkable reputation across the globe.As the world's largest developing countries, China and India share many similarities in development stage, population size and the demand to improve people's well-being. We have many common goals in technological innovation, and are highly adaptive to and compatible with each other in technology transfer. Over the past years, China and India has made solid progress in technology, innovation and investment cooperation. The two countries have carried out a number of joint research projects, and witnessed an increase in technology transfers as well as transnational start-up investments. For instance, with technologies from China First Metallurgical Group Co., Ltd, Bhilai Steel Plant of Steel Authority of India managed to save 10% of its costs. Many Chinese venture capitals have invested in Indian Internet companies such as Paytm. A Chinese company has just set up an internet startup incubator called "Zhudao Lab" in Gurgaon. Competitive Indian enterprises in IT, pharmacy and consultancy like Infosys and TATA have also entered Chinese market. In the Sino-Indian Software Industry Park in Linyi city, Shandong province, more than a hundred Indian software engineers work together with their Chinese counterparts. They help and learn from each other, and jointly start their businesses.China is now striving to build a moderately prosperous society in all respects and a great modern socialist country. India is pressing ahead with "New India" and is making great efforts to implement its own national strategies such as "Make in India", "Startup India", "Digital India" and "Smart Cities". During this new historical era and in the midst of a new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, the "Chinese Dream" and the "New India" create broad potential for cooperation. China-India technology and innovation cooperation has a bright future. A lot more could be done. With this in mind, we stand ready to work with India in the following aspects:First, we need to establish innovation cooperation mechanisms. China has established innovation cooperation mechanisms, such as "Innovation Dialogue", with the United States, the UK, Russia and Israel, etc. Based on the existing China-India Joint Committee on Scientific and Technological Cooperation, the two countries could establish inter-governmental innovation cooperation mechanisms and platforms to plan and guide China-India cooperation in science, technology and innovation in the new era. In technology transfer, we should expedite the establishment of China-India Technology Transfer Centre at the national level.Second, we need to deepen key-area cooperation. China and India should enhance cooperation in new energy and jointly tackle climate change by developing new and renewable energy projects such as solar power and electric vehicles. We should strengthen cooperation in environmental protection technologies, and jointly development technologies in haze treatment and the prevention and control of water pollution. We should strengthen cooperation in agricultural science and technology, and support each other in the development of hybrid rice and ecological agriculture. China has achieved significantly in the cultivation of hybrid rice. A team led by the famous "Father of Hybrid Rice" Yuan Longping has created another world record this year, with per hectare yield of single-cropping rice reaching more than 17 tons. We should strengthen internet and ICT cooperation. Chinese companies like Huawei, Alibaba and Tencent are working with Reliance, Paytm, Flipkart and other Indian companies to carry out many cooperation projects. We should strengthen AI technology cooperation, jointly seize the opportunities presented by the new round of AI scientific and technological revolution and tackle its challenges. We should enhance cooperation in traditional medicine. The traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda are treasures of China and India respectively. We should jointly revitalize our traditional medicine by means of modern science and technology, and make greater contribution to mankind. We should enhance cooperation in science and technology finance and ensure that venture capitals can better serve innovation-driven companies in both countries. China's Shenzhen Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange are in talks with each other for the establishment of Sino-India Innovative Capital Alliance and Sino-India Innovative Enterprise Service Platform supported by governments and with innovation enterprises and financial service sector as leading actors.Third, we need to promote exchanges between scientists and engineers. In particular, we should increase exchanges between young scientists on a larger, more regular and institutionalized basis.Fourth, we need to enhance cooperation in the research and sharing of policies and theories of technological innovation. China and India are actively exploring respective paths to become a rich and strong country through technological innovation. Both countries have undertaken many studies and practices in advancing innovation and entrepreneurship, the building of smart cities, as well as in green and coordinated development. The two sides can share their development philosophies, policies and experiences, engage in mutual learning, draw on each other's merits in a bid to achieve common development.To conclude, I wish this conference a great success. Thank you!Load-Date: November 20, 2017End of Document

CHINESE CORPORATE ESPIONAGE, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT AGAINST AMERICANS THE FOCUS OF TALLAHASSEE HEARING BY CONGRESSMEN MATT GAETZ, NEAL DUNNStates News ServiceAugust 4, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 413 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: TALLAHASSEE BodyThe following information was released by the office of Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz:Bing Energy to be Spotlighted as Anecdotal Evidence of Such TreacheryTALLAHASSEE Amid mounting concerns over corporate espionage and questionable trade practices by the People's Republic of China and Chinese entities within the United States, North Florida Congressmen Matt Gaetz (FL 1st District) and Neal Dunn (FL 2nd District) will hold a hearing into the alarming pattern of theft of scientific trade secrets and other improper activities. The hearing, "Wanton Loot: How China Is Stealing Ideas from American Entrepreneurs," will be held in the Turnbull Conference Center on the campus of Florida State University on Wednesday, August 30, from 1-2:30 pm (Eastern time)."There are too many signs to ignore the likelihood that the Chinese government is behind blatant acts of thievery of technology and systems designed in the United States," said Rep. Gaetz, a Fort Walton Beach Republican. "One glaring example took place right in Tallahassee, and we're going to hear the details so we can fight back to protect our ideas as much as our people, communities, businesses, and borders in the future."Gaetz, who is convening the hearing, said the experience of Tallahassee-based Bing Energy will be a high-profile component of the hearing. The company suffered the intellectual property theft of advanced energy technology by Chinese nationals who then established a separate company in their native country, based on that technology. Local investors and company officials are seeking justice through legal channels."We in Congress cannot sit by and watch our biggest global competitor try to get an edge by stealing from our creative, inventive and entrepreneurial society to profit from the work being done in the United States," said Rep. Dunn, a Panama City Republican whose district includes Tallahassee.It is estimated that intellectual property theft in the form of stolen trade secrets, pirated software, counterfeiting, and other nefarious schemes costs the United States more than $225 billion every year and China is one of the main offenders. These crimes stifle American entrepreneurs and diminish economic growth in our country.The public hearing will provide a forum for industry experts and business owners to have a thoughtful discussion about the need to protect America's intellectual property from oversees threats and how this affects both small businesses and major corporations.Load-Date: August 4, 2017End of Document

Ahead Of Trump Visit, US Again Refuses To Qualify China As Market EconomyThe FrontrunnerOctober 31, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 361 wordsBodyBloomberg News (10/30, Mayeda, 4.52M) reports that the Commerce Department on Monday "again refused to qualify China as a market economy, adding to tensions" between the two nations days before President Trump's first trip to Beijing. The state's pervasive role in markets and involvement in the private sector causes "fundamental distortions" in China's economy, the Commerce Department said in a memo following a review of China's market status. "At its core, the framework of China's economy is set by the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party, which exercise control directly and indirectly over the allocation of resources through instruments such as government ownership and control of key economic actors and government directives," the memo added.Reuters (10/30, Brunnstrom, Spetalnick), meanwhile, reports China's Ambassador to Washington, Cui Tiankai, said Monday that Trump's visit to Beijing next week was a historic opportunity to boost cooperation between the two countries, but warned against attempts to "contain" Beijing. Cui also "stressed the urgency of efforts to find a negotiated solution" to the North Korea crisis and warned of a "more dangerous" situation if tensions between the US and Pyongyang continued.Xi To CEOs: China Will Continue To "Open Up."The New York Times (10/30, Mozur, Buckley, Subscription Publication, 13.56M) reports that days after being elevated by the Communist Party, Chinese President Xi on Monday "reiterated his commitment to reform while holding court before a group of wealthy and influential business leaders from his country and the United States." Xi, speaking at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing during a nationally televised event that included Apple CEO Tim Cook and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, said, "China is advancing comprehensive deepening of reform with unprecedented determination and vigor," and "will continue issuing a series of measures to further open up." The Times says the event - just a week before President Trump is scheduled to make his first visit to China - "was most likely arranged to signal China's status as an economic superpower and peer of the United States."Load-Date: October 31, 2017End of Document

CHAIRS RELEASE 2017 ANNUAL REPORT--ANNOUNCE NEW INITIATIVES ON HONG KONG AND COMMEMORATION OF LIU XIAOBOStates News ServiceOctober 5, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 2472 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Congressional-Executive Commission on China:Chairs announce intention to nominate Hong Kong's Umbrella Movement for the Nobel Peace Prize and introduce legislation to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Liu Xiaobo.Media Contact: 202-226-3777(WASHINGTON, DC) U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) and U.S. Representative Chris Smith (R-NJ), Chair and Cochair of the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), today issued the Commission's 2017 Annual Report and announced several joint initiatives on Hong Kong and commemoration of the late Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, and Chinese political prisoner, Liu Xiaobo.The CECC's 2017 Annual Report provides detailed analysis on human rights conditions and rule of law developments in China, and offers recommendations on ways to integrate these issues into U.S.-China relations.The full report can be accessed on the CECC's website. A letter transmitting the Annual Report to President Trump includes a summary of the report's main findings and recommendations. Letter text can be found below."The Commission's 2017 report documents continued deterioration of human rights and the rule of law in China, as President Xi Jinping consolidates power in advance of the 19th Party Congress slated for later this month," said Senator Rubio. "Chinese authorities are ruthlessly targeting human rights lawyers and advocates; clamping down on foreign NGOs, media outlets and Internet companies; restricting religious freedom particularly in ethnic minority Tibetan and Uyghur areas and forcibly repatriating North Korean refugees to near certain persecution and even death. This year the central authorities further intervened in the affairs of Hong Kong, disqualifying democratically elected legislators and jailing pro-democracy leaders. In the face of this repression, the universal desire for basic human rights persists. This report is dedicated to the late Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and political prisoner Liu Xiaobo, whose hopes for the Chinese people, articulated in his essays, poetry and ultimately Charter 08 remain aspirational. As President Trump heads to China next month, he must press China to uphold international human rights norms, respect the rule of law, and adhere to universal standards.""At the cost of American jobs and security, the Chinese government has become more repressive domestically, more protectionist in its trade policies, and more assertive globally. The Administration is going through a review of its China policy at the moment, the Annual Report has recommendations that can assist them develop strategies that link American values and interests--it should be required reading at the White House, at the State Department, and by all Members of Congress," said Smith. "Nothing good happens in the dark that is why the Administration should shine a light on the Chinese government's failures to abide by universal standards, shine a light on the cases of tortured and abused political prisoners, shine a light on China's unfair trade practices and still coercive population control policies. A freer and more democratic China is a critical U.S. interest, and it should be pursued in tandem with other U.S. diplomatic, economic, political, and security priorities."The Chairs announced their intention to work on several joint initiatives during the upcoming year including:Nomination of Hong Kong's Umbrella Movement for the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize: The Chairs stated their intention to nominate Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, Alex Chow and the entire Umbrella Movement for the prize, citing their peaceful efforts to bring political reform and protect the autonomy and freedoms guaranteed Hong Kong in the Sino-British Joint Declaration.Congressional Commemoration of Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Liu Xiaobo: The Chairs announced bicameral legislation to award Liu Xiaobo, and the Chinese Democracy Movement, the Congressional Gold Medal. The CECC also announced its intention to start a "Liu Xiaobo Fellows Program."Both Chairs commended the capable and professional work of the CECC's research staff in producing the Commission's 16th Annual Report.The text of the transmittal letter accompanying the 2017 Annual Report can be found below.________________________________________________________________October 5, 2017President Donald J. TrumpThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NWWashington, DC 20500Dear Mr. President:We transmit to you the 2017 Annual Report of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (the Commission) as required by the U.S.-China Relations Act of 2000 (Public Law No: 106286). Under this legislative mandate, the Commission monitors and reports on human rights violations and the development of the rule of law in China, and provides recommendations to address these issues in U.S.-China relations.The Commission's structure, consisting of a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators, Representatives, and senior-level Administration officials, is intended to foster cooperation between the legislative and executive branches, and promote bipartisan attention to critical issues in U.S.-China relations. In the coming year, we hope the Administration can appoint Commissioners from the Departments of State, Labor, and Commerce, as required by the Act.The Commission's Annual Report comes out on the eve of the 19th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party and prior to your upcoming visit to China. The topics covered by our Annual Report remain some of the most contentious issues in bilateral relations and are critically linked to the protection of U.S. national interests.Over the past several years, the Chinese government has become more protectionist in its trade policies, more authoritarian in domestic politics, increasingly dismissive of international norms and "Western" ideas, and more assertive in expanding its extraterritorial reach globally.The Commission's 2017 Annual Report further documents the Chinese government and Communist Party's continued efforts to silence dissent, criminalize activities of human rights lawyers, control civil society, suppress religious activity, and restrict the operations of foreign media outlets, businesses, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) over the past 12 months. The report also provides evidence that Chinese authorities arbitrarily detained and tortured political prisoners, forcibly repatriated North Korean refugees, and continued to implement coercive population control polices, in violation of China's international obligations.These issues necessitate high-level engagement from U.S. policymakers and elected officials. As your administration pursues a China policy review, we commend the Annual Report's findings and policy recommendations to your attention, as we believe they will assist in developing strategies to advance U.S. interests and maintain principled U.S. leadership on issues of human rights and development of the rule of law in the vital Asia-Pacific region.Based on developments this past year, the report identifies the following key areas that merit the focus of Congress and the Administration in the coming year:Law as an Instrument of Repression. The Chinese government continues to use the law as an instrument of repression to expand control over Chinese society, while outwardly providing the veneer of a system guided by the rule of law. In the past year, the government moved forward with implementing a series of far-reaching new laws that provided the basis for broader and more severe crackdowns on ethnic minority groups and human rights defenders, censorship of the Internet, and restrictions on foreign NGOs and international businesses that operate in or trade with China. The report recommends that the Administration seek a rules-of-the-road agreement that ensures reciprocal treatment for U.S. institutions, businesses, and nationals operating in China and urges the Administration to coordinate with allies, businesses, and NGOs to develop a unified strategy to respond to China's unfair industrial policies, digital protectionism, and the PRC Law on the Management of Overseas NGOs' Activities.Human Rights Lawyers Viewed as Security Threat. Persistent reports emerged of human rights lawyers and advocates being arbitrarily detained on state security-related charges, for which Chinese law permits officials to enforce de facto incommunicado detention. These rights lawyers and advocates are denied due process rights, tortured in detention, and forced to "confess" to crimes they did not commit. Rights lawyers and their families were subject to constant surveillance and restrictions on their freedom of movement. Pressure on the activities of human rights defenders continues to be an issue of concern. The report recommends that the Administration consider more expansive use of existing U.S. laws, such as the Global Magnitsky Act, to hold accountable Chinese officials complicit in arbitrary detentions, torture, disappearances, and other severe human rights violations. The report also urges the Administration to deny requests for repatriation of Chinese citizens accused of corruption until the Chinese government can demonstrate that it is meeting due process protections consistent with international human rights norms and has ended both torture in detention and all forms of arbitrary detention.Severe Violations of Religious Freedom. The report notes the Chinese government's efforts to expand its political influence and control over the activities of religious communities through more restrictive regulations, at both the national and local level, with particularly severe abuses occurring in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) and Tibetan autonomous areas. Efforts to shutter and harass Protestant Christian "house churches" and the demolition of renowned Tibetan Buddhist institutes of learning, Larung Gar and Yachen Gar, are particularly concerning developments. The report recommends expanded U.S. leadership on international religious freedom through coordinated multilateral efforts and bilateral interactions that stress the strategic and economic value of promoting this fundamental freedom. The report also recommends that the Administration fully implement the Tibet Policy Act of 2002 and produce guidelines for U.S.-China counterterrorism dialogues so that the United States does not condone China's crackdowns on peaceful political dissent or restrictions on the freedoms of religion or expression in ethnic minority areas.Challenges to Hong Kong's "High Degree" of Autonomy. The actions of the mainland Chinese and Hong Kong governments during the past reporting year continue to raise concerns about the long-term viability of the "one country, two systems" model. The preemptive intervention of the National People's Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC), and the subsequent disqualification of six democratically elected legislators, raised serious concerns about Hong Kong's autonomy, its guaranteed freedoms, and the rule of law. In July 2017, the Hong Kong Court of Appeals sentenced Nathan Law, the youngest of the disqualified legislators, along with fellow pro-democracy leaders Joshua Wong and Alex Chow, in connection with their activities during the 2014 pro-democracy protests. The three had already completed community service sentences when the Hong Kong Department of Justice pursued the harsher sentences, raising concerns about the political nature of these prosecutions. Given the important economic interests the United States has in Hong Kong, and China's international commitments to protect a "high degree of autonomy" in Hong Kong, the Commission recommends that the administration continue to issue annually the report on Hong Kong outlined in Section 301 of the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992. In addition, the report recommends that the Administration and Congress work together to determine how to protect U.S. interests in Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms, including through consideration of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act (S. 417 and H.R. 3856).Shining a Light on Political Prisoners. The Annual Report highlights multiple political prisoner cases, including human rights lawyers and rights defenders, citizen journalists, labor and environmental advocates, religious leaders, and advocates for ethnic minority rights, Tibetans, and Uyghurs. The Commission urges Members of Congress and the Administration to consistently and publicly advocate for political prisoners because experience demonstrates that raising individual cases can result in improved treatment, lighter sentences, and in some cases, release from custody. The report recommends that the Administration create a Special Advisor for Political and Religious Prisoners to coordinate prisoner advocacy across the entire U.S. government. The Commission maintains an extensive Political Prisoner Database as a resource, with over 1,400 cases of currently detained political prisoners in Chinaa staggering but far from exhaustive figure.Making Human Rights a Strategic Priority. The U.S.-China relationship is marked by both growing interdependency and competition, and the issues covered by the Annual Report are among the most contentious in our bilateral relationship. Principled U.S. leadership is needed to develop a long-term policy approach that challenges China to abide by its international commitments, adhere to universal standards, and embrace the rule of law. In addition to the recommendations made above, the report suggests a focus on reciprocity, internet freedom, human trafficking, digital protectionism, protecting North Korean refugees, and addressing the problem of China's "missing girls." It urges the Administration to develop an action plan that will facilitate interagency coordination on human rights and develop coordinated approaches that prepare all agencies to pursue measurable, results-orientated human rights and rule of law outcomes. A freer and more democratic China is a critical U.S. interest and this goal should be pursued in tandem with other U.S. diplomatic, economic, political, and security priorities.While the Chinese government may not be the responsible global stakeholder envisioned by many proponents of China's entry into the World Trade Organization 16 years ago, we must not forget that the desire for freedom, justice, and democratic openness are not alien to China or its people. These are universal principles that will further U.S. interests and be the foundation for a more peaceful, prosperous, and better future for the citizens of both China and the U.S.The Commission and its staff stand ready to assist in any way to carry out the report's recommendations or further explain its findings.Sincerely,Marco Rubio Chris SmithChair CochairLoad-Date: October 8, 2017End of Document

AP Exclusive: China accuses outspoken tycoon in US of rapeAssociated Press InternationalSeptember 1, 2017 Friday 3:07 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; Only on APLength: 1687 wordsByline: By GERRY SHIH, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Escalating efforts to repatriate one of the ruling Communist Party's most wanted exiles, Chinese police have opened an investigation on a new allegation, rape, against New York-based billionaire Guo Wengui, who has been releasing what he calls official secrets ahead of a pivotal party leadership conference.Two Chinese officials with direct knowledge of the investigation told The Associated Press that police are requesting a second Interpol arrest notice for Guo, 50, for the alleged sexual assault of a 28-year-old former personal assistant.Guo and his representatives did not respond to repeated requests for comment, though Guo told a Chinese news outlet Friday the rape allegations were a Chinese government ploy to silence him.The rape allegation represents a new element in the sprawling case that Chinese prosecutors are building against the real estate tycoon, who is being investigated for at least 19 major criminal cases. Allegations against him include bribing a top Chinese intelligence official, kidnapping, fraud and money laundering.The Associated Press reviewed documents related to the rape investigation and confirmed their contents with Chinese official sources in Beijing, who requested anonymity to discuss an ongoing case. The Chinese officials' disclosures to the AP - an unusual move given the political sensitivity of Guo's case in China - underscores Beijing's urgent effort to not only bring a fugitive to heel on criminal charges but also silence a potent irritant in the run-up to a key Communist Party congress during which political stability and the stifling of any challenges to the party head, President Xi Jinping, are paramount.Although the United States does not have an extradition agreement with China, Beijing hopes that a mounting body of evidence could sway the U.S. government against extending the exiled businessman's visa, which is believed to expire in October, the Chinese officials said.Senior U.S. and Chinese officials have discussed the allegations against Guo, according to a third person with direct knowledge of the talks. The Chinese officials are asking the U.S. to cancel Guo's visa, according to the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to disclose the discussions.It's unclear what steps Washington plans to take, if any. The White House would not comment on the matter.The Guo saga highlights how China's efforts to repatriate elite Chinese seeking refuge on American soil have become increasingly contentious. The U.S. government has often refused Beijing's demands to extradite corruption suspects, citing flimsy evidence and China's opaque justice system. But the U.S. has sent back two Chinese fugitives in the past three months, including one suspected of rape.In recent months, Guo has become a widely followed - and, in the eyes of China's leadership, highly destabilizing - social media presence by serving up sensational, if mostly unverifiable, tales of corruption and scandal within the Communist Party's innermost sanctum, including among Xi's closest allies.In a daily stream of Twitter posts and YouTube videos tracked by Chinese who follow political gossip, Guo has revealed what he claims are everything from top leaders' secret homes in California to their bank account information and hidden stakes in business empires. He has vowed to continue airing the party's secrets until China unfreezes his assets and releases his relatives who have been detained by authorities, he says, as leverage against him.Pressure on Guo has been building since April when Interpol issued a "red notice" seeking his arrest on corruption-related charges. Chinese authorities later sentenced several of his employees for fraud in June.Police in central China opened the rape investigation July 5 after a former employee came forward, the officials said.In interviews with police, the woman described how she was plucked from her human resources position at Guo's real estate company in Hong Kong in 2015 and sent overseas to become his personal assistant. The woman, whose identity is being withheld by the AP, said that over the next two years, she was raped several times in New York, London and the Bahamas by Guo, who she said demanded sex from female employees as a test of their loyalty.At times, she said, she languished in virtual detention after Guo's staff confiscated her smartphone, computer, passport and keys and forbade her from leaving her room in his luxury apartment in the high-end London neighborhood of Belgravia. To prove her case, the woman surreptitiously met a lawyer friend in London earlier this year to give a written statement about her ordeal and kept her underwear, pregnancy tests and abortion pills as evidence, according to police documents.In a brief phone interview with the AP arranged by Chinese officials, the woman confirmed the account and described fleeing Guo's apartment to the Chinese Embassy in London in April to apply for a new passport before returning to China. She said she was speaking of her own volition and that police had assured her she could bring charges against Guo without facing repercussions for having worked for a highly sought-after fugitive."I just want him to face justice for what he did to me," she said.Calls to Guo's mobile phone since Tuesday evening in New York rang unanswered. Guo also did not respond to multiple requests for comment sent by an AP reporter to his WhatsApp mobile messaging account since Tuesday. Lawyers representing him at the New York firm Boies Schiller Flexner did not respond to requests for comment.In a livestreamed interview early Friday with Mingjing News, a Chinese-language overseas news outlet blocked in China, Guo said the rape allegations were "100 percent baseless.""If I really raped (the accuser) repeatedly, why didn't she accuse me in New York after the first time, where the law is stronger? Why in China?" he said, adding sardonically that it would have been "great" if he had been detained by police and kept in the U.S.Guo also acknowledged he received an AP request for comment two days ago and did not respond. "I wanted them to publish," Guo told Mingjing.Interpol declined to comment about the latest warrant China is seeking for Guo's arrest, referring questions to national authorities as is the policy in ongoing investigations.Born into poverty in central China, Guo transformed himself from a humble gasoline speculator into a real estate mogul who jet-setted with the likes of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Key to his spectacular rise, according to investigative profiles in Chinese media, was an ability to befriend officials in China's powerful security apparatus who helped him intimidate business rivals, secure deals and gain insights into the secret lives of the Chinese elite.In one instance, according to these reports, Guo won the rights to build the iconic Pangu tower in 2006 as part of Beijing's Olympics development project by working with Ma Jian, who later became China's chief of counterintelligence, to obtain a sex tape of a Beijing vice mayor who had blocked Guo's initial bid.In 2015, anti-corruption investigators detained Ma and later accused him of accepting $8.8 million in bribes from Guo, who fled the country. Prior to that, Guo had enjoyed a mutually beneficial relationship with China's intelligence service, even helping to repatriate overseas fugitives, he later said in his YouTube videos.Guo in 2015 hired American private investigators to fan out across the U.S. to look for Ling Wancheng, the fugitive brother of a disgraced top aide to a former Chinese president who possibly sought to defect, a person involved in that search effort told the AP. The person was legally barred from discussing the case publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.Months later, Chinese agents arrived in the U.S. to search for Ling in a covert operation that angered U.S. officials, underscoring how the issue of politically connected Chinese fleeing to the U.S. has strained relations."With political cases such as Ling Wancheng and Guo Wengui, the U.S. seems reluctant to send them back because both have valuable classified information about the top echelons of the party," said Willy Lam, an expert on Chinese politics at Chinese University of Hong Kong. "This phenomenon is a big plus for the CIA and FBI."Lam said that although it is unlikely that Washington would send Guo back given his intelligence value, President Donald Trump "could potentially play the 'fugitive card' to put pressure on Beijing to make concessions on issues ranging from trade to North Korea."The prospect of becoming a bargaining chip has worried Guo, according to a leaked audio recording of a meeting he held earlier this year with former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, who offered to lobby the Trump administration for a visa extension.A spokeswoman for Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, the law firm where Johnson is partner, said a meeting between Guo and Johnson "several months ago about a possible representation appears to have been recorded and released," but the firm ultimately did not take on Guo as a client."I want to help you," Johnson says in the edited recording that recently surfaced online. "I am the only member of Barack Obama's Cabinet that has met with Donald Trump."In the recording, Johnson suggests Guo meet with FBI agents and consider donating to human rights organizations to strengthen his case to remain in the U.S. After Guo expresses concern that Trump had already "made a deal" with the Chinese, Johnson and an unidentified woman who appears to be a Guo adviser quickly assure him that Trump would not give him up."He would be violating your rights," Johnson says, while the adviser points out that Guo, who goes by the name Miles Kwok, should also consider his membership in a Trump resort in Florida as a factor working in his favor."Miles is a member of Mar-a-Lago," she says, before Guo bursts into laughter.___AP writers Lori Hinnant in Paris and Julie Pace in Washington contributed to this report.Load-Date: September 1, 2017End of Document

US charges 3 Chinese nationals with hacking, stealing intellectual property from companiesCNN.comNovember 27, 2017 Monday 1:20 PM ESTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 524 wordsByline: By Evan Perez, CNN Justice CorrespondentBodyThe Justice Department on Monday unsealed an indictment against three Chinese nationals in connection with cyberhacks and the alleged theft of intellectual property of three companies, according to US officials briefed on the investigation.But the Trump administration is stopping short of publicly confronting the Chinese government about its role in the breach. The hacks occurred during both the Obama and Trump administrations.The charges being brought in Pittsburgh allege that the hackers stole intellectual property from several companies, including Trimble, a maker of navigation systems; Siemens, a German technology company with major operations in the US; and Moody's Analytics.The three charged in the Pittsburgh case are presumed to live in China and are either employed or associated with Guangzhou Bo Yu Information Technology Co., known as Boyusec, court documents say. US intelligence and private cybersecurity experts say Boyusec works as a contractor for the Chinese ministry of state security, that nation's version of the National Security Agency. The court documents unsealed Monday don't mention the Chinese state links.US investigators have concluded that the three charged by the US attorney in Pittsburgh were working for a Chinese intelligence contractor, the sources briefed on the investigation say. But missing from court documents filed in the case is any explicit mention that the thefts were state-sponsored.A 2015 deal between then-President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping prohibits the US and China from stealing intellectual property for the purpose of giving advantage to domestic companies.In recent months some US intelligence agencies have concluded that China is breaking the agreement, sources briefed on the matter say. But there's debate among intelligence officials about whether there's sufficient evidence to publicly reveal the Chinese government's role in the infractions, these people say.Obama administration officials had touted the Obama-Xi agreement, as well as 2014 Justice Department charges against members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army for commercial espionage, for reducing some of the Chinese cyberactivity against companies in the US.But the 2015 Obama-Xi deal was met with skepticism inside the US agencies whose job it is to guard against Chinese cyberactivity targeting US companies. Some now say there was only a brief drop in the number of cyberspying incidents, if at all.In the waning months of the Obama administration, intelligence officials briefed senior White House officials on information showing that the Chinese cyberattacks were back to levels previously seen, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Early in the Trump administration, US intelligence officials briefed senior officials, including the President and vice president, as well as advisers Jared Kushner and Steve Bannon.At the same time, some Trump administration officials have raised concerns about whether to confront China over the cyber intrusions at a time when the administration is trying to get cooperation from the Chinese government on North Korea and other issues.Load-Date: November 28, 2017End of Document

But missing from court documents filed in the case is any explicit mention that the thefts were state-sponsored. A 2015 deal between then-President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping prohibits the US and China from stealing intellectual property for the purpose of giving advantage to domestic companies. In recent months some US intelligence agencies have concluded that China is breaking the agreement, sources briefed on the matter say. But there's debate among intelligence officials about whether there's sufficient evidence to publicly reveal the Chinese government's role in the infractions, these people say. Obama administration officials had touted the Obama-Xi agreement, as well as 2014 Justice Department charges against members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army for commercial espionage, for reducing some of the Chinese cyberactivity against companies in the US. But the 2015 Obama-Xi deal was met with skepticism inside the US agencies whose job it is to guard against Chinese cyberactivity targeting US companies. Some now say there was only a brief drop in the number of cyberspying incidents, if at all. In the waning months of the Obama administration, intelligence officials briefed senior White House officials on information showing that the Chinese cyberattacks were back to levels previously seen, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Early in the Trump administration, US intelligence officials briefed senior officials, including the President and vice president, as well as advisers Jared Kushner and Steve Bannon. At the same time, some Trump administration officials have raised concerns about whether to confront China over the cyber intrusions at a time when the administration is trying to get cooperation from the Chinese government on North Korea and other issues. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Renesas Electronics to Set Up 'New Energy Vehicle Solution Center' to Accelerate Efforts in Chinese New Energy Vehicle MarketTargeted News ServiceOctober 31, 2017 Tuesday 10:21 PM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 542 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: TOKYO BodyRenesas Electronics, a supplier of advanced semiconductor solutions, issued the following news release:Renesas Electronics Corporation ("Renesas", TSE: 6723), a premier supplier of advanced semiconductor solutions, today announced it will establish a "New Energy Vehicle Solution Center" on November 1, 2017, directly under the China Business Unit to accelerate engagement with the Chinese new energy vehicle (NEV) market.With the announcements by the governments of Britain and France of policies aimed at prohibiting the manufacture and sale of gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles by 2040, the trend away from gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles and toward electric vehicles (EVs), and plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHVs) is gathering pace. China has positioned EVs, PHVs, and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) as "NEVs" and considers this sector to be a strategic national industry. The Chinese government has announced a policy aimed at expanding production and sales of new energy vehicles to 2 million units annually by 2020 and increasing the share of total automobiles produced and sold accounted for by new energy vehicles to more than 20 percent by 2025. To accelerate this effort and to expand the transition into NEV, the Chinese government has also announced its plan to implement a credit-score program from 2018, which make carmakers that manufacture or import NEVs obliged to obtain a NEV score, which is linked to the average amount of fuel consumption and the proportion of the number of NEVs they import. Under these regulations, China is expected to drive the adoption of NEVs worldwide.Renesas recognizes that China is now the world's largest market for new energy vehicles and an advanced market for new energy vehicle development. As such, Renesas will establish the new organization in order to actively engage in local innovation and market opportunities, and to reflect these insights in the planning and development of solutions as well as the formulation and implementation of plans for cultivating new business.

It has partially blocked popular messaging apps like WhatsApp and stepped up its censorship of images deemed politically sensitive.Earlier in the year, Chinese authorities announced a widening crackdown on VPNs, which use encryption to bypass online filters -- a move they defended last week by saying it is aimed at "cleaning" the internet.Apple's decision to remove the VPN apps in China was widely criticized, with many saying it was aiding and abetting Chinese censorship. ExpressVPN, one of the popular apps that was delisted, said in a blog post that it was "disappointed" and "troubled" by the tech giant's decision.But Cook defended the move, saying it was no different to Apple's compliance with local regulations in all its markets."We would obviously rather not remove the apps, but like we do in other countries we follow the law wherever we do business," he said.He also disputed comparisons made by some critics between Apple's treatment of Chinese government requests and its refusal last year to help U.S. authorities unlock the phone of one of the perpetrators of the San Bernardino terrorist attack."In the case of the U.S., the law in the U.S. supported us. It was very clear," Cook said. "In the case of China, the law is very clear there ... We have to abide by them in both cases. That doesn't mean that we don't state our point of view in the appropriate way."This is not the first time Apple has drawn criticism for doing the Chinese government's bidding. The company removed multiple apps belonging to the New York Times from the App Store in China in December.It has also been at the receiving end of Chinese censorship, with its iBooks and iTunes Movie services shut down last year.The latest controversy comes as Apple faces a continuing decline in sales in China, its biggest overseas market. The company's revenue from the Greater China region in the latest quarter fell 10% from a year earlier.Apple is not the only big American tech firm following Chinese censors' orders.Customers of Amazon's cloud computing service in the country have recently been warned to immediately stop using tools that bypass the Great Firewall and websites that are not registered with the Chinese government."We could receive a notice from regulators at any time asking us to shut down such services," said a message sent out Monday by Beijing Sinnet Technology, the Chinese partner of Amazon Web Services."If you have any of the [services], please stop in case your business is affected," said the message, which was provided to CNN by one of the companies' clients.Amazon and Sinnet did not immediately respond to requests for comment.-- Serenitie Wang contributed to this reportLoad-Date: August 3, 2017End of Document

'China miracle' offers solution to world's poverty relief endeavorPR NewswireOctober 13, 2017 Friday 7:24 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 779 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Oct. 13, 2017 BodyA newly released report by China.org.cn on China's progress in poverty reduction and its contribution to the world's poverty relief endeavor:Oct. 17 marks the 25th International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. Over the past two decades, half of the world's poor population managed to escape poverty. Asian-Pacific countries, especially China, made the greatest contribution to this remarkable achievement.China's progress in poverty relief, which was made under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), should be recognized as a monumental victory in human history. In the past four decades, more than 700 million Chinese people were lifted out of poverty, accounting for 70 percent of the global poverty reduction during the period. Over the last five years, China reduced the number of rural residents living in poverty by more than 13 million annually, achieving a miracle in the history of global poverty relief.China's success in poverty reduction should be primarily attributed to the country's rapid economic development. Since China adopted the reform and opening-up policy more than 30 years ago, its economy has continued to grow at a high speed, which has helped address the basic living needs of the majority of its people.Furthermore, equality is important in Chinese political and social culture. As the ruling party, the CPC has always taken safeguarding fairness and justice and achieving widespread prosperity as its missions. After the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012, it has made poverty eradication its top priority. While some Chinese people have already become wealthy during the country's rapid development, the CPC has put more emphasis on the poor and focused on ensuring the inclusiveness of economic growth. This has always been its political pursuit and demonstrated its governance capabilities.China is at a challenging stage in its poverty relief endeavor. From 2013 to 2016, another 55.6 million Chinese people were lifted out of poverty, an achievement attributed to effective measures taken by the Chinese government. These measures included channeling investment from various sources into local industries to increase farmers' income; improving the ecological environment of some poverty-stricken areas; and reducing medical expenses for indigent rural populations to prevent poverty caused by disease. Through these measures, China has gained valuable experience in alleviating poverty.As the 19th CPC National Congress is about to convene, lifting the remaining 40 million people out of poverty is expected to be the most arduous task the CPC must complete before 2020. The CPC and the Chinese government will continue to prioritize the people's rights to subsistence and development, contributing ample experience and a model to reduce world poverty.China Mosaichttp://www.china.org.cn/video/node_7230027.htmBRICS potential huge, but needs more workhttp://www.china.org.cn/video/2017-10/13/content_41726071.htmAbout China.org.cnFounded in 2000, China Internet Information Center (China.org.cn/China.com.cn) is a key state news website under the auspices of the State Council Information Office, and is managed by China International Publishing Group.

MEMA Calls for End to Practices and Polices in China That Put U.S. Companies and Consumers at RiskTargeted News ServiceSeptember 28, 2017 Thursday 11:07 PM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 550 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C. BodyThe Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association issued the following news release:The Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association (MEMA) has again raised serious concerns about policies in China that put the innovation and intellectual property rights (IPR) violations of American businesses at risk.In a detailed statement filed today, MEMA has responded to the United States Trade Representative's request for comments from industry regarding China's policies and practices in technology transfer, innovation, and intellectual property."Motor vehicle parts manufacturers are innovators, conducting almost one-third of the annual $18 billion investment by the automotive industry in research and development. This industry commitment has made the U.S. a leader in more fuel efficient, cleaner and safer vehicles resulting from domestic development and manufacturing of advanced vehicle technologies. Given this investment in innovation, intellectual property rights protection is critical to the sustained success of the motor vehicle parts manufacturing industry. The IPR of a company is among its most valuable assets here in the U.S. and abroad," said Ann Wilson, MEMA Senior Vice President of Government Affairs in the comments."For the brand owner, counterfeiting leads to significant costs, including lost sales, reduced markets and margins, damages to brand reputation, and significant legal and investigation expenditures. Perhaps more importantly, counterfeit motor vehicle parts pose a serious threat to the motoring public because of the likelihood that a part will not perform like a genuine part or could fail. Weak enforcement of existing laws and regulations means little is done to stop counterfeiting and the trafficking of counterfeit goods."In August, the Trump administration officially initiated investigation of China under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. "The investigation will seek to determine whether acts, policies, and practices of the Government of China related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce," according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative.In addition to IPR and counterfeit goods, MEMA raised concerns about a pending Chinese ban on the use of virtual private networks (VPNS), inadequate actions by the Chinese government to stop infringement and trade secret theft, and new laws and policies governing cybersecurity, data, and software."Actions like this make a company's global operations even more susceptible to a broad exposure of its research, development, IPR and trade secrets," Wilson said in the comments.Intellectual property rights protections have been a top priority for MEMA, and patent infringements, trade secret theft, counterfeiting vehicle components and parts and stealing trademarks are issues MEMA takes very seriously. MEMA remains highly engaged on issues impacting IPR. MEMA interfaces with its Intellectual Property Council, which is managed by MEMA's Automotive Aftermarket Suppliers Association (AASA) division, to address market challenges impacting patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade dress and intellectual property rights.[Category: Manufacturing]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6011135 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: September 29, 2017End of Document

CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PRESS UNBLOCKS CENSORED CONTENT ON TOP JOURNAL'S CHINA WEBSITEStates News ServiceAugust 21, 2017 MondayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 791 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Cambridge University Press (CUP) says it has reversed a recent decision to censor more than 300 articles from the China Quarterly academic journal's China website at the request of Beijing."We can now confirm that all the articles have been re-posted on CUP's internet portals in China and can be downloaded free of charge," the journal said via its Twitter account on Monday , adding: "We fully support this decision."The reversal of CUP's decision comes after an outcry among China scholars and academics and a petition on Change.org by Christopher Balding of the Peking University HSBC Business School in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen."As academics, we believe in the free and open exchange of ideas and information on all topics not just those we agree with," the petition said. "It is disturbing to academics and universities worldwide that China is attempting to export its censorship on topics that do not fit its preferred narrative."It called on universities to boycott CUP in the event that it continued to acquiesce to the demands of the ruling Chinese Communist Party, which has recently launched a campaign against "unauthorized" foreign content hosted within China.The takedown had affected 315 articles dating back to the 1960s on politically sensitive topics like the Cultural Revolution, the 1989 military crackdown on the Tiananmen Square democracy movement, Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.China Quarterly editor Tim Pringle said in a statement via the journal's Twitter account that the articles were taken down without the consent of anyone at the journal."CUP had previously taken down 315 articles following an "instruction" from a Chinese import agency without the consent of The China Quarterly," he wrote, saying that he supported the decision to unblock the articles."It is not the role of respected global publishing houses such as CUP to hinder [access to academic articles]."He said the journal would continue to publish articles "regardless of topic or sensitivity."CUP had said it had complied with the takedown request so as to avoid shutdown of the entire Chinese site.'Intense feeling of insecurity'Joseph Cheng, former political science professor at Hong Kong's City University, said the incident betrayed an intense feeling of insecurity in the highest echelons of the Communist Party leadership."The Chinese government gives the impression of the sense of entitlement that comes from great wealth, to the extent that they don't even have to bother with international norms," Cheng told RFA. "This shows a lack of respect for academic freedom worldwide, and ultimately the huge feeling of insecurity that prevails in the Chinese leadership.""Most people won't even read these articles [which are aimed at] university lecturers and researchers," he said. "They would have a very limited impact on the general public."Hebei journalist Zhu Xinxin said the incident is the first time the journal has been targeted by Chinese censors."The Chinese government is using a carrot-and-stick approach when it comes to overseas academic institutions," Zhu said. "The Chinese Communist Party ... is trying to engage in red imperialism in every sphere: the political, the cultural and the economic."Repeated calls to The China Quarterly rang unanswered during office hours since Friday .The CUP reported double-digit year-on-year growth in the China market for the last five years running, according to its annual report.The growth had been achieved "through close collaboration with Chinese publishers, large private education service providers, leading foreign language schools and new education technology companies," it said.The takedown came as Beijing begins to implement tougher online controls ordered by President Xi Jinping in February, removing any foreign content that hasn't been licensed or preapproved by government censors.Last month, SAPPRFT issued takedown notices last week to two popular multimedia websites targeting young people, AcFun and bilibili, removing a slew of overseas TV shows and video content.China routinely censors "sensitive" keywords like " June 4 , 1989" and "6.4" behind the Great Firewall, although many of the country's 731 million internet users deploy puns and other disguises to mention banned topics.Typically, searches for blocked content in China return a message apologizing for the nondelivery of search results "in accordance with relevant laws, regulations, and policies," and the deleted China Quarterly articles wouldn't have shown up in search results carried out by users in China.Reported by Xin Lin for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by the Cantonese Service.

Professor says publisher dumped his book because it was scared of ChinaCNN WireNovember 13, 2017 Monday 8:53 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 648 wordsByline: By Ben WestcottDateline: HONG KONG (CNNMoney) BodyHONG KONG (CNNMoney) --  A leading academic has accused his publisher of effectively ditching a book about Chinese government influence inside Australia because of fears of a backlash from Beijing.Clive Hamilton, a professor of public ethics at Charles Sturt University in Canberra, said his book -- "Silent Invasion: How China is turning Australia into a puppet state" -- was due to be published early next year. But he told CNN that publisher Allen & Unwin suddenly informed him last week that it would be delaying the book for an unspecified period after being warned it could face legal action by China.It's the latest example of how the growing global influence of China, which strictly censors content at home, is also creating difficulties for writers and publishers beyond its borders. The case also feeds into fears in Australia about Chinese government interference in the country.Hamilton showed CNN an email message he said he received last week from Allen & Unwin CEO Robert Gorman in which the executive expressed concern that "Silent Invasion" could result in "possible action by Beijing," in particular "a vexatious defamation action" against the company.Hamilton said another Allen & Unwin employee told him verbally that Gorman had decided to abandon publishing the book entirely. Even delaying it risked making large parts of the book out of date, reducing the likelihood it would ever come out, he said."What is striking about what has happened is that no actual arm twisting of the publisher was undertaken as far as I know," Hamilton told CNN. "And yet the mere possibility of it ... was enough to cause them to pull the plug."A spokeswoman for Allen & Unwin said the company decided, after receiving legal advice, to delay publication of Hamilton's book "until certain matters currently before the courts have been decided." She didn't specify what those matters are."Clive was unwilling to delay publication and requested the return of his rights, as he is entitled to do," she said. "We continue to wish him the best of luck with the book."The spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the content of the email exchange between Hamiton and Gorman.Hamilton, who has been awarded the Order of Australia medal for his contribution to public debate, said "Silent Invasion" studied the extent of the Chinese government's influence in Australian politics, education and business."it really is far more extensive than most Australians understand," he said. "I think it exposes a very worrying level of influence by the Chinese Community Party across Australia."Australian news organizations have reported widely on Beijing's influence in the country, including large donations to political parties and close observation of Chinese students' behavior on Australian campuses.The Chinese Foreign Ministry in June described a series of reports on the theme by top Australian media outlets as "totally unfounded and irresponsible, and not worth refuting."It isn't the first time a major publisher has come under fire over its handling of content about China.In August, Cambridge University Press was roundly criticized for removing hundreds of articles from its online site that referenced topics deemed sensitive by Beijing, including Tibet, Taiwan and the Cultural Revolution.The publisher initially defended the move as necessary to ensure that China didn't block all of its journals. But following the fierce backlash, it reinstated the blocked content.More recently, one of the world's biggest academic publishers, Springer Books, was also revealed to have censored content to avoid clashing with the Chinese government.A spokeswoman for Springer Nature said that while the decision was "deeply regrettable," it only affected about 1% of the company's academic content.TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
