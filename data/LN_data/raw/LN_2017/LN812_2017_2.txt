CHINA HOLDS 9 UYGHURS, 2 OTHERS OVER 'TERRORIST, EXTREMIST' VIDEOSStates News ServiceNovember 7, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 1019 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Chinese authorities in the northwestern region of Xinjiang are holding 11 members of mostly Muslim ethnic minority groups on suspicion of promoting "terrorism, religious extremism and ethnic divisions" using online platforms.Since August, police in the region have investigated 15 cases of "disseminating illegal information online," the Xinjiang Internet Information Office said at the weekend.Nine of the "suspects" were Turkic-speaking, mostly Muslim Uyghurs, one a non-Uyghur Hui Muslim and one an ethnic Kazakh citizen of China, many of whom are also Muslims.They are accused of "using text messages, pictures, audio and video to promote, store and disseminate terrorist, religious extremist, ethnically divisive content and fake news," the statement said.Beijing blames some Uyghurs for a string of violent attacks and clashes in China in recent years, but critics say the government has exaggerated the threat from the ethnic group, and that repressive domestic policies are responsible for violence that has left hundreds dead since 2009.China regularly conducts "strike hard" campaigns in Xinjiang, including police raids on Uyghur households, restrictions on Islamic practices, and curbs on the culture and language of the Uyghur people.The government has detained large numbers of Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other ethnic minorities simply for posting religious videos not approved by officials, Qurans, prayer mats and traditional clothing, all of which have been described as evidence of "extremism" by Chinese police in recent months.Among the detainees were a 50-year-old resident of Aksu, a 32-year-old resident of Bozhou, a resident of Urumqi and a resident of Kashgar, all Uyghurs accused of possessing and disseminating "terrorist" videos, the Internet Information Office said.'Terrorist videos' meaning unclearMeanwhile, an ethnic Kazakh from Bozhou and a 22-year-old Hui Muslim stand accused of disseminating "religious extremist propaganda," it said.An employee who answered the phone at the Xinjiang regional government's internet reporting hotline declined to give details about what was meant by "terrorist videos" in the statement."Illegal and substandard content includes the online dissemination of undesirable video and religious extremism, as well as rumor-mongering of a political nature, etc," the employee said.Asked for further details, the employee said: "We just receive the tip-offs here, but it's up to the police to define whether or not the content is illegal or against regulations."Thousands of Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities are being held in re-education camps across Xinjiang without contact with their families under a policy designed to counter "extremism," local officials have told RFA's Uyghur Service.The camps are now formally referred to as "Professional Education Schools," after being called "Socialism Training Schools" and other names since their early 2017 inception as "Counter-extremism Training Schools," the official said.The camps are in operation throughout Xinjiang and contain detainees from the Uyghur, Kyrgyz and Kazakh communities all Turkic-speaking, mostly Muslim minorities in China under policies introduced by hardline Xinjiang Communist Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, sources have said.Officials have described the facilities as closed schools, because authorities keep internees detained day and night, subjecting them to political and ideological "re-education" for an indefinite period.Ilshat Hassan, President of Uyghur American Association said the latest arrest showed that "China is further intensifying the suppression of the peaceful Uyghur people after the 19th Congress.""Some Uyghurs had hopes of change after the CCP Congress but that was only wishful thinking. The reality is the situation is only getting worse," he told RFA's Uyghur Service, referring to last month's five-yearly Communist Party congress.Pressure on KazakhsThe New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) has called on the Chinese government to free the thousands of people placed in Xinjiang campssince April 2017 and close them down.Dilxat Raxit, spokesman for the exile World Uyghur Congress group, said the ruling Chinese Communist Party has already succeeded in controlling what its citizens see online, and is targeting ethnic minorities as part of a systematic program of oppression."This so-called charge of disseminating illegal content is all about the Chinese government's fear that Uyghurs will start expressing their anger and discontent online," Raxit said."This tightening of online monitoring in the region is, in reality, another way to prevent Uyghurs getting a hold of information outside the government's controlled monopoly," he said."I worry that this will lead to even more people being detained by the local authorities."Meanwhile, the Xinjiang authorities are continuing to put pressure on ethnic Kazakhs with relatives across the border in Kazakhstan, local sources said.Sources in Urumqi said an elderly Kazakh woman was recently forced to sign a document declaring "an end to the maternal relationship with my son" and to cancel her grown son's household registration document linked to his family home, to enable him to get a visa to come home and visit her after he obtained Kazakhstan citizenship.New rules introduced since August have made it almost impossible for naturalized citizens of Kazakhstan who were once holders of Chinese passports to get a visa to come and visit relatives.Visa applications require proof that the household registration, or "hukou", back in China has been canceled before a former Chinese citizen may return to the country, sources said."The police made a mother write this declaration of the ending of maternal relations with her son," an Urumqi-based Kazakh said. "Otherwise, they would have charged him with the crime of holding dual nationality, which would have meant he couldn't come back to China."Reported by Qiao Long for RFA's Mandarin Service and by Alim Seytoff for the Uyghur Service.

Express Delivery Businesses Are Booming In ChinaRealMoneyDecember 15, 2017 Friday 10:15 AM EDTCopyright 2017 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1438 wordsByline: Alex McMillanHighlight: China passed the United States as the biggest delivery market back in 2014, and hasn't looked back since. Its express-delivery stocks are therefore likely to produce strong profits through at least 2020.BodyBeijing used to be a city of bicycles. Now it's a city of couriers, solo drivers whizzing around on motor scooters with a lockbox full of small packages on the back.It's a pattern that's being repeated all across greater China, which surpassed the United States as the world's biggest express-delivery market back in 2014.Last year, courier companies delivered 31.3 billion parcels, up 51% over the previous year. This was up 54% over the year before. You get the idea.The e-commerce boom has combined with the cheap cost of labor to generate a hive of activity, delivery bees in scooters and small vans buzzing out from central drop-off points to deliver anything you can imagine to the 1.4 billion people that call China home.It has already transformed the retail landscape here, and means the stocks of the main courier companies are worth considering. I'll outline them lower down.My wife runs a graphic-design business here in Hong Kong, part of which involves getting customized greetings cards and kids' clothing labels printed. For instance, she has a new line of cards featuring the  , with text from yours truly. The point is that we get a lot of printed materials shipped to and from us. It all goes through SF Express.At times, I do the pickup when I'm driving past the courier. The local SF Express office is in a rundown mall in Tai Po Center, one of Hong Kong's New Towns. The New Towns are densely populated concrete suburbs that bristle with skyscraper public and private towers, both public and private housing. The towns sprung up starting in the 1970s to house the city's booming population.Close to 300,000 people live in Tai Po's New Town. The shabby shopping mall has been sold off strata-title to a ramshackle list of tenants, half of which seem to be selling phone cases. The restaurants do a brisk trade, but most shops don't get a lot of customers.The busiest store of them all, by far, is the SF Express courier dropoff and pickup point. Sometimes there's a line that stretches out the front door of the shopping mall. It's become so popular, in fact, that SF Express has taken up two of the neighboring shopfronts just to store the packages that are waiting for pickup.The parent of SF Express, Shenzhen-listed SF Holding SZ:002352, went public in February. That has suddenly helped make SF Express founder Wang Wei, 47, one of China's richest people. Wang made the top 10 of the Hurun China Rich List for the first time in October, essentially from nowhere, with a net worth of $22 billion. That was good enough for No. 6 on the list .SF Express used to operate via some franchises, but it has taken full control of all its stores, which has seen its popularity soar. The company has ranked No. 1 in terms of customer satisfaction in surveys conducted over the last eight years in China. That draws the eyes of Nomura's transport and logistics analysts for Asia, Shirley Lam and Benjamin Lo. "Based on our view that the quality of services would be the key for success of express operators, we expect SF to enjoy first-mover advantage," they write in initiating coverage of the industry. "We believe that its direct-operate business model and self-operated freighters should set high entry barriers for its peers."It's not hard to open concrete boxes that contain other boxes. It is hard to keep all those boxes moving through the stores as smoothly as possible.SF Express has diversified into cold storage, heavy-goods transport, and is increasingly offering international express services, too. Ultimately it aims to become a diversified operator of supply-chain management.Nomura expects the stock to rise to 61 yuan, from 51 now, which itself is already an advance of 23% since going public. Their target price is based on an estimated compound annual growth rate in earnings of 36% from now through 2019.SF Express should trade at a premium to its competitors, Nomura anticipates. The worries to watch include higher-than-expected initial losses at the new lines of business that it enters, and any surprise slowdown in volume growth.Sinotrans Air Transportation Development SH:600270 has the backing of the Chinese government, as part of the state-owned enterprise Sinotrans. It has a joint venture with European shipping giant DHL Express, itself an offshoot of the German mail service, Deutsche Post  .There are broad alliances shaping up. Not to be left out, SF Express has established a j.v. with United Parcel Service  . FedEx  , for its part, bought TNT in May 2016, a company that ran the Dutch national post service and operates extensively in Asia, as well as Europe.DHL reduced its holding in DHL-Sinotrans Air Courier in May 2015, which alarmed some investors that the Europeans might pull out of the venture altogether. But the two companies have a 50-year cooperation in place that runs through 2036.Nomura has a target price of 20 yuan on Sinotrans Air stock, now trading at 16.78. Higher oil prices are the main threat to the company's earnings, since it deals so much with international shipments.Sinotrans Air has a Hong Kong-listed parent Sinotrans HK:0598 that is an international freight-forwarding business. Nomura's analysts are less keen on this company, which they believe may suffer from the consolidation underway in the shipping industry. Any slowdown in China's rate of growth in its exports would also hit Sinotrans hard. Nomura recently lowered its target price to HK$4.00 per share, from HK$4.40. It's now at HK$3.82.What's more, Sinotrans is absorbing its purchase of China Merchants Logistics. The company's core earnings are growing at around 5%, although the acquisition will produce a sudden rise of around 25% in profits. If Sinotrans manages the acquisition well, expect the share price to get a goosing. Likewise, better-than-expected exports out of China would feed through to greater profits.Kerry Logistics Network  had something of a first-half stall in its earnings advance in the first half of this year, profits rising only 4%. But that looks to have risen to 10% in the second half of the year. The company may unlock value by selling its warehouses in Hong Kong and leasing them back. The warehouses have a book value of only HK$8 billion ($1 billion) as part of the public company. But they could likely fetch at least double that, HK$16 billion to HK$20 billion ($2-2.6 billion), on the market.In fact, the entire market capitalization of Kerry Logistics is only HK$17.9 billion ($2.3 billion), meaning that the rest of the business is valued at a bonus $0. Even at a 15% discount to its asset value, it should trade at HK$14.30, compared with HK$10.58 now.Shenzhen International Holdings HK:0152 is ultimately controlled by the Shenzhen government and Cheung Kong Holdings  . It operates several logistics parks in China as well as infrastructure such as the port in Nanjing and toll roads. It also owns the carrier Shenzhen Airlines, with a joint venture freight supply-chain management business at the airport.It has, as of October, signed an agreement with the government of the budding free-trade zone in Qianhai, next to Shenzhen across the border from me here. The free-trade zone has had a rocky start to its existence, struggling to find tenants, but the Chinese government is intent to get it going by 2020 -- and gets what it wants within China's borders. Shenzhen International has a large land bank in Qianhai, where it will have a 40:60 profit-sharing agreement with the government on a logistics park. It will have another logistics center of its own. And it also has some land that it may sell off at a likely valuation of triple its book price now, if sold for residential homes.The company also owns four expressways that it is likely to sell back to the Chinese government in late 2018. That should give it a gain of 2.17 billion yuan ($330 million) from the sale, which should boost the share price by HK$1.30 per share. Nomura recently boosted its expected share price from HK$16.30 to HK$18.40, with the stock trading at HK$13.64 now.There's plenty of room for all the operators to grow. The Chinese government has a target of seeing the courier trade hit 50 billion parcels by the end of 2020. That would mean a compound annual growth rate of 12% from 2016 to 2020, while courier revenue should rise by a compound rate of 19% per year over the same period.Given that the number of parcels has risen by more than 50% in each of the last two years, that's a pretty safe bet. Nomura expects both shipments and sales to rise by 20% to 30% per year through 2020 instead. Expect those shares, then, to deliver returns as well.Load-Date: December 16, 2017End of Document

Apple CEO Criticized For Supporting "China's Digital Vision" At Chinese Cyber ConferenceThe FrontrunnerDecember 5, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 138 wordsBodyIn its "WorldViews" blog, the Washington Post (12/4, Denyer, 13.32M) reports Apple CEO Tim Cook was criticized by human rights activists following his keynote address endorsing "China's digital vision" at the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, China. In his keynote address, Cook claimed Apple supported the conference's vision of "developing a digital economy for openness and shared benefits." In response to Cook's address, Maya Wang of Human Rights Watch said, "The version of cyberspace the Chinese government is building is a decidedly dystopian one...Apple should have spoken out against it, not endorsed it." Apple was also criticized last month by Sens. Ted Cruz and Patrick Leahy after announcing it would remove Skype as well as nearly 700 VPN apps from its Chinese app store in order to comply with local Chinese laws.Load-Date: December 5, 2017End of Document

AP FACT CHECK: China-US business deals are largely glossAssociated Press Financial WireNovember 9, 2017 Thursday 8:32 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; AP Fact CheckLength: 799 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD and CALVIN WOODWARD, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - A trade and investment package announced during President Donald Trump's visit to China is more about the art of diplomacy than the art of the deal.The package, said to be worth more than $250 billion, puts a symbolic gloss on fundamentally strained economic relations between the U.S. and China. It draws together some new orders and extensions of business from existing Chinese customers, previously worked-out deals, tentative investments and statements of intent that may or may not turn into new dollars and jobs for the U.S.Officials from both countries made something of the developments nonetheless."Just now, the president and I witnessed the signing of some major cooperation agreements by our businesses," Chinese President Xi Jinping said in appearance with Trump on Thursday at which neither man took questions. "During this visit, the two sides signed over $250 billion U.S. dollars of commercial deals and two-way investment agreements."U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said: "Today's signings are a good example of how we can productively build up our bilateral trade."Such signing ceremonies in China are often just that, ceremonial. They typically represent purchases that Chinese customers already planned to make and held off on announcing.General Motors' $2.2 billion piece of the package, for example, consists mostly of selling parts to its existing joint venture with the Chinese government.Alaska, however, welcomed an agreement that could spur construction of a long-sought pipeline to ship natural gas from the North Slope to a port for export to Asia. Oil companies backed away from the project, but the agreement with Chinese interests means all parties will work toward a decision by the end of next year whether to proceed.The signings this week, a fixture of visits by foreign leaders meant to blunt their complaints about China's trade surpluses and market barriers, assure that Trump and others don't come away empty-handed even if China's trade and investment policies don't change at their core.During the 2016 campaign, Trump accused the Chinese of "raping our country" on trade and vowed retaliation if Beijing didn't change. Since then, China's trade surplus with the U.S. has continued to grow, up 12.2 percent in October from a year earlier.The flurry of initiatives signed this week provides for the Chinese purchase of 300 Boeing jetliners that have a list price of $37 billion, mobile phone chipsets from Qualcomm for $12 billion, $1.6 billion in soybeans, and nearly $12 billion in vehicles and parts from General Motors and Ford, among other deals.The Boeing deal is known to be a mix of old and new orders and appears to fit in the normal order of business. As well, airlines get deep discounts from the list price.Boeing generally delivers about 150 planes to China a year (126 so far this year) and China generally orders about 300 more every two years. Company officials wouldn't comment beyond their statement on the deal.Analyst Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group, an aviation-research firm in Fairfax, Virginia, said the Chinese government likes to bundle orders collected from Chinese airlines "to make it look like it plays a bigger role in the economy than it really does." Based on that practice, he said, the new Boeing orders must be "either orders in the pipeline or orders that haven't been placed but were going to be placed anyway."Boeing's last comparable announcement of a big Chinese order, 300 planes in 2015, also came during a state visit, when Xi toured the company's assembly plant in Everett, Washington.On autos, GM said its part of the package is a new but a normal element of its business in China and not something that popped up because the leaders are meeting. In addition to parts sales to the China-based joint venture, GM-SAIC, it provides for the sale of a small number of cars, such as Chevy Corvettes.The two countries also agreed this week to cooperate on other projects, like the Alaska liquefied natural gas pipeline, which could cost more than $40 billion, though there is no guarantee it will proceed.Xi said China is willing to expand imports of LNG, crude oil and other U.S. energy products and would explore "the potential" of more imports of U.S. beef, cotton and other agricultural products.But it's unclear if such pledges extend beyond a U.S.-China trade agreement announced in May. That addressed LNG and beef exports to China, and trade experts called it a modest fulfillment of past assurances made by China.___Woodward reported from Washington.

CANADA AND CHINA AGREE TO WORK TOGETHER TO ADVANCE CLIMATE ACTION AND CLEAN GROWTHStates News ServiceDecember 12, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 762 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: PARIS, France BodyThe following information was released by the Government of Canada:Canada is committed to providing leadership and working with our international partners to help move toward a more sustainable model for economic development.Yesterday, the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Catherine McKenna, concluded a successful eight-day visit to Beijing and Shanghai, China. Minister McKenna accompanied Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on his bilateral mission during which he met with the President of China, Xi Jinping, the Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Li Keqiang, and others to discuss opportunities for China and Canada to deepen collaboration on climate change and clean growth. Both countries remain unwavering in their dedication to climate leadership, and will continue to work toward meeting their commitments under the Paris Agreement.The Minister also witnessed the historic announcement of the Canada-China Joint Statement on Climate Change and Clean Growth, where Canada's Prime Minister and China's Premier committed to champion the transition to a competitive, low-carbon economy and society, recognizing that the environment and the economy go hand-in-hand.In Beijing, Minister McKenna met with Xie Zhenhua, China's Special Envoy for Climate Change, and with her Chinese counterpart, Li Ganjie, Minister of Environmental Protection. The Ministers agreed to cooperate on issues related to air quality, water, chemicals management and biodiversity.Continuing to Shanghai, the Minister visited the Shanghai Energy and Environment Exchange to be briefed on its trading platform, carbon planning and carbon asset management. She also met with the 16 Canadian cleantech businesses who were on Environment and Climate Change Canada's trade mission to develop stronger connections with Chinese companies on clean solutions for clean air, clean water, clean soil and clean energy. The companies explored partnership opportunities with more than 400 Chinese businesses and decision makers in Shanghai, Nanjing and Beijing.A series of deals were announced or unveiled in the course of the Minister's time in China. The Minister attended the unveiling of a new assembly line, where Vancouver-based Ballard Power's hydrogen fuel cell engines will be built to supply Chinese buses with zero-emissions power. In another example of cross-Pacific collaboration, the Minister attended the launch of a new initiative to share knowledge and expertise on carbon capture and storage (CCS) between two Chinese research institutes and the Saskatchewan-based International CCS Knowledge Centre. The Minister also attended Cycle Capital Management's announcement of the Haisi Cycle Fund, a new industrial technology venture capital fund and the first impact investment fund to focus on clean growth projects in China.At the conclusion of the trip, Minister McKenna, as the International Executive Vice-Chair, presided over the Annual General Meeting of the China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development. The Council is a high-profile international advisory body to the Chinese Government for collaboration and exchange on matters of sustainable development, and Canada has been its lead partner since its inception 25 years ago.Before departing, Minister McKenna also visited the Great Wall of China to support China's work to establish a national parks system, building on a memorandum of understanding signed last year between China and Parks Canada, and to promote the 2018 Canada-China Year of Tourism.Minister McKenna now travels to Paris, France, to lead the Canadian delegation at the One Planet Summit hosted by the President of France, Emmanuel Macron.Quotes"Canada and China have a longstanding history of collaboration on the environment and climate change. We're building on that relationship with the historic joint statement committing our two countries to champion progress on climate change and clean growth internationally and at home. I'm proud that Canada remains a lead partner in the China Council, advising the Chinese government on environmental protection and sustainability. And it's remarkable to see Canadian companies showcasing clean solutions and striking deals to bring their technology and expertise to customers in China. As we work to develop a stronger trade relationship with China, such partnerships will improve the quality of life of people in China while supporting good, middle-class jobs and prosperity in both countries."Catherine McKenna, Minister of Environment and Climate ChangeLoad-Date: December 17, 2017End of Document

Innovation-driven growth: Chinese solution for Asia-PacificPR NewswireNovember 14, 2017 Tuesday 9:00 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 894 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Nov. 14, 2017 BodyA news report by China.org.cn on the 25th Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders' Meeting in Vietnam and China's solution for the future development of the Asia-Pacific economy: After Chinese and U.S. companies signed deals worth more than US$250 billion during U.S. President Donald Trump's state visit to China, the leaders of APEC member economies gathered in Da Nang, Vietnam on Nov. 10 to seek wider economic and trade cooperation. Under the theme of "Creating New Dynamism, Fostering a Shared Future", the meeting focused on seeking fresh solutions for the future development of the Asia-Pacific economy. Among the highlights, the phase "innovation-driven growth" is perhaps the most eye-catching.The world economy is undergoing a number of profound reforms. At the APEC CEO Summit in Da Nang, Chinese President Xi Jinping said this included a change in growth drivers. The Asia-Pacific region has one of the fastest economic growth rates in the world; however, in the middle and long-term period, it is also facing potential risks and difficulties. To avoid a "new mediocre" period of sluggish growth, the region, and indeed the entire world, should pursue growth through innovation and tap a new growth momentum.China is the most successful practitioner and the biggest beneficiary of innovation-driven growth. In the past 40 years, it has made much economic headway. While the first two major advances in economy were contributed by the development of the rural economy and a more open economy overall, which promoted China's industrialization to an unprecedented high level and accelerated the pace of its economic globalization, China has realized that the potential of the first two growth drivers being exhausted, it now needs to be replaced by seizing the third opportunity offered by innovation-driven economy.At the recent 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), "innovation" was repeatedly emphasized. In the report to the congress, it was specifically pointed out that further integration of the Internet, big data, and artificial intelligence with the real economy should be promoted, and new growth drivers should be fostered in areas like digital economy, sharing economy and green energy. This will help strengthen the innovation capacity and competitiveness of China's economy on a steady basis.From the World Internet Conference to the high-speed railway network, e-commerce, new energy products and bike sharing, China has contributed an increasing number of innovative ideas to the world. The Chinese government is working step by step to fulfill the objective of achieving innovation-driven development, which was set by the APEC meeting in Beijing. When the objective is fulfilled, it will benefit more countries. For instance, the day when this year's APEC meeting concluded happened to be the largest online shopping day in China. In 2016, cross-border e-commerce transactions in China reached 6.7 trillion yuan, with a compound annual growth rate of more than 30 percent for the five years from 2011.With the progress of the Belt and Road Initiative, innovation-driven growth will first bring benefits to the countries along the route. Showcasing the principle of achieving shared growth through discussion and collaboration, it will help boost the transformation and development of their economies. The solution offered by China will create a new opportunity for the entire Asia-Pacific economy.China Mosaichttp://www.china.org.cn/video/node_7230027.htmInnovation-driven growth: Chinese solution for Asia-Pacifichttp://www.china.org.cn/video/2017-11/14/content_41888612.htmAbout China.org.cnFounded in 2000, China Internet Information Center (China.org.cn/China.com.cn) is a key state news website under the auspices of the State Council Information Office, and is managed by China International Publishing Group.

China: Minority Region Collects DNA From MillionsTargeted News ServiceDecember 13, 2017 Wednesday 6:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3762 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyHuman Rights Watch issued the following news release:Chinese authorities in Xinjiang are collecting DNA samples, fingerprints, iris scans, and blood types of all residents in the region between the age of 12 and 65, Human Rights Watch said today. This campaign significantly expands authorities' collection of biodata beyond previous government efforts in the region, which only required all passport applicants in Xinjiang to supply biometrics.For all "focus personnel" - those authorities consider threatening to regime stability - and their family members, their biometrics must be taken regardless of age. Authorities are gathering the biodata in different ways. DNA and blood types are being collected through a free annual physical exams program called Physicals for All. It is unclear if the participants of the physicals are informed of the authorities' intention to collect, store, or use sensitive DNA data."Xinjiang authorities should rename their physical exams project 'Privacy Violations for All,' as informed consent and real choice does not seem to be part of these programs," said Sophie Richardson, China director. "The mandatory databanking of a whole population's biodata, including DNA, is a gross violation of international human rights norms, and it's even more disturbing if it is done surreptitiously, under the guise of a free health care program."The biometric collection scheme is detailed in an official document called "The [Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous] Region Working Guidelines on the Accurate Registration and Verification of Population", "The Population Registration Program"), available in full on the government website of Aksu city in Xinjiang (an unofficial translation is available below).The guidelines are undated, but the Aksu government's notice distributing it to lower-level offices was dated July 2, 2017. According to state media reports, the Xinjiang government authorized the Population Registration Program in February 2017, and specified that it would be carried out "in stages." A county government in Tacheng prefecture, for example, has a timetable that states it began collecting biodata around mid-June and completed it by end of November 2017. The Xinjiang-wide Physicals for All program started around July and was completed October 2017.The guidelines were issued by the region's Office of Population Service and Management and Real Name Registration Work Leadership Committee. It is unclear precisely which government department this office reports to, though "population management" is usually under the supervision of the police.Authorities state that the Population Registration Program is meant for "scientific decision-making" that promotes poverty alleviation, better management, and "social stability." Authorities have offered the annual Physicals for All program since 2016, characterizing it as a benefit for the relatively economically poor region. The program's stated goals are to improve the service delivery of health authorities, to screen and detect for major diseases, and to establish digital health records for all residents. Press reports about Physicals for All include testimonies from participants describing how they received treatments for previously undiagnosed illnesses, and in some cases saving their lives.According to the guidelines, different authorities are responsible for different types of biometric collection. Party cadres and police officers are responsible for collecting pictures, fingerprints and iris scans, and "household registration" (or hukou) information using mobile apps designed for such purpose either during home visits, or by setting up central collection points. Local health authorities are responsible for collecting DNA and blood type information "as part of" the Physicals for All program, according to the guidelines. The collected blood type information is directly sent to the police, while the "blood cards for DNA collection will be sent to the county police bureaus for profiling." All of this information is stored and linked to an individual's national identification number.The guidelines say the biometric collection will be comprehensive: officials have "to ensure that [information from] every household in every village, every person in every household, every item for every person" will be collected. There is no indication that people can opt out of the collection, or any requirement of informed consent.While media reports and official implementing documents about Physicals for All outline a range of medical tests involved, including ultrasounds, electrocardiograms, and "routine blood works," they give no indication that DNA will be collected as part of the tests. It also does not appear that the government has disclosed to the public or to participants the full range of how collected medical information will be used and disseminated or how long it will be stored. While official media reports stress that participation in the Physicals for All program should be voluntary, it appears that in practice people are expected - and sometimes pressured - to participate.One Uyghur who participated in the 2016 Physicals for All program in Kashgar in western Xinjiang told Human Rights Watch that his neighborhood committee "had demanded that they [people in his neighborhood] must participate in the physicals." He did not think he had a choice in the matter, as "not participating would surely be seen as a sign of 'thought problem,'" a shorthand for "political disloyalty," a dangerous label in the repressive region. He said the health authorities had not told him afterward the results of his physical."China has few meaningful privacy protections and Uyghurs are already subjected to extensive degrees of control and surveillance, including heavy security presence, numerous checkpoints, and routine inspection of smartphones for 'subversive' content," Richardson said. "In this context, compulsory biodata collection has particularly abusive potential, and hardly seems justifiable as a security measure."An October 2017 report by the Ili health authorities says the government "has to ensure that those who should participate in the physicals do participate." While a June 2017 report by the Ili Evening Post says "for those unwilling to participate in the physicals...cadres have to...work hard to convince them to participate," suggesting that officials may put pressure on residents who refuse to take part. This practice is not consistent with international human rights norms which require that medical interventions, including medical tests, be conducted only with the free and informed consent of the individual.A Xinhua article dated November 1, 2017, states that 18.8 million people participated in the Physicals for All program in 2017.The guidelines suggest that biometric collection is a permanent measure. Police are now required to ensure that all such information is collected from anyone in Xinjiang before they conduct any "hukou-related business," such as enrolling in public schools and applying for passports. Even people who have Xinjiang hukou but live outside the region are required to submit such information to "the Xinjiang Population Services and Management Committee(s) in the Mainland."A number of local governments in different parts of Xinjiang - Yining county, Tacheng prefecture, Tiemenguan city (which is part of the Xinjiang Military Corps), Korla city, and Jinghe county - have issued local versions of the directives instructing the collection of biometrics. The directives in Ili and Tacheng largely reproduce the provincial-level guidelines verbatim. In Tiemenguan, though, the collection of DNA is limited to those aged 14 to 65. The Tiemenguan directive also instructs the propaganda authorities to be responsible for "monitoring public sentiments on the internet" about the biometric collection and to "guide and handle negative information."Human Rights Watch has previously documented that the Xinjiang police had issued calls for tender in September 2016 for DNA sequencers that indicate its intention to build large-scale infrastructure to process DNA samples of and profile a large number of individuals.Follow-up research by Human Rights Watch uncovered that a US-based company, Thermo Fisher Scientific, has supplied the Xinjiang police with some of these DNA sequencers. Human Rights Watch wrote to the company in June and August 2017, informing them that Chinese authorities are collecting DNA from individuals not suspected of crimes in Xinjiang as well as across China, and asking them to comment on a range of issues including their human rights policies and discussions they may have had with Chinese authorities about the intended use of DNA sequencing equipment. In Thermo Fisher Scientific's response to the first letter, the company stated that it does not "share information about our customers or their purchases" and that "given the global nature of our operations, it is not possible for us to monitor the use or application of all products we manufactured." The firm stated that they "expect all of our customers to act in accordance with appropriate regulations and industry-standard best practices." Thermo Fisher Scientific did not reply to Human Rights Watch's second, follow-up letter.Companies like Thermo Fisher Scientific that supply DNA sequencing and related equipment have a human rights responsibility to avoid contributing to governmental human rights violations. Thermo Fisher Scientific should immediately investigate misuse of their products and suspend future sales or service in China pending such investigation.Human Rights Watch has also documented the Chinese police's searchable, nationwide DNA database with 40 million entries from people, including dissidents and migrants. A DNA database allows police not only to search for an exact match, but also for those who are related family members and could lead to discriminatory profiling.Coercing people to give blood samples, or taking blood samples without informed consent or justification can violate an individual's privacy, dignity, and right to bodily integrity; it can also in some circumstances constitute degrading treatment. Compelled DNA sampling of an entire region or population for purposes of security maintenance is a serious human rights violation in that it cannot be justified as necessary or proportionate.The right to respect for confidentiality of medical information is also a core principle of the right to health. The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) has advised states that "[a]ll health facilities, goods and services must be ... designed to respect confidentiality." While the right to privacy does not establish an absolute rule of confidentiality of medical information, interference or breach of confidentiality must be strictly justified, which is not the case when such collection is intended to routinely be shared with the police and any other agency with access to the database.DNA information is highly sensitive and can facilitate a wide array of abuses if it is collected or shared non-consensually. Any compelled collection or use by the government is a serious intrusion on the right to privacy. While the government's collection of DNA is sometimes justified as a permissible investigative tool, this type of interference with the right to privacy must be comprehensively regulated, narrow in scope, and proportionate to meeting a legitimate security goal. Yet the program described collects DNA information from all individuals, regardless of whether they are in any way linked to a criminal investigation, and does not appear to require informed consent or explanation of why DNA samples are sought. Mandatory and disproportionate collection of other sensitive biometrics, like iris scans, also raises serious human rights concerns about how such data will be secured and used for undisclosed and potentially rights-violating purposes, including surveillance of persons because of ethnicity, religion, opinion or other protected exercise of rights like free speech.Xinjiang, in northwestern China, is home to 10 million Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities. The Chinese government has imposed pervasive restrictions on their fundamental human rights, including freedom of religion. Since the appointment of Party Secretary Chen Quanguo in August 2016, the Xinjiang regional government has enacted further repressive policies, including restricting foreign travel and forcing those studying abroad to return, detaining thousands in political education facilities, and hiring thousands more as security personnel to monitor the population. Authorities have also ramped up surveillance measures, including by integrating other biometric technology like facial recognition with surveillance systems. Across China, Human Rights Watch has also documented the authorities' efforts in implementing new technological systems for mass surveillance, including the use of big data, cloud computing, and biometrics."Chinese authorities seem to think they can achieve 'social stability' by placing people under a microscope, but these abusive programs are more likely to deepen hostility towards the government," said Richardson. "Beijing should immediately stop these programs, and destroy all data gathered without full, informed consent."The [Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous] Region Working Guidelines on the Accurate Registration and Verification of PopulationThese guidelines are based on "The [Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous] Region Working Plan on the Accurate Registration and Verification of Population" and are written to systematically and scientifically promote the work of Accurate Registration and Verification of Population, and to accurately verify Xinjiang's actual population data and to collect multidimensional biometrics information.1. Target MissionThe main goal is to fully and accurately verify the real number of Xinjiang's population, to collect the images, fingerprints, iris scans, blood types, and DNA biometrics of those between the age of 12 and 65. For "focus personnel" and their immediate families, such information must be collected from everyone regardless of age. Regulating the management of identification cards is the foundation to creating a basic population database, based on one's ID numbers, for the autonomous region. [This will also] realize the exchange of population information across government agencies, and achieve precise identification and real name registration management.2. Work Responsibilitiesi. All prefecture and city governments should follow the general requirements set out by the regional government, to develop implementation plans and to prepare human, physical, and financial resources to ensure the [implementation of] the work. All county governments will be responsible for carrying out the policy by developing specific measures and by leading and coordinating the work.ii. All township governments and neighborhood committees are responsible for organizing the personnel responsible for verifying household registration (hukou) information and collecting biometric data.iii. All county governments, township governments, and neighborhood committees should provide training to staff on verification work and require them to be certificated.iv. Village and neighborhood Party branch, Party cadres of the "Visit, Benefit and Gather" program, and police station will form a joint team, led by the village or neighborhood committee's first Party secretary (for those without a first secretary, the village or neighborhood committee's Party branch secretaries should be responsible), to carry out the tasks of verifying hukou information and the collection of biometrics using home visits and in a centralized manner.3. Work Requirementi. Protect people's legal rights, guide them to cooperate, and support the work of Accurate Registration and Verification of Population.ii. Organize meticulously and carefully make arrangements to ensure that the hukou information for everyone in every household, in every village is completely verified in Xinjiang. No one is to be missed.iii. The principle of biometric collection is to proceed from easy to difficult, to promote it from pilot areas, from villages to towns, and from focus personnel to the ordinary masses. The goal is to collect information where information should be collected, and to collect as much data as possible.iv. Strictly enforce the requirements of the Working Guidelines. To accurately collect biometric data, ensure that the collected biometrics match with the personal information [of the right person].v. The principle is whoever collects the information, that person should be responsible; whoever inputs the information, that person should be responsible; whoever manages the information, that person should be responsible. After collecting and verifying the information, the staff must sign their names in the documents to ensure the quality of the collected information and to strengthen responsibility and accountability.vi. Staff responsible for verifying information are not to fabricate, or to tamper with the collected data, nor to share data with outside sources or otherwise leak data unless legally authorized.vii. In areas that do not have mobile network coverage, staff can record data on paper or temporarily store the information on mobile devices. When the situation allows, log onto the relevant platforms and databases to upload the data.viii. After a long-term data collection system is established and the work of verifying and registering population information has been started in a comprehensive manner, when police agencies handle any hukou-related matters, they should first check to see if biometrics have been collected. Any missing or incomplete information should first be collected before any hukou matters can be conducted.4. Rules on Hukou Information Verification and the Collection of Multidimensional Biometrics Informationi. Verifying the Hukou Information of Individuals1. Staff conducting verification work will use handheld devices and log on to Accurate Registration and Verification of Population platforms using previously given account information. They will key in the identification numbers of those registered in the administrative area to generate information collection charts for [each] individual.2. Staff should verify the name, gender, ethnicity, date of birth, ID number, education level, employer information, and other information of the individual.ii. Collecting Multidimensional Biometric Data1. Multidimensional biometric data includes: images, fingerprints, iris scans, blood types, DNA samples, and others.2. The collection of biometrics, like images, fingerprints, and iris scans can be done by visiting individual households with biodata collection equipment, or by setting up central collecting points based on geographic and population distribution.3. The collection of biometrics like blood types and DNA samples should be carried out by county (city and district level) Health and Family Planning Bureaus at the basic levels as part of the Physicals for All Programs, to ensure the professional collection of blood type and DNA blood cards. The blood type information should be sent to the county level police bureaus while blood cards [for DNA collection] should be sent to the county police bureaus for profiling.5. Handling Various Situations When Verifying Hukou Informationi. While verifying hukou information, for errors found in the main items (name, gender, ethnicity, date of birth, ID number), the staff should inform the person to bring supporting documents to make corrections at their local police station. Errors found in the supplementary items (education level, employment) can be edited by police officers after gathering supporting documents on the spot, and logging onto the Accurate Registration and Verification of Population platform.ii. When verifying the information of people who have moved away from the areas where their hukous are registered, if any mismatched information is found between the information they provided and the information on the Accurate Registration and Verification of Population platform, inform the individuals to go back to the police station where their hukou is registered to make the amendments.iii. For the migrant population in Xinjiang, register their information according to the relevant requirements for the management of migrant population, verify their hukou information, and through the Accurate Registration and Verification of Population platform, report the verification results and the status of their biometric collection to the local police stations where their hukous are located for examination and approval.iv. For those without hukous, input their hukou information according to the requirements, collect their photos, biometric data, and then inform them or their guardians to report, within a certain time limit, to the police station in their area of residence or where they were born to process their hukou registration according to the relevant policies concerning people without hukous.v. For those whose information cannot be verified on the spot, after collecting their pictures and multidimensional biodata, report their situation to the police station in the areas where they said their hukous are located, and the latter will verify their information. If verified, connect their biometric data with their hukou information. If not verified, make a note on the data collecting system and try to match it later.vi. For migrant populations whose hukou is located outside of Xinjiang, register them according to the relevant regulations concerning the management of migrant populations.6. The Collection and Verification of Information for those with Xinjiang Hukous but Living in the MainlandThe work of verifying hukou information and collecting biometrics of those with Xinjiang hukous but living in the mainland is the responsibility of the local offices of the Xinjiang Population Services and Management Committees in the mainland and of the local people's governments entrusted by the Xinjiang government. The Xinjiang Population Services and Management and Real-Name Registration Work Leadership Committee is responsible for the training of personnel, distribution of equipment, and the launching of special accounts for Accurate Population Registration and Verification.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6104911 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 13, 2017End of Document

Canada, China Agree to Work Together to Advance Climate Action, Clean GrowthTargeted News ServiceDecember 12, 2017 Tuesday 8:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 792 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: PARIS, France BodyThe Canadian Environment and Climate Change Canada issued the following news release:Canada is committed to providing leadership and working with our international partners to help move toward a more sustainable model for economic development.Yesterday, the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Catherine McKenna, concluded a successful eight-day visit to Beijing and Shanghai, China. Minister McKenna accompanied Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on his bilateral mission during which he met with the President of China, Xi Jinping, the Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Li Keqiang, and others to discuss opportunities for China and Canada to deepen collaboration on climate change and clean growth. Both countries remain unwavering in their dedication to climate leadership, and will continue to work toward meeting their commitments under the Paris Agreement.The Minister also witnessed the historic announcement of the Canada-China Joint Statement on Climate Change and Clean Growth, where Canada's Prime Minister and China's Premier committed to champion the transition to a competitive, low-carbon economy and society, recognizing that the environment and the economy go hand-in-hand.In Beijing, Minister McKenna met with Xie Zhenhua, China's Special Envoy for Climate Change, and with her Chinese counterpart, Li Ganjie, Minister of Environmental Protection. The Ministers agreed to cooperate on issues related to air quality, water, chemicals management and biodiversity.Continuing to Shanghai, the Minister visited the Shanghai Energy and Environment Exchange to be briefed on its trading platform, carbon planning and carbon asset management. She also met with the 16 Canadian cleantech businesses who were on Environment and Climate Change Canada's trade mission to develop stronger connections with Chinese companies on clean solutions for clean air, clean water, clean soil and clean energy. The companies explored partnership opportunities with more than 400 Chinese businesses and decision makers in Shanghai, Nanjing and Beijing.A series of deals were announced or unveiled in the course of the Minister's time in China. The Minister attended the unveiling of a new assembly line, where Vancouver-based Ballard Power's hydrogen fuel cell engines will be built to supply Chinese buses with zero-emissions power. In another example of cross-Pacific collaboration, the Minister attended the launch of a new initiative to share knowledge and expertise on carbon capture and storage (CCS) between two Chinese research institutes and the Saskatchewan-based International CCS Knowledge Centre. The Minister also attended Cycle Capital Management's announcement of the Haisi Cycle Fund, a new industrial technology venture capital fund and the first impact investment fund to focus on clean growth projects in China.At the conclusion of the trip, Minister McKenna, as the International Executive Vice-Chair, presided over the Annual General Meeting of the China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development. The Council is a high-profile international advisory body to the Chinese Government for collaboration and exchange on matters of sustainable development, and Canada has been its lead partner since its inception 25 years ago.Before departing, Minister McKenna also visited the Great Wall of China to support China's work to establish a national parks system, building on a memorandum of understanding signed last year between China and Parks Canada, and to promote the 2018 Canada-China Year of Tourism.Minister McKenna now travels to Paris, France, to lead the Canadian delegation at the One Planet Summit hosted by the President of France, Emmanuel Macron.Quotes"Canada and China have a longstanding history of collaboration on the environment and climate change. We're building on that relationship with the historic joint statement committing our two countries to champion progress on climate change and clean growth internationally and at home. I'm proud that Canada remains a lead partner in the China Council, advising the Chinese government on environmental protection and sustainability. And it's remarkable to see Canadian companies showcasing clean solutions and striking deals to bring their technology and expertise to customers in China. As we work to develop a stronger trade relationship with China, such partnerships will improve the quality of life of people in China while supporting good, middle-class jobs and prosperity in both countries."- Catherine McKenna, Minister of Environment and Climate ChangeContact: Marie-Pascale Des Rosiers, press secretary, 613-883-4948, marie-pascale.desrosiers@mobile.gc.caCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6105839 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 14, 2017End of Document

All Rights ReservedLength: 668 wordsByline: aheath@businessinsider.com,  (Alex Heath)Highlight: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has returned to China as his company eyes the oppurtunity to finally start doing business in the country.BodyFacebook• Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's annual trip to China is underway.• The timing of this trip is significant because Facebook is currently showing signs of increased efforts to begin business in the country.• One analyst recently said there is "a realistic opportunity" for Facebook to finally enter China in 2018.Mark Zuckerberg is back in China.The Facebook CEO posted a photo of him visiting with Chinese students at the Tsinghua School of Economics and Management in Beijing on Saturday, more than one year after his last public trip to the country.Zuckerberg's latest visit to China comes as Facebook eyes what one analyst recently said is "a realistic opportunity" for the company to finally enter the world's largest internet market by users in 2018.While Facebook's service has been banned in China since 2009, the social network recently tapped William Shuai from LinkedIn to lead relations with the Chinese government. Facebook has also been covertly testing a photo-sharing app in China and is said to be on the hunt for a Shanghai office for its fledgling consumer hardware division, Building 8.In his Facebook post on Saturday, Zuckerberg said he was in China for a meeting of the Tsinghua school's advisory board, of which he has been a member since 2014. "Every year this trip is a great way to keep up with the pace of innovation and entrepreneurship in China," he wrote.Facebook has flirted with the idea of entering China for years, a move that could give it access to a vast new market of users and advertisers at a time when the company is under pressure to continue showing strong growth to investors. Zuckerberg has learned Mandarin well enough to become a proficient speaker of the language. Facebook could create its own censorship tool for ChinaFacebookDuring his last public trip to China in March 2016, Zuckerberg met with the country's propaganda chief and other government leaders. It's unclear whether he plans to meet with government officials again during this trip - a Facebook spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on his trip schedule.As the world's largest concentration of internet users, China is an attractive but challenging region for American tech companies like Facebook to break into. The government recently blocked Facebook-owned WhatsApp amidst a crackdown of online censorship.Google famously pulled its search engine service out of mainland China in 2010, after claiming that the country's censorship requirements had become too onerous and saying it had traced efforts to breach its users' accounts to China.One way Facebook has considered getting back into China is by creating its own censorship tool that would automatically suppress certain posts in specific geographic areas, The New York Times reported last year. It's unclear if the tool is still being developed.Facebook's window of opportunity to begin business in the country could be drawing near as Chinese President Xi Jinping begins his second term in November, according to Mizuho analyst James Lee, who recently noted that "media scrutiny and sensitivity are much less during an administration's second term."According to Lee, Facebook's current approach of helping Chinese advertisers sell ads overseas also "appears to be aligned with Chinese government's policy to globalize local companies," and could finally lead to the company securing the coveted Internet Content Provider (ICP) license needed to officially do business in China.NOW WATCH: An old video of Mark Zuckerberg shows the teenager in flannel pajamas opening his Harvard acceptance e-mailSee Also:• Here are the best deals for saving money on the pricey iPhone X• TRANSPORTATION AND LOGISTICS BRIEFING: Delphi will acquire nuTonomy for $450 million - Tesla looks to unlock China with new factory - Urban warehouse space in high demand in Europe• Twitter says it will make all its ads public, and share who is behind themSEE ALSO: Here's why Facebook has 'a realistic opportunity' to enter China in 2018Load-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

Deloitte announces US$200 million strategic investment in China; Celebrating 100 years of impact in the China marketplaceMarketwiredSeptember 25, 2017 Monday 1:19 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Marketwire, L.P. All Rights ReservedLength: 1250 wordsDateline: SHANGHAI, CHINA; Sep 25, 2017Body On the occasion of its first centenary in China, Deloitte is pleased to announce a strategic investment program of US$200 million into talent development and capability upgrade. This program will be dedicated to enhancing its advisory services, advancing digital and technology transformation for the firm and Chinese enterprises, supporting the Belt & Road Initiative, as well as assisting Chinese enterprises in going global.

Survey: US firms losing confidence in China business climateAssociated Press InternationalDecember 6, 2017 Wednesday 11:07 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 503 wordsByline: By KELVIN CHAN, AP Business WriterDateline: HONG KONG BodyHONG KONG (AP) - U.S. companies in China are seeing their sales improve but are frustrated by policies and regulatory barriers that block better access to the country's lucrative market, according to a survey released Wednesday.The U.S.-China Business Council's survey showed most companies are enjoying better profitability and expecting higher revenues for their China operations as the economy revives.But restricted market access and uncertainty over Beijing's policies toward foreign companies have left them less optimistic about the business climate than in recent years.The council represents 200 U.S. companies doing business with China. Results from the annual survey were based on responses from more than half its members.Challenges include fierce competition from Chinese rivals, demands for technology transfers and strict cyber regulations."Most of the regulatory challenges that companies face each day did not see improvement this year," President John Frisbie said. "The stagnation in implementation of needed economic reforms is undermining confidence among American companies that their concerns will be addressed."Chinese competition is a perennial concern, with companies saying their domestic competitors, both state-owned and private, are benefiting from preferential government financing, approvals and access to government contracts. That's led some firms to reduce or halt their investment plans.Other issues have gained in urgency given recent tensions between the U.S. and China over Beijing's efforts to acquire foreign technological know-how and control the internet.One in five companies reported being asked to transfer their technology to China. The council said it is an "acute problem" for companies that receive such requests, often from their Chinese partners rather than government entities.The requests are sometimes part of normal commercial negotiations, but "in many cases the hand of the Chinese government is behind these requests," the report said. Half of companies who received such requests said they were unacceptable but they still had to transfer some technology.Tech transfers have caught the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has accused China of abusive practices. In August, he ordered his trade office to launch an investigation of possible Chinese theft of U.S. technology and intellectual property.Four out of five companies surveyed said they were somewhat or very concerned about the impact on business operations of cyber and data regulations, including restrictions on the internet and on use of virtual private networks that let users get around the Chinese government's filters.Most internet users in China are prevented from accessing many overseas sites by the filters, known as the "Great Firewall."

Results from the annual survey were based on responses from more than half its members.Challenges include fierce competition from Chinese rivals, demands for technology transfers and strict cyber regulations."Most of the regulatory challenges that companies face each day did not see improvement this year," President John Frisbie said. "The stagnation in implementation of needed economic reforms is undermining confidence among American companies that their concerns will be addressed."Chinese competition is a perennial concern, with companies saying their domestic competitors, both state-owned and private, are benefiting from preferential government financing, approvals and access to government contracts. That's led some firms to reduce or halt their investment plans.Other issues have gained in urgency given recent tensions between the U.S. and China over Beijing's efforts to acquire foreign technological know-how and control the internet.One in five companies reported being asked to transfer their technology to China. The council said it is an "acute problem" for companies that receive such requests, often from their Chinese partners rather than government entities.The requests are sometimes part of normal commercial negotiations, but "in many cases the hand of the Chinese government is behind these requests," the report said. Half of companies who received such requests said they were unacceptable but they still had to transfer some technology.Tech transfers have caught the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has accused China of abusive practices. In August, he ordered his trade office to launch an investigation of possible Chinese theft of U.S. technology and intellectual property.Four out of five companies surveyed said they were somewhat or very concerned about the impact on business operations of cyber and data regulations, including restrictions on the internet and on use of virtual private networks that let users get around the Chinese government's filters.Most internet users in China are prevented from accessing many overseas sites by the filters, known as the "Great Firewall." It is a bulwark in the vision of a censored internet promoted at a conference this week in eastern China that drew many high-profile figures from the tech world, including top executives of Apple, Google and other Silicon Valley companies.Load-Date: December 7, 2017End of Document

Tesla Steals Big Auto's Chinese Lunch (Apparently)RealMoneyOctober 26, 2017 Thursday 10:00 AM EDTCopyright 2017 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1286 wordsByline: Alex McMillanHighlight: Tesla has first-mover advantage with electric cars yet again, this time apparently with a 100% -owned factory planned for Shanghai. Its competitors never learn.BodyOverseas carmakers will be encouraged by a report that Tesla  has won permission to build a factory of its own in China, which would be a first for a foreign brand. The suits sitting in smog-cloaked Beijing want to see China's roads populated by plug-in, not petrol-charged cars. It will happen. In China, what Beijing says, goes. And it looks like Tesla will be there to capitalize.Other foreign automakers could follow suit. The only problem is that heel draggers such as Mercedes-Benz  , General Motors  and Fiat Chrysler  have yet to produce any vague form of popular category filler, let alone a "category killer," in the "new-energy vehicle" market that China so desperately wants to encourage.Tesla has agreed a deal to build a factory in Shanghai that it will own 100%, according to The Wall Street Journal. That's significant because Tesla, with so much intellectual property at stake behind its battery technology, would not have to hand it over to a joint-venture partner. Such joint ventures are required by law for car companies, so that's a process that has taken place with every other foreign manufacturer operating in the Middle Kingdom. The tech transfer makes foreign partners wary, and rightly so. Most Chinese partners will rip off your tech and copy it right away.Tesla would be able to wholly own the Shanghai operation because it would be built in the city's new free-trade zone. The company would still have to pay the 25% duty that China charges on imported cars. But the location would cut down dramatically on production and distribution costs, and expand production of its sole car factory so far, in Fremont, Calif., which simply can't make enough cars. A good problem to have.I explored this topic as a guest on the show Money Talk on Wednesday, where we had a three-way discussion on the topic, on Hong Kong's RTHK Radio 3. Here's the link to that specific podcast . We also considered the fascinating and probably hilarious meeting due to take place between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump when Trump arrives in Beijing for a three-day visit starting Nov. 8. Both leaders will also assemble from Nov. 11-12 for the APEC summit of the heads of state of the 21 member nations in Danang, Vietnam.Tesla has not, as you may have got the impression, confirmed that it will build the Shanghai plant. Officially, the company merely  , first made in June, that it is in talks with the Shanghai Municipal Government "to explore the possibility" of opening a factory there. It promises to "more clearly define our plans for production in China" by the end of the year. It expects to continue to produce most of its cars in the United States, but believes it also needs to establish local factories overseas. Europe is another potential plant location.Its pioneering Shanghai plant would be well watched by the trifecta "alliance" of Renault  , Nissan Motor  and Mitsubishi Motors  , currently the world's largest producer of electric cars. Combined, they had shifted 481,000 units of cars such as Nissan's Leaf, Renault's Zoe and Mitsubishi's i-Miev as of the end of June.Renault and Nissan are teaming up with Wuhan-based Dongfeng Motor Group  on an electric-vehicle joint venture in China, the partners announced in August. But Dongfeng will own 50% of the joint venture, eGT New Energy Automotive. Renault and Nissan will each own 25%, the companies said . The first offering will be based on a small sport/utility vehicle that Renault and Nissan already produce together. Nissan makes the Leaf in China, but it hasn't designed an electric car there - this would be the first.China is already the world's largest consumer of electric vehicles, with more than 300,000 sold last year, and a similar amount made. But the Chinese government would like to see e-production capacity to increase to 2 million units per year by 2020.That's part of a broader push to meet a target that "new-energy" electric, plug-in hybrid and fuel-cell cars make up at least 20% of total vehicle sales by 2025. And when the government sets a target in China that it controls, in a market where it grants all the licenses and approves all production, it gets its way.I was also just in Danang, and witnessed motorcade after motorcade heading to nearby Hoi An as the VIP finance ministers from the 21 APEC nations got together in a preliminary meeting, APEC's second-most important. It's a dress rehearsal for the gathering of the leaders early next month. What a dress rehearsal, too! Southeast Asia loves its uniforms, and every arm of the Vietnamese disciplined services was out and in effect.It's a big deal for Vietnam to host APEC, particularly after the United States pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was meant to benefit Vietnam more than any other nation with U.S. participation. The TPP would have allowed much more liberal interpretations of the "Made in XX" tag, with the bulk of production for instance able to take place in Vietnam while a Mazda  retains a "Made in Japan" stamp of approval.The remaining 11 members of the TPP are now deciding how to proceed without the United States. Trump pulling the United States out of the deal is, to me, a huge mistake. It would have lowered tariffs massively on U.S. exports such as beef, cars and pharmaceuticals heading into Japan. The United States has no bilateral trade deal with the world's third-largest economy, and must now become great by doing all that spadework on its own.It would also be a great coup for Shanghai to lure a Tesla factory. The city is the de facto capital of auto production in China. Having Tesla as its tenant would cement it and encourage development not just of cars for China, but likely models for the rest of Asia, the rest of the world, too.I'm actually waiting for that flow of cars out of China to happen. It's not only the largest consumer of cars, but also the largest producer as well. I'm certain that Chinese car makers such as Quoros and Chery will undoubtedly begin to make cars that prove popular overseas, following the lead of first Japanese carmakers such as Toyota Motor  and Honda Motor  and then Korean competitors such as Hyundai Motor  , Kia Motors  and SsangYong Motor KR:003620.China is home to the top six producers of electric vehicles,  . BYD  tops the unit's global index of the industry's e-makers, followed by Jiangling Motors SH:000550 and BAIC Motor  .Ford Motor  said it is evaluating the merits of forming a joint venture with Anhui Zotye Automobile SH:000980 to produce electric vehicles in China. So far, no U.S. producer made the top 10 of the world's top electric-vehicle makers.Mercedes-Benz and BMW haven't been much better about developing proper versions of their gas guzzling sedans to compete with Tesla. That's why - until the government unwisely removed its tax waiver on the purchase of new electric cars - Tesla was destroying its nearest competitors in the luxury sedan market here in Hong Kong. Now, I'm sure thanks to lots of complaining from the conventional car makers, the waiver has gone, petrol-engine cars are slightly cheaper, and no one is buying a Tesla in Hong Kong. As Trump would say, "Sad."Big auto makers have been unbelievably slow at plugging in. They have had more than two decades to do it, and have let a totally untested maker in the former of Tesla completely steal the market. Finally, Merc parent Daimler  has a joint electric-car brand in China with BYD, and BMW  has set one up with Brilliance China Automotive Holding  .But Chinese-made Teslas selling in China will provide fierce competition. It has first mover advantage with a fully owned factory, if that goes ahead. China's category killer indeed.Load-Date: October 27, 2017End of Document

President Donald Trump Criticized Over Lack of Press Conference in ChinaUSNEWS.comNovember 10, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Ken Walsh's Washington; Vol.; No.Length: 476 wordsByline: Kenneth T. WalshHighlight: President chose not to take questions at request of Chinese.BodyPresident Donald Trump and his advisers are in hot water with journalists again because they gave in to Chinese demands and didn't allow reporters to ask questions at a joint appearance between Trump and Chinese President            Xi Jinping. It's been customary in recent years for American presidents and their staffs to resist Chinese demands for no questions on such occasions. But Trump and his aides went along with their Chinese counterparts in Beijing Thursday. "It was at the Chinese insistence there were no questions today," White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters. The White House stance brought swift criticism. "They always insist, Sarah," wrote Susan Rice, former national security adviser for President Barack Obama, on Twitter. "The trick is to use diplomacy to extract that concession as a matter of principle, despite their resistance." Former Obama press secretary Jay Carney tweeted that the Trump decision was "an embarrassing capitulation" that allowed the Chinese government to "dictate press access." Obama didn't take questions when he appeared with the Chinese president during his first visit to China in 2009, and he was criticized for it. When he returned to China in 2014, he insisted that the media be allowed to ask questions and reporters did. Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton also took questions from the media during their trips to China. Margaret Talev, a reporter for Bloomberg and president of the White House Correspondents' Association, said she was "disappointed in the outcome." She told Politico: "We always make the case for news conferences in each stop and especially in China where there is so much interest and crucial policy. This time was no different." READ: [Year One of Donald Trump Brings Convulsion to Washington]Chuck Todd, a NBC commentator and former NBC White House correspondent, wrote on Twitter; "China isn't supposed to have a say about press access. Previous press secs used to fight with Chinese counterparts for press access when in China. Witnessed personally." Jake Tapper, a CNN commentator, tweeted, "The Chinese government never wants to take questions from US reporters. In the past American presidents have insisted upon it as a demonstration of standing up for the freedoms our nation believes in." During his campaign and as president, Trump has tangled frequently with the U.S. news media and has called them the "enemy of the American people."Ken  Walsh covers the White House and politics for U.S. News.

CHINA AGAIN EXPANDS CENSORSHIP TO OVERSEAS ACADEMIC PUBLISHERSStates News ServiceNovember 2, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 845 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:One of the world's largest academic publishers has confirmed that it blocked access to some 1,000 journal articles to Chinese internet users because they contained banned keywords relating to political topics such as Tibet, Taiwan, or the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976).Springer Nature, which publishes Nature and the Scientific American, blocked the articles, all of which appeared in the Journal of Chinese Political Science and International Politics, the company said in a statement."As a global publisher we are required to take account of the local rules and regulations in the countries in which we distribute our published content," the company told the Financial Times newspaper."China's regulatory requirements oblige us to operate our SpringerLink platform in compliance with their local distribution laws [which] only apply to local access to content," it said.The articles remain accessible to anyone outside of the complex system of blocks, filters, and human censorship known collectively as the Great Firewall."This is not editorial censorship," it said. "In not taking action we ran the very real risk of all of our content being blocked."In August, the Cambridge University Press (CUP) said it had censored more than 300 articles from the China Quarterly academic journal's China website at the request of media regulators in Beijing, citing similar reasons.However, it later reversed the decision, and refused a later request from the State Administration of Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television (SAPPRFT) to block around 100 articles published by the Journal of Asian Studies.Expanding influenceJonathan Sullivan, director of Nottingham University's China Policy Institute, and the author of one of the articles which have been blocked, told the Financial Times: "It's a symbol of how unprepared we are in the West for China's influence expanding outwards."A request for comment by RFA to Springer Nature went unanswered by the time of writing on Thursday.Retired Shandong University professor Sun Wenguang agreed, saying that nowthat China has imposed stringent controls on online content in its own backyard, it is looking to extend censorship overseas."They want to make sure that only the content they approve of ever makes it into people's minds," Sun said. "Imposing total control on the internet is no longer enough for them.""This will affect a lot of students, as well as the editing of teaching materials in mainland Chinese high schools, higher education, and elementary schools," he said. "Of course the academy produces biased output, and its impact is very wide-reaching indeed."Meanwhile, James Sung, politics lecturer at Hong Kong's City University, told RFA that the ruling Chinese Communist Party's focus on state security and the requirements of the regime have gone up a notch since the 19th party congress last month."A lot of university lecturers [in China], especially the younger ones, hold views that are pretty sympathetic to Western ideas of democracy and human rights," Sung said. "The central propaganda ministry and ideological departments are very concerned about this, so they are calling for some curbs.""We may think that academics and scholars make up a very small segment of the population, and have little to do with ordinary people's lives. But from Beijing's point of view, they are still hugely influential.""We are now seeing whether overseas publishing houses have enough clout to negotiate with China," Sung said.'Try not to offend China'U.S.-based democracy activist Fang Zheng said publishers nowadays fear Beijing's displeasure."So they comply with some of the requirements of the Chinese government, for fear of offending them and losing a lot of benefits," Fang said. "Then there are no traces to be found of real history.""The Chinese government is rich, and they are using their financial clout to influence values around the entire world, which is terrible," he said.University of Sydney professor Feng Chongyi said overseas governments haven't yet woken up to China's growing political, economic, and cultural influence beyond its borders."It's as if there is a global consensus among states that we must ... try not to offend China," Feng said. "This is a two-sided process whereby China has something they want, so overseas governments and the business community slowly weaken their stance and avoid criticism of this authoritarian regime.""We need some legislation. We can't allow this situation to continue," Feng said.And in Germany, exiled dissident writer Liao Yiwu said the publishing industry is selling its soul for profit."They are giving up their own values of academic freedom and supremacy, and this has shaken the academic world to its foundations," Liao said. "They should display their motto clearly on their logos 'business trumps scholarship: profit trumps academic [freedom]."Reported by Gao Feng for RFA's Mandarin Service and by Wu Yitong for the Cantonese Service.

Canada and China sign text on climate change without progress in FTACE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 4, 2017 MondayCopyright 2017 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2017 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 647 wordsBodyOttawa, 4 Dec (Notimex).-the first Canadian Minister Justin Trudeau today signed a joint statement, where both Governments are committed to acting against climate change and to take "decisive steps" to reduce emissions with his Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang's carbon and sustainable development.The environmental declaration defines as a "global challenge" to climate change and urge to move to a clean growth economy, which requires a "decisive, cooperative and cooperative" response from Governments, enterprises and other actors, in a context sustainable development and poverty eradication.In his statement, Trudeau and Li agreed that the intensification of cooperation between Canada and China is vital to mitigate climate change and adapt to its effects around the world. They stressed that environmental protection and economic growth "they go hand in hand," so it pledged to take concrete measures to encourage the transition to competitive, low-carbon and climate-resilient economy and society, and promote the growth clean.Although there were high expectations that in the first visit by Trudeau to China was announced the start of negotiations for a bilateral free trade agreement, on Monday there were no ads in that sense, but if there were differences in logistics, as reported Canadian media.The Canadian press reported some situations, like the fact that Trudeau should promote the network Sinai Weibo, China internet giant, Canadian destinations, without that authorization perform a broadcast live by social networks.When Trudeau was about to greet Li at the great wall, security officers blocked the view of photographers with hands and bodies, and in addition it was reported that an official from the Chinese Foreign Ministry claimed its counterpart Canadian for not bringing the passports of the reporters accompanying the Prime Minister.After the meeting between two heads of Government on Monday, planned a joint news conference that was canceled by the Chinese Government, according to the Canadian Foreign Ministry.However, the Protocol remained and Trudeau said that the meeting is a precedent to the first trade agreement with a country in the G7, "there is a desire that we will do well", although he clarified that his Government seeks a progressive trade that includes gender issues Labor and environment.For his part, Li said that the event is a testimony of the "golden era" in the bilateral relationship, and told Trudeau that "it also shows the importance you attributed to the relationship between our two countries". In addition to trade, the Canadian Prime Minister seeks in this tour promoting tourism, so announced that both countries will hold the "year of the Canada-china tourism" in 2018.During this four-day visit, is expected that Trudeau progress towards a possible Treaty of free trade, but at the same time is expected with China dealing with the arrest of a couple of Canadian from Vancouver who was arrested in the country since March of 2016.Explained the daughter of detainees, Amy Chang, in a letter in which Trudeau asked his speech, his parents possess vineyards in Ontario and British Columbia and were accused by Chinese authorities of failing to properly report the value of the wine exported to Asia.While his mother was released from prison, the Chinese Government not permitted to leave the country, while his father arrested health deteriorates.The 24-year-old boy asked Trudeau to intervene for the release of their parents, who have contributed to the Canadian economy and they are prisoners for commercial reasons.In this regard, the Minister of international trade of Canada, François-Philippe Champagne, who accompanies Trudeau on the tour, said that this case takes it as something "very personal" and reminded that "we have expressed our dissatisfaction to our Chinese counterpart and" concerns in this regard".Load-Date: December 6, 2017End of Document

China Announces Launch Of Emissions Trading MarketThe FrontrunnerDecember 20, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 433 wordsBodyThe New York Times (12/19, Bradsher, Friedman, Subscription Publication, 15.39M) reports China released plans on Tuesday to begin over the next several years "a giant market to trade credits for the right to emit planet-warming greenhouse gases." The Times adds that the announcement "could give global efforts to combat climate change a boost after President Trump signaled this year that the United States would back away from Obama-era vows to curb emissions." In addition, because the market would initially cover only China's "vast, state-dominated power generation sector," the announcement "could disappoint those who were hoping the long-promised emissions market would cover the country's broader economy." Still, the Times says, "environmental groups welcomed the move."New Campaign To Curb Chinese Influence In Australia Provokes Backlash.The New York Times (12/19, Cave, Subscription Publication, 15.39M) says "a thunderous backlash" has erupted against allegations of Chinese influence in Australian politics. The backlash includes "a public outcry condemning anyone accused of links to Chinese influence, and a series of new bills that would strengthen espionage laws, outlaw foreign political donations and criminalize efforts to interfere in Australian democracy." These activities have generated "fears that [the campaign] risks becoming a McCarthy-esque witch hunt," and critics "of the legislation...worry that it, and the intensity of anti-China sentiment, will squash legitimate debate and unfairly target Australia's large and diverse ethnic Chinese community." However, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull "has emphasized that the proposed laws are not explicitly aimed at China, or Australia's Chinese," and said when he introduced the legislation, "We must ensure Australian democracy is resilient to all threats, from any country."WSJournal: Government Using Xinjiang Province As "Laboratory For Social Controls."In a 2,500-word report, the Wall Street Journal (12/19, Chin, Subscription Publication, 6.45M) describes the heavy Chinese government surveillance in Xinjiang, a province bordering Central Asia. The Journal says the Chinese government has been rolling out new techniques for "social controls" - or close monitoring of daily life, including through the use of new high-tech tools - across the country, which it tests in Xinjiang, monitoring Uighurs, China's Muslim minority, in particular. Government surveillance in Xinjiang includes close Internet surveillance as well as police checkpoints, surveillance cameras, scanning machines for ID cards, and body cameras.Load-Date: December 20, 2017End of Document

This follows the signing of a definitive agreement with the People's Government of Shunqing District, Nanchong City of Sichuan Province for the production of 300,000 metric tons of bio-composite materials and additive manufacturing and 20,000 metric tons of functional masterbatch." "Our new facility in Dubai also extends our specialized high-tech products into an important overseas market. We plan to complete the installation of 45 production lines with 12,000 metric tons of annual production capacity by the first quarter of 2018, and to complete the installation of an additional 50 production lines with 13,000 metric tons of annual production capacity by the second quarter of 2018.  This will bring the total annual production capacity in our Dubai facility to 25,000 metric tons. The Dubai facility will target high-end products for overseas markets and will ultimately enable more active inroads into the markets of Europe, the Middle East, Russia and other overseas markets.""We believe our substantial production increase and geographical expansion via our Sichuan facility solidifies our core automobile sector business.  Further, our new investment agreements to undertake major expansion projects will lead to a wider range of product capabilities and further diversified customer base.  In our view, this represents a further evolution of the company into a multifaceted leading specialty chemical company that augments our existing capabilities and enables us to engage numerous new verticals.  We believe that these strategic initiatives form a platform for sustainable growth for the next several years and well positions us for opportunities presented by China's new economy.  We are excited by this period of dynamic growth and this next evolution of the Company." Mr. Han concluded.Second Quarter 2017 ResultsRevenues were $313.6 million for the second quarter of 2017, compared to $277.1 million for the same period of 2016, representing an increase of $36.5 million, or 13.2%. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to 17.0% increase in sales volume and 1.8% increase in the average RMB selling price of our products.The increase in revenues in the second quarter of 2017 was driven by growth in demand for our products in the domestic China market, our efforts to expand our customer base attributable to our new plant in Sichuan and our efforts to increase overseas sales.  We recorded sales increases of 166.2% in Central China, 76.7% in Southwest China, 49.1% in South China, 22.1% in North China, 7.7% in East China and 5.1% in Northeast China as compared to the same period in 2016.  Overseas sales resumed in the second quarter of 2017 and were $33.0 million in the period, compared to $35.7 million in the same period of 2016, representing a decrease of $2.7 million, or 7.6%. The overseas customer has an outstanding balance of $65.1 million, of which a balance of $31.9 million was overdue as of June 30, 2017. The overseas customer has made payments of $42.5 million in the first half year of 2017, and we expect to collect the outstanding balance in the third quarter of 2017.Premium products (PA66, PA6, Plastic Alloy, PLA, POM and PPO) in total accounted for 81.4% of revenues in the second quarter of 2017, compared to 80.8% for the same period of 2016. The Company continued to shift its production mix from traditional polymer materials to higher-end products due to (i) better end consumer recognition of higher-end cars made by automotive manufacturers from Chinese and Germany joint ventures, and U.S. and Japanese joint ventures, (ii) the stronger demand for higher-end products as a result of the Chinese government's promotion for clean energy vehicles, and (iii) the greater growth potential of advanced modified plastics in luxury models in China, where manufacturers tend to use more and higher-end modified plastics in quantity per vehicle in China.Gross profit was $63.1 million for the second quarter of 2017, compared to $60.3 million for the same period of 2016, representing an increase of $2.8 million, or 4.6%.  Gross margin was 20.1% for the second quarter of 2017, compared to 21.8% for the same period of 2016, primarily due the lower gross margin of higher-end products sold in the domestic market in the current period as compared to the same period in 2016.General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $8.8 million for the second quarter of 2017, compared to $6.6 million for the same period of 2016, representing an increase of $2.2 million, or 33.3%.  This increase was primarily due to (i) the increases in salary and welfare expenses resulted from the increase in the number of management and general staff from supporting departments and in the average salary and bonus, (ii) the increase of professional fee (iii) the increase of depreciation and amortization, (iv) the increase of taxation, and (v) the increase of rental fee.Research and development (R&D) expenses were $9.5 million for the second quarter of 2017, compared to $5.9 million for the same period of 2016, representing an increase of $3.6 million, or 61.0%. This increase was primarily due to (i) elevated R&D activities to meet the higher quality requirements of potential customers from Europe, (ii) increased R&D efforts directed towards applications in new electrical equipment, alternative energy applications, power devices, aviation equipment and ocean engineering, in addition to other new products primarily for advanced industrialized applications in the automobile sector and in new verticals such as ships, airplanes, high-speed rail, 3D printing materials, biodegradable plastics and medical devices, and (iii) an increase in depreciation expenses after R&D equipment was put into use at Sichuan Xinda Enterprise Group Company Limited ("Sichuan Xinda"). As of June 30, 2017, the number of ongoing research and development projects was 286.Operating income was $44.0 million for the second quarter of 2017, compared to $47.4 million for the same period of 2016, representing a decrease of $3.4 million, or 7.2%. This decrease was primarily due to higher G&A expenses and higher R&D expenses.Net interest expense was $11.0 million for the second quarter of 2017, compared to net interest expense of $9.0 million for the same period of 2016, representing an increase of $2.0 million, or 22.2%. This increase was primarily due to (i) the increase of interest expense due to the increase of the average short-term and long-term loan balance in the amount of $849.0 million for the three-month period ended June 30, 2017 compared to $496.6 million for the same period in 2016, which was partially offset by the decrease of the weighted loan interest rate of 4.9% for the three-month period ended June 30, 2017 as compared to 5.2% for the same period of 2016, (ii) a decrease of interest income resulting from the decrease of the average interest rate to 1.5% for the three-month period ended June 30, 2017 compared to 2.4% of the same period in 2016, and the decrease of the average deposit balance in the amount of $266.9 million for the three-month period ended June 30, 2017 compared to $409.6 million for the same period of 2016.Income tax expense was $4.1 million for the second quarter of 2017, representing an effective income tax rate of 12.8%, compared to income tax expense of $5.3 million in the same period of 2016, representing an effective income tax rate of 13.6%. The decrease of effective income tax rate was primarily due to a greater portion of the profit generated by Sichuan Xinda which enjoys preferential tax rate and the increase of the super deduction of R&D expense. The effective income tax rate for the three-month ended June 30, 2017 differs from the PRC statutory income tax rate of 25% primarily due to the effect of the tax rate difference on various subsidiaries not subject to the PRC statutory income tax rate .Net income was $28.1 million for the second quarter of 2017, compared to $33.3 million for the same period of 2016, representing a decrease of $5.2 million, or 15.6%. Basic and diluted earnings per share in the current quarter were $0.43, compared to $0.51 per basic and diluted share for the same period of 2016.  The average number of shares used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share current quarter was 49.5 million, compared to 49.4 million shares for basic and diluted earnings per share in the prior year period.Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was $54.7 million for the second quarter of 2017, compared to $56.4 million for the same period of 2016, representing a decrease of $1.7 million, or 3.0%.  For a detailed reconciliation of EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, to its nearest GAAP equivalent, please see the financial tables at the end of this release.Financial ConditionAs of June 30, 2017, the Company had $559.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and time deposits, an increase of $103.2 million or 22.6% as compared to $456.4 million as of December 31, 2016.  As of the current period, working capital was $185.7 million (current assets minus current liabilities) and the current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) was 1.2, equivalent to the current ratio of 1.2 as of December 31, 2016. Stockholders' equity as of June 30, 2017 was $690.2 million, an increase of $55.9 million or 8.8% as compared to $634.3 million as of December 31, 2016.Inventories increased by $82.3 million or 29.3% to $363.2 million as of the second quarter of 2017 as compared to fiscal year end 2016 as a result of more purchases of raw materials and the Company's strategy to stock up on finished goods for upcoming orders.  The aggregate short-term and long-term bank loans increased by $143.5 million or 20.7% due to the utilization of existing lines of credit to support the expansion of the Sichuan and Dubai facilities.  We define the manageable debt level as the sum of aggregate short-term and long-term loans over total assets.  We expect that we will be able to meet our needs to fund operations, capital expenditures and other commitments in the next 12 months primarily with our cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows and bank borrowings. Recent EventsOn July 21, 2017, the Company issued a press release announcing the official signing of investment agreements between its subsidiary, Heilongjiang Xinda Enterprise Group Company Limited, and the Management Committee of Harbin Economic - Technological Development Zone with respect to the industrial project for 300,000 metric tons of biological composite materials, the industrial project for upgrading existing equipment for 100,000 metric tons of engineering plastics and the industrial project for a 3D printing intelligent manufacture demonstration factory and a 3D printing display and experience cloud factory. These projects will help the Company to expand its product mix into bio-based composites, 3D printing materials and functional masterbatch materials while maintaining our traditional petroleum-based materials, paving the path to non-auto applications and further diversifying the company's business as a key element of the Company's strategic plan. The total capital expenditures for the Company will be RMB 4,015 million (equivalent to be $592.7 million), among which the investment in fixed assets shall be no less than RMB3,295 million (equivalent to $486.4 million). Both the industrial project for 300,000 metric tons of biological composite materials and the industrial project for a 3D printing intelligent manufacturing demonstration factory and a 3D printing display and experience cloud factory are expected to be completed by the end of July 2019. The industrial project for upgrading existing equipment for 100,000 metric tons of engineering plastics is expected to be completed by the end of June 2018.On June 5, 2017, the Company announced that the special committee of its Board of Directors, which is composed entirely of independent directors (the "Special Committee"), has retained Duff & Phelps, LLC and Duff & Phelps Securities, LLC as the Special Committee's independent financial advisor, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP as its U.S. legal counsel and Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, LLP as its Nevada legal counsel in connection with its review and evaluation of the preliminary non-binding proposal letter dated February 16, 2017 from its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jie Han ("Mr. Han"), XD. Engineering Plastics Company Limited, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and wholly owned by Mr. Han, and MSPEA Modified Plastics Holding Limited, an affiliate of Morgan Stanley Private Equity Asia III, Inc. (collectively, the "Buyer Consortium"), to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company not already beneficially owned by the Buyer Consortium in a "going-private" transaction for $5.21 per share of common stock in cash.  The proposal letter states that the Buyer Consortium will not move forward with the proposed Transaction unless it is approved by such the Special Committee, and the proposed Transaction will be subject to a non-waivable condition requiring approval by majority shareholder vote of shareholders other than the Buyer Consortium members.  The Buyer Consortium currently beneficially owns approximately 74% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company on a fully diluted and as-converted basis.The Special Committee cautions the Company's shareholders and others considering trading in its securities that the Special Committee has not made any decisions with respect to the Company's response to the proposal.  There can be no assurance that any definitive offer will be made by the Buyer Consortium or any other person, that any definitive agreement will be executed relating to the proposed Transaction, or that this or any other transaction will be approved or consummated.Financial Guidance and Business OutlookThe Company reiterates its financial guidance for fiscal 2017 with revenue to range between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, and net income to range between $85.0 million to $100.0 million. This is based on the anticipation of a continued recovery throughout the Chinese automotive supply chain and a stabilization of crude oil pricing and its impact on polymer composite materials in 2017. This forecast also assumes additional contributions from the Sichuan facility and that overseas sales will be resumed in the second half of 2017.  It also assumes the average exchange rate of the US dollar to RMB at 6.8 and that the Company will incur interest expenses for loan term loans and short term loans. This financial guidance reflects the Company's preliminary view of its business outlook for the fiscal year of 2017 and is subject to revision based on changing market conditions at any time.Conference CallChina XD Plastics' senior management will host a conference call at 9:00 am Eastern Time on Wednesday, August 9, 2017, to discuss its second quarter 2017 financial results.  The conference call can be accessed by dialing +1-844-534-5152 (for callers in the U.S.), +86-4006-065-845 (for Mainland China callers) or +852-3008-1527 (for Hong Kong callers) and entering pass code 2561379.A recording of the conference call will be available through August 17, 2017, by calling +1-888-203-1112 (for callers in the U.S.) and entering pass code 2561379.A live webcast and replay of the conference call will be available on the investor relations page of the Company's website athttp://www.chinaxd.net.About China XD Plastics Company Limited                    China XD Plastics Company Limited, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, develops, manufactures and sells polymer composites materials, primarily for automotive applications.

Is China big enough for U.S. investors yet?Philly.comOctober 12, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 Distributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWSLength: 880 wordsByline: Joseph N. DiStefano, Philly.comBodyOct. 12--I was skimming headlines at Bloomberg.com when an ad for HSBC Corp. filled the screen like a news-killing fog.It urged us to buy China stocks -- now! -- before the Morgan Stanley stock indexes follow the rival Financial Times indexes in adding Beijing and Shanghai companies over the next couple years and the dumb money from American index-fund investors arrives in billion-dollar waves to inflate share values.Everyone who's paying attention knows China has grown past socialism and millions have gotten rich. But buying stocks there still sounds exotic to people here."Even if you're not ready to invest in Chinese equities, you need to understand what's going on there, because China now drives global growth," said Andy Rothman, investment strategist at Matthews Asia, a $31 billion-asset San Francisco firm part-owned by Radnor-based investment firm Lovell Minnick. Matthews Asia actively manages more than $5 billion in China stocks, more than any other U.S.-based firm, the company says.Rothman has been active in China for 30 years, starting as a Foreign Service officer. But he sounds like a missionary, repeating China market basics even to sophisticated U.S. investors. Chinese stocks, he noted, are worth $12 trillion, up from $2 trillion 10 years ago. "But when you pick up the paper or go online, nine of 10 stories predict China is going to collapse any day now, for a variety of reasons."We're past that, he insisted. China is the second-largest global economy. Its state-controlled heavy industry, export manufacturing, and overlarge state-bank-funded real-estate projects have been eclipsed, as to revenues and new investment capital, by new tech and consumer stocks. (The most familiar include Alibaba, "China's eBay," and Tencent, "China's Facebook.") Most new Chinese jobs and most new sales come from smaller private companies.China stock indexes don't yet reflect that. Matthews investment strategist Andrew Mattock said his firm makes money for its clients by picking 100 of the most promising of the 5,000 listed China stocks, whose collective price/earnings ratio he estimated at 15, which sounds like a bargain compared with big U.S. stocks.For sure, there's no shortage of warnings about Chinese business practices or investment risks that go beyond earnings reports. President Trump got investors' attention last month when he shot down the proposed sale of Lattice Semiconductor Corp. in Oregon to a firm controlled by Chinese government investors, citing "national-security risk."Never mind that Lattice says it makes "zero military product," or that its would-be Chinese buyers had promised to hire 1,000 Americans. The company's shares tumbled, costing Vanguard funds, the Pennsylvania state pension fund, and other investors millions. China's Xinhua propaganda agency said Trump was using the law as "a tool to implement protectionism."The president and his trade advisers weren't the only ones worried. In February, the Securities and Exchange Commission cited insider trading of Lattice shares as well as those of DreamWorks SKG, which Comcast acquired after outbidding a would-be Chinese buyer. The SEC said a few Chinese investors made millions buying U.S. stocks just before mergers were announced, ripping off U.S. shareholders.In both cases, the SEC said, illegal trades were led by a China-based Wharton School grad, Shaohua "Michael" Yin, exploiting inside information from Chinese investment bankers. Yin's lawyers were in court in New York last week, arguing the SEC can't prove who said what.China skepticism is familiar if you've followed short-seller advisers such as  Skippack-based Dan David and Maj Soueidan, whose adventures catching Chinese companies ripping off U.S. shareholders are chronicled in the movie The China Hustle, picked up for distribution by Magnolia Pictures last week. Buying China stocks as HSBC recommends "is an epically bad idea," David told me. "Most of the big-cap [China companies] are state-owned enterprises or frauds by design of the government."So many Morgan Stanley-backed China firms attracted fraud accusations, David said, he's thinking of a China Hustle sequel.Matthews Asia says careful investors are finding more sensibly priced bargains as China continues to grow faster than the U.S. or Europe. The view that the China outlook is improving is echoed by the nearly $5 trillion-asset Vanguard Group. It has minimal direct exposure to China, but its FTSE index-based funds, already more China-focused than Morgan Stanley, will be adding more."We advise investors to remain patient, yet vigilant," as China slowly improves its markets and legal system and eases foreign investment, Vanguard economist Qian Wang and colleagues Jessica Mengqi Wu and Zoe Bryn Odenwalder wrote in a white paper earlier this year. "In the long term, we remain constructive about China."But investing there remains tough to track on a big-picture scale, the Vanguard researchers acknowledged. Indeed, China stock returns have "little correlation with economic growth."That's a sobering admission from a broadly focused index-fund manager. It makes a case for stock-picking China specialists like Matthews.___ (c)2017 Philly.com Visit Philly.com at www.philly.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.Load-Date: October 12, 2017End of Document

'Killer' Chinese Competition Bites Into Apple iPhone 8 and XRealMoneySeptember 13, 2017 Wednesday 9:00 AM EDTCopyright 2017 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1008 wordsByline: Alex McMillanHighlight: There's a hot new smartphone out this week. And it's not from Apple.BodyYou may not have heard anything about it, because it's flying under the radar, but there's a new smartphone out this week. It's the Mi Mix 2 from Xiaomi.Xiaomi, which sold more smartphones in China than Apple  in the second quarter, calls the phone the "iPhone 8 Killer." The Beijing-based company purposefully released it a day before the iPhones 8 and X landed.The Mi Mix 2 is the latest in a stream of Chinese-made phones going up against the newest and shiniest offerings from the likes of Apple and Samsung Electronics  . Apple has suffered declining sales for six months in a row in China, the world's largest mobile-phone market. There are some 2.33 billion devices doing the rounds here.Not that Xiaomi, which saw a sharp drop in sales last year, has it all its own way. Xiaomi wasn't even in the top five Chinese smartphone sellers for 2016, which it called a "make-up year" after rising to No. 2 in 2015. It stopped releasing annual unit figures, sales were so bad.So both Apple and Xiaomi have something to prove.The new phone is Xiaomi's most-expensive model to date, just like the Apple X. The original Mi Mix started the "bezel-free" trend that you can say Apple is copying with efforts to get a "full-screen" phone without edges.The Mi Mix 2 sports a "unibody" carapace with sleek ceramic curves designed by Philippe Starck. With a full-screen display, it sells for 4,699 yuan ($720) for the top-of-the-line phone, and around $500 for the cheapest.Huawei Technologies, Lenovo Group  , Oppo and Vivo all provide home-grown competition for Xiaomi (and Apple) within mainland China. Besides Apple and Samsung, the top two dogs, Huawei, Xiaomi's Mi and Lenovo round out the top five in sales. LG Electronics, Sony  and the Taiwanese manufacturer HTC   land in the top 10 alongside the other Chinese brands.The Chinese manufacturers are fighting hard to overcome the prejudice against their products. I did a quick poll of my buddies here in Hong Kong as to who has tried out a Chinese smartphone, and one of the "half-joking" comments is that all the phones would be bugged by the Chinese government. Of course, people make similar jokes about Apple. Fresh off the pressers for the iPhone X and 8, the satirical newspaper The Onion reports that the new iPhone " Will No Longer Secretly Record Every Word You Say ."The new iPhones may kick off a "super-cycle" of sales for Apple's products. Sales have been flagging for iPhones but we'll soon see how much of that is due to people waiting to snap up the 10-year anniversary model.Chinese phone makers are certainly making headway outside China. As of mid-year, Chinese smartphone makers account for a record 48% of the market,  . They're truly global in reach.Huawei has "co-engineered" its most-recent phones with high-end-lens maker Leica. It has also partnered with "color company" Pantone to come up with the latest shades. The P10 came out in "  " Greenery as well as Dazzling Blue.I struggle to pass through an airport without noticing Huawei's ads. Scarlett Johansson was taking selfies with a Huawei handset at one point; David Beckham has sported them, too. The company is, through its partnerships, attempting to outdo competitors not only on hardware and performance but equally on the "phone as fashion accessory" front.The Huawei Nova 2 Plus comes with a 20-megapixel camera (eight more than the latest iPhone) and is a "Selfie Superstar," according to the company . Its Mate 9 Pro has a            curved-edge screen and a battery that charges in 20 minutes .As for the Mi, my daughter's 11-year-old BFF gave me the most-thorough review. The camera is clear for daytime shots and great because you can just press anywhere on the back to take a photo. But nighttime shots are really blurry. The apps worked quite well until it started getting laggy. The battery is really durable but the phone sometimes got really hot.So that's the pre-teen take. Her Dad, who is a fire chief, says the performance is even and the phone is steady. Good enough.Xiaomi's Mi Mix phones were some of the first to have an "edge-to-edge" display, the front of the phone virtually all screen with little in the way of bezel edge. It's very similar in size to the Samsung and LG phones, taller and thinner than an iPhone. The Mi Mix 2 isn't for sale in the United States, but it works on American phone networks. Its 12-megapixel camera is like the latest iPhones, and  the whole package "is legitimately a premium device" that "packs plenty of wow factor."One of its shortcomings is similar to that of other Chinese phones -- consumers simply aren't used to handling them. So the operating systems can seem a little strange at first. Xiaomi has its own take on the Android system that the fire chief struggled to get around at first when he switched from a Samsung.Apple has ceased being first-to-market with every technology that comes along. I guess, on this 10th anniversary of its smartphones, consumers can be thankful that competition is sometimes forcing the company to play catchup. But its products are famously intuitive as well as sleekly "designed in Cupertino" (and of course made in China).Here in Hong Kong, there are still plenty of Apple devotees (I would say 50% of my friends polled). But buyer beware ... there are knockoff Banana and Pear phones that look awfully similar in China ...Apple is doing its part for technical advances. It does promise that these new phones are already designed with augmented reality in mind -- and that they are prepared for wireless charging when the AirPower wireless charging accessory comes out in 2018. And Apple undoubtedly has its eye on China, where it has cooperated more with the government on curtailing errant VPN use than you might expect in the United States. I note that its  has, as a sample of its new translation feature, the question "How do you say what are the most popular dishes in your restaurant in Mandarin."Expect Xiaomi and Huawei to be telling you where to find the best chicken wings in Buffalo while chasing after a T Rex next.Load-Date: September 14, 2017End of Document

China's Xi calls for more technology developmentAssociated Press InternationalOctober 18, 2017 Wednesday 5:22 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 714 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - President Xi Jinping called Wednesday for the ruling Communist Party to lead development of Chinese technology industries, an area fraught with trade tensions and complaints that Beijing encourages theft of foreign know-how.In a speech at the opening of a party congress, Xi called for making a "country of innovators" and creating competitors in aerospace, cyberspace, clean energy and other areas. Xi promised to promote cooperation among universities, government research institutes, state companies and small enterprises.Tensions with Washington and Europe over technology policy is rising as Chinese companies emerge as global competitors in cellphones, solar power and other fields amid complaints that Beijing hampers access to its own markets.Intelligence analysts say the government encourages intellectual property theft.U.S. President Donald Trump ordered an investigation in August into whether China improperly requires foreign companies to hand over technology as a condition of market access."We will strengthen basic research in applied sciences, launch major national science and technology projects and prioritize innovation in key technologies," said Xi in a nationally televised speech.Chinese companies are spending billions of dollars a year on developing their own technology in computers, telecoms and other fields. But the country also is regarded as a global center for industrial spying and intelligence experts say the scale is growing as Beijing tries to create competitors in fields from robotics to energy to pharmaceuticals.Foreign business groups also have expressed concern about development plans they say would limit access to emerging industries by dictating in advance leading competitors will be Chinese-owned.Global companies are setting up research and development facilities in China but business groups say they are reluctant to transfer their most advanced technologies or conduct high-level research in this country for fear it will be stolen.Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, announced an agreement with Xi in 2015 to refrain from using government spy agencies to steal intellectual property for commercial use.It is unclear how broadly that prohibition might apply, because intelligence experts say Beijing has since the 1970s encouraged a wide range of sources including companies, scientists and students abroad to acquire technology.Intelligence analysts say Beijing offers rewards of cash, tax breaks, research grants or university tenure. They say the government operates a network of research centers and business parks to transform stolen know-how into commercial products.Chinese companies are stepping up acquisitions of foreign technology producers. That has prompted concern that the United States and European countries might be allowing the loss of important competitive assets.A Chinese buyer's acquisition of German robotics giant Kuka prompted appeals in Europe for laws requiring a review of such technology purchases.The president of the European Union's governing body announced plans last month for an investment-review process, a step seen as a response to complaints that Chinese companies were acquiring European technology while foreign companies are barred from purchasing most assets in China.In September, Trump blocked the acquisition of a semiconductor manufacturer, Lattice Semiconductor, by a Chinese government-financed buyer on national security grounds. A White House statement cited the importance of maintaining "semiconductor supply chain integrity" and the potential transfer of technology to a foreign buyer.Foreign business groups have complained that Beijing is improperly shielding Chinese technology suppliers from competition. That includes rules that limit Chinese banks' use of foreign security technology.In May, regulators agreed to postpone enforcement of a portion of a cybersecurity law that foreign companies and governments complained would hamper market access by limiting cross-border data flows.Foreign companies also have expressed alarm about a long-range technology plan dubbed "Made in China 2025" that calls for developing Chinese competitors in electric cars and other fields. Business groups say it would exclude foreign competitors from promising industries.Load-Date: October 19, 2017End of Document

This Thanksgiving, be thankful for the right to protestBadger Herald: University of Wisconsin - MadisonNovember 20, 2017 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 652 wordsByline: Zach UrismanBodyThis Thanksgiving, I'm thankful for the First Amendment.Liu Xiaobo had a storied life as a pro-democracy activist in China. When Chinese students protested against the communist regime in 1989 in Tiananmen Square, Xiaobo flew home from his visiting scholarship at Columbia to protest alongside them and negotiate for their peaceful evacuation. He saved hundreds of lives.Two decades later, he corralled hundreds of academics and activists to sign the Charter 08 document, which called for free elections, human rights and political checks and balances. The document ends with the statement, "We hope that all Chinese citizens who share this sense of crisis ... will hold back our differences to seek common ground ... and jointly promote the great transformation of the Chinese society, so that we can establish a free, democratic and constitutional nation in the near future and fulfill the dreams that our people have pursued tirelessly for more than a hundred years."Xiaobo's leadership in advocating for the document led to an 11-year jail sentence and the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize. China, after hearing that Xiaobo had received the Prize, blocked access to news websites announcing his win. Xiaobo served his time until he was diagnosed with liver cancer earlier this year. The Chinese government released him, only to prevent him from seeking medical attention abroad. He died in custody.Point Counterpoint: Free Speech is a universal rightUniversity of Wisconsin students value our First Amendment rights, as they have been a fundamental foundation of our university's history. Read...This is the story of dissent in other parts of the world. Democracy activists are jailed in Hong Kong. The same goes for those who oppose Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte's campaign of extrajudicial killings. If one dares run against Russian President Vladimir Putin, it seems as if they agree to put a down payment on the prison jumpsuit beforehand.In the United States of America, I get a newspaper column where I can disparage the president's policies regularly. One of the most recognizable protestors in the country is declared "Citizen of the Year" and emblazoned on the front cover of GQ Magazine. The Chinese government, by contrast, censored the publication of condolence posts on social media after Liu Xiaobo's death.In countries with nonexistent protection of free speech, opposition leaders "disappear." Here, millions of protestors pour into streets nationwide - and are celebrated. In as politically polarized times as these, we ought to be thankful that the First Amendment's protections are sacrosanct, and beyond President Trump's reach.The right to speak out is not limited to politics, of course. Printing truths against powerful figures is what led to the death of Harvey Weinstein's career. It's what has enabled so many women to assert their own stories of dealing with sexual harassment by the well-connected and ordinary alike. Coming forward is in itself a form of protest, a protest against the expected silence in facing those indignities.Sorry, but hate speech doesn't count as free speechI recently read an article titled "Are There Limits to Online Free Speech?" by Alice Marwick, assistant professor of communication and Read...The ability to protest hasn't always been guaranteed in this country, and sometimes has been met with resistance, both from the government or a private mob. This year, we should all commit ourselves to what Liu Xiaobo wrote in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech: "Freedom of expression is the foundation of human rights, the source of humanity and the mother of truth. To strangle freedom of speech is to trample on human rights, stifle humanity and suppress truth."As for other things to be thankful for, there was the magnificent Badger win over Michigan this past weekend. Happy Thanksgiving.Zach Urisman ([email protected]) is a senior majoring in finance. Load-Date: November 20, 2017End of Document

CHINA ENDS MONGOLIAN-MEDIUM TEACHING IN XINJIANG HIGH SCHOOLStates News ServiceDecember 22, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 685 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Chinese authorities in the northwestern region of Xinjiang have banned the use of Mongolian as a medium of instruction in the last high school to offer it, prompting an outcry among the country's ethnic Mongolian community, RFA has learned.Ethnic Mongolian pupils at the Bayingolin No. 3 High School in Xinjiang's Bayingolin Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture will now be required to use Mandarin Chinese in all classes and assignments, under a Sept. 1 directive issued by Xinjiang's regional education department."All classes offered in elementary and high schools must use Mandarin and written Chinese as the language of instruction," the document orders. "They must also offer ethnic languages as a separate class."Ethnic Mongolians, who number some 43,000 in Bayingolin, took to social media to decry the downgrading of their language from medium of instruction to elective course, the New York-based Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center (SMHRIC) said in a statement on its website."The 'ethnic language' mentioned in the document is offered as a single, separate, and elective course just like a foreign language," the group cited a Mongolian resident as saying. "It is no longer the language of instruction for any other courses."An ethnic Mongolian resident of the area said the community was stunned by the move."The wider Mongolian community is in a huge state of shock over the ending of Mongolian as a language of instruction at schools in the Bayangolin Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture," he said."People are very concerned about Mongolian-language education in Xinjiang and also the continuation of Mongolian culture there," the resident said.A nationwide policyAn official who answered the phone at the Bayingolin Bureau of Education confirmed the move, saying it is part of a nationwide policy to use only Mandarin as the language of instruction in China's schools.Asked if there are plans to end all teaching in ethnic minority languages, or to ban the use of non-Chinese languages altogether in schools, the official declined to comment, however."I'm not too sure about that, and I can't really comment, but we will be using the national language [Mandarin] in education," he said.The No. 3 High School was the last in the region to provide Mongolian-medium instruction, a Han Chinese teacher in the region told RFA on Friday."It used to be called the Bayingolin Mongolian High School, before they changed it," the teacher said. "But it's not as if everything is being killed off with a single blow and you can't use ethnic minority languages any more. That wouldn't be appropriate."But ethnic Mongolian dissident Hada said the move is part of a concerted effort by the ruling Chinese Communist Party to wipe out Mongolian in Chinese schools."They have banned the use of Mongolian script and language across the board," Hada told RFA. "This has caused huge anger among Mongolians around the world, not just in [Chinese-ruled] Inner Mongolia.""I strongly condemn the authorities, and call on them to take immediate measures to restore all of their constitutional rights to [Mongolians]," he said.Culture under attackGermany-based ethnic Mongolian rights activist Xi Haiming said the Chinese government is trying to eradicate Mongolian culture within its borders."Mongolians overseas are definitely not going to sit by and watch this happen," Xi said. "The Chinese government should immediately halt this barbaric policy, and restore Mongolian-medium instruction in schools."Parents said via social media that they would petition the government to change the decision, appealing to regional officials to rethink the move, SMHRIC said, citing social media posts.It said many quoted 19th century French novelist Alphonse Daudet, who wrote in reference to the banning of French during the Prussian occupation of France: "When a people are enslaved, as long as they hold fast to their language it is as if they have the keys to their prison."Reported by Qiao Long for RFA's Mandarin Service.

Suning Plays A Key Role Among E-commerce Industry Leaders In Country's Campaign To Improve Rural EconomyPR NewswireSeptember 22, 2017 Friday 5:53 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 588 wordsDateline: GUIYANG, China, Sept. 22, 2017 BodyChina's leading commercial giant, Suning Holdings Group ("Suning" or "the Group"), owner of Suning Commerce Group, a new member of the Fortune Global 500, joined with 14 other leading e-commerce players in China at the Chinese government's National E-commerce Rural Poverty Reduction Forum ("the Forum") where the Group's Chairman, Zhang Jindong, announced new measures that all companies who attended the Forum would take, including the deployment of advanced technological practices through new e-commerce initiatives and the promotion of the development of agriculture as a way to narrow the urban-rural gap and improve the quality of life of farmers in China.  In addition to increasing the overall level of fulfilling the enterprise social value, Suning will help people in rural areas leverage the power of its leading e-commerce platform, Suning.com, empowering them to open more businesses, creating jobs and increasing economic activity; developing logistical chains in undeveloped regions, allowing more people to access goods and services; as well as providing job and business skills training, among other efforts."Poverty reduction is a tough fight. The key for a leading retail company who plays important role in e-commerce like Suning is to provide data analysis and logistical support for the online sales of the products and services that people in undeveloped areas produce, and to reduce their operational costs as much as possible," Zhang said at the Forum. "Our goal is to promote the all-round development of different regions in China through the power of e-commerce."Suning already has over 2,000 offline stores and 400 online stores opened for rural markets, creating jobs for more than 10,000 young people who have returned from the large cities, driving economic growth and leading to the creation of many small businesses. Zhang added that in the last month Suning's rural e-commerce has covered 42 rural counties with its app and O2O supply chain management, while has already seen 137 percent growth in sales of farm produce to over 3 million US dollars. In the Review and Prospects Report of 2016 China's Domestic Trade Development which is recently released by the Ministry of Commerce of China, Suning's achievement in rural e-commerce practices received high recognition from the government.The Forum was attended by Chinese Vice-Premier Wang Yang, who praised the efforts of Suning and all of the other companies and stressed that e-commerce enterprises are a key engine for economic and social growth, and can precisely target efforts that will help to narrow the regional gap and empower the people in depressed regions.About Suning Holdings GroupFounded in 1990, Suning Holdings Group, through its subsidiaries, is a market leader across six industries: retail, real estate, media and entertainment, investment, sports, and financial services. Two of Suning's subsidiaries are publicly listed, Suning Commerce Group and LAOX Japan. In 2016 Suning ranked the second-largest Chinese non-state owned enterprise. With online and offline retail platforms serving a market of around 280 million loyal consumers, Suning is providing comprehensive services for consumers, as well as reliable and efficient support to overseas companies that are just entering the Chinese market.View original content with multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/suning-plays-a-key-role-among-e-commerce-industry-leaders-in-countrys-campaign-to-improve-rural-economy-300524276.htmlSOURCE Suning holdings groupCONTACT: Lyrin Lin-Brand Manager, Mobile: +86-137-7663-5966, Email: linyue@cnsuning.comLoad-Date: September 23, 2017End of Document

TOP CHINA STUDIES JOURNAL TAKES DOWN 'SENSITIVE' CONTENT AT BEIJING'S REQUESTStates News ServiceAugust 18, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 886 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Cambridge University Press (CUP) said on Friday it had censored more than 300 articles from the China Quarterly academic journal's China website at the request of media regulators in Beijing."We can confirm that we received an instruction from a Chinese import agency to block individual articles from The China Quarterly within China," the publisher said in a statement in response to leaked information from the journal on social media."We complied with this initial request to remove individual articles, to ensure that other academic and educational materials we publish remain available to researchers and educators in this market," the statement said.CUP also confirmed earlier reports that the journal had complied with the request from the State Administration of Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television (SAPPRFT) so as to avoid shutdown of the entire Chinese site."We are aware that other publishers have had entire collections of content blocked in China until they have enabled the import agencies to block access to individual articles," the statement said, adding that it would consider blocking other items in future should the same threat apply.The China Quarterly's editor Tim Pringle expressed the journal's "deep concern and disappointment" over the move."This restriction of academic freedom is not an isolated move but an extension of policies that have narrowed the space for public engagement and discussion across Chinese society," Pringle wrote in a statement posted to the journal's Twitter account on Friday."We will strive to ensure that the articles that the articles published in the journal reach as wide an audience as possible."An official who answered the phone at SAPPRFT declined to comment. "I don't really know about this," the official said. "I don't know which department issued [the request]."According to a memo from Pringle to his editorial board that was leaked online and published by the online news site Quartz, the deleted articles dated back to the 1960s and included 'sensitive'topics like the Cultural Revolution, Tiananmen Square, Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.CUP had claimed that other Chinese studies journals had received similar requests, but Pringle wrote in the leaked document that their editors were unaware of them.U.S.-based author Luo Siling said the move is another example of the long arm of Chinese censorship."It's really unthinkable," Luo said. "They are able to control an overseas publishing house.""I strongly condemn the actions of Cambridge University in this respect."U.S.-based historian Cheng Yinghong said many Chinese academics frequently cite overseas journals, and full-on censorship of overseas academic content will have a negative impact on their research."The West has its own approach, its own standpoint, when it comes to studying China, and I think they should be allowed to read this research," Cheng said."As for whether they adopt these [Western] points of view, the Chinese scholars should have their own perspective," he said. "They should be allowed to form it themselves."New online controlsThe takedown comes as the ruling Chinese Communist Party begins to implement tougher online controls ordered by President Xi Jinping in February, removing any foreign content that hasn't been licensed or preapproved by government censors.Last month, SAPPRFT issued takedown notices last week to two popular multimedia websites targeting young people, AcFun and bilibili, removing a slew of overseas TV shows and video content.China routinely censors "sensitive" keywords like "June 4, 1989" and "6.4" behind the Great Firewall, although many of the country's 731 million internet users deploy puns and other disguises to mention banned topics.Typically, searches for blocked content in China return a message apologizing for the nondelivery of search results "in accordance with relevant laws, regulations, and policies," and the deleted China Quarterly articles wouldn't have shown up in search results carried out by users in China.CUP said it is "troubled" by the recent increase in takedown requests and plans to discuss it with officials at the Beijing Book Fair."We will not change the nature of our publishing to make content acceptable in China, and we remain committed to ensuring that access to a wide variety of publishing is possible for academics, researchers, students and teachers in this market," it said.Previous reports in the British press have indicated that a charity linked to former Chinese premier Wen Jiabao was behind a multimillion endowment to Cambridge University for a professorship in Chinese development studies."The donation from the Chong Hua Foundation in January 2012 raises serious questions over whether Beijing is buying influence at one of Britain's most important universities," a 2014 article in The Telegraph reported.Cambridge University had previously denied that Chong Hua has links to the Chinese government, but new information recently received by The Telegraph indicates that the foundation is controlled by Wen Ruchun, the daughter of China's former prime minister, the paper reported in 2014.Reported by Wong Siu-san and Wong Lok-to for RFA's Cantonese Service.Translated and edited by Luisetta Mudie.Load-Date: August 18, 2017End of Document

Parents allege children were drugged and molested at Chinese kindergartenCNN.comNovember 24, 2017 Friday 10:03 AM ESTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 929 wordsByline: By Steven Jiang, CNNDateline: Beijing, China BodyA scandal of alleged child abuse at a Chinese kindergarten has rocked the country, prompting public outrage, parental soul-searching, government pledges and online censorship.State-run Xinhua news agency reported that police have opened an investigation into RYB Xintiandi, a private kindergarten in Beijing, after numerous parents accused the school of drugging and molesting their children. Beijing's education authority confirmed the police investigation in a statement.According to one parent - in a video posted on Weibo -- China's equivalent of Twitter -- at least eight parents told police that their young children had been drugged and molested, while attending the school.The video has been viewed millions of times.The unidentified mother told reporters Thursday her 3-year-old daughter said she was injected with a brown liquid by a teacher, made to strip along with other kids before being "examined" by a naked adult male stranger.She said she and other parents allegedly found multiple needle marks on their children's bodies, adding that the kindergarten and the police had not allowed them to review videos from the school's surveillance cameras."My child said the teacher told them it was a secret and they were not supposed to tell anyone else including parents," the mother said. "She now bursts into screaming at night, saying: I'm not sick, why do I have to get a shot?"The Xinhua state news agency reports that Beijing police have performed forensic tests and obtained surveillance camera footage from the kindergarten.Kindergarten apologizes, promises 'zero-tolerance' policyThe kindergarten is run by RYB Education, a Chinese company listed on the New York Stock Exchange.It operates in about 300 Chinese cities and has about 1,300 day care centers.It announced the suspension of several teachers, and apologized to the parents and public for "causing serious worries" in a statement released Friday."We have provided the relevant surveillance videos and equipment to the police," it said. "Before a clear conclusion can be drawn, our priority is to help the students and their parents emotionally, and try to minimize the impact of the incident on the children."CNN's repeated attempts to seek direct responses from the kindergarten and local educational officials on site were thwarted by security guards, who said no one would make additional comments beyond previously issued statements.As more horrific details emerged, the government scrambled to respond to the incident. Both the national education ministry and the municipal education authority in Beijing have pledged cooperation with the police and swift investigations on their own, with local officials sending a team to the kindergarten.The company said it plans to keep the kindergarten open, promising to uphold a "zero-tolerance" policy toward child abuse and shoulder responsibilities pending the result of the police investigation.The statement also said the head of the kindergarten involved had filed a police report that alleged "false accusations and being framed by certain individuals" - without specifying who.It was relatively quiet around the RYB Xintiandi campus Friday, with some parents and onlookers gathering outside the gate where a copy of the corporate statement was posted.One grandfather, who had just picked up his granddaughter but declined to be named, told CNN that the 4-year-old mentioned her classmates being forced to take white pills for disobedience and everyone was told to keep it a secret.Another resident of the neighborhood who identified himself as Mr. Liu said the kindergarten is the best in the area and costs as much as 5,000 yuan ($750) a month for bilingual class students. He said he was furious upon hearing the news, but still believes those were isolated cases based on what he had learned about the school from a relative whose child went there.Public outcry growsMany internet users, however, have angrily rejected RYB's response as "inadequate" and calling for severe punishment for those found responsible.Past incidents involving RYB kindergartens included two cases in northeastern China where four RYB teachers were each sentenced to more than two years in prison for abusing more than 20 children.Amid growing public outcry over the scandal, Chinese government censors seem to have moved to contain the fallout. Many users have complained about the disappearance of their posts on the subject on social media. Comment sections are turned off for many online news reports on this story.Across Chinese cyberspace, however, parents of young children have started sharing tips on detection and prevention of such cases -- some directly copied from school literature in the United States.Earlier this month, videos of teachers at a Shanghai kindergarten physically attacking kids and force-feeding them what appeared to be mustard went viral.Shanghai police quickly detained several employees at the facility, while the municipal government's women's affairs agency, with which the kindergarten is affiliated, had to apologize to the parents and public.Critics have long said current Chinese laws are too vague and lax on child abuse and sexual molestation cases.Media in China have documented a rising number of incidents of abuse at childcare facilities, often in small cities and towns. In a lengthy investigative piece published last year, the Xinhua news agency said only 968 cases of sexual abuse against children were recorded nationwide between 2013 and 2015, involving at least 1,790 children, with many remaining unreported.Load-Date: November 25, 2017End of Document

Springer Nature blocks access to articles in ChinaAssociated Press InternationalNovember 1, 2017 Wednesday 11:09 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 532 wordsByline: By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Academic publisher Springer Nature said Wednesday it has blocked access to articles within China to comply with demands from the Chinese government, amid a push by Beijing to tighten controls on information from outside the country.The company said in a statement that less than 1 percent of its content available online in global markets has been blocked in China in compliance with "local distribution laws.""This action is deeply regrettable but has been taken to prevent a much greater impact on our customers and authors and is in compliance with our published policy," the statement said. "This is not editorial censorship and does not affect the content we publish or make accessible elsewhere in the world."Springer Nature, which has offices around the world, says it has published more than 275,000 books and 3,000 journals, including "Nature" and "Scientific American."The move is the latest example of how effective China can be at leveraging its economic might to compel foreign companies to make concessions in order to maintain access to its massive market. Chinese President Xi Jinping's government has tightened controls over information and over a wide range of groups that could feed opposition to the ruling Communist Party, including lawyers who take on sensitive cases, non-governmental organizations and churches.The blocked articles related to topics such as Taiwan, the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution and the status of Tibet, which are considered sensitive by the Communist Party, according to a survey by The Associated Press. They can only be viewed with a virtual private network that allows users to skirt China's strict internet censorship regime, known as the Great Firewall.The newspaper Financial Times reported that at least 1,000 articles were blocked.In August, academic publisher Cambridge University Press restored more than 300 politically sensitive articles that had been removed from the publisher's website in China at the behest of authorities.Its action followed a petition circulated among academics calling on the university press to turn down censorship requests from the Chinese government. The temporarily blocked articles also touched on the Tiananmen crackdown, Tibet and similar topics.As of Wednesday, CUP's website, The China Quarterly, was fully accessible in China.Academics say that Chinese universities, which have long endured some degree of political interference, have also come under increased supervision, including regular monitoring in classrooms and ideological audits.Springer Nature said failure to block some of the articles as required by its distributors, who it said are the "officially appointed guardians of all content," could have led to its entire SpringerLink website being blocked."Access to 99 percent of Springer Nature content is therefore safeguarded for all our customers in China and we will continue to work with the regulator and other Chinese authorities to minimize the content affected, reduce and ideally eliminate these restrictions on behalf of the global research community and wider society," the company said.Load-Date: November 2, 2017End of Document

CHINA'S CHILLING 'SOCIAL CREDIT' BLACKLISTStates News ServiceDecember 12, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 720 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Maya WangChina Researcher wang_mayaApple CEO Tim Cook looks forward to a "common future in cyberspace" with China, he told the Chinese government's World Internet Conference earlier this month. This was an embarrassing gesture toward a state that aggressively censors the internet and envisions a dystopian future online.The experience of lawyer Li Xiaolin may give a taste of what that future looks like. During a 2016 work trip inside China, he tried to use his national identity card to purchase a plane ticket. To his surprise, the online system rejected it, saying he had been blacklisted by China's top court. Mr. Li checked the court's website: His name was on a list of "untrustworthy" people for having failed to carry out a court order in 2015. He thought he had resolved the issue, but now he was stranded more than 1,200 miles from home.Mr. Li's dilemma was due to the Chinese government's ambitious "social credit system." Launched by the government in 2012, it vows to "make trustworthy people benefit everywhere and untrustworthy people restricted everywhere" by the time it is fully implemented in 2020.This is no anodyne credit score. By rating citizens on a range of behaviors from shopping habits to online speech, the government intends to manufacture a problem-free society. Those with low scores will face obstacles in everything from getting government jobs to placing their children in desired schools. It remains unclear exactly who will run the system, whether or how one could dispute scores, or even whether the system is legal.As part of this scheme, the Supreme People's Court has published lists of people who have failed to carry out local court orders since 2013. These untrustworthy "chronic cheats" are named, shamed and barred from flights and fast trains. Some local governments even put their pictures, full names and addresses on billboards. By 2017 it imposed such punishments more than seven million times.How did Mr. Li get on the list? In 2013 he defended a man accused of rape. The lawyer gave a copy of his defense statement to the man's family. Unknown to him, they posted it online. The alleged victim sued Mr. Li for defamation and won, and in 2015 a Beijing court ordered him to apologize. Mr. Li sent the court a written apology. He had forgotten the incident until he found himself blacklisted. He learned that the court inexplicably dismissed his apology as "insincere," in part because he had dated it April 1.In 2013 investigative journalist Liu Hu published an article alleging someone was an extortionist. Two years later the man successfully sued Mr. Liu for defamation. The court said it would issue an apology in a newspaper on his behalf and at his expense. He wired money to the court, but months later Mr. Liu abruptly found that he couldn't buy plane tickets. Only then did a court official say the payment had not been received. Mr. Liu immediately corrected the mistake.There is nothing wrong about authorities enforcing legitimate court orders, but in the case of Messrs. Li and Liu, penalties were exacted in wildly arbitrary and unaccountable manners. And the courts failed to notify them, leaving them no chance to contest their treatment. While both found a loopholeusing their passports to buy tickets in persontheir lives were initially upended, and they have faced enormous difficulties challenging the designation.When Mr. Li, the lawyer, was first blacklisted in 2016, it took three weeks before an official talked to him. The court requested a second apology, which he wrote, leading to his removal from the travel blacklist. But he remains on another list, about which he had not been previously informed, this one prohibiting him from applying for credit cards. The court has told Mr. Li to write another apology.The journalist, Mr. Liu, remains blacklisted. The court now requires a payment several times the going rate for a newspaper apology in comparable cases. He sued the court for having abused its power but has had no response.Chinese government authorities clearly hope to create a reality in which bureaucratic pettiness could significantly limit people's rights. As President Xi Jinping's power grows, and as the system approaches full implementation, more abuses will come.Load-Date: December 12, 2017End of Document

Parents allege children were drugged and molested at Chinese kindergartenCNN WireNovember 24, 2017 Friday 2:59 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 952 wordsByline: By Steven Jiang, CNNDateline: (CNN) Body (CNN) --  A scandal of alleged child abuse at a Chinese kindergarten has rocked the country, prompting public outrage, parental soul-searching, government pledges and online censorship.State-run Xinhua news agency reported that police have opened an investigation into RYB Xintiandi, a private kindergarten in Beijing, after numerous parents accused the school of drugging and molesting their children. Beijing's education authority confirmed the police investigation in a statement. According to one parent - in a video posted on Weibo -- China's equivalent of Twitter -- at least eight parents told police that their young children had been drugged and molested, while attending the school.The video has been viewed millions of times.The unidentified mother told reporters Thursday her 3-year-old daughter said she was injected with a brown liquid by a teacher, made to strip along with other kids before being "examined" by a naked adult male stranger.She said she and other parents allegedly found multiple needle marks on their children's bodies, adding that the kindergarten and the police had not allowed them to review videos from the school's surveillance cameras."My child said the teacher told them it was a secret and they were not supposed to tell anyone else including parents," the mother said. "She now bursts into screaming at night, saying: I'm not sick, why do I have to get a shot?"The Xinhua state news agency reports that Beijing police have performed forensic tests and obtained surveillance camera footage from the kindergarten.Kindergarten apologizes, promises 'zero-tolerance' policyThe kindergarten is run by RYB Education, a Chinese company listed on the New York Stock Exchange.It operates in about 300 Chinese cities and has about 1,300 day care centers.It announced the suspension of several teachers, and apologized to the parents and public for "causing serious worries" in a statement released Friday."We have provided the relevant surveillance videos and equipment to the police," it said. "Before a clear conclusion can be drawn, our priority is to help the students and their parents emotionally, and try to minimize the impact of the incident on the children."CNN's repeated attempts to seek direct responses from the kindergarten and local educational officials on site were thwarted by security guards, who said no one would make additional comments beyond previously issued statements.As more horrific details emerged, the government scrambled to respond to the incident. Both the national education ministry and the municipal education authority in Beijing have pledged cooperation with the police and swift investigations on their own, with local officials sending a team to the kindergarten.The company said it plans to keep the kindergarten open, promising to uphold a "zero-tolerance" policy toward child abuse and shoulder responsibilities pending the result of the police investigation.The statement also said the head of the kindergarten involved had filed a police report that alleged "false accusations and being framed by certain individuals" - without specifying who.It was relatively quiet around the RYB Xintiandi campus Friday, with some parents and onlookers gathering outside the gate where a copy of the corporate statement was posted.One grandfather, who had just picked up his granddaughter but declined to be named, told CNN that the 4-year-old mentioned her classmates being forced to take white pills for disobedience and everyone was told to keep it a secret.Another resident of the neighborhood who identified himself as Mr. Liu said the kindergarten is the best in the area and costs as much as 5,000 yuan ($750) a month for bilingual class students. He said he was furious upon hearing the news, but still believes those were isolated cases based on what he had learned about the school from a relative whose child went there.Public outcry growsMany internet users, however, have angrily rejected RYB's response as "inadequate" and calling for severe punishment for those found responsible.Past incidents involving RYB kindergartens included two cases in northeastern China where four RYB teachers were each sentenced to more than two years in prison for abusing more than 20 children.Amid growing public outcry over the scandal, Chinese government censors seem to have moved to contain the fallout. Many users have complained about the disappearance of their posts on the subject on social media. Comment sections are turned off for many online news reports on this story.Across Chinese cyberspace, however, parents of young children have started sharing tips on detection and prevention of such cases -- some directly copied from school literature in the United States.Earlier this month, videos of teachers at a Shanghai kindergarten physically attacking kids and force-feeding them what appeared to be mustard went viral.Shanghai police quickly detained several employees at the facility, while the municipal government's women's affairs agency, with which the kindergarten is affiliated, had to apologize to the parents and public.Critics have long said current Chinese laws are too vague and lax on child abuse and sexual molestation cases.Media in China have documented a rising number of incidents of abuse at childcare facilities, often in small cities and towns. In a lengthy investigative piece published last year, the Xinhua news agency said only 968 cases of sexual abuse against children were recorded nationwide between 2013 and 2015, involving at least 1,790 children, with many remaining unreported.CNN's Serenitie Wang contributed to this report.TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

THE GLOBAL ECONOMY'S NEW RULE-MAKERStates News ServiceAugust 30, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 1013 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: STANFORD, Calif. BodyThe following information was released by the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace:In a recent commentary for the South China Morning Post, Helen Wong, HSBC's chief executive for Greater China, shows that China's rising generation of 400 million young consumers will soon account for more than half of the country's domestic consumption. This generation, Wong notes, is largely transacting online, through innovative, integrated mobile platforms, indicating that it has already "leapt from the preweb era straight to the mobile Internet, skipping the personal computer altogether."Of course, China's rising middle class is not news. But the extent to which digitally oriented younger consumers are driving rapid growth in China's service industries has not yet received ample attention. Services, after all, will help drive China's structural transition from a middle- to a high-income economy.Not too long ago, many pundits doubted that China could make the shift from an economy dominated by labor-intensive manufacturing, exports, infrastructure investment, and heavy industry to a service economy underpinned by domestic demand. But even if China's economic transition is far from complete, its progress has been impressive.In recent years, China has been offloading its labor-intensive export sectors to less-developed countries with lower labor costs. And in other sectors, it has shifted to more digital, capital-intensive forms of production, rendering labor-cost disadvantages insignificant. These trends imply that supply-side growth has become less dependent on external markets.As a result of these changes, China's economic power is rapidly rising. Its domestic market is growing fast, and could soon be the largest in the world. And because the Chinese government can control access to that market, it can increasingly exert its influence in Asia and beyond. At the same time, China's declining dependence on export-led growth is reducing its vulnerability to the whims of those who control access to global markets.But China does not actually need to limit access to its own markets to sustain its growth, because it can increase its bargaining power by merely threatening to do so. This suggests that China's position in the global economy is starting to resemble that of the United States during the post-war period, when it, along with Europe, was the dominant economic power. For decades after World War II, Europe and the US represented well over half (and near 70% at one point) of global output, and they were not heavily dependent on markets elsewhere, other than for natural resources such as oil and minerals.Now, China is rapidly approaching a similar configuration. It has a very large domestic market to which it can control access rising incomes, and high aggregate demand; and its growth model is increasingly based on domestic consumption and investment, and less on exports.But how will China wield its increasing economic power? In the post-war period, the advanced economies used their position to set the rules for global economic activity. They did so in such a way as to benefit themselves, of course; but they also tried to be as inclusive as possible for developing countries.The post-war powers certainly did not have to take that approach. It was within their power to focus far more narrowly on their own interests. But that might not have been wise. It is worth remembering that in the twentieth century, following two world wars, peace was the top priority, along with or even before prosperity.China shows every sign of moving in the same direction. It most likely will not pursue a narrowly self-interested approach, mainly because to do so would diminish its global stature and clout. China has shown that it wants to be influential in the developing world and certainly in Asia by playing the role of a supportive partner, at least in the economic realm.Whether China can achieve that goal will depend on what it does in two key policy areas. The first is investment, where China has moved aggressively by introducing a variety of multilateral and bilateral initiatives. For example, in addition to investing heavily in African countries, it created the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in 2015, and, in 2013, announced the "Belt and Road Initiative," meant to integrate Eurasia through massive investments in highways, ports, and rail transport.Second, how China manages access to its vast internal market, in terms of trade and investment, will have far-reaching consequences for all of China's external economic partners, not just developing countries. China's domestic market is now the source of its power, which means that the choices it makes in this area in the near term will largely determine its global standing for decades to come.To be sure, China's current position on domestic-market access is less clear than its economic ambitions abroad. But China will most likely move toward an open, largely rules-based multilateral framework. The lesson from the post-war period is that this approach will do the most good externally, and will thus enhance China's international influence. At this stage of China's development, such an approach will have few if any costs, while most likely conferring many benefits.What remains to be seen is how China's relationship with the US fares. The US is suffering from non-inclusive growth patterns and related political and social upheavals. And it now seems to be departing from its historical post-war approach to international economic policy. But even if the US is isolating itself under President Donald Trump, it is still too big simply to ignore. If the Trump administration enacts aggressive policies directed at China, the Chinese will have no choice but to respond.Still, in the meantime, China can continue to pursue a rules-based multilateral approach, and it can expect broad support from other advanced and developing countries. The key is not to be distracted by America's descent into nationalism. After all, it is anyone's guess how long that will last.Load-Date: August 30, 2017End of Document

China Continues to Hold, Presumably Torture Nobel Nominee Gao ZhishengTargeted News ServiceSeptember 6, 2017 Wednesday 8:48 PM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 571 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyInternational Christian Concern issued the following news release:Nearly a month has passed since Chinese Christian human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng was presumably taken by state security from his home near Shaanxi's Yulin city in the morning of August 13, where he was under house arrest. The whereabouts of Gao, reputed as "Conscience of China", is still unknown. As is typical in these cases, he could face torture in a black jail hidden away in rural province.Gao became the target of Chinese authorities for defending the most vulnerable in China, including Christians, coal miners, Falun Gong practitioners. He has been kidnapped numerous times, endured repeated torture such as beating, deprivation of sleep and electric shocks, and spent many years in jail and solitary confinement. The Chinese government 'released' him in 2014 and placed him under house arrest.The causes for his disappearance could be many, including President Xi Jinping's retaliation for Gao's recently published memoir, in which he heavily criticized the Communist Party and predicted a 2017 collapse of the regime; the upcoming 19th Party Congress, a major power show where Beijing wants no accidents and demands silence from dissidents; or interviews he recently gave to the media in Hong Kong and the U.S. detailing torture and inhumane treatment.His older brother, Gao Zhiyi, was brought in by police on August 26 and briefly detained before being release. Gao's supporters believe the detention prevented his brother from being inquired as to Gao's whereabouts. In addition, a Twitter account organized by Gao's supporters called "Gao Zhisheng Caring Group" also posted recently that "so far the family and friends of Gao in China, two have been warned, and seven were summoned (among them two have disappeared) by the authorities. These nine cases are the known ones."His disappearance is concerning when details of past torture and abductions, recorded in his books, are taken into account. Years in captivity have decayed his health as he suffers tooth loss and other health problems."Now that I know he has disappeared, I am in a state of emotional collapse," Zhisheng's wife, Geng He, who currently resides in the U.S. with their children, told Radio Free Asia.Former Virginia Congressman Frank Wolf, when asked to comment on Mr. Gao's disappearance, stated, "Mr. Gao was my adoptee for the Defending Freedoms Project five years ago, where I highlighted his case and pushed for his release. It's truly unfortunate that after years he still doesn't get to taste freedom. The sudden disappearance of Mr. Gao last month is worrisome in light of Liu Xiaobo's death and knowing the secret arrests and horrendous torture Chinese government has put dissidents through. I urge the Chinese government to immediately release and sustain freedom of Gao Zhisheng."Gina Goh, ICC's Regional Manager, said, "It is a shame that a country so eager to prove its legitimacy to stand among the world leaders, continues to violate basic human rights and secretly imprison and torture their human rights defender. China will never be looked up to unless it learns to respect its own citizens. Let us not forget the plight of Mr. Gao and many imprisoned Christians who suffer inhumane treatment. We ought to continue to press for their release and keep them and their suffering families in our prayers."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-5980654 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: September 6, 2017End of Document

China's foreign investment plunges after official curbsAssociated Press Financial WireSeptember 14, 2017 Thursday 10:19 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 687 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - China's investment in other countries has plunged since Beijing tightened controls to cool surging spending on British soccer teams, Manhattan real estate and other assets deemed unneeded for Chinese economic development.Outward investment in the first eight months of this year fell 41.8 percent from a year earlier to $68.7 billion, the Commerce Ministry said Thursday.Chinese companies, flush with cash from an economic boom, ramped up purchases of foreign technology and brands in recent years to speed their development. But after a flood of money into sports and entertainment, authorities tightened controls on the flow of capital out of the country last year and said they want investment to focus on technology and other assets needed by China's economy.China's investment abroad is relatively small compared with that of developed countries, but the surge in spending and Chinese buyers' willingness to pay top prices for premium assets has made them sought after by sellers abroad.Chinese money plays an outsize role in smaller economies such as in Eastern Europe. Chinese investors also have bought high-profile assets such as New York City's Waldorf Astoria Hotel and the Hollywood studio Legendary Entertainment.Investment this year went mainly into manufacturing, wholesale and retail, and information technology, according to the Commerce Ministry. It said there were no new investment projects abroad in sports, entertainment or real estate."Irrational outbound investment was further contained," a ministry spokesman, Gao Feng, said in a statement on its website.Chinese buyers also might face more hurdles abroad after the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said Wednesday he will propose a European system to screen incoming foreign investment.Juncker didn't mention China but the announcement follows mounting complaints that Chinese buyers are free to make almost any acquisition in Europe while Beijing bars sales of most assets to foreigners.European sensitivity has been especially high since last year's purchase of Germany's Kuka, a leading industrial robot maker, by China's Midea Group.Chinese buyers see Europe as more welcoming to investment than the United States, where some deals are required to undergo a security screening.On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump blocked a Chinese government-financed company's purchase of a semiconductor manufacturer, Lattice Semiconductor, on national security grounds.Chinese investors own all or part of five British soccer teams. One of the country's biggest conglomerates, Wanda Group, paid $3.5 billion in 2012 for Hollywood studio Legendary Entertainment and owns the AMC Cinema Chain.The central bank governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, said in March the government wanted to curb spending on assets that are "unsuited to the industrial policy needs of the country." He said foreign sports and entertainment assets "have not much benefit to China."A Cabinet document issued in August said Beijing wants to promote "rational, orderly and healthy development of foreign investment while effectively guarding against risks."The August document encouraged companies instead to plow money into "Belt and Road" projects, President Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy initiative to expand trade links through Asia to Europe by investing in ports, highways, railways, power plants and other infrastructure.Investment in the 52 countries covered by "Belt and Road" was $8.5 billion in the first eight months of this year and spending commitments rose 21 percent to $84.5 billion, according to Gao.Xi has been moving to reassert control over top state enterprises while reining in private sector conglomerates including Wanda, Anbang Insurance, Fosun International and HNA Group that have expanded abroad.News reports in July said regulators told bankers Wanda's recent foreign acquisitions violated capital controls.Wanda's proposed acquisition of Dick Clark Productions, which produces the Golden Globes and the "Miss America" pageant, was called off in March after the seller said Wanda failed to complete the purchase.Load-Date: September 15, 2017End of Document

Apple's decision to remove availability of VPN apps was criticized as supportive of the Chinese government's censorship drive.Amazon.com warned Chinese customers of its cloud computing services to stop using tools that circumvent China's new policy."We're hopeful that over time the restrictions we're seeing are lessened, because innovation really requires freedom to collaborate and communicate. We believe in engaging with governments even when we disagree," Cook said in a telephone earnings call on Tuesday.The Apple chief also challenged comparisons between his company's compliance with Beijing and its refusal last year to help authorities unlock a cellphone used by the main culprit in the 2015 terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif."In the case of the U.S., the law in the U.S. supported us. It was very clear. In the case of China, the law is very clear there," Cook said. "We have to abide by them in both cases. That doesn't mean that we don't state our point of view in the appropriate way."China is Apple's largest market outside the United States.Load-Date: August 3, 2017End of Document

TECH COMPANIES AUTOMATE AUTOCRATIC MEDIA IN CHINA AROUND THE WORLDStates News ServiceSeptember 16, 2017 SaturdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 959 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: SEATTLE, Wash. BodyThe following information was released by the University of Washington:Nick Monaco is a research associate at Alphabet's human rights focused think-tank and technology incubator Jigsaw. He is also a research associate on the Computational Propaganda Project at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford.More posts by this contributor:Hey politicians don't hate the internet, hate the gameSamuel Woolley ContributorSamuel Woolley is the Director of Research of the Computational Propaganda Project at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford. He is a fellow a Jigsaw, the Institute for the Future, and the University of Washington's TechPolicy Lab.More posts by this contributor:Hey politicians don't hate the internet, hate the gameA troubling trend is sweeping Silicon Valleybig tech acquiescing to digital authoritarianism to gain access to the Chinese market.In July, Apple removed VPNs from its Chinese app store and announced plans to build a data center in Guizhou to comply with China's new draconian cybersecurity laws.This follows Facebook's decision months earlier to build a tool that allowed third-parties in China to suppress controversial content on its network. While these moves can be rationalized from most business perspectives, acquiescing to China's digitally authoritarian policies for market access will have harrowing political consequences in the long term.Apple and Facebook, two of the most powerful companies in the world, have set dangerous precedents in these decisions that risk being followed both in and outside of the tech industry. When big tech bends its principles to limbo into Chinese markets, it encourages other Western companies and institutions to do so as well.The latest example is Cambridge University Press. The prominent publishing house recently removed hundreds of academic articles from the website of its publications China Quarterly and the Journal of Asian Studies, in response to Chinese authorities deeming them controversial. After outcry from academics and researchers, Cambridge University Press reversed its decision but the fact remains that they were willing to censor peer-reviewed academic research.At best, such decisions risk entrenching the status quo China has already ranked as the lowest in the world in Internet freedom for two years running. At worst, these moves encourage the omnipotent aspirations of the Chinese government to build a digital dictatorship.Chinese AI research and production is set tosupersede the US in the next few decades, especially given President Trump and the GOP's refusal to recognize the importance of scientific RandD and blue-sky research. Given this outlook, Western tech companies must consider the social ramifications of their involvement in China.It's undeniable that the Party may be on the brink of unprecedented automated repression extremely few companies control the most popular apps in China, and as experts like Richard McGregor have shown the Chinese Communist Party always has its hands in the country's most successful businesses. The possibilities that would exist such as automated mining of publicly and privately available data coupled with mass sentiment analysis to predict and quell dissent in advance have horrifying implications for human rights. Repressive governance could, to a large extent, become an automated affair.China has already implemented a frightening citizenship score pilot program, which gives each citizen a "social credit score". It is also known that markedly more scrupulous governments, from Mexico to Ecuador and Venezuela, have deployed surveillance and intelligence systems against political opposition. The possibility of AI autocracy in the People's Republic is real, and it is one that Western tech companies are tacitly endorsing when they choose to forfeit digital rights in favor of market access.It would also be na¯ve to assume this form AI autocracy will stay put in the Middle Kingdom. Authoritarians have a way of sharing repressive technology which is why ones of Egypt's biggest telecoms companies, Orascom, owns 75% of North Korea's only official mobile network, Koryolink. It is also why China's cellphone company Huawei helped Iranian security forces to stifle dissent at home.Two-thirds of all internet users worldwide live in countries where criticism of the authorities is subject to censorship. It would be reasonable, with this in mind, to assume that China's AI authoritarian modelif successfulcould become the soft-power the country has lacked on the world stage up to now.The Economist rightfully pointed out in July:"Western companies are at least engaged in an open debate about the ethical implications of AI; and intelligence agencies are constrained by democratic institutions. Neither is true of China. [..] If China ends up having most influence over its future, then the state, not citizens, may be the biggest beneficiary".In an era where the leader of the free world is emboldening authoritarians on everything from reneging on human rights to slanderously impugning the press, the onus falls on civil society and the private sector to maintain and promote liberal democratic values at home and abroad. Western tech companies are one of the most powerful actors in the latter sphere, and also fund many in the former. This puts them in a unique position to promote privacy, security and digital rights around the world.The social and political consequences of technology are externalities that must be accounted for. It is impossible to decouple business decisions in the tech community from responsibility for the consequences that result from them, especially as technology continues to play an ever more crucial role in individuals' daily lives.Load-Date: September 17, 2017End of Document

Trump stops China-backed takeover of U.S. chip makerCNNMoney.comSeptember 13, 2017 Wednesday 12:47 AM ESTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHNOLOGYLength: 433 wordsByline: Seth FiegermanBodyPresident Trump has stopped the takeover of an American chip maker by a private equity firm with ties to China.The deal, which would have seen China-backed Canyon Bridge Capital Partners acquire Lattice Semiconductors, was blocked over national security concerns."Today, consistent with the administration's commitment to take all actions necessary to ensure the protection of U.S. national security, the president issued an order prohibiting the acquisition," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement Wednesday.The national security risk included "the potential transfer of intellectual property" to the Chinese-backed company and the "Chinese government's role in supporting this transaction," according to Mnuchin's statement.Those are sensitive matters: the Trump administration launched an investigation last month into whether China is unfairly getting hold of American technology and intellectual property.The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which reviews deals that could result in a foreign entity taking control of an American company, had previously recommended halting the deal.The business deal put Trump in the middle of a hot-button issue: Chinese investment in the United States.Both Lattice and Canyon Bridge had said the acquisition could have boosted American jobs, a core issue for the Trump administration.Lattice had said that Canyon Bridge currently employs 300 people in Oregon -- and Canyon Bridge has committed to adding 350 more if the takeover deal went through.In a statement Wednesday, Canyon Bridge said it is "obviously disappointed" by Trump's decision and called the proposed acquisition "an excellent deal" for Lattice and for "expanding the opportunity to keep jobs in America."Reps for Lattice did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Lattice stock fell nearly 2% in after hours trading following the news.The Chinese government believes that "security inspections in sensitive industries are a legitimate right of any country," said Gao Feng, a Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman. But he added that "they should not become a tool to promote protectionism."Canyon Bridge says it's headquartered in California, but its website also lists a Beijing address and states, "Initial funding for Canyon Bridge comes from limited partners in China."The takeover was pegged as a $1.3 billion deal when it was first announced in November 2016.Chinese investment into U.S. firms so far in 2017 includes 83 deals worth about $25 billion, according to research firm Rhodium Group.-- Serena Dong and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.Load-Date: September 15, 2017End of Document

Microsoft, Heungkong Group and China Nansha Free Trade Zone launch the Microsoft Cloud Incubation ProgramPR NewswireNovember 23, 2017 Thursday 3:06 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1011 wordsDateline: GUANGZHOU, China, Nov. 22, 2017 BodyThe "New Era of AI Leads the Future of the Cloud" themed Artificial Intelligence Summit was held in Nansha District, Guangzhou, China on November 17, 2017, as part of the local government's efforts to further promote the development of a new sector encompassing the next generation of information technology, Artificial Intelligence and Biological medicine (AIB). The event attracted over a dozen internationally renowned technology and financial firms, including Heungkong Group, Microsoft (China), iFLYTEK, Tricorn (Beijing) Technology, Malong Technologies and Megvii.Hosted by Heungkong Group, in partnership with Microsoft (China), with the help of the administration committee of Nansha Development Zone, the summit brought together a number of Chinese government officials and senior business executives. The attendees included CPC Central Committee United Front Work Department former minister and All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Party Committee former secretary, Hu Deping; Guangdong Province Party Committee United Front Department deputy director, Li Yangchun; Guangzhou Municipal Committee Standing Committee member; Nansha Development Zone (China Nansha Free Trade Zone) Party Committee secretary; Nansha Development Zone administration committee director and Nansha District Committee secretary, Cai Chaolin; Nansha District Committee deputy secretary and Nansha District chief executive, Zeng Jinze; Guangdong Federation of Industry and Commerce vice chairman, Lu Xiaozhou; Industry and Information Technology Commission of Guangzhou Municipality chief engineer, Hu Zhigang; Nansha Development Zone administration committee deputy director, Xie Ming; Heungkong Group chairman, Chi Keung Lau and president, Mei Hing Chak; Microsoft (China) COO, Horace Chow and vice president of Microsoft for Greater China, Teng Wen. In addition, former Japanese Prime Minister, Yukio Hatoyama, was invited to the event as a keynote speaker. On May 3, 2017, Nansha partnered with Microsoft (China) and Heungkong Group to roll out the Microsoft Cloud & Mobile Technology Incubation Program - Guangzhou Cloud & Mobile Application Incubation Platform (Microsoft Cloud Incubation Program). The incubation platform was formally launched at the summit, where 11 AI teams that had passed the reviews during the roadshow were formally invited to participate in the incubation program. To date, the platform has recruited 18 prominent AI teams, all of which have been given rent-free office space at the Heungkong International Financial Center in Nansha for four to six months during which they will be "incubated'."The incubation platform, which serves as the technological key in helping Nansha realize its vision in terms of AI, provides the district with an unprecedented opportunity to establish and grow its own AI industry," said Cai Chaolin. "Nansha plans to speed up the construction of a 100 billion yuan (approx. US$15 billion) AI industry cluster by taking full advantage of its role both as a free trade zone and as a government-designated self-innovation demonstration zone, with the aim of creating a new, future-oriented AI-plus smart city."As Microsoft's 18th incubation platform and the first that targets cutting-edge technology in artificial intelligence, the Microsoft Cloud Incubation Program is highly valued by Microsoft.At the summit, Horace Chow expressed gratitude to the government and Heungkong Group and said they are looking forward to promoting the incubation platform in Nansha. Keeping in line with what the district has dubbed its "1+1+10" series of policies, a program to transform the area into one of Guangzhou's key commercial and industrial hubs, Microsoft has promised to proactively facilitate innovation across the board with a focus on cloud computing, the internet of things, big data and artificial intelligence, helping boost the development of innovative companies.As one of China's top 500 privately held firms, Heungkong Group, as part of its plan of transforming itself into a company of the future, has shifted a key part of its focus to the technology sector.In her speech, Mei Hing Chak said that Heungkong Group started to establish a presence in Guangdong Free Trade Zone four years ago, in line with China's reform and opening up strategy. With a prime focus on innovative financial service platforms, and a strategy which incorporates big data, AI technologies and the Chinese government's Internet Plus initiative which advocates adoption of the Internet and modern technologies by the country's traditional industry sectors, the group has been assisting companies in their industrial transformation, helping them find new growth paths.By application of a clever approach whereby Heungkong Group will leverage herd behavior to good effect by having all of the AI startups in one place, the firm has joined hands with Guangzhou Nansha Industrial Investment Fund Management to further the development of the sector through the joint launch of a 100 million yuan (approx. US$15 million) Artificial Intelligence venture capital fund. The firm expects to enhance the success of the effort by putting its 27 years of experience in a diverse range of industries and more than 20 years of experience in finance to use. The fund will mainly provide strong financial support for entrepreneurial teams and start-ups in artificial intelligence, big data, the Internet of Things, cloud computing and intelligent manufacturing.An executive at Heungkong Group, responsible for the fund, said that the group is also willing to participate in the 10 billion yuan (approx. US$1.5 billion) Artificial Intelligence industry fund, initiated by the governments of Guangzhou and Nansha District and leverage its capital and operational strengths to promote the development of Artificial Intelligence in Nansha.View original content with multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/microsoft-heungkong-group-and-china-nansha-free-trade-zone-launch-the-microsoft-cloud-incubation-program-300561378.htmlSOURCE Heungkong GroupCONTACT: Fang Yanhua, +86-137-6075-8692, fangyanhua@heungkong.comLoad-Date: November 24, 2017End of Document

CHINA ISSUES VAGUE AND OVERBROAD RULES ON INTERNET CENSORSHIP IN TIBETStates News ServiceNovember 17, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 917 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: DHARAMSALA, India BodyThe following information was released by the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD):The Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD) has obtained a copy of a Chinese government document that announces the implementation of vague and broadly defined rules on internet censorship in Tibet.Issued for public notice by the Machu (Ch: Maqu) County Public Security Bureau (PSB) located in Kanlho (Ch: Gannan) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu Province, the document in Tibetan contains a list of instructions to online chat group administrators and owners of public online accounts on how to conduct self-censorship.The notice, that took effect on 8 October, contains rules that are local version of two new regulations released on 7 September by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC). Both the "Management Regulations on Online Public Accounts" and "Management Regulations on Internet Groups" provide that the regulations were passed to "promote the healthy and orderly development of online community" and "uphold the socialist core values."To be implemented by the Machu County Internet Police, the notice orders all online chat group administrators and owners of public online accounts to be responsible for "strictly regulating" their group members and the information they post. They are also made responsible for strictly preventing the spread of 'illegal' contents on the internet. The notice covers all online groups such as those that provide information including text, picture, audio and video to the public through any registered online platform as well as online chat groups, social media, and instant messaging apps.All online group administrators and owners of public online accounts are required to follow nine instructions listed in the notice. Apart from the usual instructions on banning the spread of information containing 'rumours', 'pornography' and 'violence', there are some that make specific references to 'state secrets', 'internal confidential documents', and 'Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan'. Another bars users from sharing 'fake videos' of Chinese police brutality. Typical of all Chinese legal documents, the notice also contains the last catch-all phrase: "Do not share other illegal information." The notice ends with a warning that those "who share information by violating the regulation will be dealt with by the relevant departments in accordance with relevant laws and regulations."Below is a translation of the nine rules listed in the notice:Do not share information containing political contentsDo not believe in rumours and do not tell themDo not share internal documents containing confidential informationDo not share information containing pornography, drug use, and violence, etc.Do not share information related to Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan before it is released on government websitesDo not share military related informationDo not share documents containing state secretsDo not share fake videos that sully the image of policeDo not share other illegal informationThe censorship rules issued in Machu County add to a host of other restrictive regulations passed by the Chinese authorities this year to implement the Cyber Security Law that took effect in June. The notice issued in Machu County is notable for several reasons. Tibetan activists and government critics are routinely convicted of "leaking state secrets" or "endangering state security" for allegedly sharing information that contains "illegal political contents". Both charges are vaguely defined in Chinese Law allowing the law enforcement agencies to criminalise human rights and peaceful dissent. The reference to 'fake videos' of Chinese police brutality is also noteworthy given that in the past Chinese authorities had banned videos of Chinese police subjecting handcuffed Tibetan protesters to severe beatings and torture that sparked international outcry and exposed inhumane torture methods employed in Chinese police custody.In October, Chinese state media reported on a workshop organised by the County PSB to educate online chat group administrators about the new internet regulations in Tsekhog (Ch: Zeku) County in Malho (Ch: Huangnan) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province. The PSB officers who led the workshop explained to 248 online group administrators on the reasons why "many online groups administrators were arrested in the past" and gave specific instructions on preventing illegal contents online.In Tibet, blogs, instant messaging services, discussion forums, and other internet platforms have long been monitored and censored. More social media contents are blocked in Tibet than any other place in the PRC. Therefore any new law or regulation only reinforces the existing restrictions. One of the most popular social media apps in China is WeChat. WeChat is the most widely used social media apps by a large number of Tibetans in Tibet. TCHRD's 2016 Annual Report found that self-censorship among Tibetans had increased and the new regulations will further restrict their freedom of expression and right to privacy.Earlier this week, a report released by Freedom House on online freedom worldwide found that for the third consecutive year, China was the world's worst violator of internet freedom, followed by Syria and Ethiopia. The report also found that half of all internet shutdowns in the reporting year were specific to mobile connectivity, with most mobile shutdowns occurring in Tibet and Oromo areas in Ethiopia.Load-Date: November 17, 2017End of Document

Chinese kindergarten investigation: Beijing police detain teacherCNN WireNovember 26, 2017 Sunday 9:11 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1253 wordsByline: By Steven Jiang, CNNDateline: BEIJING (CNN) BodyBEIJING (CNN) --  Police in Beijing have detained a teacher as they investigate allegations that children were drugged and molested at a kindergarten. A 22-year-old female teacher surnamed Liu at RYB Xintiandi, a private kindergarten in Beijing, was taken into custody Saturday for allegedly abusing students, Beijing police said in a statement. Chinese police often don't provide the full names of suspects.The police also announced the detention of another woman for "rumor mongering," accusing her of posting fabricated information online about the involvement of military personnel in the incident, which prompted an unusual denial from the Defense Ministry in a press release Friday.RYB Education, the Beijing-based and New York-listed company that runs the kindergarten, apologized to children, parents and the public in a statement issued Saturday. It said it had fired both the detained teacher and the head of the kindergarten, while continuing its full cooperation with the authorities in the investigation. "There was serious breach of duty in our management," the statement said. "We must bear responsibility, deeply reflect, and thoroughly investigate and rectify (our operations)."The company promised to provide psychological counseling to the victims, upgrade safety measures in its facilities and set up an independent supervision system.Public outcry But the latest developments appear to have failed to quell intense nationwide debates about the incident, which has triggered public outrage, parental soul-searching, government pledges and online censorship.The story broke last week after numerous parents accused RYB Xintiandi of drugging and molesting their children. According to one parent -- in a video posted on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter -- at least eight parents told police that their young children had been drugged and molested while attending the school.The video was viewed millions of times before being deleted from Weibo.The unidentified mother told reporters on November 23 that her 3-year-old daughter said she was injected with a brown liquid by a teacher and made to strip along with other children before being "examined" by a naked adult male stranger.She said she and other parents allegedly found multiple needle marks on their children's bodies, adding that the kindergarten and the police had not allowed them to review videos from the school's surveillance cameras."My child said the teacher told them it was a secret and they were not supposed to tell anyone else, including parents," the mother said. "She now bursts into screaming at night, saying, 'I'm not sick, why do I have to get a shot?'"Beijing police have performed forensic tests and obtained surveillance camera footage from the kindergarten, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency.Company criticizedRYB Education saw its stock price plummet almost 40% Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. The company announced a plan to buy back shares worth $50 million in a call with investors Friday, prompting criticism online that it puts profits before public interests as it had not held a press conference on the incident.The company and its franchisees operate in approximately 300 Chinese cities and run about 1,300 daycare centers and 500 kindergartens.In an earlier statement, released Friday, RYB Education said it had provided the relevant surveillance videos and equipment to the police, adding: "Before a clear conclusion can be drawn, our priority is to help the students and their parents emotionally, and try to minimize the impact of the incident on the children."That statement also said the head of the kindergarten had filed a police report that alleged "false accusations and being framed by certain individuals" -- without specifying who.As more details emerged, the government scrambled to respond to the incident. Both the national education ministry and the municipal education authority in Beijing have pledged cooperation with the police and swift investigations on their own, with local officials sending a team to the kindergarten.CNN sought a direct response from the company and local education officials on Sunday but those calls were not answered. On Friday, attempts to contact the kindergarten and local education officials on site were thwarted by security guards, who said no one would make additional comments beyond previously issued statements. Anger on social mediaIt was relatively quiet around the RYB Xintiandi campus Friday, with some parents and onlookers gathering outside the gate where a copy of the corporate statement was posted.One grandfather, who had just picked up his granddaughter but declined to be named, told CNN that the 4-year-old mentioned her classmates being forced to take white pills for disobedience and everyone was told to keep it a secret.Another resident of the neighborhood who identified himself as Mr. Liu said the kindergarten is the best in the area and costs as much as 5,000 yuan ($750) a month for bilingual class students. He said he was furious upon hearing the news, but still believes those were isolated cases based on what he had learned about the school from a relative whose child went there.Many internet users, however, have continued to angrily reject RYB's response as "inadequate" and have called for severe punishment for those found responsible.Past incidents involving RYB kindergartens included two cases in northeastern China, where four RYB teachers were each sentenced to more than two years in prison for abusing 17 children.Amid growing public outcry over the scandal, Chinese government censors seem to have moved to contain the fallout. Many users have complained about the disappearance of their posts on the subject on social media. Comment sections are turned off for many online news reports on this story.Even one of the most influential news executives at a state media outlet questioned the wisdom of such heavy-handed tactics on Weibo before his post was taken down."The authorities should be cautious when deleting posts," Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of Global Times, a popular state-run nationalistic tabloid, wrote Thursday as news of the scandal had begun to spread online. "They should only target those posts that maliciously stretch the topic to politics, in order to prevent the deletion from arousing more suspicion."Parents share tipsAcross Chinese cyberspace, parents of young children have started sharing tips on detection and prevention of such cases -- some directly copied from school literature in the United States.Earlier this month, videos of teachers at a Shanghai kindergarten physically attacking kids and force-feeding them what appeared to be mustard went viral.Shanghai police quickly detained several employees at the facility, while the municipal government's women's affairs agency, with which the kindergarten is affiliated, had to apologize to the parents and public.Critics have long said current Chinese laws are too vague and lax on child abuse and sexual molestation cases.Media in China have documented a rising number of incidents of abuse at childcare facilities, often in small cities and towns. In a lengthy investigative piece published last year, Xinhua said only 968 cases of sexual abuse against children were recorded nationwide between 2013 and 2015, involving at least 1,790 children, with many remaining unreported.CNN's Serenitie Wang contributed to this report.TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

China's digital economy: A leading global forceMcKinsey & CompanyAugust 3, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 McKinsey & Company, Inc All Rights ReservedLength: 911 wordsByline: MGIHighlight: China is already more digitized than many observers appreciate and has the potential to set the world's digital frontier in coming decades.Body Link to Image China has one of the most active digital-investment and start-up ecosystems in the world, according to a new discussion paper from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), China's digital economy: A leading global force. China is in the top three in the world for venture-capital investment in key types of digital technology, including virtual reality, autonomous vehicles, 3-D printing, robotics, drones, and artificial intelligence (AI). China is the world's largest e-commerce market, accounting for more than 40 percent of the value of worldwide e-commerce transactions, up from less than 1 percent about a decade ago. China has also become a major global force in mobile payments with 11 times the transaction value of the United States. One in three of the world's 262 unicorns (           start-ups valued at over $1 billion) is Chinese, commanding 43 percent of the global value of these companies (Exhibit).Exhibit Link to Image Three-often unappreciated-factors are propelling the expansion of digital China and suggest that there is far larger upside potential for digital in China than many observers appreciate: • The bigger, younger China market is enabling rapid commercialization of digital business models on a large scale. The sheer scale of China's Internet user-base encourages continuous experimentation and enables digital players to achieve economies of scale quickly. In 2016, China had 731 million Internet users, more than the European Union and the United States combined. Beyond scale, it is the enthusiasm for digital tools among China's consumers that will support growth, facilitate rapid adoption of innovation, and make Chinese digital players and their business models competitive. Nearly one in five Internet users in China relies on mobile only, compared with just 5 percent in the United States. The share of Internet users in China making            mobile digital payments is around 68 percent, compared with only around 15 percent in the United States.• China's three Internet giants are building a rich digital ecosystem that is now spreading beyond them. Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent, collectively known as BAT, have been building dominant positions in the digital world by taking out inefficient, fragmented, and low-quality offline markets while driving technical performance such as computing efficiency to set new world-class standards. The BAT companies have been developing a multifaceted and multi-industry digital ecosystem that touches almost every aspect of consumers' lives. The functionality offered by their "super apps" has increased about seven times since 2011. In 2016, BAT provided 42 percent of all venture-capital investment in China, a far more prominent role than Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Netflix that together contributed only 5 percent of US venture-capital investment in that year. Beyond China's big three, other digital innovators such as Xiaomi and NetEase and traditional players such as Ping An are building their own ecosystems. China's digital players enjoy the notable advantage of close links to hardware manufacturers. The Pearl River Delta industrial hub is likely to continue to be a major producer of connected devices because of its strength in manufacturing hardware.• The government gave digital players space to experiment before enacting official regulation and is now becoming an active supporter. The Chinese government moved to regulate the digital sector only after a delay, which gave innovators plenty of space to experiment. As the market has matured, both the government and the private sector have gradually become more proactive about shaping healthier digital development through regulation and enforcement. Today, the government is playing an active role in building world-class infrastructure to support digitization as an investor, developer, and consumer.In combination, these three factors mean that China has an increasingly visible presence on the global stage and rising impact on the global economy. China runs a trade deficit in services but a trade surplus in digital services. China's outbound venture capital totaled $38 billion between 2014 and 2016, reaching 14 percent of global venture-capital investment outside China. Over the past two years, China's top 3 Internet companies made 35 overseas deals, compared with 20 by the top three US Internet companies. Chinese digital companies are also expanding business models outside the country's borders, and sharing their technology with foreign partners, enabling their expansion.            China's digital globalization is only just getting started but is gathering momentum.This discussion paper is a preview of a major MGI report on digital in China that will explore how digital disruption will enable companies to boost their efficiency, boost revenue, and optimize cost, and how three types of digital disruption-de-materialization, dis-intermediation and disaggregation-can help to restructure value chains, and increase the speed of the disruption.About the authorsJonathan Woetzel is a director of the McKinsey Global Institute, where            Jeongmin Seong is a senior fellow,            James Manyika is chairman and a director, and            Michael Chui is a partner.

CHINA'S BACKING OF UN SANCTIONS MAY NOT PUSH PYONGYANG BACK INTO TALKS: ANALYSTSStates News ServiceAugust 8, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 1074 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:As Japan warned that the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear weapons program has entered "a new stage," China has come down on the side of economic sanctions against the isolated Pyongyang regime.But political analysts in China and Taiwan said the move may not be enough to ensure Pyongyang's return to the negotiating table.In a report released on Tuesday , Japan's defense ministry warned that North Korea may already have achieved the miniaturization of nuclear weapons necessary to launch a long-range nuclear missile strike."Since last year, when it forcibly implemented two nuclear tests and more than 20 ballistic missile launches, the security threats have entered a new stage," it said in its annual defense white paper.North Korea under supreme leader Kim Jong Un has carried out a string of missile tests since the beginning of the year, including two intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) which landed off the west coast of Japan.Japan's warning comes after the United Nations Security Council unanimously voted through a new round of sanctions against Pyongyang at the weekend.North Korea slammed the new U.N. sanctions as "fabricated" and warned there would be "strong follow-up measures."The sanctions, which include a ban on coal and other North Korean exports worth over U.S.$1 billion, also had the backing of Beijing, which said that they were a "price worth paying."Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China, as North Korea's closest trading partner, will pay the biggest price for the new United Nations sanctions, but vowed to enforce them.The sanctions could slash Pyongyang's U.S.$3 billion annual export revenue by a third, analysts said.Vested interestsAnalysts said Wang Yi's comments weren't only directed at North Korea, but also at vested interests in the ruling Chinese Communist Party's own ranks, however."[President] Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump may have agreed that mainland China will reduce trade with North Korea when they met back in April, but according to video sent by internet users in [the border city of] Dandong, there is a never-ending stream of transportation crossing the Yalu River Bridge, and Sino Korean trade is still increasing daily," journalist Zhao Yan wrote in a commentary for RFA's Cantonese Service on Monday .Video of the Yalu River Bridge posted to YouTube by user Xi Tianqi showed a line of trucks moving slowly across the bridge.According to the Korea Trade and Investment Promotion Corporation (KOTRA) North Korea's foreign trade dependence was at a record high of 92.5 percent in 2016. By comparison, North Korean trade dependence on Russia was 1.2 percent."There is no way that Fatty Kim can run the North Korean economy without the support of the Chinese government," Zhao said, using an online nickname commonly used in China for Kim Jung Un. "But what is worth noting is that Sino-Korean trade has continued to expand ever since ... President Hu Jintao came to power [in 2002]."Zhao said recent corruption probes into Wang Min, former party secretary for the northeastern province of Liaoning, which borders North Korea, could be linked to Xi's bid to reduce trade with North Korea."But [Chinese] officials are driven by vested interests, and Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign seems powerless to stem the temptation of skimming off some of Fatty Kim's cash on the part of mainland Chinese officials," Zhao wrote. "If this weren't the case, then we wouldn't have a ceaseless flow of trucks crossing that river."But To-hai Liou, foreign policy expert at Taiwan's Chengchi University, said the stakes are high for Xi's central government in Beijing, too."If the United States were to launch an attack on North Korea, this would diminish China's authority," Liou said. "It goes without saying that it would probably start another Korean war, or instability in northeast Asia, not to mention the possible collapse of the North and a flood of refugees in China."The sanctions raise the possibility that North Korea could be forced to return to the negotiating table.But Wang Sheng, a Korean expert at Jilin University in northeastern China, said he isn't optimistic about that prospect."There will need to be three-party talks between China, the U.S. and the North, or four-party, between the U.S., China and both North and South Korea, before they can move to six-party talks [including Russia and Japan]," Wang said. "But it is pretty clear that North Korea won't be curbed by China.""What the North really wants is for formal diplomatic ties to be set up with the United States, and a [bilateral] dialogue. This has been its position all along," he said.Military exercisesBut he said progress could be hampered by demands from Pyongyang for a halt to joint exercises between U.S. and South Korean forces."I think North Korea might decide it wants to talk if the U.S. and South Korea agreed to a temporary halt to those exercises, or even just to reduce their size and scope, but if not, I'm not optimistic," Wang said.Meanwhile, Japan's defense ministry also highlighted "provocative acts" by China in the East China Sea and South China Sea as an area of concern.The complaint comes after the foreign ministers of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) indirectly criticized Beijing's territorial expansion there in an unusual statement on Sunday .In a reference to China's building of artificial islands, air strips and other installations in the disputed waters, the ministers noted "concerns expressed by some ministers on the land reclamations and activities in the area, which have eroded trust and confidence, increased tensions and may undermine peace, security and stability in the region.""We emphasized the importance of non-militarization and self-restraint in the conduct of all activities by claimants and all other states," the communique, which came as Beijing and ASEAN signed a code of conduct for the South China Sea, said.Liou said Japan's comments were squarely aimed at ensuring a continued U.S. military presence in the region."When it comes to the South China Sea, of course Japan doesn't want to see a diminished U.S. presence," he said. "[They] don't want to see China become the dominant power in the Asia Pacific."Reported by Gao Feng for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Zhao Yan for the Cantonese Service.

INDONESIA DEPORTS 143 SUSPECTS IN CYBER-CRIME RING TO CHINAStates News ServiceAugust 3, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 545 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Indonesia on Thursday deported 143 suspects allegedly involved in a $450 million cyber fraud ring that targeted wealthy Chinese, triggering a diplomatic protest from Taiwan after more than a dozen of its citizens were sent to China.The suspects 125 Chinese and 18 Taiwanese citizens were arrested on July 29 during raids in Jakarta, Surabaya and Bali, and deported at the request of authorities in China, Indonesian officials said.The deportations drew protests from the Taiwanese capital Taipei and the Taiwan Economic and Trade Office (TETO), which serves as the island's diplomatic office in Jakarta."According to the 'presumption of innocence' and 'principle of repatriation of nationality,' Taiwanese suspects should be sent back to Taiwan for investigation and trial," TETO said in a statement released Thursday.It said a majority of the suspects did not have passports, allowing officials in Beijing to claim that all of them were Chinese citizens.Forcibly sending Taiwanese nationals to the Chinese mainland "completely ignores goodwill and appeals from our side," said Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, a cabinet-level administrative agency under the central government's executive branch.Color-coded shirtsThe deportees left from Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport on two flights, immigration office spokesman Agung Sampurno told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service."One hundred and forty-three people, consisting of 125 Chinese and 18 Taiwanese, were able to return home with emergency documents issued by the Chinese government," Agung said.The suspects were taken to the Chinese cities of Chengdu or Tianjin. As they boarded their flights out of Indonesia, they wore T-shirts with designated colors orange, blue or pink to indicate the locations of their arrests, Indonesian and Taiwanese officials said.Apart from the 143 who were expelled, four Taiwanese nationals and a Malaysian were detained in Jakarta because their documents had not been completed, Agung said.Home to more than 23 million people, Taiwan is the most populous state to not be a member of the United Nations. China claims sovereignty and considers it a breakaway province.Most nations, including Indonesia, adhere to Beijing's strict One-China policy and do not have formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan.Official request from BeijingBenarNews could not reach Arrmanatha Nasir, Indonesia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, to comment on Taiwan's protest.Police said the 143 deportees were suspects in an international ring who allegedly extorted money from Chinese businessmen, by identifying themselves as law-enforcement officials who could help settle their legal cases after being paid a certain amount.Investigators said they could not confirm the number of victims, but National Police spokesman Brig. Gen. Rikwanto earlier told BenarNews that the international syndicate netted about 6 trillion rupiahs (U.S. $450 million)."The exact amount has not been known yet, as the legal process will be there (China)," he said, adding local authorities did not start a legal process in Jakarta because there were no Indonesian victims.Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Load-Date: August 4, 2017End of Document

CORRECTING and REPLACING Chinese Millennials and Generation Z Set to Become the Dominant Force in Luxury by 2025Business WireDecember 8, 2017 Friday 1:37 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Advertising Writers; Education Editors; Marketing WritersLength: 566 wordsDateline: SHANGHAI & LONDON & NEW YORK BodyReissuing release to add ticker symbol for searching purposes.The corrected release reads:CHINESE MILLENNIALS AND GENERATION Z SET TO BECOME THE DOMINANT FORCE IN LUXURY BY 2025Chinese millennials and Generation Z are set to become the dominant driver of luxury consumption over the next decade.The country's millennials (born 1985 to 1995) and Generation Z (born after 1995) accounted for 34% of discretionary disposable income in 2015 but this is forecast to rise to 50% by 2025, according to the 2017 Chinese Luxury E-Commerce Whitebook report from Secoo (Nasdaq: SECO), Asia's largest high-end e-commerce platform, and Tencent, the largest data company in China.The report - which leverages Secoo's unique insight into customers and Tencent's expertise in big data - found that almost half (48%) of luxury shoppers in China were under 30.Young generation embrace onlineSome 42% of Chinese millennials tend to shop online, compared with 34% of Generation X (born between mid 1960s and early 1980s). The average age is now 25 and, as the desire of young people to shop online shows no abating, this post-90s generation is also becoming another powerful group in luxury consumption.Minority brands Rise upThis younger generation is highly active using online and social media channels, such as Weibo and WeChat - with digital media accounting for 76% of where they source the latest luxury information and insight, while traditional media only accounts for 24%.Chinese consumers are stepping up their buying of minority brands - as opposed to famous and high-profile logo - as they seek more personalised and less mainstream experiences. For example, as Hip-Hop culture has gradually become more mainstream this has led to more young people embracing and becoming fans of brands, such as Supreme and Vetements.Reduced import duties boost China's domestic consumptionThe US remains the biggest market globally accounting for 22% of luxury sales but China is a close second with 21%.The report also found that growth in the Chinese luxury market is forecast to grow each year by 4% over the next five years to reach of 617 billion RMB in 2021, ahead of growth in the worldwide market.Key drivers behind this have included the Chinese government introducing policies to stimulate demand for domestic luxury consumption by reducing import duties on categories, such as cosmetics, luggage and apparel.The 2017 China Luxury E-Commerce Whitebook report follows Secoo reporting strong financial results in 5 consecutive quarters. For the third quarter to 30 September 2017, Secoo's GMV reached US$209.6 million, representing an increase of 65.4% from Q3 2016. Total net revenuereached US$147.6 million, up 44.2% from Q3 2016.Secoo has grown rapidly to become Asia's largest online luxury transaction platform, according to Frost & Sullivan.* The content for the 2017 China Luxury E-Commerce Whitebook was collected between 1 October 2016 and 30 September 2017 and features a combination of Secoo's real shopping data, mapped against Tencent's digital and social media data from consumers, including videos they have been watching.

One-Fifth of World's Internet Users Are in China, They Are Spending Close to $1 Trillion OnlineTargeted News ServiceSeptember 28, 2017 Thursday 12:48 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 893 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: BEIJING BodyBoston Consulting Group, a management consulting firm, issued the following news release:The Chinese online market has joined that of the US as one of the two engines driving the global internet economy. The number of Chinese internet users has grown at 25% per year over the past 15 years, to reach 710 million in 2016--20% of the world total. Online spending in the country has increased by 32% per year in the last five years, reaching $967 billion in 2016. Still, only 52% of China's population uses the internet, leaving significant room for growth. A new report and slideshow by The Boston Consulting Group (BCG), AliResearch, and the Baidu Development Research Center take a detailed look at what is driving this rapid growth. The report, Decoding the Chinese Internet, offers a window into China's online landscape, its unique characteristics and competitive dynamics, and what the future holds.Rapid growth, power players, fast-cycle innovation, and mobile connectivity are shaping this growth market. Over the last three years, Alibaba has become the world's largest retailer, and mobile payments in China have reached $8.5 trillion--70 times more than in the US. In April 2017, Ant Financial's Yu'ebao became the world's biggest money market fund, with $165.6 billion in assets under management. And three technologies developed by Baidu, including autonomous driving, were selected by MIT Tech Review among "the 10 Breakthrough Technologies in 2017."Although China lags the US in terms of total connectivity, more Chinese go online using mobile phones (90% versus 78%). Mobile internet users in China love to try new apps, but lose interest quickly: the typical user has 38 apps, 43% of which are used only once.Overnight success is more likely in China than in the US. On average, it takes only four years for a Chinese startup to become a unicorn (valued at over $1 billion), compared with seven years for a new company in the US.Three Primary Forces Drive Rapid GrowthShu Li, a BCG partner and coauthor of the report, says that "both the economic environment and a high degree of transparency within the internet industry have propelled China's internet boom, but the most important force is the leapfrog growth of undeveloped sectors that the internet enabled." In certain industries such as retail and financial services, internet-based solutions that address efficiency gaps and other pain points have quickly gained traction and become mainstream.Fast-Cycle Innovation Drives VolatilityFrancois Candelon, a BCG senior partner and coauthor of the report, notes that "China's internet landscape is fast changing and volatile. Ongoing innovation in business models, applications, and content leads to intense competition." The hottest areas see many microchanges that can better meet evolving market demand, as well as higher innovation frequency, more quick wins, and greater volatility.Online competition is fierce, with many companies vying for a piece of the pie. This is especially the case when a fad is peaking, after which many companies are unlikely to survive. For instance, the number of group-buying websites soared to 5,000 at the height of their popularity in 2011, then plummeted to only 200 sites three years later.Key Success Factors for Foreign PlayersWhy have so many global giants failed to crack China's internet market? The report identifies four critical success factors that point to why some companies thrive and others fade:Localization Capability. Chinese consumers have unique needs and demand patterns that reflect their economic, social, and cultural environment.Quick Market Response. The rapid change and volatility of China's internet landscape demand the ability to respond and innovate quickly.Online/Offline integration. Companies must be able to capitalize on the relative strengths of online and offline channels and use them to complement each other.A Strong Ecosystem. The existing ecosystems of China's online leaders are a formidable barrier to outsiders hoping to break in. Ecosystems built elsewhere in the world may not work in China.Looking ForwardCan China maintain its online growth and momentum? All signs point to yes. The country has a massive supply of available capital, 850 million people under the age of 40 (internet users skew young here), a low-cost talent pool of science and engineering grads, and ongoing investments by the Chinese government in infrastructure--in areas such as broadband, mobile internet, and cloud computing--with the goal of providing ubiquitous internet access.In addition, China's major players are pioneering new internet development models, which should also drive growth. Hongbing Gao, vice president of Alibaba Group and dean of AliResearch, says, "The new development models will create new opportunities for the Chinese internet market."Cheng Zhao, Baidu's editor-in-chief and general manager of public affairs, says, "We expect that China's internet landscape will shift from application-driven to technology-driven innovations, which will likely stabilize the market."Click here (http://on.bcg.com/DecodingTheChineseInternet) to view a slideshow with the report's key findings.To arrange an interview with one of the authors, please contact Eric Gregoire at +1 617 850 3783 or gregoire.eric@bcg.comCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6024877 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: October 15, 2017End of Document

A giant Australian publisher scrapped a book on China's influence out of fear for Beijing's wrathBusiness Insider USNovember 14, 2017 Tuesday 02:54 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1189 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Tara Francis Chan)Highlight: Author Clive Hamilton says the fear of what Beijing might do was enough for the publisher to pull the book.BodyThomson Reuters• An Australian publisher has shelved a book on China's influence in Australia, out of fear of reprisal from Beijing.• The publisher wanted to avoid "Beijing's agents of influence" commencing complex and legal action.• There has been an uptick in warnings on China's influence in Australian business, politics, security, and universities.• The author, a public ethics professor, says the "shadow Beijing casts" could put Western democracy at risk. A large independent publisher has shelved a book on China's soft power in Australia, because it is concerned about reprisals from Beijing or its "agents of influence."Allen & Unwin told Clive Hamilton, the author of the upcoming "Silent Invasion: How China is Turning Australia into a Puppet State," that his book was an "extremely significant" title but could open the company to "possible action by Beijing," which could take a range of forms, including complex and expensive legal action.The publishing company, in a statement to Business Insider, said it had chosen to delay publication."After extensive legal advice we decided to delay publication of Clive's book "Silent Invasion" until certain matters currently before the courts have been decided," a spokesperson said. "Clive was unwilling to delay publication and requested the return of his rights, as he is entitled to do. We continue to wish him the best of luck with the book."Hamilton, a professor of public ethics at Charles Sturt University, said the decision was worrying and "if it spreads, and other publishers are afraid of publishing criticism of Chinese government then Western democracy is in trouble.""I think the key message is that the shadow Beijing casts is now enough to spook even a reputable publisher in Australia. They didn't have to do anything, just the fear of what they might do was enough for the publisher to pull the plug from the book," Hamilton told Business Insider.Hamilton has published eight previous titles with Allen & Unwin and said "Silent Invasion" looked in detail at the level of China's influence in Australian institutions, including politics, media, universities, and social and cultural organizations. Hamilton said the book also explores how public thinking and the attitudes of opinion makers have been subtly influenced to shift the country "more and more into China's orbit."In an email seen by Business Insider, Allen & Unwin CEO Robert Gorman told Hamilton the company had been advised to delay the scheduled publication, but did not specify when exactly this decision would be revisited.Instead, Gorman said there was a "very high chance of a vexatious defamation action" from "a 'whale' or a small Beijing agent mentioned in the book."Hamilton, who received the email on November 8, said the irony of the situation "did my head in for a few days.""How can Beijing suppress a book that exposes Beijing's influence in Australia? It kind of adds a new layer of meaning and significance to the book," Hamilton said.There was fear of a defamation case from "agents of influence"In Gorman's email to Hamilton, Allen & Unwin outlined how two ongoing defamation court cases - thought to be those brought by Australian citizen Chau Chak Wing against Fairfax Media and ABC over media reports from earlier this year - impacted their decision to delay the book's release."The advice we received was that the risk of such an attack was likely to lessen considerably once the current defamation cases by the 'whales' against media companies had been through the courts," wrote Gorman.Allen & Unwin also said it was an "obvious target" for legal action by "Beijing's agents of influence." According to Hamilton, agents of influence work in a variety of areas in Australia."There are wealthy businesspeople; they're talking about political donors, they're worried about opinion-makers and political leaders - usually ex-political leaders - who basically argue strongly in favor of Beijing's view," Hamilton said.Publishers have controversially censored material in China this yearOther notable publishers have recently censored material to avoid running afoul of Chinese authorities.In August, Cambridge University Press (CUP) came under fire for blocking access to more than 300 articles at the request of Beijing authorities. Some of the articles touched on locally controversial topics including Tibet, Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution and the Tiananmen Square massacre.An international outcry forced CUP to reverse its decision.And earlier this month, the Financial Times discovered Springer Nature, publisher of Nature and Scientific American magazines, had withdrawn more than 1,000 sensitive articles.Self-censorship of books in China is common, but the decision by Allen & Unwin appears to be the first time a publisher has self-censored material about the Chinese Communist Party in its home country.Warnings of China's influence have been growingIn 2012, Huawei was blocked from tendering for Australia's National Broadband Network (NBN) due to cybersecurity concerns. The Attorney General's department made the decision based on advice from the national security agency, the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO).Then, in 2015, the federal government blocked the sale of a giant landholder, S. Kidman and Co., to a Chinese company, Shanghai Pengxin, on national-interest grounds. Some of the land owned by the cattle-rearing company was defense-sensitive, being close to the Woomera weapons testing range in South Australia.The company was later sold to a consortium led by Australian mining billionaire Gina Rinehart, with a one-third minority stake controlled by another Chinese company, Shanghai CRED, but the defense-sensitive assets were excluded from the sale.Last year, an Australian senator was found to have financial ties to a Chinese business that had close links to the country's Communist Party and earlier this year, Australia's top spy warned universities to be            wary of foreign interference.And on Tuesday, Attorney General George Brandis confirmed the completion of a review examining new laws that will ban foreign political donations and include a register for foreign agents, who will have to declare whether they are working for a foreign power.Hamilton said the Communist Party has used its secretive United Front Work Department to influence and control organizations and thinking in other countries."Those groups have been mobilized as a highly effective way of influencing our perceptions of China in the political domain, the business community, and more broadly in the media in Australia," said Hamilton. "It really is a very extensive influence campaign that's been highly effective."Hamilton is now looking for another publisher.NOW WATCH: Trump says the Texas church shooting 'isn't a guns situation' - watch his full statement on the attack that killed 26 peopleSee Also:• Here's where Google's first 21 employees are now• Jon Gruden says he may return to coaching, and 2 teams appear to be the most likely destinations• The US's most secretive intelligence agency was embarrassingly robbed and mocked by hackersLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

EPO AND CHINESE IP OFFICE RENEW THEIR STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPStates News ServiceNovember 23, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 567 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: MUNICH, Germany BodyThe following information was released by the European Patent Office (EPO):The EPO and China's State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) have renewed their co-operation by signing a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement at their annual heads of office meeting today in Zhengzhou.EPO President Benot Battistelli and SIPO Commissioner Shen Changyu underlined that this unique agreement reinforces a historic co-operation which goes back more than 30 years. It is the first and only agreement of such kind signed by both offices with other patent offices.The comprehensive strategic partnership sets out the principles for co-operation in areas such as laws and policies, the patent granting process, user services and training. It is valid for an unlimited time, and will be complemented by annual work plans, such as the one for 2018 also signed today in Zhengzhou."The new strategic agreement signed today is a milestone in the history of our relations with China," said EPO President Battistelli. "Thanks to our co-operation, the European and Chinese patent granting systems now closely resemble each other, which greatly benefits innovators in both regions. The new agreement will allow us to explore the vast potential for even closer co-operation, to include new areas such as artificial intelligence and green technologies, and to continue to promote the efficient functioning of the global patent system".EPO-SIPO relations date back to the signing of a first memorandum of understanding between the two offices in 1985, and have since contributed significantly to the development of the protection of patent rights in China, and to the strengthening of the patent system at international level.One of the highlights of the EPO's President visit to China was a 50-minute high-level meeting with State Councillor Wang Yong. The State Councillor outlined the main challenges ahead for China with respect to intellectual property. He stressed the importance placed on IP by the Chinese government, in particular since the recent 19th National Congress, and noted that China's partnership with the EPO is very important for the development of the Chinese patent system. He acknowledged the leading role of the EPO in the quality of the global patent system.In meetings with European and Chinese companies in Beijing, Mr Battistelli outlined the benefits of EPO-SIPO co-operation for their business, and presented recent developments at the EPO such as its Early Certainty approach, plans to launch optional postponement of examination at the request of applicants ("User Driven Early Certainty") and the forthcoming fee reductions. In all these discussions, the EPO President stressed that the main aim of both the EPO and SIPO is to maintain and even increase the quality of their patent-granting procedures. Industry participants praised the continuous positive results achieved by the EPO in the implementation of its quality and efficiency strategy, and encouraged the EPO to further develop its fruitful co-operation with the SIPO.Rapid growth in patent applications from ChinaChina is a leading country of origin for patent applications at the EPO (6th largest country of origin), and applications from China have grown rapidly in recent years (+25% in 2016). With Huawei (no. 2) and ZTE (no.22), two Chinese companies were among the most active patent filing companies at the EPO last year.Load-Date: December 1, 2017End of Document

The Atlantic's December Issue: "The Making of an American Nazi" Profiles the Disturbing Evolution of Daily Stormer Publisher Andrew AnglinAtlantic OnlineNovember 14, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 2431 wordsBodyWashington, D.C. (November 14, 2017)-Andrew Anglin's website, The Daily Stormer, has been called the leading hate site on the internet-and Anglin himself is the alt-right's most effective propagandist and most vicious troll. But who is Anglin, and how did he develop such a following? The cover story of The Atlantic's December issue, "The Making of an American Nazi," takes a riveting and deeply disturbing look into the world of Anglin and the alt-right one year after the election of Donald Trump. Reporter Luke O'Brien spent nearly a year uncovering previously unknown details of Anglin's past, charting his strange evolution from an antiracist vegan teen in Columbus, Ohio, to a neo-Nazi-including a bizarre foray into a remote jungle in the Philippines. In a companion piece, author Angela Nagle explores the evolution of the alt-right in "Brotherhood of Losers," asking what drives young men to radicalize in this way, and whether the backlash against the violent protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, will fracture the movement.Also in this month's issue: The Atlantic's Science, Technology, and Health editor, Ross Andersen, journeys to China, where the government has built the world's largest radio dish for the purpose of detecting extraterrestrial communications; tech writer Alexis Madrigal questions whether we should let children build emotional bonds with robots; and author Leslie Jamison visits the virtual realm of Second Life.The Atlantic's December 2017 issue is online in full today and on newsstands this week. A selection of pieces from the issue are linked and summarized below.COVER &amp; FEATURES           The Making of an American Nazi, by Luke O'Brien  Andrew Anglin's website, The Daily Stormer, has been called the leading hate site on the internet, and Anglin himself is the alt-right's most effective propagandist and most vicious troll. He "doxes" minorities, women, politicians, members of the LGBTQ community, journalists-publishing their addresses, phone numbers, and emails, and pictures of their spouses and young children-so that the underbelly of the internet can wreak havoc on their lives. And he's done more than anyone to organize and radicalize a new generation of white supremacists, sometimes with tragic consequences: Dylann Roof, who murdered nine black people in Charleston, South Carolina, was a Daily Stormer reader. Luke O'Brien comes closer than any other journalist in charting Anglin's bizarre and delusional evolution. Anglin's story shows that, like many members of the alt-right, he was drawn to white supremacy more for a sense of belonging and status than as a result of any deep ideological conviction. The Atlantic's cover story is a haunting profile of a violent, deeply disturbed, paradoxical, and at times drug-abusing individual-one who has been emboldened by the election of President Trump. O'Brien writes that during the election, "Suddenly it was okay to talk about banning Muslims or to cast Mexican immigrants as criminals and parasites-which meant Anglin's even-more-extreme views weren't as far outside the mainstream as they once had been." When candidate Trump was asked by CNN about the death threats and harassment leveled by Anglin's army, Trump's response was: "I don't have a message to the fans."             Brotherhood of Losers, by Angela Nagle The alt-right has offered angry, unmoored men a sense of belonging. But it wasn't until the events in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August that it leapt from private forums and online chat rooms into a form that most Americans could finally grasp as a real, and unambiguous, political movement. Charlottesville revealed the new movement's true ugliness, leaving many of its adherents horrified, and once again adrift. Where did the alt-right come from, and what's next for its fractious ranks? Angela Nagle, who has been observing the evolution of rightist groups for eight years, details the chilling inner workings of this resurgent facet of society, attributing its antiestablishment, antifeminist appeal to a desire for belonging and even trolling for the fun of it.           What Happens If China Makes First Contact?, by Ross Andersen As America has turned away from searching for extraterrestrial life, China has built the world's largest radio dish for precisely that purpose. And so, if another civilization's faint radio whispers were to come down in the next decade, China may very well be the first to hear them. The Atlantic's Science, Technology, and Health editor, Ross Andersen, travels to China to see for himself the enormous dish-which is the size of five football fields and large enough to hold two bowls of rice for every human on Earth-and to ask what the consequences would be were a signal from a distant intelligence to reach our planet. Would China go public with the signal? Would the government respond? Or would China withhold the signal's origin, even keep it a state secret? Andersen also meets with Liu Cixin, China's foremost science-fiction writer, with whom the Chinese government consulted on the project. He asks Liu to imagine the Chinese Academy of Sciences calling to tell him that it had found a signal. Liu cautioned against sharing with extraterrestrial life a too-detailed account of human history: "It's very dark. It might make us appear more threatening." But, writes Andersen, "I reminded Liu that distant civilizations might be able to detect atomic-bomb flashes in the atmospheres of distant planets, provided they engage in long-term monitoring of life-friendly habitats as any advanced civilization surely would. The decision about whether to reveal our history might not be ours to make."           The Digital Ruins of a Forgotten Future, by Leslie Jamison Second Life was supposed to be the future of the internet, but then Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram came along. Of the 36 million Second Life accounts that had been created by 2013, only an estimated 600,000 people still regularly use the platform. What happened? In a new report, Leslie Jamison explores the evolution and current state of the world of Second Life (and its future) in an era when social media reign supreme. She observes: "If Second Life promised a future in which people would spend hours each day inhabiting their online identity, haven't we found ourselves inside it? Only it's come to pass on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter instead. As I learned more about Second Life, and spent more time exploring it, it started to seem less like an obsolete relic and more like a distorted mirror reflecting the world many of us live in."The stories of the people who escape into Second Life, and the world they've built, illuminate the promise and limitations of online life. Jamison joins the inhabitants of Second Life, and the more she explores, the more questions the online realm raises "about where unfettered fantasy leads, as well as about how we navigate the boundary between the virtual and the real. As virtual-reality technology grows more advanced, it promises to deliver a more fully realized version of what many believed Second Life would offer: total immersion in another world. And as our actual world keeps delivering weekly horrors ... the appeal of that alternate world keeps deepening, along with our doubts about what it means to find ourselves drawn to it."DISPATCHES:           My Son's First Robot, by Alexis Madrigal The Atlantic's Alexis Madrigal, who covers tech from its epicenter, in Northern California, wrestled with the decision of whether to buy his son a toy robot for his fourth birthday. Would he know what to make of it? Would his little sister destroy it? What are the consequences of inviting into the house a(nother) "smart" thing? The robot, Cozmo, produced by the company Anki, must be fed, repaired, and played with, and can use the full breadth of its animated repertoire to summon particular feelings in its owner and foster emotional bonds. Sure enough, when Cozmo lost a few rounds of a game, it showed frustration, prompting Madrigal's son to say: "Don't beat him! You're making him sad.""If you neglect him, you feel the pain of that," says Anki's CEO. Madrigal writes: "When he told me this, I felt a flash of not-quite-anger. It seemed almost cruel to design a robot that could play on a young kid's emotions. And I had never considered that, in the coming human-robot conflagration, robots might take over simply by expertly manipulating us into letting them win." But this technology is happening. It's here. Now it becomes a matter of understanding it and its interplay with our world. This leads Madrigal to conclude: "I feel about [robots] as my parents did about computers: It will be necessary to understand these machines to comprehend the world. So now we have our first robot."           Big In ... Turkey: Plaid Jackets Ever since then-Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan voted for himself in a presidential election in 2014 wearing a garish, oversize blue plaid suit jacket, the piece has become a staple of Erdogan's wardrobe-and a spreading trend. As Erdogan has consolidated power, members of his government have begun following not just his political lead but also his fashion cues. Photos of the leader flanked by subordinates, all matching, have gone viral.           Can Unions Stop the Far Right, by Vauhini Vara Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union  held strong in the recent elections against its far-right opponents in the Alternative for Germany party-and it was Germany's working-class voters who may have stopped a full hard-right turn. According to Vauhini Vara, a combination of market forces and a strong social-safety net has kept most people feeling satisfied with their government. Because Germany's economy is driven by manufacturing exports, a high percentage of citizens work in that sector, and they have become a powerful political constituency anchored by strong unions. German workers' sense of security and belonging mitigates the fears that have fed right-wing populism elsewhere. Can-and should-the United States learn from Germany's example?           Conservatism Without Bigotry, by Peter Beinart Is American conservatism inherently bigoted? While the debate over conservatism and bigotry is not new, the argument has become particularly fierce in the age of Donald Trump. As Peter Beinart observes, Trump's denigrating comments about Mexicans and Muslims, and his equivocal condemnations of white supremacists, have sparked outrage at perceived conservative bigotry, which now animates American liberalism more than it did in preceding administrations. Beinart argues that in order to move forward, Republicans must now reckon with their policies' racial effects, but liberals also must stop carelessly crying racist. He writes: "Halting the downward spiral will require other politicians to take risks as well. And it will require scores of commentators, activists, and voters to support them when they do. Liberals and conservatives each know the other side is capable of hatred and scorn. They both need to demonstrate that they are capable of empathy and courage, too."From the Culture File:           Shark Tank Nation, by Caitlin Flanagan: The genre of capitalist reality television began with our president, who realized years ago that TV contests based on people's ability to sing, dance, or get along with a houseful of losers on the CBS lot were small-time. According to Caitlin Flanagan, The Apprentice was about winning where it counts: in business. Since then, shows such as the long-running Shark Tank, and the newer and more offbeat The Toy Box and Steve Harvey's Funderdome, show a mesmerizingly shallow view of American entrepreneurship. Of ABC's The Toy Box, where a panel of children decide the fate of an inventor's financial future, Flanagan writes: "There is something exquisitely cruel about watching adults who have literally bet their house on an invention be dismissed by bored kids. She looks creepy!, one little monster said about a doll whose creator-a black woman who had wanted a doll that looked like her own daughter-had spent 30 years and more than $300,000 trying to bring it to market."           Books: The Rise and Fall of Rolling Stone, by Rich Cohen: Jann Wenner, the longtime editor of Rolling Stone, traded the hippie dream for pop-star friends and luxury. One witness to the early days of the magazine, as they devolved into out-of-control excess, was Rich Cohen, who was supposed to have written Wenner's autobiography on three separate occasions-. Cohen has praise for Sticky Fingers, the biography of Wenner by New York magazine's Joe Hagan, even if he feels Wenner's charm and spirit are lost in this definitive telling. He writes: "It's the book I could never have written. I know too little and sympathize too much. I like Wenner, and Hagan is remorseless ... A funny thing happens when a part of your life becomes official history. No matter how good that history is, the writer can't help getting a crucial aspect wrong. All the facts might be correct, but the spirit is lost. The effect is like a body without a soul."           Books: Inventing John Wayne, by Stephen Metcalf: In the new book Wayne and Ford: The Films, the Friendship, and the Forging of an American Hero, Nancy Schoenberger argues that "the masculine ideal, as championed by Ford and embodied by Wayne, is still salvageable, honorable even." But this is not the whole story, writes Stephen Metcalf in his review of the book. "Schoenberger has hidden a provocative thesis inside a Christmas present for Dad. She asks us to remember the beauty of masculine self-mastery as Ford presented it in his very best films. And yet, from the bulk of the evidence here, masculinity (like the Western) is a by-product of nostalgia, a maudlin elegy for something that never existed-or worse, a masquerade that allows no man, not even John Wayne, to be comfortable in his own skin." Metcalf continues: "Schoenberger makes the case that we are confused about masculinity because we cannot accept men like Wayne as heroes. In flight from machismo, we have largely given up on adult male self-mastery. But isn't it also true that, allowed at last to be confused about masculinity, we no longer accept men like Wayne as heroes?"With the holiday season quickly approaching, the December issue's Big Question asks: "           What was the most significant event to happen on a holiday?" The 1914 Christmas Truce of World War I, the Yom Kippur War, and Alexander Graham Bell filing his patent application for the telephone on Valentine's Day in 1876 are a few of the most historic happenings-as told by historians, authors, and Atlantic readers.Load-Date: December 27, 2017End of Document

Research Report on China Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Industry 2017-2021: Domestic Sales of Civil UAV in China will Exceed 6 Million by 2021PR NewswireAugust 8, 2017 Tuesday 2:45 PM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 654 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, August 8, 2017 BodyThe"Research Report on China Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Industry, 2017-2021"report has been added toResearch and Markets'offering.An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is an aircraft without a human pilot aboard and is under remote control by a human operator or autonomously by onboard computers. By techniques, UAVs can be classified into unmanned helicopter, fixed-wing UAV, multi-rotor UAV, unmanned airship, parasol-wing UAV, etc. The mainstream on the market is multi-rotor UAV, which is generally used for consumption.UAVs can carry unmanned smart flight platforms with different loads and will be more widely used as platforms and loads upgrade. Apart from traditional application areas such as military, agriculture and border defense, the development of UAV has reached to aerial photography, media interview, express delivery and Internet signal transmission.In January 2013, DJI, a Chinese UAV manufacturer, launched its first commercial UAV, the Phantom, which is mainly used to take GoPro into the sky. Since then, commercial UAVs have experienced explosive growth. Optimistic about professional applications of UAV, top Internet companies also attempt to step into this field.In November 2016, JD, a Chinese B2C e-commerce company, was granted the qualification to deliver goods by UAV. This marks an important breakthrough in policy. On November 12, 2016, JD completed its first UAV delivery in the Shanxi Province. Earlier in 2016, Tencent and ZEROTECH co-launched YING at CNY 1,999. This drone is targeted at the commercial market and bears Tencent's social community. UAVs used in agriculture, forestry and plant protection are also a significant trend in the industry.According to the report, with the support from the Chinese government, the size of pro market will surpass that of commercial UAV mainly used for aerial photography. However, future applications of UAV will surely be more diverse. Commercial UAV market and professional UAV market alike awaits to be explored. Many manufacturers have begun their march to agriculture, security, surveying and mapping, electricity and logistics.According to the report, from 2017 to 2021, both global and Chinese military, civil and commercial UAV markets will keep growing fast. It is estimated that by 2021, domestic sales of civil UAV in China will have exceeded 6 million and the market size will be over USD 3 billion.Companies Mentioned1 Shenzhen DJI Technology Co., Ltd.Shenzhen Rapoo Technology Co., Ltd.Powervision Tech Inc.Ewatt Technology Co., Ltd.XAIRCRAFT Co., Ltd.Beijing Skycam UAV Co., Ltd.Aerospace Communications Holdings Co., Ltd.Guizhou Guihang Automotive Components Co., Ltd.Avic Electromechanical Systems Co., Ltd.Chongqing Zongshen Power Machinery Co., Ltd.Dea General Aviation Holding Co., Ltd.Weihai Guangtai Airport Equipment Co., Ltd.Wuhan Guide Infrared Co., Ltd.Sunward Intelligent Equipment Co., Ltd.Shenzhen Sunwin Intelligent Co., Ltd.Key Topics Covered:1 Concepts in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Industry2 Analysis of China UAV Industry, 2013-20163 Analysis of Competition in UAV Industry in China4 Analysis of Major UAV Manufacturers in China, 2014-20165 Analysis of Raw Material Costs and Retail Prices in UAV Industry in China, 2014-20166 Forecast on Development of UAV Industry in China, 2017-2021For more information about this report visithttps://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/hzxrzs/research_reportMedia Contact:Research and MarketsLaura Wood, Senior Managerpress@researchandmarkets.comFor E.S.T Office Hours Call +1-917-300-0470For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call +1-800-526-8630For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900U.S. Fax: 646-607-1907Fax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/research-report-on-china-unmanned-aerial-vehicle-uav-industry-2017-2021-domestic-sales-of-civil-uav-in-china-will-exceed-6-million-by-2021-300501226.htmlSOURCE Research and MarketsLoad-Date: August 9, 2017End of Document

Chinese IoT solutions provider Tuya Smart delivers insights into what the future portends at the World Internet ConferencePR NewswireDecember 6, 2017 Wednesday 1:47 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1596 wordsDateline: WUZHEN, China, Dec. 6, 2017 BodyTuya Smart was the sole IoT solutions provider and smart platform creator invited by the organizer of the World Internet Conference (WIC) and China Central Television (CCTV) to provide insights into the two topics that were the themes of the event: artificial intelligence (AI) and globalized intelligent manufacturing.On December 4, Tuya Smart COO and Tuya Smart USA president Yang Yi, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tencent CEO Ma Huateng, Netease.com CEO Ding Lei, Sohu CEO Charles Zhang and Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun, among other top-level executives from some of the world's leading internet firms, attended the event. Global smart platform Tuya Smart, recognized for its outstanding contribution to the intelligent manufacturing and AI sectors, was invited to give a speech themed "New Intelligent Businesses in the New Era" at the AI-focused session. Mr. Yang said during his speech that the innovation in technology is the key to the transformation from "Made in China" to "From Smart China" and cited as illustrations Aliyun's breakthroughs in terms of internet data centers and how QR turned traditional payment services on their heads. Products incorporating China-originated intelligent manufacturing strategies are now available the world over. However, a technology platform cannot be considered as one that has succeeded unless there is complete and total ease of use, or, to put it another way, not even an iota of a barrier between the platform and the user. Tuya Smart aims to build a smart platform that meets this objective in all respects and engage every company across the manufacturing spectrum in intelligent manufacturing.Since identifying the synergies between intelligent manufacturing and new retail at the IoT Intelligentize Conference that Tuya Smart itself hosted on October 26, besides the WIC, the smart platform creator has received invitations from the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES), as well as many of the top players in Silicon Valley, in addition to other leading organizations within China and around the world. Before delivering the AI-focused keynote speech, Mr. Yang had received an invitation from CCTV to give a 30-minute live presentation in English about the event. As part of the live interview, Mr. Yang shared with the CCTV and British journalists in attendance his views on the ongoing transformation of the meaning of "Made in China" as well as the status of and trends influencing AI.When asked by the host about the future of the manufacturing industry and AI, Mr. Yang said,"At every one of the sessions of this important international conference, the WIC, the topic kept returning to the all important themes of the "digital economy" and "open and sharing", which facilitated the fusion of internet, big data and AI, as well as how this fusion helped the digital economy grow rapidly.I believe that in China, today and as we look into the future, the continued development of the manufacturing sector has become and will continue to be the cornerstones of the internet, IoT, AI and big data, while, in turn, these new technologies will be the engine that drives the next surge of growth across the sector.Over the last two years, China's manufacturing sector has been moving quickly towards intelligent manufacturing. Leading home appliance makers, including Changhong, Haier, TCL and Midea, have already built out their smart product lines. In addition, a wide spectrum of traditional manufacturers are embarking on their transformation to intelligent manufacturing in response to the government's supply-side reform.AI is undoubtedly one of the new drivers behind the development of the manufacturing sector. According to data provided by research organizations working closely with Tuya Smart, the smart platform creator has helped several major brands successfully transition into an intelligent hardware environment, with one percent of their growth in sales of the relevant product lines directly attributable to the effort. Some medium-sized companies that Tuya Smart worked with experienced sales growth exceeding 50 percent. Consequently, it has become apparent that AI has become the key to the transformation of traditional manufacturing.At the same time, in terms of the country's transition to intelligent manufacturing, what started out as a rocky road has, over the last two years, gradually become much more smooth going. When the first steps of the transformation were initiated, leading manufacturers from every sector were eager to invest in intelligent manufacturing, however, consumers were still highly skeptical of the new intelligent products and expressed reluctance in getting on board. In addition, the challenges facing adoption included disunity in terms of setting standards, immaturity of the industry chain, instability of the overall system and a high threshold for entry. The reasons behind the challenges, I think, include, first of all, the technology barrier and a lack of cooperation among manufacturers, which resulted in the consumers quickly becoming frustrated when faced with the difficulty of managing the various interfaces and control devices in anything that resembled a unified way. Secondly, an industry is not likely to move up to the next level if it grows independently of the support that it needs from external resources. The establishment of an ecosystem is necessary in providing consumers with a better smart home experience, regardless of whether the provider is a major player or a small start up. This can be seen, for example, in Xiaomi's stores, each one of which it manages directly, demonstrating the ecosystem's capability in injecting new momentum into the industry. In my opinion, every player across each industry needs to agree on and roll out fully integrated communications protocols. In addition to enhancements to product safety, cloud computing and big data will help companies build their own ecosystems and provide consumers with new experiences in every corner of their intelligent home.Concurrent with China's transition into intelligent manufacturing, AI technology has been staking out its own sizeable claim over the last few years. For example, even as Amazon Echo and Google Home have attracted wide attention, more than one million units of Tmall Genie, an AI-based intelligent voice terminal developed by Alibaba AI Labs, have been shipped. According to data from the AI industry whitepaper published by International Data Corporation (IDC), a leading global provider of market intelligence, expenditures on AI technology worldwide are expected to reach 275.8 billion yuan (approx. US$41.7 billion) by 2020, with China representing 12 percent or 32.5 billion yuan (approx. US$4.9 billion) of the total, demonstrating China's leadership position. We can see huge potential in the field as the Chinese government continues to support AI projects initiated by the country's three internet leaders, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. In addition to the smart home, finance, translation and speech, AI technology will be applied in the healthcare, security, logistics and mobility markets. However, limitations remain in terms of what the algorithm technology can deliver and we need to address them, including further developing the algorithms' inferential capability in accurately deducing the meaning of speech and in addressing the pathology underlying cancer and other diseases. As we look further into the future, it will behoove us to face and resolve legal and ethical issues that will arise as a result of the widespread adoption of the technology.I am familiar with intelligent manufacturing in China and AI topics as Tuya Smart emerged virtually out of nowhere and has since been playing a key role in helping products made in China improve their capabilities in terms of IoT and AI while, at the same time, becoming increasingly globalized. Although the firm is yet small, Tuya Smart has now become the world's largest intelligent platform. Our dedicated team of over 160 are helping customers expand into overseas markets, including Changhong, Seashell, Delixi, Xenon, Eboy, iO.e Light and Beca, to name a handful of the leading companies that work with us.

GLOBAL MOMENTUM TO END THE IVORY TRADE: ARTICLE BY BORIS JOHNSONStates News ServiceDecember 29, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 898 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: LONDON BodyThe following information was released by the UK Government:Writing in The Times, the Foreign Secretary says that a new global consensus, driven by UK leadership, is emerging that buying or selling ivory is unacceptable.Published 29 December 2017From:Foreign and Commonwealth Office and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MPWritten on:29 December 20172018 must be the year we defeat the ivory tradersThere is one question I would never want the children of the future to ask; in fact I'm haunted by the thought that they might. How could we reply if they feel compelled to enquire: "Why did you not do more to save the elephant?"Humanity is privileged to share the planet with these magnificent throwbacks from the Pleistocene, whose every attribute is a walking metaphor, and to be frank I find it heart-breaking to observe how their numbers have declined.Four decades ago, the great zoologist Iain Douglas-Hamilton assembled a small squadron of light aircraft and embarked on the first comprehensive survey of the elephant populations of Africa. In 1979 he found that 1.3 million elephants roamed the savannah and rainforest. Today, we are down to 415,000 African elephants and the pace of slaughter has recently accelerated. At least 110,000 have been wiped out since 2006: in East Africa, half of the elephants are gone; in Tanzania, nearly two thirds have vanished.If we do nothing, there is a real danger that our great grandchildren will grow up in a world without wild elephants. They will look at yellowing photographs of giant herds, they will watch David Attenborough documentaries on their ipads (or whatever virtual reality wizardry will then be commonplace), they will marvel at how such creatures once walked the earth, and then they will point accusing fingers and ask why their forebears you and me - somehow neglected to save the elephant from extirpation?China government ban on domestic salesSo it is fantastic news that decisive action is now being taken. About 70 per cent of the ivory hacked from the carcasses of poached elephants finds its way to China. There, workshops specialise in converting magnificent tusks into ornamental knick-knackery for display in countless homes.But that will soon change. From 31 December, the Chinese government will ban the domestic sale of ivory, albeit with certain exemptions. The biggest ivory market in the world - in which poachers and dealers enrich themselves should then be restricted.Everything will depend on how this measure is enforced and we must be cautious until we see the full impact. But just the prospect of a reduction in Chinese demand is already having an effect. If you track the volume of online advertising for ivory products, you will find that it declined by almost a third in the first four months of 2017, compared with the same period last year. The price of raw ivory also appears to be falling, reducing the profits to be made from butchering elephants.Once the Chinese ban comes into effect, I hope these benign trends will gather pace. But this far-sighted decision by China's leaders signifies something even more important, namely the emergence of a global consensus that buying or selling ivory is no longer acceptable anywhere. Saving elephants is not some Western obsession, but a cause that unites humanity.UK action to tackle the Illegal Wildlife TradeBritain has done a huge amount to encourage this new consensus. The Duke of Cambridge, whose passion for conservation is well known, met President Xi Jinping of China twice in 2015 and Prince Harry has just been named president of African Parks, a conservation NGO. In the New Year, the Government will act on our plans for a British ban on domestic ivory sales; in October I will co-host with Michael Gove an international conference in London on how to curb the Illegal Wildlife Trade.And in the besieged strongholds of the African elephant, Britain is helping to beat the poachers. When I visited Kenya in March, I met the UK-funded Anti-Poaching Team that protects the elephants of Lewa Conservancy.My aim is to make 2018 the year of UK leadership in defeating the ivory trade: wherever I go as Foreign Secretary and whenever I meet the representatives of a relevant country, I will repeat our message.I did just that when I saw the Japanese foreign minister, Taro Kono, here in London earlier this month. Japan has a large domestic ivory market and its government could play a key role in stamping out elephant poaching.I've instructed our diplomats in embassies across the world to have frank conversations with our friends and allies.The slow death of Africa's elephants is a disaster that proceeds from other disasters. Poaching is but one tentacle of the octopus of corruption, trafficking and gun-running that suffocates states and holds back national economies across Africa and Asia. If China now deprives the ivory poachers of their biggest global market, then the whole edifice of trans-national organised crime will be weakened.Africa's elephants face many other threats besides poaching. Year after year, their habitat is lost or degraded. They are locked in a struggle for land and water with rising human populations. Yet with determination and goodwill, I have no doubt that we can solve these problems - just as we are acting to curtail the ivory trade - and ensure that our great grandchildren share our planet with elephants.Load-Date: December 29, 2017End of Document

The leadership of China has blocked image sharing and voice chatting services of Whatsapp, but just a day before, the country also blocked the use of Facebook's Messenger.Chinese service providers took this stern step after observing censorship of information, traffic manipulation and continuous monitoring of databases. On 19th September, Chinese authorities made Whatsapp inaccessible.

This event will also mark the commencement of President Xi Jinping's second regime of rulership.Whatsapp has yet not replied to the current situation and it is likely that a policy statement will be made by Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg has tried several times to re-enter the Chinese market of social media and other digital divisions but the national policy of China has hampered any such attempts made. The resolve of Facebook's founder can be seen from the fact that he is learning Mandarin Chinese.

Here's how Tim Cook explained why removing apps in China is not like helping the FBI hack iPhones (AAPL)Business Insider USAugust 1, 2017 Tuesday 09:04 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 390 wordsByline: aoreskovic@businessinsider.com,  (Alexei Oreskovic)Highlight: Tim Cook defended Apple's decision to stop offering some VPN app, which let Chinese users circumvent the country's internet restrictions.BodyAPApple CEO Tim Cook on Tuesday defended his company's decision to stop offering special apps that let Chinese users circumvent the country's internet restrictions.The recent removal of some VPN apps from Apple's App Store in China has prompted criticism, with some accusing Apple of bowing to pressure from Beijing and placing its business interests above its values.VPN, or virtual private network, apps allow users to connect directly and securely to the internet, bypassing the filters that the Chinese government uses to block certain sites (including Google, YouTube, and Facebook).Apple's anti-VPN moveseemed at odds with the image it has sought to create for itself as a champion of freedom and privacy. In 2016, the company famously battled with the US FBI, refusing to help law-enforcement officials unlock an iPhone that belonged to one of the suspects in the December 2015 terror attack in San Bernardino, California, that killed 14 people.Is there a double-standard?Not at all, said Cook.Cook was asked about Apple's VPN move in China during the post-earnings conference call on Tuesday. He said that Apple was simply responding to stepped-up enforcement of Chinese regulations that require anyone operating a VPN to have a license from the government. He noted that the App Store still offered "hundreds" of VPN apps from developers based outside of China and that Apple's philosophy always involves "engaging" with governments it doesn't agree with.Here's why Cook said Apple's actions in China are not inconsistent with its values or its policies in the US:"Some folks have tried to link it to the US situation last year. They're very different. In the case of the US, the law in the US supported us. It was very clear. In the case of China, the law is also very clear there. Like we would if the US changed the law here, we would have to abide by it in both cases. That doesn't mean that we don't state our point of view in the appropriate way. We always do that."NOW WATCH: Amazon has an oddly efficient way of storing stuff in its warehousesSee Also:• Apple folds to China's demands• 6 things to watch out for in Apple's earnings today• Some analysts doubt the Chinese will pay $1,000 for 'iPhone 8' when they spend most of their time in WeChatSEE ALSO: Apple stock surges to all-time high as forecast hints at strong sales boostLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

CHINA DETAINS FIVE MORE ETHNIC KAZAKHS OVER 'ETHNIC HATRED', 'TERRORIST' CONTENTStates News ServiceDecember 19, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 762 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Chinese authorities in the northwestern region of Xinjiang have detained five ethnic minority Kazakhs for disseminating "terrorist audio and video" online.A 37-year old Kazakh from Shihezi city, under the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, surnamed Wu was held under administrative detention on Nov. 1 for possessing "terrorist video" materials on a cell phone, while a Kazakh surnamed Zhu, 31, was held in the seat of Kumul (in Chinese, Hami) prefecture on Nov. 6 for "making comments that promote ethnic divisions," the regional branch of the Cyberspace Administration said in a statement on Monday.A Kazakh identified only as A, age 26, and a Kazakh surnamed Ye, 36, were both detained in Sanji (Changji) city, in Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture, under administrative sentences, which can be handed down by police for up to 15 days without a trial, for "incitement to ethnic hatred" with comments on WeChat.And a Kazakh surnamed Tuo, 26, from Altay (Aletai) prefecture was detained on identical charges over comments posted on WeChat.Regional officials recently investigated 10 similar cases in which suspects were detained for "promoting, storing and disseminating text, images, audio and video related to terrorist violence, religious extremism, ethnic separatism and false rumors," the Cyberspace Administration said."Police have investigated and punished the relevant personnel in accordance with the law," it said.Six Uyghurs were also detained on similar charges, apparently included from an earlier statement from the Cyberspace Administration that was reported by RFA in November.Beijing blames some Uyghurs for a string of violent attacks and clashes in China in recent years, but critics say the government has exaggerated the threat from the ethnic group, and that repressive domestic policies are responsible for violence that has left hundreds dead since 2009.China regularly conducts "strike hard" campaigns in Xinjiang, including police raids on Uyghur households, restrictions on Islamic practices, and curbs on the culture and language of the Uyghur people.The government has detained large numbers of Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other ethnic minorities simply for posting religious videos not approved by officials, or for possessing Qurans, prayer mats and traditional clothing, all of which have been described as evidence of "extremism" by Chinese police in recent months.Sources estimate that Chinese authorities in Xinjiang have detained hundreds of ethnic Kazakhs in recent months, freezing their bank accounts and assets pending "investigation," also for "extremist" behavior that includes normal Islamic practices.'Monopoly on information'Dilxat Raxit, spokesman for the World Uyghur Congress exile group, said the aim of the anti-terror campaign appears to be to frighten ethnic minority groups away from using the internet at all."The Chinese government is using oppressive methods such as detention, arrest and other punishments to frighten Uyghurs away from the internet," Raxit said. "Their aim is to achieve a total government monopoly on the flow of information.""At the same time, they are using these detentions as a form of high-profile propaganda to scare people away from using the internet to protect their legitimate rights," he said.Local sources told RFA that many more people have been detained than has been reported by official news outlets.Both Kazakhs and ethnic minority Uyghurs are being detained in "political study centers" in unprecedented numbers across the region.The camps are formally known as "Professional Education Schools," and are renamed versions of the "Counter-extremism Training Schools," that once dotted the region, sources have told RFA's Uyghur Service.The camps are in operation throughout Xinjiang and contain detainees from the Uyghur, Kyrgyz and Kazakh communitiesall Turkic-speaking, mostly Muslim minorities in Chinaunder policies introduced by hardline Xinjiang Communist Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, sources have said.Last month, Chinese authorities in Burultokay (Fuhai) county in Xinjiang's Altay prefecture, handed down a 16-and-a-half-year jail term to ethnic Kazakh official Manat Hamit on ethnic hatred charges, after finding audio files of Quranic recitations on his computer in April.He was initially accused of "disseminating terrorism-related audiovisual material," and "incitement to racial hatred and to racial discrimination."Reported by Qiao Long for RFA's Mandarin Service.

Trump blocks sale of U.S. tech firm to China, citing national security concernsUPISeptember 13, 2017 Wednesday 10:01 PM ESTCopyright 2017 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 370 wordsByline: RAY DOWNSDateline: Dec. 31 BodyIn a rare decision, President  blocked the sale of a U.S. tech company to a Chinese firm Wednesday due to security concerns.Trump issued an order preventing the $1.3 billion sale of Portland, Ore.-based Lattice Semiconductor Corp. to Canyon Bridge Capital Partners, which the White House described as a "Chinese corporation owned by Chinese state-owned entities that manages industrial investments and venture capital."Citing the Defense Production Act of 1950 as amended by the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007, a White House statement said the reason for the block was the "national-security risk posed by the transaction relates to, among other things, the potential transfer of intellectual property to the foreign acquirer, the Chinese government's role in supporting this transaction, the importance of semiconductor supply chain integrity to the United States Government, and the use of Lattice products by the United States Government."In a statement, Canyon Bridge said it was disappointed in Trump's decision to "forgo what we believe to be an excellent deal for Lattice's shareholders and its employees by expanding the opportunity to keep jobs in America," according to CNBC.And Lattice CEO Darin Billerbeck said the blocked deal "was in the best interests of our shareholders, our customers, our employees and the United States."According to Bloomberg, Lattice makes programmable logic chips, which are often used for industrial and military purposes. And the company does a great deal of business in Asia, generating about 70 percent of its sales there.Although it is rare for a U.S. president to block the sale of a U.S. firm to a foreign country, it isn't unprecedented. Former Presidents  and  each blocked sales -- all to Chinese entities, reported BBC.But the Trump administration also appears to be taking a tougher stance on business deals between the United States and China.In April, the Commerce Department announced it was investigating whether steel imports from China, leading to speculation that Trump might enforce heavy tariffs on Chinese steel. And in August, Trump signed an executive memorandum ordering an investigation into alleged intellectual property theft by China.Load-Date: September 14, 2017End of Document

US risks losing artificial intelligence arms race to China and RussiaCNN WireNovember 29, 2017 Wednesday 1:57 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1296 wordsByline: By Zachary Cohen, CNNDateline: WASHINGTON (CNN) BodyWASHINGTON (CNN) --  More than 60 years after a space race rivalry with the Soviet Union ushered in a new era of ballistic missile development, the US is facing another "Sputnik moment" amid a rapidly escalating international competition over artificial intelligence, according to former Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work. The idea that rapid advances in artificial intelligence will define the next generation of warfare -- a concept known as the "Third Offset Strategy" -- was first articulated by former Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel in 2014.Possible AI applications for the military include: creating more nimble systems, possibly at lower cost; developing more effective training systems; software that processes mountains of data from surveillance systems or for "pattern-of-life" surveillance; improved facial recognition capabilities; war games support and automated combat in so-called manned-unmanned operations, according to a September report from the RAND Corporation. But a new report published Wednesday and provided exclusively to CNN by Work and Govini, a data and analytics firm that conducts government analysis, warns that the US military must now decide if it wants to "lead the coming revolution, or fall victim to it" amid emerging challenges from China and Russia. "This stark choice will be determined by the degree to which the Department of Defense (DoD) recognizes the revolutionary military potential of AI and advanced autonomous systems," the report said.Specifically, the White House and Pentagon must determine the extent to which the US will ramp up research and development in technologies associated with artificial intelligence -- including advanced computing, artificial neural networks, big data, machine learning, unmanned systems and robotics, it said. The US must also determine a national strategy for how aggressively it will develop new systems, operational concepts and organizational constructs that exploit artificial intelligence advancements in warfare, according to the report.An important part of that strategy relates to "autonomy" which results "from delegation of a decision to an authorized entity to take action within specific boundaries," Work told CNN. The technologyWhile critics have often warned against the development of autonomous offensive weaponry for fear of losing operational control, Work told CNN that the US pursuit of "narrow AI" will always prioritize human control but allow the machine to "independently compose and select among different courses of action to accomplish assigned goals based on its knowledge and understanding of the world, itself, and the situation.""They are worried about the Terminator, but the US view is more like the Iron Man," Work said in reference to the Marvel superhero who is a man equipped with a powerful and adaptable suit of armor. The US has already begun to apply elements of AI to military platforms and strategy -- a move perhaps no more evident than in its investment in the $400 billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Combining an array of sensors and software used to quickly collect data and interpret data, the F-35 "is the key example of human elaboration," Work told CNN. "It sucks up data and portrays that to the pilot in a way they couldn't have done on their own," he added, calling the aircraft a "perfect example of human-machine collaboration" that should be applied to other military platforms. But despite some success in implementing AI technology to date, Work told CNN that he does not "don't believe our national response is nearly good enough to this point."The raceBoth China and Russia have recently highlighted the importance of artificial intelligence to the future of the global economy and military power. Speaking to students during a national "open lesson" in September, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the country that takes the lead in the sphere of computer-based artificial intelligence will rule."Artificial intelligence is the future not only of Russia but of all of mankind," said Putin. "There are huge opportunities, but also threats that are difficult to foresee today."The words of the Russian President echo what scientists in Russia and around the world have been mulling over for quite some time.Work on developing drones and vehicles for military and civilian usage is well under way in Russia, according to state media.The Russian military is also developing robots, anti-drone systems, and cruise missiles that would be able to analyze radars and make decisions on the altitude, speed and direction of their flight, according to state media.And in July, the Chinese government published a detailed road map outlining a national plan to prioritize the development and application of AI -- a move Work said he considers a "Sputnik moment.""Artificial intelligence has become the new focus of international competition. Artificial intelligence is the strategic technology that leads the future," the Chinese government publication said."The major developed countries in the world regard the development of artificial intelligence as a major strategy to enhance their national competitiveness and safeguard their national security," it added. China's hopes to lead the world in AI technologies by directly linking defense and commercial development. The fundingWhile DOD and Silicon Valley have recently invested in AI research and development, relying on American commercial research and development is not going to be enough, according to Work.The US has lacked a clear plan to keep pace with foreign rivals despite predictions that AI "has the potential to be a transformative national security technology, on a par with nuclear weapons, aircraft, computers, and biotech," according to a recent study by Greg Allen of Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International studies. But according to Work and Govini, Wednesday's report aims to help build the foundation of a national response to, what they view, as a clear challenge by foreign powers. By providing an analysis of government spending on key components of AI between 2012 and 2017, the report provides guidance for defense leaders and the White House on how the US should respond to challenges from China and others, Work said.And while the report generally concludes that DOD is "putting its money where its mouth is" when it comes to the Third Offset Strategy, Work told CNN that there is still "a long way to go."The report's analysis of unclassified government spending on AI over the last five years indicates that DOD is focusing on collecting data and applying it to two primary components of the offset strategy: virtual reality (simulations and training technology) and computer vision (the data that tells a system what to strike and not to strike). While important foundational elements of artificial intelligence, the US must begin to prioritize measures toward applying those advancements toward mission concepts, according to Matt Hummer of Govini. DOD should increase its investment in "advanced computing" technology -- which represents the lynchpin for broader application -- and analytical technology -- which is used to display information to a human operator, he said.Further development of the Cloud -- a critical part of increasing processing speed -- is also an area the US should emphasize, he said. Ultimately, an emphasis on prioritizing artificial intelligence spending is going to "require a national response led from the White House," according to Work. "This is designed, I hope, to not only help DOD leaders to think about what to invest in but help the White House to think about broad contours of a national response," he said.TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Trump speaks with Macron amid mounting tensions with North KoreaCNN.comAugust 11, 2017 Friday 4:37 PM ESTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 1110 wordsByline: By Dan Merica, Jeremy Diamond and Melissa Gray, CNNBodyUS President Donald Trump called the French President Saturday amid mounting tensions with North Korea the day after he said he was considering further economic sanctions against the rogue nation.In a call Trump had with President Emmanuel Macron of France, the two discussed "the need to confront the increasingly dangerous situation associated with North Korea's destabilizing and escalatory behavior," according to a White House readout of the call.During the call, both leaders discussed working with allies to enforce United Nations sanctions and denuclearize the Korean Peninsula, the statement said.Earlier Saturday, Macron issued a statement voicing his "concern at the ballistic and nuclear threat coming from North Korea," adding that the international community should work with Pyongyang to "resume the path of dialogue without conditions."Macron said France and other UN Security Council members want North Korea to "proceed with the complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement of its nuclear and ballistic programs."Trump has also contacted the leader of China and the governor of Guam. Japan, meanwhile, deployed the PAC-3 land-based missile interception system to four different locations.Guam Gov. Eddie Baza Calvo, on the US territory in an area of the Pacific that North Korea has threatened to strike with missiles, said he spoke with Trump and chief of staff John Kelly, and he posted audio of the call on Facebook."Both assured me that the people of Guam are safe," Calvo wrote. "In the President's words they are behind us '1,000 percent.' As the head of the Government of Guam, I appreciate their reassurances that my family, my friends, everyone on this island, are all safe."North Korea's estimated splashdown of missiles aimed toward Guam would place them just outside Guam's 12-nautical-mile territorial waters. Guam's Homeland Security adviser, George Charfauros, said Friday it would take 14 minutes for a missile fired from North Korea to reach Guam.In Japan, the defense ministry deployed the missile interception system to military bases in four prefectures, video from the four locations showed Saturday.The prefectures sit in a line between North Korea and Guam. Pyongyang identified three of the prefectures as the regions over which its missiles would fly on the way toward the US territory.Meanwhile, Trump stood by his bellicose rhetoric on North Korea on Friday, saying leader Kim Jong Un "will truly regret it and he will regret it fast" if he issues an overt threat or attacks Guam or a US ally."This man will not get away with what he is doing," Trump told reporters. "If he utters one threat in the form of an overt threat ... or if he does anything with respect to Guam, or any place else that is an American territory or an American ally, he will truly regret it and he will regret it fast."Trump told reporters on Friday that the US is considering additional sanctions against North Korea "at a very, very high level.""Very strong ones. They are already very strong," he said. "We are considering additional sanctions at a very, very high level. And probably you could say as strong as they get."It is unclear what stepped up sanctions against the North Korea would look like.Trump calls ChinaChinese President Xi Jinping called for restraint during a phone call Saturday with Trump over the escalating tensions with North Korea.Trump has urged the Chinese government to exert more pressure on the North Korean regime, with little success.Trump getting ready to go after China on tradeDuring the call, Trump also informed Xi that he plans to direct his administration on Monday to investigate Chinese trade practices, a senior administration official told CNN.North Korea threatsSaber-rattling from North Koreas has dominated Trump's 17-day working vacation in New Jersey. When asked about the ratcheted-up rhetoric in recent weeks between the US and North Korea, Trump said there are good options on the table for dealing with the tensions, but also some bad ones."Hopefully it will all work out," Trump said before the call with Xi. "Nobody loves a peaceful solution better than President Trump, that I can tell you. But this has been going on for many years. Would have been a lot easier to solve this years ago, before they were in the position they are in."But we will see what happens. We think that lots of good things could happen and we also could have a bad solution."Trump called Xi after meeting with US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Bedminster.Earlier in the day, Trump issued a warning to North Korea."I hope they are going to fully understand the gravity of what I said. And what I said is what I mean," Trump said, adding that the significance of his words was "pretty obvious" and his administration is looking "very carefully" at possible future actions against North Korea.Foreign policy and national security experts have raised questions about Trump's threatening response to North Korea, noting that past administrations have tried to avoid the President commenting on North Korea's threats in order to avoid giving them credibility.Trump dismissed the criticism Friday, saying the only reason they are critical of his response is "because it's me.""If somebody else uttered the exact same words that I uttered they would say what a great statement, what a wonderful statement," Trump said, adding that there are "tens of millions of people in this country that are so happy with what I am saying."Neighboring powers urge restraintTrump's rhetoric and North Korea's response have unsettled powers in the Asia-Pacific region, with some scrambling to respond to the escalation of tensions.Neighboring powers urged restraint. Russia called on the Trump administration to keep calm, and Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told state media that his country was working with China on a "double freezing" plan to address the threat."Kim Jong Un freezes any nuclear tests and any missile launches -- we mean ballistic missiles -- and the US and South Korea freeze large-scale military exercises," Lavrov said, adding that North Korea regularly uses the drills to justify its missile tests and nuclear program.Other foreign leaders raised questions about whether there was a military option in North Korea. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Friday that "an escalation of rhetoric will not contribute to a solution" of the conflict in North Korea."I do not see a military solution to this conflict," she added.Trump praised Merkel on Friday as a "very good person," but said she was speaking for Germany, not the United States.Load-Date: August 13, 2017End of Document

State Department Conducts Daily Press Briefing, Sept. 28Targeted News ServiceSeptember 28, 2017 Thursday 4:10 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 9348 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Department of State issued the following transcript of the daily press briefing by spokesperson Heather Nauert:TRANSCRIPT:2:49 p.m. EDTMS NAUERT: Hi, everybody.QUESTION: Hello.MS NAUERT: How are you today?QUESTION: All right.MS NAUERT: Hi. Hey, Josh. All right, another packed day. It seems like they just keep getting busier and busier.So I want to start by telling you a little bit about a terrific dialogue and engagement that we held today, earlier today at the State Department. Secretary Rex Tillerson and the Chinese Vice Premier Liu Yandong chaired the first U.S.-China Social and Cultural Dialogue here at the State Department today. That dialogue focused on advancing cooperation in seven areas: education, social development, science and technology, health, subnational, arts and culture, and environment and conservation. The two sides committed to safeguarding global health security and support for educational exchanges, particularly the U.S.-China Fulbright Program. The Secretary advocated for access of foreign media to Chinese audiences.Later today, Secretary Tillerson will travel to China to meet with Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the State Councilor Yang Jiechi - pardon me - and President Xi Jinping. The Secretary will discuss a range of issues focusing on the President's planned travel to the region, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, also trade and investment.In addition to that - this is building on Secretary of Commerce Ross's visit earlier this week - we're working with China to rebalance our trade and our lopsided relationship in that realm and ensure that China provides fair treatment to U.S. companies in ways that create U.S. jobs. Secretary Tillerson's visit to China reaffirms the administration's commitment to further broaden and enhance U.S. economic and security interests in the Asia Pacific region.On Wednesday, at the direction of Secretary Tillerson, Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, they will host the Law Enforcement and Cybersecurity Dialogue. That's next week. It will be co-chaired by Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke on the U.S. side, and State Councilor and Minister of Public Security Guo Shengkun on the Chinese side. They will talk about increasing cooperation on repatriations, fugitives, counternarcotics, and also cyber crime. With the conclusion of the Law Enforcement Cybersecurity Dialogue, the first round of the four cabinet-level dialogues agreed to by President 3 9/28/2017Trump and President Xi at Mar-a-Lago in April, will have been completed. The Diplomatic and Security Dialogue and the Comprehensive Economic Dialogue were held in June and July respectively.That was a mouthful. So we were very happy to have welcomed them today.In addition to that, I wanted to mention something about Puerto Rico today. We have seen some false reporting coming out from some members of the news media today, so I wanted to take a moment to clarify things. Reports that the State Department is evacuating U.S. citizens and charging Puerto Ricans for evacuation flights are false. The State Department is not facilitating evacuations from Puerto Rico. Reports that the State Department is confiscating U.S. passports of Puerto Ricans is also false.Let's go back to geography class, folks. Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory. Here at the State Department, we work with international countries, and therefore we are not involved in this. The State Department is not an agency in charge of relief efforts there, and for questions about relief efforts in Puerto Rico, I would refer you to FEMA. They have the lead on this.I'd also like to thank those of you who called us to check the facts earlier today. We received phone calls, so we certainly appreciate that. We are always happy to help track those down and try to get you the information on a timely basis. So thank you very much.And with that, I will take your questions.QUESTION: Just a - just on that.MS NAUERT: Yeah.QUESTION: When you do - when you are part of an evacuation from a foreign country, people do have to reimburse the government for their flights, don't they? I mean, that's always been the case in the past.MS NAUERT: In some --QUESTION: It hasn't changed, has it?MS NAUERT: Yeah. Since 1956, when we have assisted with the evacuations - and that's not something that happens all the time, but when the State Department has assisted with evacuations, we are required by law - again, this does not pertain to Puerto Rico. But in the past instances with Irma, for example, we would then seek reimbursement to the maximum extent practicable for evacuation services provided to private U.S. citizens.There are some times when we do not do that. An example of that would be there was a certain window of time during two hurricanes from Sint Maarten, and that is when the Secretary waived those fees. So Americans were not asked to pay those fees in that particular incident. We were trying to get as many people out as quickly as possible in between two storms. But I want to assure you that no one will be denied assistance because they cannot produce a checkbook or a credit card. Again, this only applies to international places. 4 9/28/2017QUESTION: Right, right. So - but - and in those cases, do they have to actually surrender a passport?MS NAUERT: Not to my knowledge. I've never heard of surrendering a passport.Okay. I'm getting the nod now. Okay.QUESTION: One more question on that.MS NAUERT: Yes.QUESTION: So are you saying that people in Puerto Rico are not even being asked to sign these promissory notes, and they're not - the answer --MS NAUERT: I can only speak --QUESTION: Or is it just that State is not part of this?MS NAUERT: I can only speak to the State Department. In terms of the State Department, the State Department - and I want to be clear - is not evacuating anyone from Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory. FEMA may be doing other things, and if you have any questions about that, then I would refer you to FEMA. Okay?QUESTION: Right. So can we move to - where do I want to go? Oh, right. Cuba.MS NAUERT: Yes.QUESTION: Do you have any update on the review of what to do about the embassy or your staffing levels there, and anything more on the investigation into the incidents?MS NAUERT: Sure. As many of you know, we met earlier this week with the minister of foreign affairs and his delegation here at the State Department. That was a meeting that was held at their request. We were more than happy to have that meeting and to be able to ask questions and have a dialogue with the Cuban delegation.I would describe the conversation between Secretary Tillerson and his counterparts as firm and frank. The Secretary continued to express his profound concern for Americans who are employed by the U.S. embassy in Havana.Many of you have had questions in recent days about the timing of any potential announcements in terms of whether or not we change staffing levels or whatever. I just want to let you know that the Secretary is reviewing all of his options. We are reviewing how to best protect our American personnel.In terms of the investigation, the FBI has the lead on that investigation. We have a lot of conversations and dialogue with the FBI and other agencies that are a part of this investigation, and that has not been concluded just yet. 5 9/28/2017One other note. I just want to let you know that the Secretary has been monitoring this very closely. We have had a lot of meetings here at the State Department from - with various bureaus and people weighing in. The safety and security of our folks who are serving the United States down there is our top concern.QUESTION: So related - just related to that.MS NAUERT: Yes.QUESTION: It seems to have crept into some kind of conventional wisdom that you are now - have determined that 25 Americans were - instead of the 21 which you have repeatedly confirmed and denied the 25. And yet the 25 continues to appear in a variety of reports.MS NAUERT: It does.QUESTION: Is there a reason for that? Or is it - is it still wrong?MS NAUERT: Here's what I - here's what I can tell you. We have had - and I want to be clear about this as well - 21 medically confirmed cases. We have always been clear about saying that number could certainly change. We have people who are undergoing medical evaluations. People's symptoms have changed, and some of them are different from one another. So they continue to undergo medical evaluations. I certainly hope that no one else is diagnosed, for lack of a better word, by the medical community. We certainly hope that that won't be the case. But if that changes, I've always been very forthcoming in bringing you the numbers as we get them as we can confirm them.QUESTION: Last one --MS NAUERT: Yeah.QUESTION: Just to put a fine - just to put a fine --QUESTION: On that point --QUESTION: Hold on. This is on that point. Right now --MS NAUERT: Yes.QUESTION: All you can confirm is 21?MS NAUERT: Correct.QUESTION: The 25 figure that's out there is just wrong?MS NAUERT: I have no idea - I have no idea where the number 25 came from.QUESTION: It's wrong. Right? 6 9/28/2017MS NAUERT: All of the briefings I have sat in with our top people have all indicated 21 is the number. However, that number could certainly change as we continue to evaluate our U.S. staff who served down there.QUESTION: Twenty-one diagnosed cases.MS NAUERT: Twenty-one medically confirmed.QUESTION: Confirmed incidents related to the sonic --MS NAUERT: That they've - I'm not characterizing it that way. That's your word. That's not mine. Twenty-one medically confirmed to have experienced health effects.QUESTION: Directly related to the same specific incident?MS NAUERT: We don't - we don't know what it was. We don't know who's done it. We've been very clear about that from the beginning.QUESTION: No, but I'm not - I'm saying, like, there could be more than 21 people who have reported kind of health symptoms that you believe are unrelated?MS NAUERT: Elise --QUESTION: But when you say 21, do you mean they're all related to the same --MS NAUERT: There are a lot of questions that we still have. That's why we have such a vigorous investigation that is underway. We have the best medical professionals here on the mainland helping our people and helping with the evaluations. Those evaluations are ongoing last I had heard, which was just a few hours ago. Twenty-one people have been medically confirmed to have experienced health effects. Okay.QUESTION: Why two months since this has been - this has been reported for the past two months and so on? Why does it remain such a mystery? And since this was your first meeting with the foreign minister of Cuba, did they in any way explain what's going on, or did they come clean? How did they respond to all these inquiries?MS NAUERT: I wish I could get - I wish I could get into some of that conversation with you. Unfortunately, I cannot. We had the conversation with them. We made it very clear Cuba has a responsibility, as does every country that hosts U.S. and other officials where we have posts, they have a responsibility to ensure that our embassy personnel are kept safe. That's under the Vienna Convention. That obviously was not done. Our people were certainly put in a very precarious situation. And let me again just say the safety and security of our folks is our top concern.Anything else on Cuba?QUESTION: You said -- 7 9/28/2017QUESTION: So it sounds --MS NAUERT: Go ahead.QUESTION: Go ahead.MS NAUERT: Hi, Michele.QUESTION: It sounds like in the investigation and in terms of you leaning even one way or another as to what this was - was it an attack or not? Who did it? It doesn't sound like it's moved in any way or --MS NAUERT: I can't say that. I cannot speak to the investigation. I cannot speak to the details of the investigation. I'm not one of the investigators. That is held - handled by a separate agency, separate group of folks, so I'm not able to answer your questions about that. And even if I did have the answers to that, I probably wouldn't be able to bring it to you, because we don't know who is responsible; we don't know what is responsible. We want to bring in all the facts and have those facts sussed out before I can bring it to anybody. Okay?QUESTION: Iraq.QUESTION: But there's - I mean, you must have concerns that this could - because you don't know what this was even or who did this, this could potentially happen to any diplomat anywhere.MS NAUERT: We have never seen this anyplace in the world before. As far as we know, this is just something that's limited to Cuba.QUESTION: Heather, can you confirm it? You said people or person --MS NAUERT: Go ahead.QUESTION: -- were put in danger, past tense. Are you sure that the incidents have stopped?MS NAUERT: The last incident that has been reported was in August, okay?QUESTION: And I know none since then, but are you confident that there will be no more future incidents?MS NAUERT: I - goodness, I would certainly hope not. I would certainly hope not.QUESTION: But you can't rule that out?MS NAUERT: We are working hard to try to get to the bottom of this. We've tried to extend every possible assistance available to our people, who are amazingly serving in Cuba, despite the situation. And frankly, a lot of our folks really want to be down there. They are happy and proud of the work that they're doing. And despite these concerns, our folks are still doing their jobs every day. 8 9/28/2017QUESTION: I'm just wondering if people still want to work down there and serve down there.MS NAUERT: Yeah.QUESTION: And you're not aware of any - well, obviously not aware of any future incidents. No idea what's really happening. But what does drawing down the diplomatic presence achieve?MS NAUERT: I have - there is - I don't have anything to announce for you on that, okay?QUESTION: And based --MS NAUERT: If that changes, I will let you know.QUESTION: Based on this last high-level conversation, you're still calling this an incident, right?MS NAUERT: I do. Yeah.QUESTION: It's not appropriate to call it an attack, or is it?MS NAUERT: Look, I prefer to call it an incident, because we still do not know what the cause was and we don't know who's responsible for it.QUESTION: Can you tell us anything about the investigation, like how many FBI agents may be down there?MS NAUERT: Did you just walk in here? Michele just asked me that same question --QUESTION: Oh. (Laughter.)MS NAUERT: -- about the investigation. Hi, Carol.QUESTION: Sorry. I misheard. (Laughter.)MS NAUERT: (Laughter.) No. The answer is no, I can't tell you anything about the investigation, okay? If I can, I'll certainly bring it to you.QUESTION: Iraq?QUESTION: Heather, this might be a way to get at what --MS NAUERT: Okay. Go ahead. Hi, Josh.QUESTION: -- Elise was asking about. Can you offer any insight into what criteria the State Department is using to determine if a diplomat in Havana comes forward and says, "I have a headache," whether that is a medically confirmed incident versus just a headache or an unrelated physical ailment? 9 9/28/2017MS NAUERT: We have - when I say we have top medical staff - people, not staff working for us, but people elsewhere - who are involved in this at different medical facilities in the United States. In addition, we have a medical representative there on the ground in Cuba, who's there 24/7. We also have a bureau here that's our medical bureau. So they're all involved in tracking this. In terms of the kinds of tests that people are going - I just can't speak --QUESTION: I just have a question --MS NAUERT: I can't speak to that part.QUESTION: If you - given that you don't know what is causing this, how could it be that you could medically confirm that these cases are or are not related?MS NAUERT: I think that's a question for the medical staff, and a lot of that would just be confidential. I'm sorry. I don't have anything for you on that.QUESTION: Heather --MS NAUERT: Okay.QUESTION: -- Tuesday's meeting with the foreign minister.MS NAUERT: Yes.QUESTION: The Cuban Government called this meeting. It was scheduled, I believe, for a half hour. It went much longer than that. Why did they say they scheduled the meeting? Did they come with information? Did they come trying to avoid any type of U.S. reprisals, to insist that they weren't doing anything? Why were they here?MS NAUERT: I don't want to ascribe any motivations to that - their request for the meeting. We have had conversations with them on the ground in Cuba, and I know they were heading back to Cuba from New York, from having been at the United Nations, and so they stopped down here to have a conversation with us.QUESTION: And they're investigating this in conjunction with the FBI?MS NAUERT: Well, look, any country would have to basically sign off on U.S. investigators being on the ground. So when I've talked about their cooperation, they gave us and our investigators the permission to head to that country to conduct investigations. Okay? Lets --QUESTION: So did the meeting yesterday further that cooperation, or did it kind of put - make it harder to continue --MS NAUERT: I'm not going to characterize that. I'm just going to say the meeting was frank and firm, and we had a - it was good to have a chat. Okay?QUESTION: A grand old time.MS NAUERT: Yes. Yeah. 10 9/28/2017QUESTION: By saying that, that sounds --MS NAUERT: Let's move on from Cuba. I don't have anything more for you on Cuba.QUESTION: One more. But one more.MS NAUERT: As I have more information for you on Cuba, I will bring it to you, okay?QUESTION: Can we just get your reaction to one - there was one report that said the U.S. had ruled out that Cuba was responsible. Can you confirm or deny that?MS NAUERT: When I say that the investigation is ongoing --QUESTION: So you haven't ruled anyone out.MS NAUERT: -- the investigation is ongoing.QUESTION: Okay. Thank you.MS NAUERT: Let me leave it at that.QUESTION: Iraq.MS NAUERT: Okay. Let's move on. Okay. Let's move on to Iraq.QUESTION: As you know, a couple of days after the Kurdistan referendum, the relations between Baghdad and Erbil is getting complicated, as you and many others expected. Kurdistan now is almost besieged by Turkey, Iran, and Iraq, and there is a feeling among the people in Kurdistan that the United States is keeping silent and that's - means giving the green light to Iraq to do whatever they want to do.MS NAUERT: "Keeping silent" would be a mischaracterization of the U.S. position on this. We have been very clear from the beginning that we oppose that referendum because we thought it would be destabilizing. As we see some of these reports in the media, unfortunately, that has been borne out. This is destabilizing. We want Kurdistan - we want the Kurds, we want Iraq - the central government of Iraq to remain focused on the fight against ISIS. We have concerns that this will take the focus off the fight against ISIS.That being said, I want to be very cautious about inflaming tensions. We understand the concerns that many in the region have, and the United States Government doesn't want to do anything to inflame tensions in that arena. We want to avoid anything that would contribute to any additional instability.QUESTION: So does that mean that --QUESTION: So you are not part of any dialogue currently between Baghdad and Erbil? So there is no dialogue, but are you not working on -- 11 9/28/2017MS NAUERT: Well, we've had lots of conversations, both with Erbil and with Baghdad as well. The Secretary had conversations with both of his counterparts over the past few days. I have said this, and we've talked about this. You and I talked about this, right? The United States, if asked, would be willing to help facilitate a conversation between the two, but I want to be clear about that: if asked.If we are asked to assist in any way - look, we're friends with the Kurds; we are friends with the central government of Iraq. We have fought - our American forces have fought side by side with your folks, okay? We want to have a stable, unified Iraq. We want that more than anything. We want ISIS out of Iraq. We want to see them decimated and to never wreak terror on your communities again.QUESTION: One more thing on that.MS NAUERT: Yes.QUESTION: That's just the Iraqi Government - it seems that the parliament asking the Iraqi Government to ask all of the foreign consulates and representatives in Erbil to close. Have you received any warning or any message from the Iraqi Government to close your embassy?MS NAUERT: Our embassy - our consulate, rather, in Erbil remains open.QUESTION: Can I follow this, Heather?MS NAUERT: Okay? I'm not aware of any requests on the part of --QUESTION: Heather --QUESTION: One more on that --QUESTION: One more on that. Heather --MS NAUERT: Okay. Hold on, hold on.QUESTION: Sorry.MS NAUERT: Hi, Elise.QUESTION: Will you - okay, so you said that this was a destabilizing vote.MS NAUERT: Yeah.QUESTION: You don't agree with it. Does that mean that you will not recognize an independent Kurdistan?MS NAUERT: That would be a hypothetical situation.QUESTION: Why? If you didn't think it was a good idea for them to vote on independence -- 12 9/28/2017MS NAUERT: Yeah.QUESTION: -- then how is that not --MS NAUERT: Our relationship with the Kurds, in our view, will not change. Okay?QUESTION: Would you like to see the referendum nullified?MS NAUERT: I don't know that that's - I don't know that that's a --QUESTION: Is that doable? Is that --MS NAUERT: I'm not familiar with the law or the specifics under which this was held, so I'm hesitant to get into that kind of a hypothetical.Hi.QUESTION: You said the Secretary has talking to Iraq and Kurdistan.MS NAUERT: Yes.QUESTION: Was that after the referendum or before?MS NAUERT: In the days before. I'm not aware if he's had any conversations with them since, and he's now on his way to Beijing.QUESTION: And don't you have any reaction to what Kurdistan considers a collective punishment, the suspension of the flights? Almost all the airlines have canceled their flights for tomorrow, and we have actually learned from sources within Iran - our network has learned from sources within Iran and Turkey that Iran and Iraq are trying, maybe tonight, to take the border crossings by force. Isn't the United States really doing anything to stop what seems --MS NAUERT: We would oppose any violence, if that were to take place. We want to be very strongly - our voice - we hope our voices will be heard in a very strong fashion that we oppose violence on any side of this. Okay?QUESTION: And just one more question: Turkey, the Turkish Government, has taken a number of Kurdish stations off air, including Rudaw - like, our network. Are you concerned about this decision by the Turkish Government?MS NAUERT: I'm not aware of that. This is the first I've heard of it, so we can certainly look into it and see if I can get you anything on that, okay?Hi, Laurie.QUESTION: The former ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, said today on CNN it was a mistake for the U.S. to come down so hard against the referendum once it was clear it was going to happen and that it probably emboldened Baghdad to take a harsher posture than it otherwise 13 9/28/2017would have. And he also stressed the importance of managing the tensions that now exist in the region. What is your response to that?MS NAUERT: The only thing I will respond to - and I'm always hesitant to respond to other officials or world leaders who specifically have a comment or an opinion on something - but he does bring up - that last point is a valid one, and that is we would like to see some calm on all sides. The United States does not want to do anything that would inflame tensions. That's why I'm going to be very cautious with my words. We will continue to offer our assistance to help facilitate any dialogue, if we are asked. Okay?QUESTION: But "if we are asked" - you have influence in Baghdad; you have influence in Erbil, influence in Ankara. Crocker stressed the importance of the U.S. being proactive on this --MS NAUERT: I think we have been very proactive. We've talked about Iraq and we've talked about this referendum a lot from this briefing room. Okay, let's move on --QUESTION: Just one more?QUESTION: On Iraq?MS NAUERT: Let's move --QUESTION: One more on al-Baghdadi.MS NAUERT: Okay. One more on Iraq. Go ahead.QUESTION: Has the State Department got any response to this apparent message from him - the fact that he's still standing at this point?MS NAUERT: Yeah. Well, first of all, the --QUESTION: Or the possibility that he's still standing.MS NAUERT: -- the tape that was released that is allegedly of Baghdadi, I'm certainly aware of that tape. We have folks who will take a look at it. When I say "we," I don't necessarily mean the State Department. Somebody out there in the U.S. Government is taking a look or a listen at that tape to try to confirm its authenticity. I'm not in the position to confirm the authenticity of that. Okay?QUESTION: Can we go to the Middle East?MS NAUERT: Sure, okay. Are we good? Anything? Okay.QUESTION: Ambassador David Friedman in Israel gave an interview in which he said that only two percent of the West Bank is occupied. Does that reflect the U.S. position?MS NAUERT: So I've also heard about this report, and when you mention that figure of two percent, I don't know where that came from. That came from some report. I have no idea which report that came from. 14 9/28/2017QUESTION: It was in the interview. It came from his --QUESTION: It came from his own mouth.QUESTION: It was from David Friedman's mouth.MS NAUERT: Oh. Okay, okay. I thought he was citing a report or something. Okay, okay. So I'm aware of what he said. His comments - and I want to be crystal clear about this - should not be read as a way to prejudge the outcome of any negotiations that the U.S. would have with the Israelis and the Palestinians. It should also not indicate a shift in U.S. policy.QUESTION: Well, do they reflect - oh. So it does - so his comments by the U.S. ambassador to Israel do not reflect U.S. policy?MS NAUERT: I just want to say it should not be read as a change in U.S. policy.QUESTION: Did he go rogue?QUESTION: This is --QUESTION: So is this --QUESTION: Yeah, yeah. That's --QUESTION: This is at least the second time that from this podium you've had to sort of clean up Ambassador Friedman's remarks when he had upped the alleged occupation. Is this becoming an issue? I mean, even if it's not a change of position, is the perception that the ambassador to Israel has his thumb on the scale in the view of this conflict creating problems for the U.S.?MS NAUERT: I guess what I would say to that is we have some very effective leaders and representatives for the U.S. Government, including Jason Greenblatt, Mr. Kushner, who are spending an awful lot of time in the region trying to get both sides together to have talks about a lasting existence side by side. The President has made that one of his top priorities. And when we talk about top priorities here, we talk about the nuclear threat of North Korea, but also - the nuclear and ballistic missile threat of North Korea, but we also talk about this. And I think it indicates just how important this is to the President that he has put those two in charge of negotiating that.In terms of the ambassador, I can't comment any more for you on that other than to say our policy here has not changed.QUESTION: Well, it sounds --QUESTION: But when you say that - Heather, when you say -- 15 9/28/2017QUESTION: It sounds to me like you're saying - that you're telling - you're telling the Palestinians and the Israelis don't bother listening to the ambassador, listen to Greenblatt and Kushner.MS NAUERT: I have not had the chance to speak to the ambassador, so I will hesitate at commenting too much --QUESTION: I mean, the ambassador spoke --MS NAUERT: Hold on - too much on what he said. I was not there. I have not heard it. I have not heard the context in which that conversation was had. But I just want to be clear that our policy has not changed.QUESTION: Right. But the - but I mean, all that is fair enough, but the problem arises because he is the Senate-confirmed ambassador. Mr. - neither Greenblatt nor Kushner are. They're just informal-type envoys. And ambassadors to every country are supposed to speak for and with the authority of the President of the United States. Do you not see that this is causing confusion?And then as a purely factual matter, how much of - what percent of the West Bank does the United - does the administration believe is occupied?MS NAUERT: I don't know that we have a map of that or that we have --QUESTION: You've got a lot of maps on that.MS NAUERT: Do we have a lot of maps?QUESTION: Oh, yeah.MS NAUERT: Do we?QUESTION: Yes.MS NAUERT: Okay. Well, see, you all pre-date me here. I'll go pull out some --QUESTION: Heather, do you --MS NAUERT: -- the dusty shelves.QUESTION: You have many, many, many, many maps.MS NAUERT: Okay, okay. Said, go right ahead.QUESTION: I want to follow up on something else that he said.MS NAUERT: Yes. 16 9/28/2017QUESTION: He said that the two-state solution has lost its meaning. Is that your position? I mean, this is - it's been the case of past U.S. presidents - I mean U.S. ambassadors in Israel to speak for the State Department and to report directly to the Secretary of State. Has he cleared that with the Secretary of State?MS NAUERT: I under - I understand. The Secretary is on a plane right now. I saw him earlier this morning at the China dialogue. I have not had a chance to talk with him about this.QUESTION: Okay.MS NAUERT: Okay.QUESTION: Can we go back to Ambassador Friedman's current comments --MS NAUERT: Elise, I'm not going to have anything more for you on the ambassador.QUESTION: Okay, but will you - I understand. But you just said that Jason Greenblatt and Jared Kushner are working on this issue.MS NAUERT: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.QUESTION: And then you - or before that, you said that Ambassador Friedman's comments don't reflect a change in policy. So aren't you a bit concerned that the ambassador's comments are detracting or going to harm the efforts by the President's appointed envoys on this issue?MS NAUERT: I think I would go back to the meetings that the President held where the Secretary was last week at the UN, in meeting with Mr. Abbas and meeting with Mr. Netanyahu. And I think they know - I know they know - just how strongly we feel about trying to bring peace, peace to that region.QUESTION: Well, they - the President told him --MS NAUERT: And --QUESTION: -- that last week and that yes, they came across - they came out of those meetings last week. And now this week --MS NAUERT: And we both came out of those meetings very, very hopeful.QUESTION: I understand that.MS NAUERT: And they both had said something along the lines of "We have" - something along the lines of "We've never felt like we're in a better position to reach this goal." So I'm not going to tarnish that in any kind of way. I think we're still going forward with that goal.QUESTION: But that was last week. And this week, the ambassador is coming out and saying something completely different. Has he been -- 17 9/28/2017MS NAUERT: Well, let me just say, to my knowledge, we have not received any phone calls about this just yet. Okay?Said, go ahead. Go right ahead.QUESTION: Let me just follow up very quickly. I'm sorry. I just want to follow up, because today, the prime minister of Israel told the official news channel that he discussed with Mr. Greenblatt and with Mr. Friedman and, in fact, with Mr. Dermer, the ambassador, the Israeli ambassador here, that they - they want to close - he raised with them closing the PLO embassy here in Washington. You have anything on that? Do you know anything about that? Because I told the Palestinian ambassador. He says we have not heard anything; this is something that the Israelis are just saying they're doing.MS NAUERT: Okay.QUESTION: Do you know anything about that?MS NAUERT: You know what? I'm not familiar with that report. If I have anything for you on it, I will certainly get it to you, but I can refer you back to the government. Okay?QUESTION: On a related matter --MS NAUERT: Yes.QUESTION: -- do you know anything about Interpol recognizing or accepting Palestine as a member-state?MS NAUERT: I do. I do. We're still working through some of that to try to figure out - assess the situation on that. That vote took place earlier this week. We were disappointed in the vote. It grants Palestinian Authority country status in Interpol. We believe that that vote unnecessary - unnecessarily politicizes the important law enforcement body. We believe it also complicates efforts to achieve a historic conflict-ending agreement between the parties.QUESTION: I thought that the President's personal and the - his administration's primary goal in the Middle East is the defeat of ISIS and counterterrorism-type things. This is one of Interpol's main functions. Are you saying that you're disappointed that now, the Palestinians will be able to participate fully in the work of an international police agency who - which is dedicated, one of its primary missions, to fighting terrorism?MS NAUERT: No. Fighting terrorism has not changed. That will not - that certainly will not change. This is --QUESTION: So the Palestinians can do it; they just can't do it as part of Interpol?MS NAUERT: But this is something, by joining or belonging to some of these international organizations, unnecessarily, we believe, complicates peace between the two.QUESTION: Well -- 18 9/28/2017MS NAUERT: And I'm just going to leave it at that. Okay?QUESTION: Asia?MS NAUERT: All right. Shall we move on? Hi. How are you?QUESTION: On Asia. Good. Thank you. Prime Minister Abe announced earlier that Japan will hold snap elections next month. Do you have any reaction? And will this affect the President's trip to Asia in a couple months from now?MS NAUERT: Sure. So I don't think it will affect the President's trip to Asia. I don't have a full schedule for the President. I know he will be traveling to China. What countries beyond that, I just don't know. I know the President is really looking forward to that. We had a terrific meetings - series of meetings here today with the Chinese delegation.To your question about Japan and the snap elections, we would regard that as internal politics, so I'm not going to comment on that too much. I can just say that Japan will always remain a steadfast ally of ours. Our relationship - we've talked about this before one on one - our relationship with the Japanese is one that we consider to be ironclad. Okay.QUESTION: And then on the Secretary's trip to Beijing now, is there any action in particular that you'll be requesting from his counterparts in Beijing? And can you offer any insight on the schedule?MS NAUERT: Let's see. I don't have the exact schedule in front of me. I'm sorry. I just don't - did not grab that. You might think so with this big book - (laughter) - but I don't have the Secretary's schedule. I know that he is really looking forward to that.If I can just bend your ear for a moment on the dialogue that we had today, it was terrific to have met so many foreign ministers - excuse me, so many cabinet-level officials from China. We met with the education minister, the finance minister, the equivalent of our Health and Human Services Secretary, and they were all here for a bunch of meetings with their various counterparts to talk about different forms of dialogue. This is one of the four meetings that the President, President Trump, and Mr. Xi had agreed to earlier this year. So it was a terrific exchange of ideas about how the United States can perhaps bring in more of their students. There are so many students who are coming from China every year.I know that the Secretary looks to just reinforce the relationship with China. As two massive powers, massive populations, we want to have a good understanding and a good working relationship with China. Today was a part of that. The Secretary's trip, where he's - will land later today or tomorrow is a continuation of that. Part of what he will be doing on that trip is helping to facilitate the President's travel and talk about what the President will be doing when the President arrives there.QUESTION: But is there any particular message that he'll be bringing on North Korea to China? 19 9/28/2017MS NAUERT: Oh, well - I mean, that is certainly a big topic of conversation that we always have. I know that the Secretary will continue his conversations with the Chinese Government about the destabilizing activities of the DPRK. China has taken some great strides in recent weeks, and we look forward to China adhering to the UN Security Council resolutions and fully implementing all those resolutions. We've seen some reports today about how they have committed to do just that, and so I think the Secretary will be thanking them for the steps that they've taken in that direction. And of course, we're always looking for countries to do more. Okay?QUESTION: On DPRK?QUESTION: In your --MS NAUERT: Yeah?QUESTION: In your opening spiel --QUESTION: China?QUESTION: -- on the dialogue from this morning at the top --MS NAUERT: Yeah.QUESTION: -- you mentioned - one line was about how he talked about hoping the Chinese would increase access to foreign media --MS NAUERT: Yes.QUESTION: -- for Chinese audiences.MS NAUERT: Mm-hmm.QUESTION: Was he - was he any more specific about, like, which foreign media and --MS NAUERT: So I was there and heard the Secretary as he was talking about that, and you know freedom of speech is an important matter for the U.S. Government. It's what we stand for, it's one of the things we care about most deeply. The subject came up, the Secretary brought up that issue and said that that was a - I'm trying to think of his exact words. I don't have them in front of me, but where he said that we would like further - and I can check my notes - but we'd like further access because that - having access to U.S. media could help better - help the two countries better understand one another.QUESTION: Okay. Could I just make a point that one way to demonstrate your commitment to --MS NAUERT: Yes.QUESTION: -- freedom of press and the importance of it is actually bringing more reporters with him on his trip when he shows up? Just -- 20 9/28/2017MS NAUERT: I will register that, Matt.QUESTION: Thank you.MS NAUERT: Thank you.QUESTION: Heather?MS NAUERT: Okay. Anything --QUESTION: On China?MS NAUERT: Anything else on North Korea, China?QUESTION: On North Korea?QUESTION: On China.MS NAUERT: Okay. Hi.QUESTION: In the discussions, does the United States have any indication or will the United States be pushing for China to go beyond what it's agreed to in Security Council resolutions? Is there an indication that China might go further?MS NAUERT: Well, I don't want to speak on behalf on Nikki Haley and her very, very capable team up there. I don't know what they have in mind, if there are further sanctions at the United Nations that the Security Council could undertake. We've been pleased that we've had two unanimous UN Security Council resolutions that have --QUESTION: But China going beyond without an additional --MS NAUERT: Pardon me?QUESTION: Without an additional resolution --MS NAUERT: Oh. We're always asking countries to do more. We're always asking countries to do more. China has said that they are implementing and adhering to the UN Security Council resolutions, and so we're obviously very pleased with that, but we're always asking every country to do more. We know a lot of countries can do more. We just had a good headline out of Malaysia today. Malaysia is eliminating its - my understanding - I hope I'm phrasing this properly, but their - the North Korea embassy staff, essentially, there.QUESTION: On the dialogue --MS NAUERT: Okay?QUESTION: On DPRK --QUESTION: Heather, on the dialogue today -- 21 9/28/2017MS NAUERT: Yes?QUESTION: How --MS NAUERT: Go ahead.QUESTION: How do you view --QUESTION: Can you - can you say --MS NAUERT: Excuse me, sir.QUESTION: Sorry, sorry. How does the State Department view this discussion that's going to go on tomorrow between North Korea and Russia? And are - is the U.S. speaking to Russia about these talks before they happen?MS NAUERT: Well, you may recall about two weeks ago or so, our Ambassador Joe Yun had traveled to Moscow to meet with some Russian officials. And Ambassador Yun spoke with them specifically about North Korea. If you recall, Russia was one of the countries that signed on to both of those unanimous UN Security Council resolutions. We were pleased to see that. You mentioned the issue of DPRK traveling to Moscow, apparently for some meetings there. I can't see that as a bad thing. Diplomacy is our preferred approach. If Russia can be successful in getting North Korea to move in a better direction, we would certainly welcome that.QUESTION: And North Korea responded in sort of classic form to these allegations that Otto Warmbier has been tortured.MS NAUERT: Yeah.QUESTION: I know you say you don't want to disrespect the parents or violate privacy in talking about the State Department's view of this case and Warmbier's treatment, but they are the ones out there saying that --MS NAUERT: I know.QUESTION: -- so by leaving it out there and having North Korea furiously respond and the President had tweeted it, isn't that just exacerbating the situation? If the State Department does not believe he was tortured --MS NAUERT: I didn't say that. I have only said that we're not going to comment on what may or may not have happened to him.QUESTION: And why is that? Because obviously, the privacy issue is off the table since the parents are the ones talking about it.MS NAUERT: I think we try our very best not to talk about people's health concerns, health situations, health status. We try to be strong and clear about that, and so I'm not going to do that. Look, his parents are in terrible mourning. We did everything we could to bring their son home. 22 9/28/2017Some pretty heroic efforts on the part of our staff. We were all incredibly heartbroken when he was brought home and we learned about his fate, certainly. But I'm just not - I'm not going to comment on that. I know you'd like me to, but I'm not going to comment on that. Okay? Okay.Marcin. How are you?QUESTION: Thank you, Heather. Heather, I have a question about the judicial reform in Poland. You said about two months ago that you're watching the situation there closely. And the president of Poland this week proposed two bills written by his administration. So do you have any comment about them?MS NAUERT: Yeah. We certainly do. So we've been watching the situation unfold in Poland very closely. Poland, of course, an important friend of the United States. We believe that a healthy and strong democracy in Poland is a vital component of U.S.-Polish relations. You all well know there are a lot of Poles who live here in the United States; I grew up with a lot of Polish families where I'm from in the Midwest.We have expressed our concerns about the rule of law and the developments there in Poland. I want to be clear about that. Poland has every right to enact judicial reform, but reforms should be in line with Poland's constitution and the highest standards of international law. It should also respect judicial independence and the separation of powers. We are aware that President Duda's new judicial reform proposals - we are closely following the parliament's upcoming deliberations on them. I don't have the date for them, but I'm sure you're well aware of that. We rely on our allies to maintain strong democratic institutions, economies, and also defense capabilities. We'll continue to watch that very carefully, but just want to express how important it is to have a strong and healthy democracy in Poland. Thanks.QUESTION: Just to go back to China here. Can we not leave that topic?MS NAUERT: Well, actually --QUESTION: In the meeting today --MS NAUERT: I think we've closed out on China, so --QUESTION: No. On the meeting today, the initial reports were that Secretary Chao was also going to be a part of this. But as I understand, it was Secretary Tillerson, Secretary DeVos. Were there any other high-level representatives from the U.S. side?MS NAUERT: I don't have the full schedule on what took place. I believe that - my understanding is that Secretary Chao was meeting with them later today. When exactly, I don't know; I would just have to refer you to her department for that, okay. But Secretary DeVos was here, and of course, Secretary Tillerson as well.Hi, Ilhan, how are you?QUESTION: Turkey. Today, President Erdogan once more talk about American pastor who has been jailed in Turkey almost a year, Brunson. And President Erdogan said - suggested 23 9/28/2017openly that there should be some kind of swap between Fethullah Gulen, who is Turkish national and lives in U.S., and American pastor. What is your view on this?MS NAUERT: In terms of Fethullah Gulen, who is here in the United States, we have received several requests for his extradition from the Turkish Government related to him. Though - that is something - we haven't talked about this for a while. We continue to evaluate it, take a look at the materials that the Turkish Government has provided us. I don't have anything new for you on the subject of that.In terms of Pastor Brunson, that is a very important issue for us, to try to get Pastor Brunson home. It is something that the President had raised with Mr. Erdogan not too terribly long ago. The State Department has been in as close of contact as we can be with Pastor Brunson. We last were able to visit him on September the 18th. That's a new bit of news. The last time that we had visited him was - let's see, it was August the 24th. And we just - we continue to advocate for his release. He was wrongfully imprisoned in Turkey, and we'd like to see him brought home.QUESTION: Just one more question.MS NAUERT: Yeah.QUESTION: We don't usually hear this kind of prisoner swap or hostage diplomacy between the allies, Turkey's ally. We hear about Iran or North Korea. What's your view that this kind of offer, coming from your ally?MS NAUERT: Look, I can't imagine that we would go down that road. We have received extradition requests for him. I have nothing new for you on that. We continue to call for Pastor Brunson's release.Okay? We've got to wrap it up there.QUESTION: All right, hold on.MS NAUERT: Thanks.QUESTION: No one from this administration has yet spoken on the record about the refugee numbers, so I want to ask you about that.MS NAUERT: Oh, okay.QUESTION: But I also want to ask you: Can you take the question about what percentage of the West Bank the administration sees as occupied?MS NAUERT: I will see if I can find something for you on that.QUESTION: Because there are plenty of maps. 24 9/28/2017MS NAUERT: I will see if I can find something for you on that, Matt. That may be a situation where there are different reports that have different information, and so --QUESTION: Okay. Well, there are --MS NAUERT: That I'm just not aware.QUESTION: There's one thing that there is not a shortage of in this area, it's maps.MS NAUERT: Okay. All right.QUESTION: On the refugee numbers.MS NAUERT: Yes.QUESTION: If you look at the last 40 years of refugee admissions, or since 1975, essentially --MS NAUERT: Since you started reporting, right?QUESTION: -- you notice - (laughter) --QUESTION: Wow.MS NAUERT: (Laughter.) I'm just teasing.QUESTION: Ooh, ouch.MS NAUERT: I'm just teasing, you know, right?QUESTION: Not that old yet.QUESTION: It's funny.QUESTION: Whenever - historically --MS NAUERT: Said thinks it's funny.QUESTION: -- there's a trend that whenever there is a bump in the number of refugees worldwide, the number - the admissions numbers for the United States have gone up. This has been true in the late '70s and '80s with the Vietnamese and Cambodians. In - then again, the - with the Soviet Union and the fall of the Soviet Union, the numbers shoot up. You can see it in the way - in the stats that you guys have compiled, and then again with the Iraq War, the number of refugees worldwide went up because of them and your numbers went up, and then again with Syria.MS NAUERT: Did you get a map there?QUESTION: No, I don't have a map. I can check -- 25 9/28/2017MS NAUERT: You have a chart.QUESTION: I have the charts, the figures.MS NAUERT: Okay.QUESTION: So is this administration comfortable for the first time, being the first administration, Republican or Democrat - because there were Republican administrations that bumped this up as well - is this administration comfortable actually reducing the number - the cap when the refugees situation worldwide is the worst that it has been since the Second World War?MS NAUERT: When it comes to refugees, we have a couple different ways of handling a refugee population. I've spent a lot of time with our bureau that handles that, our refugee and migration bureau. Those folks have been here for many years and are dedicated to what they do, and they do a terrific job.One of the things they said to me at the very first briefing I had with them when I came into this position was they explained to me that refugees, by and large - well, refugees, not by and large, but this is a fact - prefer to stay closer to home. Okay. We all may think as Americans that everybody wants to come here to the United States. But as a matter of fact, these refugees often want to stay closer to home so that it's - when it's safe and practical for them to be able to return home to their communities, they can.One place we are starting to see that trickle in - talked to the Government of Turkey last week - we are starting to see that in parts of Syria as places start to become safer. Of course, in Syria, that's a relative thing, but in general, people like to stay closer to home. The United States remains - when we bring people over here to the United States, the refugee population, and that's what you're talking about now - remains the largest acceptor of refugees in the world. There are only about 37 countries across the world that accept refugees. How many countries are there in the world? Two hundred, close to two hundred? So we're one of 37 and we're the top.So we continue to bring in refugees. We have a very strong program that, once refugees are brought into the United States, we, the United States, along with partners and NGOs, help facilitate their integration into their communities. I mentioned to you I grew up in Wisconsin. A lot of Hmongs came over in the 1970s and have established farms and still living there. So this is --QUESTION: Hmong from Laos --MS NAUERT: Yes.QUESTION: -- or monks --MS NAUERT: Yeah.QUESTION: -- or both? 26 9/28/2017MS NAUERT: From Laos.QUESTION: Yeah.MS NAUERT: Yeah. And are still living there, and --QUESTION: Right. And they did not prefer to stay close to home, which is not really the point of my question.MS NAUERT: But that's a different - that's a different situation. But by and large --QUESTION: My - but this is - my - point of my question is --MS NAUERT: -- people want to stay close to home so they can return home when they're ready.QUESTION: But my question is - the fact is that the United States has traditionally, has historically been a leader when the global population of refugees --MS NAUERT: We still are a leader in that, Matt. We still are a leader in that. We accept more refugees than any other country around the world.QUESTION: Right.MS NAUERT: And when we accept those refugees, we provide them with services in the United States to help them out. We have a tremendous network of not just State Department officials, but also NGOs, church groups - the Lutherans up in Minnesota who volunteer their time and effort to help these families.QUESTION: All of which is wonderful. My - that's not my question, though.MS NAUERT: Okay.QUESTION: My question is that traditionally, historically, when the global population of refugees has spiked, has gone up in these incident - instances that I have mentioned here, the U.S. acceptance of - the number admitted to the United States has also gone up because those administrations decided that it was important for the U.S. to take a leadership role to bump its numbers up in acceptance to get other countries to do the same.MS NAUERT: Look, I --QUESTION: Is this administration comfortable not doing that in this case when we have the record level of refugees --MS NAUERT: Matt, you're wrapping in - you're wrapping in opinion into this question. The fact is we have --QUESTION: No, I don't think so. 27 9/28/2017MS NAUERT: -- are accepting, for Fiscal Year 2018 45,000 - okay - 45,000 refugees coming from all around the world. We are assisting those families. It is something where we have come up with some more stringent, if you will, procedures for allowing people to come in. Having more stringent procedures for allowing people to come in, asking additional questions, that type of thing requires more work to vet those refugees. We feel, this government feels that that is the number that we can practically bring here into the United States and handle. These people, once they come in, will in fact be receiving more types of services, better types of services than those in the past. Additional English training is one example, additional job services. So I would argue, in fact, that these refugees may, in fact, be better off with fewer refugees here in the United States than those in the past.QUESTION: Okay. That's an interesting way to look at it, I guess. I'm not sure it's going to win you a lot of praise from the refugee advocate community. The discussion on the conference call that I was not able to be on yesterday was all about the number one issue is safety and security for the United States and the fact that you need to increase the vetting of these people, and that that can reduce the - that that makes sense that it would reduce the number you're able to take in.I'm curious though now, months after as this review has gone in - gone on, what deficiencies did the administration discover in the vet - in the vetting process that was used by the previous - by previous administrations?MS NAUERT: See, I would take issue with that as well, because as technology changes, as situations on the ground changes, we need to constantly be revamping our security procedures. And that is something - our procedures are strong now, but we're always working to improve those procedures. We're starting to get in the territory of Department of Homeland Security. They have a great press staff, so they can best answer those questions.QUESTION: But you don't think that - you don't think that previous administrations also did that and were able to increase the number of --MS NAUERT: They were - huh? Of course, they were. I imagine they were constantly revising their procedures.QUESTION: Okay. So what specifically was deficient about the previous vetting process?MS NAUERT: Look, all I can say is that there are some new standards in place, there will be some new standards in place. I know that DHS is working on those. Details about that, I'd just have to refer you to DHS.QUESTION: So they don't know what they are yet? They're still being worked on?MS NAUERT: That - I don't want to speak for DHS.QUESTION: Okay.MS NAUERT: So on that part, I just - I want to refer you to them. 28 9/28/2017QUESTION: Because if they're still being worked on, I'd like to know how it is that you've determined that you can't take more than 45,000 if you don't what they are yet.MS NAUERT: Okay, all right. Thanks, everybody. Good to see you all.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6012204 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: September 29, 2017End of Document

China denies accusations of Trump on the delivery of oil to North KoreaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 29, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2017 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 446 wordsBodyBeijing, 29 Dec (Notimex).-China denied that it has violated the limits imposed by United Nations supplies of oil to North Korea, once the President of the United States, Donald Trump, criticized Beijing for allowing crude to reach Pyongyang.The Chinese Government held that reports on boats that sell oil to North Korea are inconsistent with the facts, and added that Beijing will never allow Chinese companies to violate the resolutions of the United Nations.China has always implemented the resolutions of the United Nations in its entirety, and if there are violations, Beijing will treat them severely according to the law, said the spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hua Chunying.The spokesman of the Foreign Ministry rejected accusations of President Trump over alleged Chinese oil to North Korea supplies that violate the sanctions imposed by the UN."We will not allow any citizen or Chinese company activities that violate the resolutions of the UN Security Council," reiterated the diplomatic representative.December 28 Trump posted on his Twitter account a message in which condemned the cooperation between Beijing and Pyongyang, to specifically report that China is supplying oil to North Korea, after the South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo He said that the Chinese tanker trasvasan oil at North Korean ships."We conducted a survey with respect to the information appearing in the news media on the assumption that on 19 October a Chinese ship work oil to a North Korean ship, the vessel does not touch Chinese port since August of 2017 and we don't have data on their tickets or" arrivals of Chinese ports,"he said.The spokesman said that "we do not know if this ship entered in ports of other countries, therefore, the information presented in this news does not correspond to reality", concluded.The UN Security Council adopted a week ago unanimously a resolution to impose new international sanctions against Pyongyang in response to its persistence in developing its nuclear program and missiles.The document, proposed by United States, extends the trade embargo to North Korea and further reduces your chances of financing from abroad.China is the main trading partner and supplier of energy for North Korea, but has expressed a growing frustration with its nuclear tests and missile.The Department U.S. Treasury published satellite photos that showed it was a North Korean ship that received oil from a vessel not identified on October 19.Those images were a greater public attention this week when Chosun Ilbo reprinted them to accompany the report that China would have transferred oil to North Korea vessels about 30 times since October.  Load-Date: December 29, 2017End of Document

CYBER MONDAY YOU'VE MET YOUR MATCH. WHAT CHINA'S CONSUMERISM MEANS FOR OUR PLANET.States News ServiceNovember 26, 2017 SundayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 1038 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF):By: Xixi ChenHappy Cyber Monday everyone.For those of us who didn't break the bank on Black Friday, we're filling up our online shopping carts with Cyber Monday sales seeing if we can break new records of consumerism. I know I am.Last year's Cyber Monday was the biggest day in the history of U.S. e-commerce, totaling $3.45 billion in online purchases. That's an enormous amount of money. But it's just a drop in the bucket compared to the $25 billion spent on China's Singles Day a recording-breaking day for sales.What started as an anti-Valentine's day holiday for single Chinese people, Singles Day makes our Black Friday and Cyber Monday look like any ordinary day of shopping. Singles Day has become the world's largest online shopping holiday. When you look at China's population, it's no surprise they out-shopped us. The economy will be made up of 500 million middle class consumers in the next five years an exploding population all of which are embracing the convenience and material abundance of consumerism.Are we killing the planet with our holiday shopping?With this demand for consumerism comes a rise in manufacturing, packaging and distribution. Every product purchased comes from a long journey. It's been designed, sourced, manufactured, packaged and delivered to you at home or to your favorite store. Every step along this journey comes with steep environmental costs. Now multiply that product and its costs to every item purchased by hundreds of millions of consumers.The good news is that the Chinese government is taking action.If the country wants to continue driving economic growth, the conventional patterns of manufacturing have to be changed. So what's the plan? China is creating policies promoting sustainable supply chains, manufacturing and consumerism and they're at innovative ways to make this possible.China is changing the conventional patterns of manufacturing in an effort to green the global supply chainClick To TweetPowered By CoScheduleManager, EDF+BusinessChina's Made in China 2025 plan, an initiative introduced in 2015, has been a major driver in the country's success. The goal is aimed at upgrading manufacturing industries towards an innovation-driven and information technology-based, low-carbon economy. Roughly 1,000 pilot facilities have popped up in an effort to redefine manufacturing, reducing impacts through the entire product life cycle. And the degree of technological advancement is equally as impressive. Artificial intelligence, smart energy management it's all helping China bridge the gap to become a cleaner manufacturing economy.Even more encouraging is how the government has inspired others to take action, especially business. Companies play a big role in championing sustainable industries. They can leverage their size to drive change at scale, accelerating the revolution to a clean energy future. Here's how they are switching up china's manufacturing game:Focus on the supply chain. Companies based in China, or those with local Chinese suppliers, are reducing their carbon footprint by looking outside their own operations driving change and saving money at scale Kingfisher was looking for strategies to better help its top 100 suppliers reduce both CO2 emissions and energy use. EDF Climate Corps fellows Yuan Yang and Zheyang Chen conducted a supplier carbon emission survey and identified product categories with high emission intensity, as well as factories with strong energy saving potential, that should be prioritized for advanced supply chain carbon management. Thanks to this updated process, Kingfisher can better understand and manage its supply chain carbon emissions, target high-use suppliers and strong energy saving potentials and access more high-quality data.Invest in renewables. China has been the world's biggest solar market since 2013, and is on pace to hit record solar installations this year. To give you some perspective, Chinese workers install an array of solar panels at least the size of a soccer field every hour. Take global retail giant, Walmart. The company wanted to increase the use of solar power throughout its supply chain, and do so by providing suppliers with practical training materials on renewable energy program implementation. EDF Climate Corps fellows Junli Li and Xinyuan Wen identified 70% of Walmart's 500 key supplier factories eligible for rooftop solar projects through the use of energy management contracts. Taking action, the fellows developed a rollout plan for implementation and a training session for the supplier factories. If all factories follow through with the implementation, 1.15 gigawatts of solar could be installed, generating 1.63 billion kWh of electricity per year.Lead on technological innovation. Scaling energy efficiency is an easy and cost-effective way of reducing corporate carbon footprints. But companies are using innovation to go beyond the low-hanging fruit. Coca-Cola wanted to provide its utility with an estimate of predicted electricity use prior to each purchase cycle, to take advantage of utility incentives. EDF Climate Corps fellow Yiping Shao created a prediction model that estimates daily total electricity use of a Coca-Cola plant for a one-month period. In addition to identifying big energy and financial savings, the model can be used at other Coca-Cola facilities and at other companies in the beverage industry, helping better align businesses and utility companies in their efforts to match supply and demand, and reduce wasted energy.Finding the intersection of prosperity and sustainabilityIt's an exciting time for China. They are at the intersection of prosperity and sustainability. A parallel made possible thanks to a drive for innovation backed by smart policies something the U.S. is currently lacking. But they're not there yet. It's a long way to go before this rise in consumerism can be balanced. Fortunately, the businesses behind the products we buy are moving forward. They're taking the reins, committing to making their operations cleaner.That way the next time you go online or in-store to buy something, you can feel better about your purchase.Load-Date: November 27, 2017End of Document

TIBETAN MONKS WARNED ON SOCIAL MEDIA USE IN CHINA'S QINGHAI PROVINCEStates News ServiceSeptember 25, 2017 MondayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 419 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Authorities in a Tibetan prefecture of northwestern China's Qinghai province summoned the heads of local Buddhist monasteries last week to warn against the use of social media to view or spread "illegal content" while top-level Party meetings are held in Beijing in October, sources say.The gathering, which was held from Sept. 14 to 18 in Tsolho (in Chinese, Hainan) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture's Trika (Guide) county, brought together the leaders of "all Tibetan monasteries, both large and small, in Tsolho," a local source told RFA's Tibetan Service."Authorities explained that the meeting was being conducted on the orders of higher authorities to tell the prefecture's monks and nuns that they must not use social media to listen to, or to view and share photos and video clips of, illegal material during the period of the 19th Congress of the [ruling] Chinese Communist Party," RFA's source said, speaking on condition of anonymity."Severe consequences" were threatened for anyone found violating the ban or enticing others to do so, the source said the assembled monks were told.Protests challenging Chinese rule by Tibetans living in western Chinese provinces have brought a clampdown by authorities on internet communications, with police regularly monitoring social media sites for evidence of news-sharing with media contacts outside China, Tibetan sources say."During the meeting, the officials emphasized the importance of expressing loyalty to the Chinese government and the Communist Party of China," RFA's source said, adding that one official cited the case of a monk in Tsolho's Mangra (Guinan) county who had been caught viewing banned material and been jailed for three years."He also noted that ten Han Chinese nationals are currently being investigated for listening to and distributing illegal political material and could be sentenced at any time now for not obeying the rules," he said.Authorities in China have stepped up nationwide "stability maintenance" measures targeting anyone with a critical opinion of the Chinese Communist Party or Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of the Party's 19th Congress, which will be held in Beijing from Oct.18 to 28.Among other moves, authorities have banned travel to Tibet from outside the politically sensitive region while the top-level meetings are held, sources say.Reported by Kunsang Tenzin for RFA's Tibetan Service.

China is pushing its Amazons and Googles to spend hundreds of millions on failing companiesBusiness Insider USAugust 22, 2017 Tuesday 06:00 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 689 wordsByline: llopez@businessinsider.com,  (Linette Lopez)Highlight: Mixed ownership reform is starting in earnest in China, and it's going to cost healthy companies a fair amount of money.Body It sounds innocent enough - "mixed ownership reform."That is the phrase the Chinese government is using to describe a program in which healthy private companies are encouraged to invest in debt-laden quasi state-owned enterprises (SOEs).Take, for example, China Unicom, a flailing state-owned telecommunications company. Last week it announced that it would raise around $10 billion in cash from private investors Alibaba, Baidu Inc., JD.com, China Life Insurance Co. and Tencent, among others. Together they'll have a 35% stake in the company.To put that in perspective, Alibaba, with a 2.04% stake, will be investing $770 million in China Unicom. The question for investors on this side of the world is, will companies like Alibaba do that over and over again? And if they do, will it even work?A problem disguised as a solutionSince 2015 China has been trying to figure out ways to gradually deflate the massive debt bubble built in its corporate and financial system. That debt is making massive SOEs sluggish and unproductive. That year, SOEs recorded a 2.8% return on assets, while private companies returned 10.6%, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics.Mixed ownership, which has been part of the conversation around Chinese reform since the 1990s, really began in earnest this year. The government announced that it completed 48 mixed ownership investment deals in June.You'll find them concentrated in sectors like telecommunications and energy - old China. The companies bailing them out are mostly tech giants, like Alibaba and Tencent - new China.The problem is, critics say that moves like this don't actually solve the problem of unproductive state giants."The introduction of private capital into SOEs will not, in itself, alter a key determinant of behavior in the Chinese economy: the relationship between firms and the state," wrote researchers at The Paulson Institute in a paper published last year. "That's because China's institutional environment blurs the boundary between SOEs and privately owned firms, which permits the state to exercise significant influence over firms irrespective of its equity ownership stakes and where firms of all ownership types compete for state-generated rents."In other words, until the state gets out of the way and creates a transparent, neutral environment where businesses can succeed or fail on their own merit, these reforms won't mean anything. In fact, the paper argues, as long as the state is bossing private companies around too there is really little difference between private and public enterprises. With these reforms, the government isn't loosening its grip on the economy and opening up, it's going backward and making the state an even more powerful actor in China's economy.What's more, thanks to these deals, as well as forced M&A, SOEs aren't getting smaller - they're getting bigger.A solution that creates more problemsBack to China Unicom, which made headlines last week when it announced its deal (the stock shot up 11%). It made more headlines when it took the deal off the table and said it would be back with another one in three days.Apparently, according to the WSJ, China Unicom's initial plan for mixed ownership violated the rules of China's stock market. So they had to go back to the drawing board. It didn't help that one of the companies they said would be investing, CRRC Corp, denied that it had any involvement either."It's a bit embarrassing that you had to withdraw a plan shortly after it's filed and after you had spent so much time putting it together," a policy adviser involved in state-company reform told the Journal. "At least it shows there is a lack of communication of sort."So yeah, the process hasn't been perfected quite yet. But it doesn't sound promising either way.NOW WATCH: 6 details you might have missed on season 7 episode 6 of 'Game of Thrones'See Also:• Here's where you can preorder Nintendo's new $80 mini Super Nintendo• 'Game of Thrones' director reveals what George R.R.

Trump speaks with Macron amid mounting tensions with North KoreaCNN WireAugust 12, 2017 Saturday 8:37 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1143 wordsByline: By Dan Merica, Jeremy Diamond and Melissa Gray, CNNDateline: (CNN) Body (CNN) --  US President Donald Trump called the French President Saturday amid mounting tensions with North Korea the day after he said he was considering further economic sanctions against the rogue nation.In a call Trump had with President Emmanuel Macron of France, the two discussed "the need to confront the increasingly dangerous situation associated with North Korea's destabilizing and escalatory behavior," according to a White House readout of the call.During the call, both leaders discussed working with allies to enforce United Nations sanctions and denuclearize the Korean Peninsula, the statement said.Earlier Saturday, Macron issued a statement voicing his "concern at the ballistic and nuclear threat coming from North Korea," adding that the international community should work with Pyongyang to "resume the path of dialogue without conditions."Macron said France and other UN Security Council members want North Korea to "proceed with the complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement of its nuclear and ballistic programs."Trump has also contacted the leader of China and the governor of Guam. Japan, meanwhile, deployed the PAC-3 land-based missile interception system to four different locations.Guam Gov. Eddie Baza Calvo, on the US territory in an area of the Pacific that North Korea has threatened to strike with missiles, said he spoke with Trump and chief of staff John Kelly, and he posted audio of the call on Facebook."Both assured me that the people of Guam are safe," Calvo wrote. "In the President's words they are behind us '1,000 percent.' As the head of the Government of Guam, I appreciate their reassurances that my family, my friends, everyone on this island, are all safe."North Korea's estimated splashdown of missiles aimed toward Guam would place them just outside Guam's 12-nautical-mile territorial waters. Guam's Homeland Security adviser, George Charfauros, said Friday it would take 14 minutes for a missile fired from North Korea to reach Guam.In Japan, the defense ministry deployed the missile interception system to military bases in four prefectures, video from the four locations showed Saturday.The prefectures sit in a line between North Korea and Guam. Pyongyang identified three of the prefectures as the regions over which its missiles would fly on the way toward the US territory.Meanwhile, Trump stood by his bellicose rhetoric on North Korea on Friday, saying leader Kim Jong Un "will truly regret it and he will regret it fast" if he issues an overt threat or attacks Guam or a US ally."This man will not get away with what he is doing," Trump told reporters. "If he utters one threat in the form of an overt threat ... or if he does anything with respect to Guam, or any place else that is an American territory or an American ally, he will truly regret it and he will regret it fast."Trump told reporters on Friday that the US is considering additional sanctions against North Korea "at a very, very high level.""Very strong ones. They are already very strong," he said. "We are considering additional sanctions at a very, very high level. And probably you could say as strong as they get."It is unclear what stepped up sanctions against the North Korea would look like.Trump calls ChinaChinese President Xi Jinping called for restraint during a phone call Saturday with Trump over the escalating tensions with North Korea.Trump has urged the Chinese government to exert more pressure on the North Korean regime, with little success.During the call, Trump also informed Xi that he plans to direct his administration on Monday to investigate Chinese trade practices, a senior administration official told CNN.North Korea threatsSaber-rattling from North Koreas has dominated Trump's 17-day working vacation in New Jersey. When asked about the ratcheted-up rhetoric in recent weeks between the US and North Korea, Trump said there are good options on the table for dealing with the tensions, but also some bad ones."Hopefully it will all work out," Trump said before the call with Xi. "Nobody loves a peaceful solution better than President Trump, that I can tell you. But this has been going on for many years. Would have been a lot easier to solve this years ago, before they were in the position they are in."But we will see what happens. We think that lots of good things could happen and we also could have a bad solution."Trump called Xi after meeting with US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Bedminster.Earlier in the day, Trump issued a warning to North Korea."I hope they are going to fully understand the gravity of what I said. And what I said is what I mean," Trump said, adding that the significance of his words was "pretty obvious" and his administration is looking "very carefully" at possible future actions against North Korea.Foreign policy and national security experts have raised questions about Trump's threatening response to North Korea, noting that past administrations have tried to avoid the President commenting on North Korea's threats in order to avoid giving them credibility.Trump dismissed the criticism Friday, saying the only reason they are critical of his response is "because it's me.""If somebody else uttered the exact same words that I uttered they would say what a great statement, what a wonderful statement," Trump said, adding that there are "tens of millions of people in this country that are so happy with what I am saying."Neighboring powers urge restraintTrump's rhetoric and North Korea's response have unsettled powers in the Asia-Pacific region, with some scrambling to respond to the escalation of tensions.Neighboring powers urged restraint. Russia called on the Trump administration to keep calm, and Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told state media that his country was working with China on a "double freezing" plan to address the threat."Kim Jong Un freezes any nuclear tests and any missile launches -- we mean ballistic missiles -- and the US and South Korea freeze large-scale military exercises," Lavrov said, adding that North Korea regularly uses the drills to justify its missile tests and nuclear program.Other foreign leaders raised questions about whether there was a military option in North Korea. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Friday that "an escalation of rhetoric will not contribute to a solution" of the conflict in North Korea."I do not see a military solution to this conflict," she added.Trump praised Merkel on Friday as a "very good person," but said she was speaking for Germany, not the United States.CNN's Miranda Green, Angela Dewan, Josh Berlinger, Sherisse Pham, Junko Ogura and Steve Brusk, and journalist Yumi Shioda, contributed to this report.TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Commerce chief: US to tackle 'bigger' China trade issuesAssociated Press Financial WireSeptember 27, 2017 Wednesday 7:29 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 673 wordsByline: By KELVIN CHAN, AP Business WriterDateline: HONG KONG BodyHONG KONG (AP) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Wednesday that the Trump administration's priorities as it prepares to tackle "bigger" and "more difficult" trade issues with China are better market access, less protectionism and protecting intellectual property rights.Ross spoke to reporters in Hong Kong after visiting Beijing, where he said he made it clear to Chinese officials that "we do need major change" in the U.S-China trade relationship, which he said "is too lopsided."Ross met Premier Li Keqiang, China's top economic official, in Beijing as part of preparations for President Donald Trump's visit to the country in November. He will also lead a senior trade mission to China that month, the Commerce Department announced Tuesday.Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met when Xi visited the U.S. in April, in a meeting where they agreed on a 100-day plan for trade talks to address Trump's complaints about China's swollen trade surpluses.Ross said that while those talks have yielded some progress, such as a deal to let U.S. beef into China, "we're looking for bigger things and more difficult things than what we had in the first 100 days."He didn't elaborate on specific issues, saying only that at the top of the list is "better market access both for companies operating there physically and for companies exporting there."The U.S. also wants less protectionism and more respect for intellectual property rights from China, Ross said."The U.S. is actually the least protectionist of any major country and China is one of the most protectionist," he said, while adding that the "frankness and an openness" he saw on his visit to Beijing made him optimistic about the negotiations.Trump has slammed China's large trade surpluses with the United States and ordered an investigation into whether Beijing improperly pressures companies to hand over their technology in exchange for market access. Last year, the U.S. ran up a $347 billion trade deficit in goods with China - accounting for nearly half the total.Xi, who took power in 2012, and other Chinese leaders have vowed to let market forces have a bigger role, give equal treatment to foreign and Chinese companies and roll back state industry's dominance. But reform advocates complain little has been done to fulfill those pledges.Ross raised concerns about Chinese government support measures aimed at helping develop key industries like robotics inadvertently leading to overcapacity.China has been making a big push into robotics as communist leaders seek to take an early lead in emerging industries. Out of about 400 robotics companies in China, Ross said "people in the industry tell me their estimate is that 360 of those are in it to get subsidies and tax breaks and are not really that serious about the products."On North Korean sanctions, Ross said the U.S. would keep them up as part of efforts aimed at denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula."We've been trying to go step by step gradually increasing the economic pressure on North Korea," Ross said. "If nothing else happens in terms of other alternative solutions, you can bet the U.S. will increase the pressure as best we can."Ross also commented on a Commerce Department decision on Tuesday that Canadian plane maker Bombardier should be hit with tariffs on its C Series aircraft in a dispute with Boeing, saying it was part of playing fair.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had threatened to stop doing business with Boeing, which is in talks to sell Canada 18 Super Hornet jet fighters. British Prime Minister Theresa May also raised it with Trump because Bombardier employs more than 4,000 workers in Northern Ireland."It's not out of any anti-Canadian or any anti-U.K. or certainly any anti-Northern Ireland sentiment, but even with your friends and even with your allies, you must obey the rules," Ross said, adding that the decision was preliminary and a final ruling is expected in months. "The consequences are what they will be."___Follow Kelvin Chan at www.twitter.com/chanmanLoad-Date: September 28, 2017End of Document

Google is opening an artificial intelligence center in ChinaCNN WireDecember 13, 2017 Wednesday 11:03 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 461 wordsByline: By Sherisse PhamDateline: HONG KONG (CNNMoney) BodyHONG KONG (CNNMoney) --  Despite many of its services being blocked in China, Google has chosen Beijing as the location for its first artificial intelligence research center in Asia. "The science of AI has no borders, neither do its benefits," Fei-Fei Li, chief scientist at Google's AI business, said in a blog post Wednesday announcing the new center.But China's internet borders are fortified by the so-called Great Firewall, and most of Google's biggest products -- its search engine, YouTube and Gmail -- have been blocked by the country's vast censorship apparatus for years. Google effectively left China in 2010, but the country's 730 million internet users make it too large a market to ignore. Google has made no secret of its desire to find ways to rebuild its presence in the country. Its artificial intelligence unit DeepMind teamed up with Chinese authorities to hold a five-day festival in the country earlier this year. The event focused on a human-versus-computer showdown in the ancient game of Go. Opening a high profile AI research center in China is the latest move in Google's charm offensive. It comes just months after Beijing set out its ambitions for the rapidly developing technology, announcing plans to build a domestic artificial intelligence industry worth nearly $150 billion in the coming years.China wants to become a superpower in an industry that's expected to significantly shape the future of the human race.Russian President Vladimir Putin predicted in September that whoever becomes the leader in artificial intelligence "will become the ruler of the world."Google's new center will help China pursue its aim to become the global leader. The facility will employ a team of researchers who will be supported by engineers the company already has in China."Besides publishing its own work, the Google AI China Center will also support the AI research community by funding and sponsoring AI conferences and workshops, and working closely with the vibrant Chinese AI research community," Li said. But Google could find itself in tricky situations. The Chinese government is aggressively using artificial intelligence for surveillance of its citizens, raising concerns among human rights groups. China has also been accused by the U.S. government, business groups and think tanks of trying to take short cuts in the development of its domestic industries by forcing foreign companies to hand over their intellectual property. Beijing has disputed the allegations.Google said it already had people in China working on some of its top global products, and that it wouldn't be adding new research capacity in the country if it were worried about IP theft.TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Bitcoin value drops on news of Chinese exchange shutdownBlockchainTechNews.comOctober 17, 2017 Tuesday 10:00 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Networld Media Group All Rights ReservedLength: 157 wordsBodyBetween Thursday and Friday last week, Bitcoin value dropped 7.3 percent following reports that Chinese regulators were forcing the shutdown of that nation's virtual currency exchanges. By noon Friday, the currency had rallied somewhat, making up about 3 percent of its losses.Some China-based exchanges, including Huobi and Okcoin, have contradicted the reports. Both exchanges said in a Bloomberg Technology report that they have received no such orders from the government, resulting in confusion about what Chinese regulators actually intend.However, there is no disputing the fact that China completely banned initial coin offerings last week, a move that itself put a significant dent in bitcoin value, according to Bloomberg Technology.The Chinese government has vowed to severely punish any company that attempts to offer an ICO in the future, and has instructed companies that already have held sales to refund money to participants.Load-Date: October 17, 2017End of Document

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) penned a letter last week to Apple CEO Tim Cook regarding reports that Apple has removed Virtual Private Network (VPN) applications (apps) from the version of Apples App Store available to users in the Peoples Republic of China, and urged him to stop enabling the Great Firewall, China's internet censorship system which stifles free speech and internet freedom.Several news outlets covered the letter. Select news coverage below:CNBC: Apple removed several privacy apps in China now two senators are demanding answersIn a detailed list of questions, the senators asked Cook to explain if Apple had raised concerns when Beijing was formulating its cybersecurity laws or if the tech giant pushed back when asked to take down several of the apps. They also asked if Apple had preemptively taken down any apps from the China App Store and whether it had either promoted freedom of speech in the country or condemned the government's censorship and surveillance mechanisms."Fortune: Why Ted Cruz and Patrick Leahy Are Worried Apple Is 'Enabling' Chinese CensorshipIn a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook this week, the senators questioned the chief executive about a report from The New York Times in July that said Apple bowed to government pressure and removed apps that anonymize Chinese Internet users, allowing them to access an uncensored Internet. While the senators stopped short of accusing Apple of removing the apps, they expressed concern about the possibility of the company quelling access to free speech.Forbes: Senators Shame Tim Cook Over Apple VPN Ban In ChinaThe senators ask Cook for clarification on the Chinese government's involvement in the ban. However, as the senators point out, Apple does like to present itself as a bastion of internet freedom, and the main point of the letter appears to be to shame the company. They are asking the company to reveal just how hard it fought against the ban, and whether it's made a formal request to have them reinstated. They've also asked Cook to provide copies of any statements Apple's issued in China, either promoting free speech or condemning government censorship.Silicon Beat: Senators to Tim Cook: Is Apple enabling Chinese censorship?In a public letter with a list of 10 questions, Cruz and Leahy argued Apples removal of VPN apps in July may only strengthen stringent Chinese online censorship. If these reports are true, we are concerned that Apple may be enabling the Chinese governments censorship and surveillance of the Internet, wrote Cruz and Leahy.Breitbart: Ted Cruz, Patrick Leahy Question Apple over Enabling Chinese CensorshipWhile Apples many contributions to the global exchange of information are admirable, removing VPN apps that allow individuals in China to evade the Great Firewall and access the Internet privately does not enable people in China to speak up,' Cruz and Leahy proclaimed. To the contrary, if Apple complies with such demands from the Chinese government it inhibits free expression for users across China, particularly in light of the Cyberspace Administration of Chinas new regulations targeting online anonymity.
