China Polysilicon Industry Report 2017: By the End of 2017, the Annual Production Capacity of Polysilicon in China Will Reach 250-260 Thousand Tons/YearPR NewswireJuly 10, 2017 Monday 11:45 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 910 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, July 10, 2017 BodyResearch and Marketshas announced the addition of the"Research Report on China's Polysilicon Industry, 2017-2021"report to their offering.In 2016, production volume of polysilicon in China was 194 thousand tons, up by 17.5% YOY; production volume of silicon wafers was about 63 GW, up by 31.2% YOY; production volume of photovoltaic batteries was 53GW, up by 20.7% YOY, new installed grid-connection capacity of photovoltaics reached 34.5GW, up by 127% YOY. Production scales of all links in the industry chain all took over 50% of that of the globe and continued to be the first in the world.According to the report, solar grade polysilicon is the major raw material of crystal silicon photovoltaic battery pieces and the fundamental link with the highest technical barrier and the most intensive investment in the whole photovoltaic industry chain. By the end of 2016, newly installed capacity of photovoltaic power generation was 34.54 million kW, and cumulative installed capacity was 77,420,000 kW, both ranking the first in the globe.In 2016, the export value of silicon wafers, battery pieces and components was around USD 13.84 billion, down by 11.3% YOY. Export to emerging markets like India, Turkey, Chile and Pakistan significantly increased while that of occident traditional markets decline to below 30%. In 2016, photovoltaic export decline was influenced by many domestic photovoltaic enterprises' setting up plants oversea. Chinese enterprises invested to build photovoltaic enterprises in over 20 foreign countries. By the end of 2016, production capacity of photovoltaics built oversea was over 5 GW, showing clear trend of globalized allocation of production.By the end of Jun, 2017, polysilicon enterprises in normal production was 17, declining from over 80 in the end of 2011. Annual effective production capacity was about 230 thousand tons/year, which increased by 20 thousand tons/year compared to the end of 2016. GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Limited, TBEA Co., Ltd. and Daqo New Energy Corp. are leading enterprises.It is estimated that, by the end of 2017, annual production capacity of polysilicon in China will reach 250-260 thousand tons/year. The current domestic polysilicon production capacity can satisfy demand for raw materials of near 40 GW battery pieces. Presently, over 100 thousand tons of imported polysilicon is mostly processed into photovoltaic components for export which are not directly used by domestic photovoltaic power stations.Fast growing markets in recent years are China, the U.S. and Japan. The Chinese government increased additional electrovalence from CNY 1.5 cents/kWh to CNY 1.9 cents/kWh, which filled financing gap of governmental subsidies on wind, electricity and photovoltaic projects. In addition, at the end of 2015, the U.S. government announced to extend 30% of tax credit policies on photovoltaic investment to 2019, which encouraged keeping active investments in the U.S. photovoltaic market in 2017-2019.Due to the prediction of increasing demand for polysilicon in China photovoltaic industry in the next few years, some new investors, including East Hope Group, announced to enter the market. East Hope Group has invested to build a polysilicon project with annual production capacity of 120 thousand tons in Changjizhou, Xinjiang Province so far. When it is finished, the group will become the largest Polysilicon manufacturer in China. The project adopts the most advanced improved Siemens production process in the world and is equipped with facilities like self-owned power plants to largely reduce costs.There is a large growth potential in demand for polysilicon in China. However, the polysilicon industry in China is in an adjustment period facing many uncertainties like policies and market risks. Therefore, investors are supposed to analyze the market cautiously before entering.Key Topics Covered:1 Basic Concepts of Polysilicon Industry in China2 Development Environment of Polysilicon Industry in China, 2015-20173 Analysis of China Polysilicon Industry, 2012-20164 Import and Export of Polysilicon in China, 2014-20165 Development Status of China Photovoltaic Industry, 2012-20166 Analysis on Major Polysilicon Manufacturers in China, 2015-20177 Prospect of China Polysilicon Industry, 2017-2021Companies MentionedAsia Silicon (Qinghai) Co., Ltd.China Silicon Corporation Ltd.Daqo New Energy Corp.East Hope GroupGCL-Poly Energy Holdings LimitedGuodian Inner Mongolia Jingyang Energy Co., Ltd.Inner Mongolia Dun'an Photovoltaic Science and Technology Co., Ltd.Inner Mongolia Phoevix Silicon Co., LtdInner Mongolia Shenzhou Silicon LLCShaanxi Tianhong Silicon Co., Ltd.Sichuan Renesola Silicon Co., Ltd.Sichuan Yongxiang Polysilicon Co., Ltd.TBEA Co., Ltd.Yichang CSG Polysilicon Co., Ltd.Yunnan Aixin Silicon Science and Technology Co., Ltd.For more information about this report visithttps://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/j5cvnp/research_reportMedia Contact:Research and MarketsLaura Wood, Senior Managerpress@researchandmarkets.comFor E.S.T Office Hours Call +1-917-300-0470For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call +1-800-526-8630For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900U.S. Fax: 646-607-1907Fax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/china-polysilicon-industry-report-2017-by-the-end-of-2017-the-annual-production-capacity-of-polysilicon-in-china-will-reach-250-260-thousand-tonsyear-300485190.htmlSOURCE Research and MarketsLoad-Date: July 11, 2017End of Document

China compiles its own Wikipedia, but public can't edit itAssociated Press State & LocalMay 5, 2017 Friday 3:43 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 870 wordsByline: By LOUISE WATT, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - It'll be free. It'll be uniquely Chinese. It'll be an online encyclopedia to rival Wikipedia - but without the participation of the public. And don't expect entries on "Tiananmen Square 1989" or "Falun Gong spiritual group" to come up in your searches, either.Scholars and experts hand-picked by Beijing to work on the project say only they will be able to make entries - the latest example of the Chinese government's efforts to control information available on the internet.The scholars say truth is their guiding light, and their editing and review process is a rigorous one. If there is a difference of opinion, a committee should figure it out, said Zhang Baichun, chief editor of the history of science and technology section."Of course, science does not come from democratic votes, to convince others you will have to present the most convincing proof," he told The Associated Press.The effort to compile 300,000 entries that span science, literature, politics and history is being led by the ruling Communist Party's Central Propaganda Department, which guides public opinion through instructions to China's media, internet companies and publishing industry as well as overseeing the education sector. It has instructed the Encyclopedia of China Publishing House, known for its offline Chinese Encyclopedia, to produce it.The ruling party has struggled to manage public opinion in the internet age, when citizens can comment on news and topics of outrage and post photos of protests on social media - at least until such messages are scrubbed away or rendered unsearchable by censors. China also regularly blocks overseas sites including Facebook and Twitter, and has periodically blocked Wikipedia's English and Chinese versions. Currently, the Chinese Wikipedia is inaccessible on the mainland.Jiang Lijun, senior editor at the Encyclopedia of China Publishing House, said they had met with a team from San Francisco-based Wikipedia to learn from their experience.China has had a private sector version of Wikipedia since 2006, run by Baidu, the operator of the country's most popular internet search engine. It has more than 14 million entries, and more than 6 million people have edited it, according to its website.Jiang said Thursday that they plan to have entries on political leaders, the history of the Communist Party, and subjects such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence and the European Union.The online Chinese Encyclopedia will focus primarily on entries that are less likely to change as opposed to recent events, and with academic value, "while also trying to strike a balance between that, being timely and what people are searching for," she said. She declined to comment on how events that are politically sensitive in China, like the Cultural Revolution and the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, would be treated.Qiao Mu, an independent media analyst in Beijing, said the Chinese Encyclopedia would be "quite different" from Wikipedia because of the need to toe the line on political taboos."If it's not blocked in China, the publisher must accept censorship, either self-censorship or censored by authorities," he said.He said the encyclopedia would likely present a single, official version of sensitive historical events, and exclude items like the Tiananmen crackdown and the outlawed Falun Gong spiritual group, which "never exist on the internet."The publishing house behind the Chinese Encyclopedia is paying 20,000 scholars and experts from universities and research institutes to write entries and it is slated to go online next year. Jiang said initially the encyclopedia will just be in Chinese, but they are also doing research to see how viable an English version would be.Wikipedia is edited and maintained by hundreds of thousands of volunteers around the world, and has more than 40 million articles encompassing nearly 300 languages. More than 900,000 entries are in Chinese, compared with more than 5 million in English."There is Chinese content on Wikipedia too, but sometimes it is not as accurate as it could be," said Jiang, the senior editor.Jiang said that as Wikipedia's content is generated by users, they can create more entries faster. "But we try to eliminate self-promotion and inaccuracy as much as possible."Zhang, the professor of history of science and technology, said the online version will make it easier to reach more people, particularly young readers.To create the history of science and technology entries, Zhang said professors from the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Natural Sciences first hold meetings with veterans and young experts in their fields to form a committee. The committee will then find the most authoritative person on the topic to write the draft, including sometimes foreign experts, said Zhang, who is director of the institute.The draft is reviewed by a section chief editor and then the committee."If there is a difference of opinion, all deputy and chief editors should participate in the discussion and figure it out together," Zhang said. "We will reason things out with the author until we reach an agreement, or change the author."___Follow Louise Watt on Twitter at twitter.com/louise_wattLoad-Date: May 6, 2017End of Document

It has more than 14 million entries, and more than 6 million people have edited it, according to its website.Jiang said Thursday that they plan to have entries on political leaders, the history of the Communist Party, and subjects such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence and the European Union.The online Chinese Encyclopedia will focus primarily on entries that are less likely to change as opposed to recent events, and with academic value, "while also trying to strike a balance between that, being timely and what people are searching for," she said. She declined to comment on how events that are politically sensitive in China, like the Cultural Revolution and the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, would be treated.Qiao Mu, an independent media analyst in Beijing, said the Chinese Encyclopedia would be "quite different" from Wikipedia because of the need to toe the line on political taboos."If it's not blocked in China, the publisher must accept censorship, either self-censorship or censored by authorities," he said.He said the encyclopedia would likely present a single, official version of sensitive historical events, and exclude items like the Tiananmen crackdown and the outlawed Falun Gong spiritual group, which "never exist on the internet."The publishing house behind the Chinese Encyclopedia is paying 20,000 scholars and experts from universities and research institutes to write entries and it is slated to go online next year. Jiang said initially the encyclopedia will just be in Chinese, but they are also doing research to see how viable an English version would be.Wikipedia is edited and maintained by hundreds of thousands of volunteers around the world, and has more than 40 million articles encompassing nearly 300 languages. More than 900,000 entries are in Chinese, compared with more than 5 million in English."There is Chinese content on Wikipedia too, but sometimes it is not as accurate as it could be," said Jiang, the senior editor.Jiang said that as Wikipedia's content is generated by users, they can create more entries faster. "But we try to eliminate self-promotion and inaccuracy as much as possible."Zhang, the professor of history of science and technology, said the online version will make it easier to reach more people, particularly young readers.To create the history of science and technology entries, Zhang said professors from the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Natural Sciences first hold meetings with veterans and young experts in their fields to form a committee. The committee will then find the most authoritative person on the topic to write the draft, including sometimes foreign experts, said Zhang, who is director of the institute.The draft is reviewed by a section chief editor and then the committee."If there is a difference of opinion, all deputy and chief editors should participate in the discussion and figure it out together," Zhang said. "We will reason things out with the author until we reach an agreement, or change the author."___Follow Louise Watt on Twitter at twitter.com/louise_wattLoad-Date: May 6, 2017End of Document

CHINA TO BAR PRIVATE COMPANIES FROM PROVIDING ONLINE NEWSStates News ServiceMay 3, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 859 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:China's powerful Cyberspace Administration has moved to further tighten control over what the country's 731 million internet users can see online, with a ban on private-sector providers of online news.New rules coming into force on June 1 will bar any non-state-owned enterprise from running online news and editorial services, according to the agency's official website.Announced on the eve of World Press Freedom Day, the move comes amid "increasing challenges in the country's efforts to regulate online news services," state news agency Xinhua reported.The rules will transfer full powers to regulate online news to the Cyberspace Administration from China's cabinet, the State Council, it said.The regulations will apply to "news reports about public affairs such as politics, economy, military and diplomacy, as well as comments and reports on emergencies, and news services include publishing, forwarding and broadcasting news," Xinhua said.According to the regulations: "Non-publicly owned capital may not enter into Internet news information gathering activities."Beijing lawyer Li Jinglin said the regulation is "illegal," although the regulations claimed to supersede any earlier laws."This is illegal, because it violates China's constitution," Li said. "But who is going to enforce that?""There is no independent judiciary in China, so there is no agency that could rule the Cyberspace Administration's rules unconstitutional," he said.Li said the rules are a far cry from promises Beijing made during its negotiations to join the World Trade Organization (WTO) to open up its media sector eventually to foreign competition."They had previously promised to open up the media ... to foreign investment, but they are happy to break these promises," he said.Instead, online news providers must be legally registered in China, and people in charge of the organization must be Chinese citizens, while companies are banned from operating beyond the scope of their existing license.Licenses will be awarded for three years, and must be renewed before the end of that period, with further checks carried out in the case of news organizations judged to have violated the terms of their license.The authorities will also freeze sites that refuse to take steps to "rectify" violations of censorship rules.New rulesBeijing-based rights activist Hu Jia said the rules show that the media industry in China has changed rapidly since the turn of the century."These new rules from the Cyberspace Administration will send a shiver up the spine of online reporters and editors who are already struggling for survival," Hu said. "It may be the beginning of summer in Beijing, but already there's a chilling effect in the air.""There is less and less space for civil society to exist in," he said.According to the rules, online news organizations must also show that they have "qualified" personnel, suggesting that journalists and editors will be subject to the same political screening process as their counterparts in more traditional media.They will also be required to limit themselves to reprinting news information on the ruling Chinese Communist Party's news whitelist, clearly indicating the story source, and keeping the original headline and byline."They may not distort or misrepresent the original meaning of the title and the content of the news information," according to Article 15, while Article 17 forbids news sites from publishing or disseminating "prohibited" content.Any content discovered to be in violation of Chinese government guidelines must be immediately taken down.The rules add: "Internet news information service providers shall consciously accept social supervision."'A cornered beast'Meanwhile, Guangzhou-based writer Ye Du said the aim is to choke off any freedom of expression for online news and information."They have to cut it all off at one stroke; they can't allow any room at all or some idea that clashes with one-party rule could emerge."But veteran Chinese journalist Zhu Xinxin said he is optimistic that social media will make total control hard to achieve."I think we can say that the efforts of Chinese citizens has broken the monopoly of the Communist party on news in the internet age," Zhu said. "Online, the government is fighting like a cornered beast.""They can't exercise total control over online public opinion."The new rules come after the Cyberspace Administration announced a crackdown earlier this year on the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) to get around the complex system of blocks, filters, and human censorship known as the Great Firewall that limits what Chinese citizens can see online.Any service providers offering VPNs or special cable services to connect to the wider internet beyond sites censored by the government will now be required to obtain government approval before they can operate, according to a statement released by the ministry of industry and information technology.Reported by Gao Shan and Yang Fan for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Hai Nan for the Cantonese Service.

IFJ Opposes Apple Decision to Block Content for China, Hong Kong, Taiwan UsersTargeted News ServiceApril 21, 2017 Friday 11:20 PM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 348 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: BRUSSELS BodyThe International Federation of Journalists issued the following news release:The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) opposes the decision by Apple to block the downloading of certain apps by mobile users in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.According to Globe Voices, China Uncensored, a satirical news show was censored by Apple TV through the app store if users trying to access the show were based in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The curator, Chris Chappell issued a statement noting that content regarding the two-party system in Hong Kong and Taiwan was censored. Chappell also wrote a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook urging Apple to remove the block on China Uncensored to Hong Kong and Taiwan-based users, threatening to take legal and political action.China Uncensored launched on YouTube in 2012. The show mocks China's Communist Party and its authoritarian rule through curating news about crackdowns on dissidents, persecutions of religious minorities and state-sponsored hacking activities, turning them into satirical reporting.It has been reported that Apple has been tightly following the Provisions on the Administration of Mobile Internet Application Information Service issued by the Chinese government. The regulations allow the service provider to remove so-called rumours and information deemed to be harmful to national security. In January 2017, The New York Times app was removed from the Apple iTunes Store so no Mainland mobile users are able to download this app but which is still available in Hong Kong and Taiwan.The IFJ Asia-Pacific office said: "We a strongly opposed to move by Apple to remove content from its services at the mercy of the Chinese government. Users should be able to freely access any content they wish, yet the Chinese government continues to try and control access to information and the free flow of information in and out of China, as well as for it's citizens."We urge Apple CEO, Tim Cook, to review the decision and take the necessary steps to ensure access is granted.Copyright Targeted News Services07K-Vail-5841975 07K-VailLoad-Date: April 22, 2017End of Document

The human rights activist has been imprisoned since 2009 for co-writing a manifesto known as "Charter 8", calling for fundamental reforms, and is being denied to move outside China for treatment of his late-stage liver cancer.MEPs also call for the release of Lee Ming-che, a Taiwanese pro-democracy social media activist, who has been detained on 19 March 2017 in China and is since missing, allegedly under investigation on suspicion of "engaging in activities that endanger national security".Parliament is highly concerned by the Chinese government's "continued efforts to silence civil society actors" with the help of new laws on state security, counterterrorism, cybersecurity, and foreign NGO management. In a resolution adopted on Thursday, it calls upon the EU to keep raising the issue of human rights violations in its political dialogues in order to make China live up to its international human rights commitments.ERITREA: END ARBITRARY DETENTION AND GROSS HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONSMEPs call for the immediate release of Dawit Isaak, journalist and laureate of the UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize in 2017, who was arrested in Eritrea in 2001 and last heard from in 2005.

WHATSAPP FALLS VICTIM TO CHINESE INTERNET CENSORSHIP IN WAKE OF LIU XIAOBO'S DEATHStates News ServiceJuly 18, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 916 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:China's internet censors appeared on Tuesday to have blocked the sharing of anything but text on the popular WhatsApp social media app, amid a nationwide clampdown on mentions of late Nobel peace laureate Liu Xiaobo, who died of liver cancer in police custody last week.Anti-censorship website GreatFire.org reported on Tuesday that the app was partly inaccessible from with the complex system of blocks, filters, and human censorship known as the Great Firewall.WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook and offers end-to-end encryption, isn't as popular as its homegrown counterpart WeChat among China's 731 million internet users, but has until now been more resistant to government censorship.Social media users reported that their attempts to post banned photographs of Liu, a pro-democracy activist who wasn't treated for liver cancer until it was already at an advanced stage, had failed on WhatsApp since noon local time."I took photographs of a memorial event for Liu Xiaobo today," one user commented. "I was about to post them to my friends group when it just wouldn't send, not on my phone's mobile data and not on Wifi.""I can still send out text messages though, without the need to climb the Great Firewall," the user said, in a reference to the use of circumvention tools like virtual private networks (VPNs).The user said they had previously used WhatsApp to circumvent government censorship along with a group of more than 100 friends, who regularly used it to hold "lively discussions."Mourning 'filtered out'Beijing-based rights activist Hu Jia, a close friend of Liu Xiaobo and his widow Liu Xia, said the authorities are clamping down on the app, however, after successfully censoring WeChat users and content."At the moment, basic sentiments of mourning are being filtered out on a massive scale," Hu said. "This means that it's no longer convenient for a large number of rights activists and dissidents to use WhatsApp."In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a regular news briefing on Tuesday that he "has no information" on the issue."This isn't something that is for the foreign ministry to answer," Lu said. "You need to ask the departments that deal with communications and the internet."Earlier this week, security researchers at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab revealed that Chinese censors were able to intercept images commemorating Liu in private one-on-one chats on WeChat in real time, suggesting massively detailed image recognition capabilities.According to a Chinese censorship researcher known by his pseudonym Charlie Smith, the authorities have likely implemented wholesale blocking of multimedia messages because they are unable to target the overseas-based app with the same precision."It would not be surprising to find that everything on WhatsApp gets blocked, forcing users in China to use unencrypted, monitored, and censored services like WeChat," Smith told the Associated Press.Whereabouts unknownThe whereabouts of Liu Xiaobo's widow Liu Xia remained unknown on Tuesday amid growing calls for her release. Liu Xia has been under constant house arrest since her husband's Nobel Peace Prize was announced in October 2010, but has never been charged with any crime.A friend of the family told RFA that they expect Liu Xia to remain incommunicado for some time, however."If the authorities continue to hold Liu Xia under house arrest, this would be the worst possible outcome," the friend said. "Let's wait a couple of weeks and see what happens. I am guessing that it won't be much longer than that."The friend called on the international community to keep up the pressure on Beijing to allow her to leave the country."I think that if they keeping piling on the pressure, Liu Xia will eventually be allowed to leave," the friend said.Tuesday was declared by Chinese activists as an "International Day of Mourning for Liu Xiaobo," marking a traditional weeklong period following a person's death.Richard Choi, vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Democratic Movement in China, which has long campaigned on behalf of the Liu family, said activists in the former British colony would be taking part."We are holding a memorial event for Liu Xiaobo on Tuesday evening," Choi told RFA. "We call on the people of Hong Kong to take part, because the way the Chinese government has handled the entire affair has made people very angry.""So we want to get large numbers of people out for this memorial, and share our reflections in this manner."Barred from MacauAlliance chairman Albert Ho said some pro-democracy activists in the former British colony had been denied entry to Macau, probably because they had attended a memorial for Liu in Hong Kong at the weekend, suggesting the long arm of Beijing is clamping down further on rights activists, using immigration controls."We have been attending memorials and openly taking part in countless public activities, and we have never been worried before, for example that we wouldn't be able to visit mainland China or Macau," Ho said."We are not going to take any notice of this now."An employee who answered the phone at the border control police in Macau asked for questions to be sent via e-mail, but no reply had come at the time of writing on Tuesday.Reported by Ding Wenqi and Qiao Long for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Wong Lok-to for the Cantonese Service.

Israel's eHealth Giant Natali to Build up in China's Massive MarketPR NewswireApril 6, 2017 Thursday 11:30 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 831 wordsDateline: LONDON, April 6, 2017 Body"Barriers are collapsing," says Nimrod Altman, CEO of Natali Healthcare Group, who is to give a speech at the Healthcare Business International on April 4th, 2017, at the Queen Elizabeth II Centre in London. Faced with a fast-growing, ageing population worldwide, many healthcare providers are moving their companies overseas. However, only a few western groups have successfully built themselves up in the Chinese market. Natali is one of them.  As Israel's largest private healthcare provider, Natali became a subsidiary of China's Sanpower group in 2014. They have effectively implemented their eHealth/TeleHealth technologies in the Chinese market within just three years. Since expanding its services to China, Natali has amassed 120,000 Israeli subscribers and over four million in China.Advanced eHealth technologiesNatali has been promoting its large variety of innovative devices and products in China, namely eHealth/Telehealth technologies such as Predictive eMonitoring and eHealth apps, keeping a significant number of Chinese patients from unnecessary hospitalisation.The newly launched SmartCare solution in China has adopted smart censors technology to record normal daily life behaviour of the elderly. Whenever there is an abnormal signal, Natali's Call Centre, where doctors and physicians are ready to support, will be notified and get medical insights right at hand.Altman believes eHealth/Telehealth technologies are breaking the limits of distance and infrastructure for doctors and patients, largely by relieving the imbalanced allocation of healthcare resources in China.  This saves patients' time and money by allowing them do health checks and receive treatments whenever they want.Great potential in China's marketHowever, China's market is a big one with complications. There is a massive ageing population facing compromised healthcare service that have depended much on the public healthcare sector, particularly public hospitals.  Alongside this, there is the struggling survival of Chinese traditional medicine, lack of workforce in public hospitals and an overall increase of life expectancy, according to the research done by Natali and Sanpower.The Chinese government is also looking into innovative plans for the private healthcare provision. In March 2016, Chinese Vice Premier Madame Liu Yandong and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu witnessed Natali's undertaking of China's first B2C telemedicine project. Large private healthcare service companies like Natali can provide sustained systematic community healthcare as well as private home care, alleviating pressure on the public sector by giving complementary support.Altman believes that the eHealth concept is set to grow exponentially in China's private healthcare industry.The popularisation of Internet technologies is equipping China's market with great potential, which will allow Natali to develop. The internet technologies market in China is not only about over 700 million smartphone users, but also the increasing amount of internet users who are witnessing the Internet-plus age.Business model with Sanpower"But there is a better combination of leading technologies and business models to think about. We need to make adjustments because of the differences between the two markets, " added by Altman "That is why working with Sanpower's local strategists is a crucial factor for Natali to succeed in China. "Sanpower is not only helping to break culture and language barriers, but also providing business insights into governmental cooperation, insurance companies, market position, product promotion, and payment means. An intelligence team comprised of professionals from Natali and local experts from Sanpower have been constantly giving design support regarding the popularisation of Natali's day-to-day digital healthcare to every elderly people's home.Natali has become the first foreign investment by Sanpower but it is just one of the family members of Sanpower's full range of health services and private hospitals, including An Kang Tong, A.H. Nursing, More Health and Yi Le Ju. Service companies and private hospitals work together to provide customised health support to each family, and work on the cutting-edge health technologies.Fitting into the whole healthcare picture of Sanpower, currently the first stage of Natali lies in premium elderly care and chronicle disease management. Natali is able to provide holistic healthcare services including Emergency Medical Services and a division of healthcare services for schoolchildren."Without Sanpower's necessary political, economic and logistic on-ground support, it is almost  impossible for Natali to bring advanced medical concepts and existing successful solutions to Chinese elderly patients," says Altman.To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/israels-ehealth-giant-natali-to-build-up-in-chinas-massive-market-300436002.htmlSOURCE Natali Heathcare GroupCONTACT: jiliang@sanpowergroup.com, +44 (0) 7422 904858Load-Date: April 7, 2017End of Document

Human Rights: Liu Xiaobo in China, A. Antonios and D. Isaak in Eritrea, BurundiTargeted News ServiceJuly 6, 2017 Thursday 4:24 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 639 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: BRUSSELS BodyThe European Union's European Parliament issued the following news release:The European Parliament calls upon the Chinese government to immediately release the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo and his wife Liu Xia from house arrest and allow him to seek medical treatment wherever he wishes. The human rights activist has been imprisoned since 2009 for co-writing a manifesto known as "Charter 8", calling for fundamental reforms, and is being denied to move outside China for treatment of his late-stage liver cancer.MEPs also call for the release of Lee Ming-che, a Taiwanese pro-democracy social media activist, who has been detained on 19 March 2017 in China and is since missing, allegedly under investigation on suspicion of "engaging in activities that endanger national security".Parliament is highly concerned by the Chinese government's "continued efforts to silence civil society actors" with the help of new laws on state security, counterterrorism, cybersecurity, and foreign NGO management. In a resolution adopted on Thursday, it calls upon the EU to keep raising the issue of human rights violations in its political dialogues in order to make China live up to its international human rights commitments.Eritrea: End arbitrary detention and gross human rights violationsMEPs call for the immediate release of Dawit Isaak, journalist and laureate of the UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize in 2017, who was arrested in Eritrea in 2001 and last heard from in 2005. They demand that the Eritrean government should end the practice of arbitrary detention and release all prisoners of conscience, including Abune Antonios, Patriarch of the Eritrean Orthodox Church, who is imprisoned since 2007.In a resolution, Parliament condemns "in the strongest terms Eritrea's systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations", the ban of independent media, harsh detention conditions amounting to torture, persecution on the basis of religion, forced labour in the national service on a mass scale, and sexual abuse of women conscripts, and reminds the Eritrean Government that "many of its activities constitute crimes against humanity".MEPs further denounce the resumption of major EU aid to Eritrea. They call upon the EU Commission to "carefully consider" Parliament's concerns and to "ensure that the funding is strictly assigned to meeting the needs of the Eritrean people for development, democracy, human rights, good governance and security".Burundi: Fear for escalation of the political crisisMEPs are deeply concerned about the political and security situation in Burundi and about the widespread immunity for perpetrators of violence, including security forces and authorities who have allegedly killed more than 1 200, tortured thousands and arrested more than 10 000 people since 2015 in a government crackdown on those opposing the re-election of President Nkurunziza for a third term, in violation of the constitution.Following the recent statement by ACP-UE JPA co-chair Louis Michel, Parliament fears "spiralling violence and a possible escalation of the crisis along ethnic lines", fuelled by government propaganda and rallies of the ruling party CNDD-FDD's youth militia. In a resolution, it calls for effective action to prevent violence and a national dialogue to rebuild trust and national unity, and urges the Burundian government to cooperate with the UN commission of inquiry and the EAC negotiations for a solution to the conflict.The political deadlock and the deteriorating economic situation are having serious consequences for the population of Burundi, where more than 200 000 people have fled their homes and three million are in need of humanitarian aid, MEPs state, urging the EU and other donors to step up funding.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-5918728 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 7, 2017End of Document

CHINA ISSUES CYBERSECURITY ALERT AS RANSOMWARE ATTACK HIGHLIGHTS SECURITY LOOPHOLESStates News ServiceMay 15, 2017 MondayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 615 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:China issued a nationwide cybersecurity alert on Monday in the wake of global WannaCry "ransomware" attacks that left tens of thousands of computers compromised and showed up gaping holes in the online security practices of higher education institutes, experts said.The enterprise-security division of anti-virus software provider Qihoo 360 said 29,372 institutions ranging from government offices to universities, ATMs and hospitals had been "infected" by the outbreak, including around 4,000 universities and research institutions.However, the country's Cybersecurity Administration said the spread of the malware was believed to be slowing on Monday, although Chinese government bodies from transport, social security, industry watchdogs and immigration said they had suspended services ranging from processing applications to traffic crime enforcement in the wake of the attacks.A computer expert in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong surnamed Gao told RFA on Monday that the spread of the malware was exacerbated by the fact that some institutions had disabled their own firewalls."Sometimes the institutional firewalls make the computers very slow, so sometimes they are switched off," Gao said. "Sometimes the government sends out directives warning [them] about this."Sang Young, cybersecurity expert at the Internet Society's local chapter, agreed, saying that the attack had highlighted gaping holes in the cybersecurity of many Chinese educational institutions."A lot of the technical colleges in mainland China are directly linked to the internet, which is to say that they use their real IP addresses, so it's very easy for the virus to find them," Young said."Here in Hong Kong, a lot of companies are hidden behind firewalls, or wifi routers, which has the same effect."Ransomware attackThe attack comes as China gears up to implement a tough new cybersecurity law from June 1, which critics say discriminates against overseas service providers.Among government agencies affected were a social security department in the central city of Changsha, the exit-entry bureau in northeastern Dalian, a housing fund in southern Zhuhai and an industry watchdog in eastern Xuzhou, Reuters reported.The attack encrypts infected machines, before demanding ransom payments of U.S.$300-600 to unlock them again, using the digital currency Bitcoin.The Cyberspace Administration warned Chinese computer users to install and upgrade computer security software to avoid further attacks.Xinhua news agency said that some 18,000 IP addresses in China have been confirmed as infected with the "WannaCry" ransomware, citing the National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team/Coordination Center (CNCERT)."Intranets in many industries and enterprises involving banking, education, electricity, energy, healthcare and transportation have been affected in different extents," it said, quoting experts as saying that reinstalling the operating system is one way of dealing with the problem."The growth rate of infected institutions on Monday has slowed significantly compared to the previous two days," Chinese Internet security company Qihoo 360 said in a statement."Previous concerns of a wide-scale infection of domestic institutions did not eventuate."However, China remained a major source of attack from infected computers, according to a Hong Kong-based cybersecurity company.Michael Gazeley, managing director of Network Box, said nearly half of the attacks on Network Box's clients came from China.Reported by Goh Fung for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by the Mandarin Service.

Gizwits Aims to Become the New Tech Giant with China's Large-scale IoT AdoptionPR NewswireJuly 10, 2017 Monday 8:35 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 981 wordsDateline: GUANGZHOU, China and HALF MOON BAY, Calif., July 10, 2017 BodyWith the largest number of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) connections in the world, China now stands at the forefront of the development of Internet of Things (IoT), witnessing the transformation of traditional businesses like manufacturing, transportation and energy as well as the rise of new tech giants."IoT will be the game changer for the traditional businesses." Jack Huang, founder and CEO of Gizwits, an IoT platform from China, spoke during the Consumer Internet Panel in Rutberg FM 2017, where the founders of popular digital services including Gizwits, Windows photo edit app PicsArt, open data platform Factual and iPad games system Osmo have gathered to discuss the ever-changing consumer market.As the only entrepreneur on the panel with extensive experience in China, Huang pointed out that China's traditional retailers are facing serious challenges and how IoT is a critical tool for them as they strive to compete with e-commerce platforms."For example, one of our clients is a major shopping mall management company in China, with hundreds of properties under management. They are eager to transform the shopping experience by tracking what customers are doing in the physical store, providing better recommendations and streamlining the entire shopping experience." Huang talked about how Gizwits is helping traditional retailing industry in China to compete with e-commerce giants such as Alibaba and JD.com.Moreover, the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry still relies heavily on the physical stores, and IoT solutions can help optimize their operation and provide better insights. Huang brought up further examples: "We help multinational FMCG companies operating in China, such as Nestle, Ferrero and Danone, to collect and analyze the data from physical stores, letting them gain better understanding of consumer behaviors, resulting in substantial increase in offline sales and operational efficiency."Huang believes that IoT (Internet of Things) has the ability to "penetrate into the physical layer on earth", vastly expanding the scope of the Internet as we know it, making doing business offline more data driven and more optimized.Meeting the needs and demands of such powerful Chinese traditional businesses and multinational companies only accounts for a part of Gizwits' success in the Chinese market. It gained its first fame and market share by focusing on consumers and product in the early days. The Gizwits platform provides comprehensive development tools and online services for IoT developers, making it easy for them to build IoT products and applications.Underpinned by the Chinese government commitment and the substantial capital support, the development of IoT in China has been booming in the last few years. In 2016, the total revenue of the Chinese IoT industry surpassed a trillion dollars. The number of developers and corporate clients on the Gizwits platform has surged accordingly, accounting for staggering figures as more than 50,000 IoT developers and 6,000 corporate clients.Jack Huang was a serial entrepreneur in the U.S. before he started Gizwits. He was a member of the founding team that created Mimeo, the first and largest US-based B2B cloud-printing company, in 1999, and started a semantic search startup Zoomino in 2006.While building and growing startups the United States, Huang kept a close eye on the Chinese market. In 2008, he sensed the significance of the growing IoT market in China and founded Gizwits, aiming to create a competitive service platform for companies operating in China looking to integrate IoT technologies.As of July 2017, Gizwits is the largest third-party IoT service provider in China. Its client list now includes famous names as the China State Grid, the Daimler Group, A.O.Smith, 3M, Honeywell, Bosch Siemens, Midea, and Haier.With the rise of Tencent, Alibaba and other internet giants, China is shedding its copycat reputation and leading global innovations in a number of areas, especially mobile Internet. Chinese companies are increasingly demonstrating their global leadership potential in the high-tech industry.In 2016, Gizwits published its 4.0 version, in doing so becoming the first IoT platform that employs Fog Computing (aka edge computing) in China. It also launched its own IoT Machine Learning framework "Giga ML", which allows IoT developers to run machine learning models both on the IoT devices and in the cloud. Mr. Huang shared Gizwits' unique approach to combine the power of IoT and Machine Learning: "Machine learning for the most part has been run either on the device or in the cloud. With Giga ML, we employed an Adaptive Federated Machine Learning (AFML) approach, which uses the cloud to automatically deploy, re-train and redeploy the most effective Machine Learning models on millions of devices."The company raised multi-million dollar Series A funding from Matrix Partners in 2014 and 30 million Series B from Matrix Partners and Juren Capital in 2015.About GizwitsGizwits is a leading Internet-of-Things solution provider in China. It is now the largest IoT software developing platform in the Asia-Pacific region and has over 1,000 clients worldwide.It has been the Apple MFi-certified IoT solution provider in the Asia Pacific Area for seven years and gradually established strong ties with the best semiconductor companies including Qualcomm, Broadcom, TI and MTK. It is also a strategic partner of Microsoft and Amazon.Gizwits Inc. has been named one of the top 50 IoT startups by Forbes, one of the 50 most innovative companies in China by Fast Company in 2015, and earned fourth place in 10 Most Innovative Tech Companies by China Internet Weekly and ENet.View original content with multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gizwits-aims-to-become-the-new-tech-giant-with-chinas-large-scale-iot-adoption-300485029.htmlSOURCE GizWitsCONTACT: Shibei Ding, +1-352-665-3873, shibei.d@arcbering.comLoad-Date: July 11, 2017End of Document

Apple removes foreign VPN apps from Chinese app storeUPIJuly 29, 2017 Saturday 11:26 AM ESTCopyright 2017 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 349 wordsByline: DANIEL URIADateline: July 29 BodyVirtual-private network, or VPN, applications have been removed from Apple's Chinese app store. Foreign companies had developed the apps to get around China's Internet filters.British Virgin Islands-based app developer, ExpressVPN, shared a letter it received from Apple stating the application was removed from the China app store because it includes content that is illegal in China."We're disappointed in this development, as it represents the most drastic measure the Chinese government has taken to block the use of VPNs to date, and we are troubled to see Apple aiding China's censorship efforts," ExpressVPN said. "ExpressVPN strongly condemns these measures, which threaten free speech and civil liberties."Residents in China utilize VPNs to get around the "Great Firewall" that censors Chinese Internet and limits access.On Sunday Yokubaitis, president of VyperVPN developer Golden Frog said its app was also removed from the app store, the New York Times reported."We gladly filed an amicus brief in support of Apple in their backdoor encryption battle with the F.B.I. so we are extremely disappointed that Apple has bowed to pressure from China to remove VPN apps without citing any Chinese law or regulation that makes VPN illegal," he said.Yokubaitis added that the company considers the removal of the app as a detriment to human rights in China."We view access to Internet in China as a human rights issue, and I would expect Apple to value human rights over profits," he said.Star VPN tweeted it had received notice that Apple was "removing all VPN apps" from the China app store.Users in mainland China said the Windows, Mac and Android versions of the targeted VPN software were still accessible, the South China Morning Post reported. Alternatives developed in China, including Benteng and Flying Bird, were also available but users reported problems with connectivity and stability.China, Apple's largest market outside the United States, pledged to crack down on unapproved VPNs and restricted other online content as part of a 14-month campaign to "clean up" the Internet.Load-Date: July 30, 2017End of Document

Philippine justice writes online book on China's sea claimsAssociated Press InternationalMay 5, 2017 Friday 1:54 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 564 wordsByline: By JIM GOMEZ, Associated PressDateline: MANILA, Philippines BodyMANILA, Philippines (AP) - A Philippine Supreme Court justice launched a book on Thursday that questions China's historic claims to most of the South China Sea and said he will distribute it online to try to overcome China's censorship and reach its people.Supreme Court Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio said his e-book can be downloaded for free in English now and will be made available later in Mandarin, Vietnamese, Bahasa, Japanese and Spanish to help more people understand the basis of the Philippines' stand against China's territorial claims.Carpio said public opinion, including in China, can help pressure Beijing to comply with an arbitration ruling last year that invalidated China's historic claims based on a 1982 maritime treaty. Carpio helped prepare the arbitration case, which the Philippines largely won.China has dismissed the ruling and continued to develop seven artificial islands in the South China Sea's Spratly archipelago. China's construction of the islands on disputed reefs has alarmed rival claimants and the United States."This book in its printed form can never be distributed in China. It will be banned," Carpio said at the launch of his book in Manila. "The only way this e-book can reach the Chinese people is in electronic format through the internet.""I believe that like all other people of the world, the Chinese people are inherently good, but their government has drilled into their minds that they own the South China Sea since 2,000 years ago. This is, of course, utterly false and the world will never accept this," he said.Chinese Embassy officials were not immediately available for comment.In the book, titled "The South China Sea Dispute: Philippine Sovereign Rights and Jurisdiction in the West Philippine Sea," Carpio uses old maps, photographs, excerpts from the arbitration ruling, Chinese government statements and documents to question the validity of China's claims.Former Philippine Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario, who spearheaded the filing of the arbitration case against China in 2013, praised Carpio for promoting the rule of law and how that worked well for a small country standing up to a superpower, saying "international law is the great equalizer." He gave a speech at the launch of Carpio's book and said they stood together with most Filipinos in agreement that international rule of law applied to all.Carpio's studies on the South China Sea disputes are not part of his work on the Supreme Court. He said he asked the court's permission in 2015 to give lectures in 17 countries to explain the territorial conflicts, which many fear could become Asia's next flashpoint.Carpio warns in the book that China may be planning to build more island outposts at Luconia Shoal off Malaysia and Scarborough Shoal off the northwestern Philippines.If it constructs an island base at Scarborough, China would have enough radar coverage of the South China Sea to be able to impose an air defense identification zone similar to what it did a few years ago in the East Sea in a region where it has territorial rifts with Japan, he said.China and the Philippines, along with Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and Taiwan have overlapping claims to parts or all of the South China Sea that straddle busy sea lanes and are believed to be atop undersea deposits of oil and gas.___Online:Book download: http://www.imoa.ph/downloads/Load-Date: May 5, 2017End of Document

Strategic Analysis of Autonomous Cars in China, 2010-2025 Featuring Baidu, Dongfeng, FAW, Geely & Volvo - Research and MarketsBusiness WireJune 7, 2017 Wednesday 1:57 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business EditorsLength: 510 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyResearch and Markets has announced the addition of the "Strategic Analysis of Autonomous Cars in China, 2010-2025" report to their offering.The aim of this study is to research, analyze, forecast the trends and provide an overview of the development of autonomous cars and its impact on the whole automotive value chain. The study provides a global overview and analyzes the Chinese autonomous car market in particular.China is the largest passenger vehicle marketplace in term of sales and production volume in the world. Strong capitalization and the fast-growing automotive industry in China are likely to create high development opportunities in the global autonomous car market. The Chinese automotive industry is moving into autonomous car development. It is at the research and development stage, as well as in the testing and demonstration phase. Key stakeholders include global leading original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), joint-venture OEMs, domestic Chinese OEMs, and leading technology companies involved in the autonomous car development in China.Although there is no relevant policy about autonomous driving being finalized by the Chinese government and no official announcement has been made regarding the same, the need for regulations and policies will be addressed when the Chinese autonomous cars market proceeds into mature development. Innovation to zero is the key advantage of the implementation of autonomous cars in China. For instance, autonomous cars are likely to reduce car fatalities caused by human errors. The driverless car is the revolution for future transportation, as well as one of the new Mega Trends.The research service provides conclusions and a future outlook about the development of the Chinese autonomous cars market. China is expected to realize the commercialization and mass production of autonomous cars by 2030.

World Bank to Support Scaling Up of Health Reform Pilots in ChinaTargeted News ServiceMay 9, 2017 Tuesday 12:46 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 715 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe World Bank issued the following news release:The World Bank Board of Executive Directors approved a US$600 million loan to China today to help improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare services in Anhui and Fujian provinces, using the Program-for-Results (PforR) instrument that links loan disbursements to tangible results on the ground."China has made impressive gains in improving overall health outcomes in past decades, but now faces new challenges: an aging population, an increasing burden of chronic diseases, and fast-rising health expenditures. This program will support China's efforts to scale up successful health reform pilots and innovations to tackle these challenges," said Ramesh Govindaraj, World Bank Lead Health Specialist and team leader for the program.The Health Reform Program-for-Results will be implemented in Anhui and Fujian provinces with policy development and technical support from the State Council National Health Reform Office. The two provinces, which face similar challenges as the country as a whole, have been pioneering innovative health reforms.The program aims to achieve its objective through three result areas:Improving the quality and efficiency of hospital services by reforming hospital governance and management, controlling the growth of health expenditure, strengthening service quality assurance, and establishing systems for performance monitoring and evaluation;Establishing an effective People Centered Integrated Care model with an emphasis on primary care services, by strengthening the service capacity of primary care facilities, intensifying the training of health-care workers, implementing provider payment reform, and introducing a transformative model for service delivery among different levels of providers, in order to facilitate the integrated management of non-communicable diseases;Creating an enabling policy and institutional environment for health reform by strengthening oversight and stewardship, developing health information systems, building capacity of health providers, and establishing a platform for knowledge-sharing and learning."The challenge is not merely one of introducing technical solutions, but also of managing large-scale reform. This program strongly supports and encourages knowledge-sharing to help close the gap between 'knowing' and 'doing', so that reforms can be scaled up successfully from pilots through continuous learning and adjustment," said Shuo Zhang, World Bank Senior Health Specialist and the co-team leader.The program will be implemented from 2017 to 2021 supporting the Health Reform Program of 13th Five-Year development plan of China. The total IBRD financing for the PforR is US$600 million, which is 15 percent of total spending for the program in the two provinces."We are pleased to support the Chinese government in the 'deep water' phase of its health reform. This PforR is building on our joint study with WHO and the Chinese government on health reform, and will put its recommendations into practice," said Bert Hofman, World Bank Country Director for China.The 2016 study, titled Deepening Health Reform in China: Building High-Quality and Value-Based Service Delivery, recommends that China continue to shift from its current hospital-centric model that focuses on patient volume and disease treatment, to a model centered on primary care that delivers greater value for money by focusing on prevention and integrated disease management of chronic conditions."Getting this reform right is crucial for China's social and economic success in the coming decades. We believe that China's experience with health service delivery reform can provide valuable lessons for other countries facing similar challenges," said Tim Evans, Senior Director of World Bank Group's Health, Nutrition and Population Global Practice.The World Bank Group has had a long engagement in the health sector in China. Over the past three decades, the Bank has been working with China on more than a dozen projects, ranging from rural health service development and medical education, infectious and endemic diseases, tuberculosis control, maternal and child health, to rural health system strengthening and health system reform.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-5858480 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: May 10, 2017End of Document

Students at University's New Chinese Institute Showcase Design ProjectsTargeted News ServiceJune 16, 2017 Friday 4:34 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 859 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: BIRMINGHAM, England BodyBirmingham City University issued the following news release:Students at the Birmingham Institute of Fashion and Creative Art (BIFCA) in Wuhan, China have been showcasing their artistic and technical work, marking the completion of the Institute's first academic year.First Year Design projects on show in Wuhan represent the three undergraduate programmes on offer at BIFCA: BSc (Hons) Digital Media Technology, BA (Hons) Landscape Architecture and BA (Hons) Visual Communication.A partnership between Birmingham City University and Wuhan Textile University, BIFCA is the first non-profit, Chinese-foreign cooperatively run educational institution in Hubei province to offer undergraduate programmes.BIFCA offers state-of-the-art facilities - including the latest 3D design and media production equipment - contained in a completely refurbished 10,000m² building on the Nanhu Campus at Wuhan Textile University.Students at BIFCA also have the option of spending half of their studies in the UK at Birmingham City University's brand new City Centre Campus.Last month, BIFCA was incorporated in to the University's Faculty of Arts, Design and Media (ADM), which is the UK's largest trainer of arts professionals outside the country's south east. Birmingham City University is also fourth in the UK for drama and dance, and fourth for music (Guardian League Table 2018).Dr Cheryl Yu, Assistant Dean, Birmingham Institute of Fashion and Creative Art, commented:"Since the launch ceremony of BIFCA in September 2016, attended by the Lord Mayor of Birmingham, Carl Rice, the British Consulate and Government officials of Hubei province, we are concluding the first year's running of BIFCA with joys from the students and staff."The first year is rather challenging for students and staff; however, I am extremely impressed with the students achievement, which reflects the growth and commitment of our students, as well as our school. I have every confidence for an even brighter future ahead of us."During their first year's study at BIFCA, students mainly focus on improving their English language skills while they also study 30 credits of their subject modules, as an introduction to their degree studies.Digital Media TechnologyStefano Gemin, Digital Media Technology Lecturer, Birmingham Institute of Fashion and Creative Art, said:"Almost all students at BIFCA come from an art background, and arrived with basic English proficiency. The students have excelled themselves, both linguistically, but also in being able to acquire industry-ready coding and web development skills. They should all be proud of their progress with us so far."Stefano's Digital Media Technology students took part in two web development projects during the academic year. Initially, working in a team of up to four people, they had to find a client among businesses close to the campus and design a website for them, meeting specific requirements. Later in the year, students created a web application for an individual project.Birmingham City University is one of just 63 universities in the world to be given the green light by the Chinese Government to set up a jointly run higher education institute in China. BIFCA was officially launched in September 2016 by the Vice-Governor of China's Hubei province, Guo Shenglian, the Lord Mayor of Birmingham, Councillor Carl Rice and the Consul General of the UK in Wuhan, Nick Whittingham.It is Birmingham City University's intention to make other subjects available to students in Wuhan, as well as to increase the range of its collaborations in China.Landscape ArchitectureDaniel Coombes, Teaching Fellow in Landscape Architecture, Birmingham Institute of Fashion and Creative Art, said:"In our first year at BIFCA my students have had two main landscape modules. During the first semester the students learned the basics of studying landscape architecture with a focus on exploration, creativity and finding inspiration."In the second semester the focus shifted towards visualising their design work using computer programs.They spent the semester developing their software skills before digitally revisualising their hand-drawn design project from the first semester.Daniel CoombesVisual CommunicationMeanwhile, Visual Communication students, working in groups, were asked to create a visual representation that combined an exploration of a given word and a given site. The project, entitled 'People and Places', encouraged the students to undertake new forms of research and experiment with materials and visual representation techniques.Led by Dawn Parke, Fellow in Graphic Communications, the students produced a range of visual outputs including 3D multi-sensory installations, handcrafted and digital animations and graphic print material. Creative outputs ranged from children's books, brochures, photographic exhibitions and illustrative narratives.Birmingham City University has over 5,000 Chinese alumni with many holding prominent positions in the creative arts, including Fei Liu, who was a previous winner of Harper's Bazaar China Designer of the Year award.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-5895541 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: June 16, 2017End of Document

Students Divided Over Swiped Pro-Tibet Signs Depicting Self-immolationCornell Daily Sun: Cornell UniversityApril 27, 2017 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1516 wordsByline: Yuichiro KakutaniBodyTwo dozen posters in the Arts Quad depicting Tibetans self-immolating in protest were snatched last week by an unknown person or people on the same night a Cornell group had put the signs up.The stealing of the signs last week emphasized a campus divide among international students regarding China's policy toward Tibet, which includes exiling the Dalai Lama and prohibiting photographs of the spiritual leader, and elicited differing views regarding protests in Tibet and campus activism.The poster campaign, organized by the Tibet Initiative at Cornell, featured names and pictures of 30 Tibetans who self-immolated - set fire to their own bodies - in protest of China's actions regarding Tibet."Self-immolation has begun to boom since 2009 [and] the [2008] Beijing Olympics, when people were desperate about the situation in Tibet," said Tenzin Dechen '18, a member of TIC. "It did garner a lot of international media attention then, but, since then, coverage has died down and we wanted to let the campus know that this is still happening."The posters attracted attention from pedestrians who walked around Arts Quad on the first day of the campaign, organizers said, which was their intention. Their mission, members said, was to make students aware of the acts by making the acts of protest visible."That first day was great," said Tenzin Wangmo '18, a member of TIC. "We were not expecting people to research or act on this issue. People were stopping at the signs and just reading it. That's all we wanted, and people were doing just that."More than half of the signs, 24 of 34, were missing on the second day of the poster campaign, and most TIC members suspect foul play."We couldn't continue the poster display because, after the second day, over two thirds of it [was] gone," Wangmo said."All four title posts were gone," Wangmo said, making her think that wind or other weather was not the culprit. "We talked to maintenance about it. It's not like [the signs] were scattered across the Arts Quad, they were all just gone."Tibet Initiative at Cornell, via Facebook24 of the 34 signs depicting quotations and pictures of Tibetans who self-immolated in protest were snatched, TIC members said.All of the posters with political messages were removed from the Arts Quad, said a CALS junior who spoke to the The Sun on the condition of anonymity because the student had "family back home in Tibet" and was worried about potential consequences of speaking to the press."I looked at the posters that were gone," the student said. "A lot of them had quotes. Any posters with quotes that mentioned anything that was slightly political, like they did it in front of a government building, were gone."Given exceptional circumstances, Cornell administrators extended the duration of the poster campaign and worked to find the culprit, TIC members said. But the campus group lacks the time and money to launch another poster campaign and the identity of the potential vandal remains unknown, Dechen said."At the moment, we are corresponding with the Cornell administrators to find out what next steps to take," Dechen said. "But our budget is shot, and it's prelim season. We realistically can't do much for this semester ... [the possible vandal] could be anyone. There are no cameras in the Arts Quad."Chinese Students' Perspectives VaryCampus activity concerning Tibet is a controversial topic for Chinese international students studying in the United States. Chinese students recently protested the selection of Dalai Lama, the exiled head of the Tibetan government, as the commencement speaker at UC San Diego, the Los Angeles Times reported.Some Chinese international students studying in Ithaca were also unnerved by the Tibetan poster campaigns."It's complicated," a Chinese student in the College of Arts and Sciences told The Sun on the condition of anonymity because the student feared retribution if they were identified."There are two different versions [of history], and I don't know which is true. But, I feel it's good to at least recognize that this conflict exists and these Tibetans are here, because they are considered minority groups, even here."Self-immolation in the Tibetan context is not an "act of suicide," Prof. Jane-Marie Law, religious studies, said in an interview."Self-immolation is a long-standing form of protest in the Buddhist world ... done when people have no sense of agency," she said. "It's very different from suicide. What makes self-immolation not a suicide is the motivation - it is done to prevent suffering of someone else, or on behalf of your community ... it is the ultimate selfless act."Self-immolation is a very sensitive issue for the Chinese government, which often perceives the act as a symbol of Tibetan defiance of Chinese authority in the area."The Chinese government does not freak out without good reason," Law said. "What is terrifying about self-immolation to an oppressing power ... is that it tells them, 'You don't control my fear of pain and suffering.' Once you realize the mental control required [for self-immolation], you realize you are oppressing someone stronger than you are."A Chinese sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences said pro-Tibet activism on campus is positive, but added that it is discouraging to see how the issue of Tibet was framed in the exhibit."Students or on-campus organizations should be allowed to express their political stances," the student wrote in a message to The Sun. "I think removing the pictures was an unwise decision, regardless of the intentions behind it.""However, I am indeed concerned about some of the effects of displaying these pictures," the student added. "From what I have seen these pictures overwhelmingly convey the message that the situation in Tibet could not be improved unless China granted it complete autonomy, which is not consistent with political reality."Other Chinese students were more critical of the Tibetan campus activism for "neglecting how divisive and complex the issue of Tibet is ... for Chinese international students at Cornell.""'One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter' goes both ways," a Chinese Arts and Sciences freshman wrote in an email to The Sun. "What seems to be a campaign for human rights could possibly be considered a public endorsement to a known separatist and traitor by some members of the Cornell community."Some Chinese students said they were supportive of Tibet, but support for more pro-Tibet policies was the minority view in some Chinese communities at Cornell."I think I am supportive of Tibet and campus activism about it, but that may be because my maternal family is from Taiwan and I went to an international school and wasn't shaped by the government in the same way," Deanna M. Pistono '19 said. "I don't think I am representative of the Chinese international community who grew up in China and went through their school system."Law, the religious studies professor, said the Chinese government generally attempts to restrict speech regarding Tibet."There certainly is censorship in Tibet," she wrote in an email. "People are not allowed to discuss any controversial issues, the status of the Dalai Lama, the problem with the Chinese-selected 'Panchen Lama,' or any other host of issues."Not the First Time...Despite TIC members' shock, this is not the first time a political display on the Arts Quad has been vandalized. Last year, Amnesty International at Cornell's displays, and, in 2014 and 2015, signs and chalkings placed by pro-Palestine groups, were repeatedly removed or vandalized, The Sun previously reported."Last year, Amnesty's refugee display was a collection of flags from five countries with the most refugees," said Helen Shanahan '18, co-facilitator of Amnesty International at Cornell. "People repeatedly stole the flags, particularly the Palestine flags, and scattered them around North Campus. It was obviously purposely destroyed."The vandal behind Amnesty International at Cornell's display was never found."Cornell Police looked into it but they never found any leads about it, so we didn't have any avenues to go," said Christopher Hanna '18, another co-facilitator for the group.In response to last year's vandalism, Amnesty International made sure this year's display was securely anchored to the ground to deter potential vandals."The displays this year are harder to take out," Hanna said. "The flags were just shallowly put in the ground, so an assailant can easily rip dozens and scatter them out. But these displays have metal sticks in the ground and will take a lot of time to pull out."Hanna suspects the vandals may have been racially motivated, aiming to negatively shape the activism culture on campus."I think the common thread is disrespect or [a] racist way of thinking," Hanna said. "It's subtly racist, because these [countries] are all non-white or otherwise on the periphery that are having their flags and displays removed."The fact that these exhibits have been removed from campus, Hanna said, "speaks to a toxic culture about activism on campus."Load-Date: April 27, 2017End of Document

NEWLY-DISCOVERED EB-5 SCAM HIGHLIGHTS FRAUD, NATIONAL SECURITY WEAKNESSES, NEED FOR LONG-TERM REFORMStates News ServiceApril 21, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 1952 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Iowa Senator Charles Grassley:Member of 'China's Most Wanted' among more than 100 granted visas in scheme---Millions in investor funds spent on cars and homes; EB-5 projects never emergedRecent news reports of an elaborate EB-5 investor visa scheme are raising fresh concerns of the program's national security vulnerabilities as a bipartisan, bicameral coalition of lawmakers continues to press for reforms. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley is raising questions about a scheme that allowed fraudsters to pocket $50 million from Chinese investors that should have gone to U.S. job-creating development projects. While the projects never materialized, more than 100 Chinese investors, including several Chinese fugitives, obtained visas.The EB-5 program, which is scheduled to expire at the end of April absent Congressional action, issues work visas and a pathway to citizenship for foreign nationals who invest in certain U.S. development projects. The program was designed to foster U.S. job creation, particularly in rural and distressed urban areas, but has been mired by fraud, abuse and integrity issues. In this latest case, a trio of fraudsters spent roughly $15 million in funds collected from investors on high-priced cars and several multi-million dollar homes. Meanwhile, nearly three years after U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services approved the development project, no construction has taken place. Both the FBI and Department of Homeland Security raised concerns about several of the investors, including investors who are on a Chinese government list of most-wanted fugitives."It's alarming that this information was not discovered before these individuals were permitted to enter the United States. Unfortunately, this is not the first time criminals have been discovered using the EB-5 program to enter the United States," Grassley said in a letter today to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly.Grassley is seeking details on the fraudulent regional center as well as the investors who funded it. Specifically, he is seeking government documents related to the project as well as information on each of the investors. Further, he is asking whether USCIS ever audited the project and why it has not filed charges against the three fraudsters.Grassley has long advocated for reforms to EB-5 that address widespread fraud and national security vulnerabilities. He has called for an end to abusive gerrymandering practices that funnel investment dollars away from rural and economically distressed areas, which the program was designed to prioritize. In a recent letter to congressional leadership, Grassley and Judiciary leaders advocated for letting the program expire at the end of the month, absent meaningful reforms.Full text of Grassley's letter to Secretary Kelly follows:April 20, 2017VIA ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSIONThe Honorable John KellySecretaryU.S. Department of Homeland SecurityWashington, D.C. 20528Dear Secretary Kelly:I write today to request information about an Employment-Based Fifth Preference Immigrant Investor (EB-5) regional center linked to an immigration scam that allowed more than 100 Chinese nationals to improperly obtain U.S. citizenship, including several Chinese fugitives and criminals.According to the LA Times, the California Investment Immigration Fund was established in 2008 by a father-daughter duo and a friendTat Chan, Victoria Chan, and Fang Zen.[1] It is alleged that from 2009 to 2016 the Chans and Zeng collected more than $50 million from Chinese nationals, who were granted conditional residency in exchange for investing money in development projects that never occurred. The trio spent about $15 million on high-priced cars and several multi-million dollar homes for personal use, as well several business properties in California, such as a $2.25 million for a vacant lot in Indio, CA in 2012 and $5.25 million in 2015 for vacant land in Rancho Cucamonga. These sites were never used to develop the proposed EB-5 project. In fact, no construction ever occurred and photos taken in 2016 indicate that the lots are still vacant, nearly 3 years after the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) approved the project. It is not clear if the investors knew that the projects did not exist; however, about 30 of the investors received some or all of the investment backamounting to about $10 million.Apparently, although Chan and Zeng have managed to conceal the information from U.S. officials, they have yet to be arrested or charged in the investigation. Investigators determined that the some investors who received refunds have continued to pursue legal permanent residency in the United States, despite not meeting the visa program's requirements.Most of the money involved in the scam originated from accounts in mainland China or Hong Kong, and approximately $50 million was wired or deposited into one of 72 bank accounts linked to the investment fund or one of many affiliated holding companies. According to the FBI and a Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) affidavit filed in the case, several of the regional center investors have raised suspicion, including investors who are on a "Chinese government list of most-wanted fugitives, accused of bribery, and other crimes."[2] It's alarming that this information was not discovered before these individuals were permitted to enter the United States.Unfortunately, this is not the first time criminals have been discovered using the EB-5 program to enter the United States. In 2013, Iranian operatives used the EB-5 program to facilitate terrorism and were involved in an illegal procurement network that exported items to Iran for use by 'secret' Iranian government agencies. More recently in 2017, the ex-wife of China's third-most-wanted government official pled guilty to committing EB-5 fraud by submitting false source funds documents "as part of a scheme to escape to the U.S. with stolen Chinese public funds."[3] Shilan Zhao, ex-wife of former Chinese government official Jianjun Qiao, accepted a plea deal to forfeit property that was worth millions of dollars in San Gabriel Valley. According to an internal memo, ICE identified seven main areas of program vulnerability with the EB-5 visa program, including use by foreign government agents/espionage, use by terrorist, investment fraud by regional center and investors. Years later, it's evident that these program vulnerabilities still exist and have not been effectively addressed.To better understand the circumstances surrounding the California Investment Immigration Fund and the principals and investors involved, please provide responses to the following requests no later than May 04, 2017, numbering your answers accordingly. Please also have knowledgeable staff brief my staff as soon as possible.Please provide the Committee the California Investment Immigration Fund's Form I-924, business plan, and related Form I-924As, I-526s, and I-820s. Please also provide all documentation and supporting evidence related to the approval of the regional center application, including copies of written correspondence (including emails) or records/logs of telephone conversations between the Chans, Zeng, representatives of the regional center, or entities or person otherwise advocating on behalf of the California Investment Immigration Fund and USCIS or Department of Homeland Security headquarters officials.Of the Form I-526s affiliated with the California Investment Immigration Fund, how many petitions resulted in the issuance of an EB-5 visa? Of those denied, what was the reason for denial?What was the total capital investment generated for the California Investment Immigration Fund through the EB-5 program?How many direct and indirect jobs were created as a result of the EB-5 investments affiliated with the California Investment Immigration Fund? How many were created as a result of investments in affiliate companies? What evidence was provided to corroborate this information?How many investors filed the form I-829 to remove conditions? Of these, how many have been approved? How many are pending?Has USCIS issued a notice of intent to terminate to the regional center? If not, why not?Of the pending Form I-526s, does USCIS plan to deny the petitions if the regional center is terminated? If not, why not?Of the Form I-526s that were approved, how many petitioners will be unable to remove the conditions on permanent residence if the California Investment Immigration Fund is terminated? Has USCIS informed petitioners about the investigation? If so, when and how?For each foreign investor associated with the principals of the California Immigration Investment Fund regional center, please indicate whether or not the individual has entered the United States in the past or is currently in the United States, as well as what type of visa each individual used to enter the United States.Did USCIS conduct a regional center compliance audit of the California Immigration Investment Fund?Did the audit include a site visit?What were the results of this audit?Please provide detailed information on the status of the investigation of the California Investment Immigration Fund principals, investors, and its affiliates.Please explain the decision not to arrest or file charges against Victoria Chan, Tat Chan, Fang Zeng and others who are associated with the fraudulent scheme.Does ICE plan to revoke their U.S. immigration benefits? If not, why not?How many petitioners did ICE determine were on the Chinese government most-wanted fugitive list?Does ICE know the location of these foreign investors? If so, please provide a status report.What is the current immigration status of these individuals?Does ICE have plans to initiative removal proceedings? If not, why not?It is alleged that many of the foreign investors improperly obtained U.S. citizenship through the fraudulent EB-5 scheme. Does ICE plan to revoke their green cards? It not, why not?I anticipate that your written reply and any responsive documents will be unclassified. Please send all unclassified material directly to the Committee. In keeping with the requirements of Executive Order 13526, if any of the responsive documents do contain classified information, please segregate all unclassified material within the classified documents, provide all unclassified information directly to the Committee, and provide a classified addendum to the Office of Senate Security.

U.S.-China Trade Announcement Misses Opportunity to Address Critical Issues Facing Advanced Industries That Are Key to U.S. Economic FutureTargeted News ServiceMay 12, 2017 Friday 4:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 632 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Information Technology and Innovation Foundation issued the following news release:The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), the top-ranked U.S. science- and tech-policy think tank, today released the following statement from Robert D. Atkinson, ITIF's president, on the Trump administration's U.S.-China trade announcement:The Trump administration deserves credit for taking seriously the need to increase U.S. exports to China. But the initial results of the 100-day action plan of the U.S.-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue indicate that the Chinese government has shown once again that it can out-maneuver the U.S. government when it comes to bilateral trade issues.For the prior two U.S. administrations, China has employed a delay-and-diversion strategy on trade that succeeded in protecting brazenly mercantilist economic policies that run counter to its obligations under the World Trade Organization, among other commitments. Now China has entered into a joint 100-day action plan with the Trump administration. But rather than secure real concessions on the critical issues facing the U.S. economy--especially the rampant practice of "innovation mercantilism" that wrests away U.S. market share in advanced industries such as computing, semiconductors, aerospace, automobiles, Internet services, clean energy, and cloud computing--the plan instead opens up Chinese markets for some commodity-based and finance industries in return for giving China free rein to use its massive foreign reserves to buy up American companies in advanced industries.As I testified to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, "The current and emerging challenge will be around advanced industries that the United States currently leads or holds strong global positions in, because those are the industries China is now targeting for dominance. I urge you to consider what a world would look like in 15 years where U.S. technology jobs in industries as diverse as aerospace, chemicals, computers, instruments, motor vehicles, medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and software and Internet are significantly reduced due to Chinese policies focused on gaining global market share in those industries."Going forward, it will be important for the Trump administration to move beyond a simple focus on the trade balance to a focus on the kind of two-way trade with China that supports America's competitive advantage in advanced, knowledge- and technology-based industries. Otherwise, we could very well envision a world in which U.S.-China trade is in balance, but where the structure of both the trade that is occurring and the two national economies themselves has radically shifted. Without a significant course correction, China's exports and economy will be made up of more higher-value-added advanced industries, while America's exports and economy will become more focused on agriculture, natural resources, and finance, as its advanced industries wilt across the country, including in the industrial heartland. At this rate, America risks going back to being an economy made up of 'hewers of wood and drawers of water.'It is encouraging that the Trump administration has said these initial results of its bilateral engagement are only the beginning. Moving forward, we urge the administration to demand real changes in Chinese policies related to America's advanced industries. That should start with the first meeting of the Comprehensive Economic Dialogue in the summer of 2017.For more analysis of China's "innovation mercantilism" and how to stop it, see: "Stopping China's Mercantilism: A Doctrine of Constructive, Alliance-Backed Confrontation."Contact: Samantha Greene, 202/626 5744, sgreene@itif.orgCopyright Targeted News Services88Kelton-5863090 88KeltonLoad-Date: May 13, 2017End of Document

China tried to hack group linked to controversial missile defense system, US cybersecurity firm saysCNN WireApril 27, 2017 Thursday 6:41 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 631 wordsByline: By Joshua Berlinger and Juliet Perry, CNNDateline: HONG KONG (CNN) BodyHONG KONG (CNN) --  A cybersecurity firm in the United States believes state-sponsored Chinese hackers were trying to infiltrate an organization with connections to a US-built missile system in South Korea that Beijing firmly opposes. "China uses cyber espionage pretty regularly when Chinese interests are at stake to better understand facts on the ground," John Hultquist, the director of cyber espionage analysis at FireEye, told CNN's News Stream. "We have evidence that they targeted at least one party that has been associated with the missile placements."A spokesperson with South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told CNN there was an attempted cyber attack last month on their systems originating from China, but would not comment when asked if THAAD was targeted.The official said "prompt defensive measures" blocked the hackers.China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told CNN the Chinese government opposes any form of cyber attack, and fights against all form of hacker activity. "This position is consistent, clear, and serious," it said in a statement. The statement reiterated China's opposition to THAAD and called on the US and South Korea to halt its deployment. On Wednesday, the top US commander in the Pacific said the defense system would be operational in days. When asked if the group could be North Koreans posing as Chinese hackers, Hultquist said his team has gathered plenty of evidence to prove the group's origins, including their use of the Chinese language."We've known these actors for several years now and we've watched their activities."Intelligence not disruption The spying on the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system was likely done for intelligence purposes, not to disrupt it, Hultquist said. "If it were done in retaliation we'd expect some sort of follow on disruption or destruction of it, which we didn't see. Typically, when we see cyber espionage actors, they prefer to stay quiet and remain on target where they can gather as much intelligence as possible," Hultquist said.THAAD is a missile defense system the US is deploying in South Korea in case of an attack by North Korea. It detects incoming projectiles and shoots them down. Some military experts compare it to hitting a bullet with another bullet.The system is controversial in South Korea. Some worry its deployment fuels a cycle of militarization on the Korean Peninsula.Around 400 protesters gathered as parts of the system was moved Wednesday to Seongju county, where it is set to be deployed. Locals complain about the lack of consultation regarding the deployment.Why target THAAD?Analysts say Beijing believes THAAD's extremely powerful radar could be used to monitor activities inside China despite its stated use as a countermeasure against North Korea. "The US-South Korean deployment of THAAD in South Korea will harm strategic balance in the region and further stimulate tensions on the Korean Peninsula. It won't help achieve the goal of denuclearization or maintaining peace and stability in the region," Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Geng Shuang said Wednesday.South Koreans have accused China of enacting 'unofficial' sanctions in response to the THAAD deployment. Lotte, the company that owns the land where THAAD has been deployed, has seen 87 of its 99 stores in China closed and work on its theme park in the country suspended.Those developments fueled concerns the disagreement could spiral into a trade war. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly denied any knowledge of restrictions being placed on South Korean businesses over THAAD. CNN's Kristi Lu Stout, Paula Hancocks, Steven Jiang, Rebecca Wright and Nanlin Fang contributed to this report TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

ETHNIC MONGOLIAN MAKES RALLYING CALL TO HERDERS IN NORTHERN CHINA ON RELEASEStates News ServiceJuly 18, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 624 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:An ethnic Mongolian herder jailed two years ago by Chinese authorities in the northern region of Inner Mongolia has been released from prison to be met by dozens of cheering supporters.Nairalt Borjigin, who hails from Baayanunduur Som in Inner Mongolia's Ar-Horchin Banner [a county-like division], was jailed 25 months ago for his role in protests protecting the herders' traditional grazing lands from development.In a speech widely circulated and translated into English by the New York-based Southern Mongolia Human Rights Information Center (SMHRIC), Nairalt Borjigin said many herding communities now face annihilation amid severe drought in the region and dwindling access to grasslands."With a heartfelt understanding of the enormous hardships our fellow herders are facing today, I firmly believe that each and every one of you here today represents hundreds more courageous herders in your respective communities," he said.His speech voiced widespread anger and frustration among herders who have continually reported being forced off their land by Chinese companies, local government policies to save the grasslands from overgrazing, and illegal land grabs by incoming Han Chinese migrants encouraged to move to the region from elsewhere in China."I know that you all are here today not to welcome me as an individual, but you are welcoming and paying respect to our collective idea of defending our legal rights and our determination to the struggle for our future and the well-being of our children and future generations,"Forced out by povertyHe said herders are being forced by sheer poverty to leave their traditional, nomadic way of life forever."The conscience of our people never fails to judge what is right and what is wrong," Nairalt Borjigin said, adding that he has received thousands of calls, text messages, and social media tweets from supporters on his release."I did not spend 25 months in prison in vain ... as long as my people are awakened and stand up for our rights and our future.""We must not lose our spirit," he said.SMHRIC chairman Enghebat Togochog said herders are routinely jailed if they try to oppose the takeover of their lands."It is very common for herders to be subjected to persecution for protesting against Chinese government exploitation of the grasslands for mining, and against the grasslands protection policies," he told RFA."Local governments take a very hard line against any attempts at protest by the herders."He said blamed the problem on a lack of rule of law in China."China isn't a country that does things by law," he said. "But the herders still want to use the framework of the law to protect their legitimate rights and interests."Grazing is forbiddenGermany-based ethnic Mongolian dissident Xi Haiming said Mongolian herding communities are now being prevented from continuing their traditional way of life by the ruling Chinese Communist Party."We have always been a nomadic people who have herded cattle and sheep for several thousand years," Xi told RFA in a recent interview. "Now they won't let us do that any more. Grazing is forbidden.""The Communist Party is now openly banning ethnic Mongolians from keeping their flocks, and in a lot of places the land has already been taken from them for mining operations," he said.He said much of the former vast expanse of the Inner Mongolian grassland has been dug up for selenium mining."It has all been dug away now," Xi said. "Then the army took over the area and the ethnic Mongolians were squeezed out.""Ethnic Mongolians have become refugees in their own land."Reported by Gao Shan and Tian Yi for RFA's Mandarin Service.

Newly-Discovered EB-5 Scam Highlights Fraud, National Security Weaknesses, Need for Long-Term ReformTargeted News ServiceApril 21, 2017 Friday 2:15 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1937 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe office of Sen.

Both the FBI and Department of Homeland Security raised concerns about several of the investors, including investors who are on a Chinese government list of most-wanted fugitives."It's alarming that this information was not discovered before these individuals were permitted to enter the United States. Unfortunately, this is not the first time criminals have been discovered using the EB-5 program to enter the United States," Grassley said in a letter today to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly.Grassley is seeking details on the fraudulent regional center as well as the investors who funded it. Specifically, he is seeking government documents related to the project as well as information on each of the investors. Further, he is asking whether USCIS ever audited the project and why it has not filed charges against the three fraudsters.Grassley has long advocated for reforms to EB-5 that address widespread fraud and national security vulnerabilities. He has called for an end to abusive gerrymandering practices that funnel investment dollars away from rural and economically distressed areas, which the program was designed to prioritize. In a recent letter to congressional leadership, Grassley and Judiciary leaders advocated for letting the program expire at the end of the month, absent meaningful reforms.Full text of Grassley's letter to Secretary Kelly follows:April 20, 2017VIA ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSIONThe Honorable John KellySecretaryU.S. Department of Homeland SecurityWashington, D.C. 20528Dear Secretary Kelly:I write today to request information about an Employment-Based Fifth Preference Immigrant Investor (EB-5) regional center linked to an immigration scam that allowed more than 100 Chinese nationals to improperly obtain U.S. citizenship, including several Chinese fugitives and criminals.According to the LA Times, the California Investment Immigration Fund was established in 2008 by a father-daughter duo and a friend--Tat Chan, Victoria Chan, and Fang Zen.[1] It is alleged that from 2009 to 2016 the Chans and Zeng collected more than $50 million from Chinese nationals, who were granted conditional residency in exchange for investing money in development projects that never occurred. The trio spent about $15 million on high-priced cars and several multi-million dollar homes for personal use, as well several business properties in California, such as a $2.25 million for a vacant lot in Indio, CA in 2012 and $5.25 million in 2015 for vacant land in Rancho Cucamonga. These sites were never used to develop the proposed EB-5 project. In fact, no construction ever occurred and photos taken in 2016 indicate that the lots are still vacant, nearly 3 years after the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) approved the project. It is not clear if the investors knew that the projects did not exist; however, about 30 of the investors received some or all of the investment back--amounting to about $10 million.Apparently, although Chan and Zeng have managed to conceal the information from U.S. officials, they have yet to be arrested or charged in the investigation. Investigators determined that the some investors who received refunds have continued to pursue legal permanent residency in the United States, despite not meeting the visa program's requirements.Most of the money involved in the scam originated from accounts in mainland China or Hong Kong, and approximately $50 million was wired or deposited into one of 72 bank accounts linked to the investment fund or one of many affiliated holding companies. According to the FBI and a Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) affidavit filed in the case, several of the regional center investors have raised suspicion, including investors who are on a "Chinese government list of most-wanted fugitives, accused of bribery, and other crimes."[2] It's alarming that this information was not discovered before these individuals were permitted to enter the United States.Unfortunately, this is not the first time criminals have been discovered using the EB-5 program to enter the United States. In 2013, Iranian operatives used the EB-5 program to facilitate terrorism and were involved in an illegal procurement network that exported items to Iran for use by 'secret' Iranian government agencies. More recently in 2017, the ex-wife of China's third-most-wanted government official pled guilty to committing EB-5 fraud by submitting false source funds documents "as part of a scheme to escape to the U.S. with stolen Chinese public funds."[3] Shilan Zhao, ex-wife of former Chinese government official Jianjun Qiao, accepted a plea deal to forfeit property that was worth millions of dollars in San Gabriel Valley. According to an internal memo, ICE identified seven main areas of program vulnerability with the EB-5 visa program, including use by foreign government agents/espionage, use by terrorist, investment fraud by regional center and investors. Years later, it's evident that these program vulnerabilities still exist and have not been effectively addressed.To better understand the circumstances surrounding the California Investment Immigration Fund and the principals and investors involved, please provide responses to the following requests no later than May 04, 2017, numbering your answers accordingly. Please also have knowledgeable staff brief my staff as soon as possible.Please provide the Committee the California Investment Immigration Fund's Form I-924, business plan, and related Form I-924As, I-526s, and I-820s.

"Mogherini should strongly and clearly denounce the Chinese leaders' increasingly heavy-handed repression of civil society activists."Human Rights Watch urged Mogherini to publicly call for the immediate release of all detained peaceful government critics, including Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo and Martin Ennals Award winner Ilham Tohti.She should also strongly express the EU's concerns about a slew of new legislation that violates human rights and imposes harsh restrictions on civil society groups, such as the Counterterrorism Law, the Cybersecurity Law, and the Foreign NGO Management Law, and urge the Chinese government to stop suppressing religious teaching and expression, Human Rights Watch said."EU officials should demonstrate their seriousness about promoting human rights in the EU's foreign policy by speaking out publicly about Beijing's rampant abuses," Richardson said. "Mogherini should seize this opportunity to press China's leaders to end the crackdown."Load-Date: April 19, 2017End of Document

China Trade Deals, Retail Rebounds: 5 Things to Know About the EconomyUSNEWS.comMay 12, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Vol.; No.Length: 1565 wordsByline: Andrew SoergelHighlight: U.S. News breaks down the week's most notable economic developments.BodyTrump Team Announces China Trade ProgressWhat Happened:President Donald Trump's administration announced this week that U.S. beef exporters will soon get access to the Chinese market as part of a            100-day trade dialogue spawned last month after Trump's first meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.Among other aspects of a trade update published Thursday by the Commerce Department, China also agreed to take steps to allow U.S. electronic payment services to break into its massive consumer market. The U.S., in turn, has agreed to allow "China-origin cooked poultry" to be imported "as soon as possible."The series of trade concessions represents one of the most tangible results from Trump's April meeting with Xi at the U.S. president's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Yet the significance of the moves is debatable as, for example, China moved to open its market to U.S.            beef exports back in September, when President Barack Obama was still in office.What It Means:The Commerce Department's announcement also indicated the world's two largest economies would begin laying groundwork for a "one-year plan to further solidify actions in promoting U.S.-China economic engagement and cooperation," so similar announcements presumably are on the horizon.But the administration is facing some criticism for not locking down many near-term trade tweaks of substance."The Trump administration deserves credit for taking seriously the need to increase U.S. exports to China. But the initial results of the 100-day action plan of the U.S.-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue indicate that the Chinese government has shown once again that it can outmaneuver the U.S. government when it comes to bilateral trade issues," Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said in a statement Friday. "Rather than secure real concessions on the critical issues facing the U.S. economy ... the plan instead opens up Chinese markets for some commodity-based and finance industries in return for giving China free rein to use its massive foreign reserves to buy up American companies in advanced industries."Retail Rebounds After Tough 2017 StartWhat Happened:Consumer spending appeared to bounce back in April after a disappointing start to 2017, according to a retail sales report published Friday by the            Census Bureau.Sales were up 0.4 percent on the month and 4.5 percent on the year after underwhelming in February and March. Leading the month's gains were nonstore retailers -- which include online shopping outfits -- and electronics and appliance stores.General merchandise shops, meanwhile, continued to sink into the red, with sales declining 0.5 percent on the month and 0.7 percent on the year. And although department stores edged up a modest 0.2 percent in April, such retailers have weathered a 3.7 percent sales decline over the course of the past 12 months.What It Means:"Retail sales increased a solid 0.4 percent in April, better than the slim 0.1 percent gain in March but not the breakout performance markets had hoped to see," Sara Johnson, a senior research director at IHS Markit, wrote Friday. "The near-term outlook for consumer spending remains favorable: rising employment, real incomes and household wealth should fuel a pickup in growth."Indeed, the labor market has been strong for months, and income gains have steadily risen over the course of the past year. So retail spending in April -- and, more broadly, in the first quarter of 2017 -- was widely expected to be better than it was, leaving some analysts scratching their heads as to why consumers are being so stingy."Recently I've started to think about whether the consumer's too stretched. You look at credit card debt rising to levels -- I believe revolving debt is $1 trillion. Auto debt is over $1 trillion. Student loan debt is over $1 trillion," says Josh Elman, a retail analyst at Nasdaq Advisory Services. "And we're seeing interest rates starting to rise, so my concern is whether the consumer is stretched too far ... as a result of consumers allocating their dollars in different manners than they have in previous years."Consumer Sentiment Still Strong in MayWhat Happened:Consumer sentiment held steady during the opening days of May as Americans continue to express confidence in the economy's current condition and hold optimistic expectations for the future, according to a report published Friday by the University of Michigan.The sentiment index compiled by the university's Surveys of Consumers outfit ticked up 0.7 percent over the month and was up 3.2 percent on the year. The subindex tracking opinions on current conditions remained unchanged over the month, while the future expectations metric rose 1.3 percent.The index has moderated from levels seen in December and January -- immediately after the presidential election -- but sentiment hasn't backed off dramatically over the course of Trump's first few months in office.What It Means:"Consumer sentiment remained on the high plateau established following Trump's election, with the early May figure nearly identical with the December-to-May average of 97.4," Richard Curtin, Surveys of Consumers chief economist, said in a statement Friday.He also noted that "more favorable income gains and low inflation" have been a boon for consumers, allowing them to hold "the most favorable real income expectations in a dozen years."Curtin still described the partisan divide between Republicans' and Democrats' respective sentiments about the economy's future as "huge," though he said that gap appeared to close this month as Democrats expressed "diminished fears of an immediate recession and lessened concerns about personal financial setbacks." That said, whether the domestic economy is in great shape or poised for a downfall still appears to be largely dependent upon whom one asks.Job Openings Jump as Manufacturers Enjoy Banner MarchWhat Happened:There were more jobs up for grabs in the U.S. at the end of March than had been the case in any month since July, according to a report published Tuesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.The bureau's so-called JOLTS report -- short for Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary -- showed the U.S. labor market held more than 5.7 million vacancies in March. Total hires made that month, meanwhile, rose from February's total to clock in at nearly 5.3 million.And the number of workers who quit their jobs -- which is typically viewed as a sign of confidence among employees that they'll be able to find alternative means of earning a paycheck -- rose to its second-highest level since 2001. More than 3.1 million Americans quit their jobs last month.What It Means:Strength was particularly prominent among manufacturers, who've been due for more consistent good news after years of lackluster economic performance. More than 320,000 manufacturing employees were hired in March to mark the best month for new industrial hires since April 2008.More than 920,000 manufacturing hires also were made during the first three months of the year for the best pace the economy's seen since 2008."Americans appear to be more optimistic about growth in recent months, and manufacturers are no exception," a recent first-quarter industry report published by the National Association of Manufacturers said. "The rising confidence stems from the belief that the new administration in Washington, D.C., will bring much needed regulatory relief -- as well as reforms to the tax code and a significant infrastructure package."Inflation Gains Lay Groundwork for Rate HikeWhat Happened:Prices continued climbing in the U.S. last month as a pair of inflationary indicators hovered near the Federal Reserve's long-term target.The Bureau of Labor Statistics' consumer price index on Friday showed the prices consumers paid for an assorted basket of goods and services edged up 0.2 percent in April for a 2.2 percent gain on the year.Excluding volatile food and energy prices, core inflation was up 1.9 percent on the year -- just shy of the Fed's 2 percent goal.The bureau's producer price index, meanwhile, rose by 0.5 percent on the month and was up 2.5 percent on the year. Excluding food, energy and trade volatility, the core producer index was up 2.1 percent from where it sat in April 2016.What It Means:"[T]he labor market remains strong, and communication from most Fed officials remains resolute that they remain focused on their tightening monetary policy path," a team of researchers at Wells Fargo Securities wrote in a research note Friday, saying that softer inflationary readings before April's are unlikely to "deter Fed officials from raising rates at the June meeting."Indeed, with the labor market continuing to plug along and inflationary pressures picking up, June is expected to be a prime month for America's central bank to raise its benchmark interest rate.The CME Group's FedWatch Tool, which tracks the likelihood the Fed will raise rates in the eyes of analysts and investors, on Friday afternoon showed a 78.5 percent chance that Fed Chair Janet Yellen and her colleagues do so when they gather in Washington next month for their fourth meeting of 2017.Andrew Soergel is an Economy Reporter at U.S. News.

Tencent vs. Baidu: Who Will Win the Upcoming Chinese AI War?The Daily Cardinal: University of Wisconsin - MadisonApril 3, 2017 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1034 wordsBody"asset-content" data-asset-uuid="1c6524d0-60e4-5e49-8264-9e39c85fdbe1">Tech giantsTencent (NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) andBaidu (NASDAQ: BIDU) are currently engaged in an ongoing O2O (online-to-offline) ecosystem war in China. Tencent is turning WeChat -- the most popular messaging app in China -- into an all-in-one platform for making payments, hailing cabs, playing games, ordering food, and making online purchases. That social-centric expansion forced Baidu, which owns the biggest search engine in China, to add similar services to its mobile app.Those battles are now moving toward the growing artificial intelligence market. By adding AI capabilities to their platforms, Tencent and Baidu can boost the analytics capabilities of their services and set the foundations for next-gen initiatives like driverless cars. Let's take a closer look at the arms race between these two companies, and see if one can eventually gain the upper hand.Image source: Getty Images.A look at Tencent's AI investmentsTencent first announced the establishment of its AI Lab last April, and 50 AI specialists now work there. Tencent recently poached the chief of machine learning research at Baidu's Big Data Lab, Tong Zhang, to lead the unit. Prior to joining Baidu, Zhang cut his teeth atIBM andYahoo. Zhang will also lead a team of 200 product engineers to convert AI advances into usable features for Tencent's apps and services.Tencent wants to apply AI to four key areas -- its content, social apps, online games, and cloud services. The company notes that "over a hundred" of its products -- including WeChat, QQ, and the Tian Tian Kuai Bao news app -- already rely on AI. To strengthen its cloud-based AI processing capabilities, Tencent installedNVIDIA's (NASDAQ: NVDA) high-end GPUs -- which are better for machine learning purposes than CPUs -- in its cloud servers.Image source: Getty Images.Tencent also developed a Go-playing AI to followAlphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google. Google's AlphaGo AI beat Go world champion Lee Sedol last year. Tencent's Go-playing AI, Fine Art, recently beat high-ranking Japanese Go player Ryo Ichiriki.AI scientists believe that Go, which requires players to surround opponents' pieces with their own, is a better test of problem solving than chess because it has many more possible moves.Like Google, Tencent believes that AI, ride hailing apps, EVs, and driverless cars will eventually converge. That's why it recently invested in Chinese EV makerNIO and bought a 5% stake inTesla Motors. It might even tap its existing partnership with NVIDIA, which develops CPUs for connected and driverless cars, to eventually produce its own driverless platform.A look at Baidu's AI plansBaidu founded its Big Data Lab in July 2014. The division focuses on improving its machine learning algorithms, core search technologies, and big data applications. Its products include the Siri-like virtual assistant Duer, which was recently given its own business unit, and predictive analytics tools for businesses. Like Google, Baidu wants to process the data it receives from its search, mapping, and cloud services into useful information for companies and consumers.Baidu is aggressively expanding this unit with investments, partnerships, government backing, and big hires. Like Tencent, Baidu invested in NIO during its last funding round. It partnered with NVIDIA and HERE Maps to create a cloud-connected mapping platform for autonomous cars, and plans to launch its own autonomous cars -- which are being produced by a Chinese automaker -- by 2018. It also formed the dedicated Intelligent Driving division for those efforts earlier this year.Image source: Getty Images.In late February, Baidu obtained approval from the Chinese government to launch a state-backed engineering laboratory for deep learning technologies like computer vision, machine hearing, biometric identification, and human-computer interactions. It also recently acquired Raven Tech, a Beijing-based start-up which develops an AI platform for smart homes.Baidu has hired many top AI researchers to lead these efforts, but it recently lost two major leaders. In addition to Tong Zhang's abrupt departure for Tencent, Baidu's chief scientist Andrew Ng, a former Googler who led the AI group since 2014, also resigned. Those departures have raised serious concerns, since Baidu's AI group has grown to around 1,300 people -- and those employees need experienced leaders.Keep up with money news, sent to your inboxSign Up!

That's because the battle between Tencent and Baidu closely mirrors the ongoing clash betweenFacebook and Google -- one company owns the dominant social network, while the other controls the dominant search engine.Since neither ecosystem will completely consume the other, there will probably always be people who prefer using Tencent's WeChat over Baidu's app as all all-in-one platform, and vice versa. However, investors should keep an eye on how much money Tencent and Baidu are spending on these AI and O2O efforts, since both companies have posted rising expenses in recent quarters.10 stocks we like better than BaiduWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

CHINA HOLDS RIGHTS LAWYER WHO EXPOSED DETAILS OF XIE YANG TORTUREStates News ServiceMay 5, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 790 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Chinese rights lawyer Chen Jiangang, who helped to expose the torture of his client and fellow lawyer Xie Yang, was in the custody of China's state security police on Friday.Chen went 'missing' with his wife Zou Shaomei and the couple's two sons during a family trip to the southwestern province of Yunnan after making a video saying he was concerned that he might be detained.An officer who answered the phone at the municipal state security police bureau in Yunnan's Jinghong city appeared to confirm the agency's involvement."Don't you worry about them, they're just fine," the officer said when contacted by RFA on Thursday. "OK, let's leave it there."Chen and his family were detained on Wednesday afternoon, activists close to Chen said via social media.His family was released Thursday morning and permitted to take a flight back to Beijing, but Chen was forced drive the 3,200-kilometer (2,000-mile) journey home with three police escorts, Agence France-Presse reported.Sources said Zou and the children remain under police surveillance at their home, while Chen's current whereabouts are unknown.A fellow rights lawyer who asked to remain anonymous said Chen may have been hoping to help his family flee China by crossing the border into northern Myanmar from Yunnan."They were on a trip, but the possibility that he wanted to take his wife and kids out of the country can't be ruled out," the lawyer said. "Our biggest concerns are for his family, because I think it unlikely that Chen himself will want to leave.""A lot of people are sending their wives and kids overseas now, because they all have the same fears ... and it's very common for the Chinese authorities to retaliate against loved ones [of dissidents]," he said."We see a lot of cases where they target the relatives for speaking out against the injustice [faced by the dissident or activist]," he said.The family was detained alongside rights activist Zhang Baocheng and his wife, who also remain incommunicado, sources told RFA.Repeated calls to Chen and Zou's cell phones rang unanswered on Wednesday, while an employee who answered the phone at the Mengyang police station in Yunnan where the six people were detained declined to comment.Rights lawyer Ge Yongxi said he had received a brief smartphone chat message, including a location notification, from Zou, indicating that the family had been detained."She sent me a WeChat message [on Wednesday] ... but I can't confirm any other details because I haven't spoken directly with Chen Jiangang's wife," Ge said."But Chen Jiangang should be at liberty, because he was taking a trip within China's borders," he said.UN weighs inThe United Nations human rights agency on Friday denounced China's ongoing detention and harassment of human rights lawyers and activists, including Chen."Prior to being reportedly taken by police last Wednesday, Chen had, in a video message, expressed concerns that he too may 'lose his freedom' and that he may be coerced into self-incrimination," U.N. human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told reporters in Geneva."We are dismayed by this continuing pattern of harassment of lawyers, through continued detention, without full due process guarantees and with alleged exposure to ill-treatment and coercion into self-incrimination," she said.The U.N. human rights commission said the vast majority of rights lawyers detained or placed under surveillance or travel bans by China since July 2015 were defending the basic rights of Chinese citizens, mostly economic, social and cultural rights."We urge the Chinese government to abide by its international human rights obligations, to ensure due process and fair trials, and to release without delay those being held for exercising their fundamental human rights or for defending the exercise of such rights by others," it said in a statement on Friday.The reports of Xie Yang's torture in police detention were slammed by China's state-run media as "fake news," but Chen stood by them, saying they were "totally accurate."He has since been prevented from meeting with Xie, and police say he has been replaced with a government-appointed lawyer.Xie has lodged a formal complaint saying that he was subjected to confinement in a "hanging chair" made of plastic chairs stacked high above the ground for hours at a time, so that his legs swelled up and he was in excruciating pain.He was also deprived of sleep and repeatedly beaten, humiliated, and taunted with death threats against his family, according to his lawyers' notes.Reported by Xin Lin for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Ng Yik-tung and Wen Yuqing for the Cantonese Service.

Why China is beating the U.S. at innovation; China invests more in research and development, which commercializes products and creates jobs, study showsUSA TODAYApril 18, 2017 TuesdayFIRST EDITIONCopyright 2017 Gannett Company, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: MONEY; Pg. 1BLength: 993 wordsByline: Paul Davidson @Pdavidsonusat USA TODAYBodyWhile the United States is still at the top in total investment in research and development -- spending $500 billion in 2015 -- a new Boston Consulting Group (BCG) study released Monday has made a startling finding: A couple of years ago, China quietly surpassed the U.S. in spending on the later stage of R&D that turns discoveries into commercial products. And at its current rate of spending, China will invest up to  twice as much as the U.S., or $658 billion, by 2018 on this critical late-stage research.In other words, the U.S. is doing the hard work of inventing new technologies, and China, among other countries, is reaping the benefits by taking those ideas and turning them into commercial products, the report says."Other countries are free-riding on the U.S. investment," says Justin Rose, who co-authored the BCG study.The slippage is a significant blow for the U.S. economy, costing  tens of billions of dollars a year in manufacturing output and hundreds of thousands of factory jobs over the past decade or so, BCG says. Companies that lead in commercializing ideas also typically build factories near their research centers so scientists can test products before making them.The burgeoning commercial drone market is a prime example of the shift. The U.S. military developed drone technology throughout the 20th century for reconnaissance and other purposes, adding microchips for better wireless control and longer-lasting batteries. But China's Da-Jiang Innovations has refined the unmanned vehicles to better avoid obstacles and has become the world's largest builder of commercial drones. It sells them to U.S. real estate and construction firms for applications such as aerial photography and mapping. DJI has three factories in Shenzhen.The U.S. has also given birth to a Smithsonian-worthy collection of breakthrough tech -- including flat-panel displays, digital mobile handsets, notebook computers and solar panels -- only to fumble away their development to other countries, particularly China and Japan.The BCG study concludes the U.S. has the potential to reverse the trend through better collaboration among private industry, universities and research consortia. Such a shift would increase annual manufacturing output by 5%, or $100 billion, and add 700,000 factory jobs and another 1.9 million in other sectors through ripple effects.Yet while President Trump is focused on narrowing the nation's trade deficit, his proposed budget would slash federal funding for R&D, potentially snuffing  a significant source of U.S. manufacturing jobs that could help accomplish that goal. Last year, the U.S. had an $83 billion trade gap in advanced tech products, according to the Census Bureau.The country is still the global leader in "basic and applied" R&D, which makes early discoveries and further refines them. About a third of the $500 billion the country spends on R&D is funneled to those activities. But while two-thirds of the total goes to later-stage "development" R&D, China invests 84% of its R&D money on advances that yield commercial products. For the past decade, "development" R&D has been growing 20% a year in China, vs. 5% in the U.S., the BCG report says. As recently as 2004, the U.S. spent four times as much as China.In China, many technology companies are state-owned, so they don't have to worry if massive R&D spending yields losses until a product is commercialized, and even the research of private firms is often subsidized by the government, says Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.The Chinese government, he says, also gives the private sector specific timetables for achieving dominance in areas such as solar, printers, robots and drones. And China routinely steals tech and fails to enforce patent laws, Atkinson says"They have huge advantages," he says.There's ample opportunity for a U.S. turnaround, BCG says, with 75 of the world's 200 highest-rated universities located  in the U.S. But there's little cooperation among the schools, which do the lion's share of basic and applied research, largely through federal grants, and private companies, which do most of the development research.Among the obstacles BCG identified:Schools do a poor job of promoting their latest research and putting it in a digestible form for manufacturers. And researchers are focused on securing tenure, while companies are seeking a return on their investment. When companies do partner with universities, it's often for a limited, product-specific purpose rather than for developing industry-wide solutions that take longer to bring to fruition but can create many more jobs."Companies are being gun-shy and risk-averse and not wanting to make big bets on transformative technology," Atkinson says. Instead, they're focused on quarterly profits, which typically determine executives' bonuses.U.S. manufacturers are reluctant to collaborate with other firms because they don't want to share the fruits of their research with competitors.Manufacturers are reluctant to work with suppliers to establish industry-wide standards that can reduce costs and speed implementation of tech, fearing the suppliers would share the information with competitors.The study says the government should set up a central repository for federally-funded university research; school research should be geared toward commercializing products; manufacturers should build long-term relationships with universities, such as Procter & Gamble's link-up with the University of Cincinnati; and public-private research consortia should focus on developing industry-wide solutions. Since 2008, P&G has invested millions of dollars in a  computer simulation center to enhance its consumer household products."If we want to be the leader in product development for things that matter in people's lives, pushing money into developing important (products) is what we should be focused on,"  Rose says. Graphic photo Jefferson Graham, USA TODAYLoad-Date: April 18, 2017End of Document

CHINESE STUDENT APOLOGIZES FOR 'FRESH AIR' AND 'FREEDOM' COMMENTS DURING GRADUATION SPEECHStates News ServiceMay 23, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 780 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Chinese student Yang Shuping delivers a graduation speech at commencement exercises at the University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland, May 21, 2017.Screen grab from YouTube video of University of Maryland graduationA Chinese student has apologized after she referred in public to breathing "the fresh air" of free speech after arriving to study in the United States, sparking a storm of online criticism and abuse.Yang Shuping said in a graduation speech at the University of Maryland that she had initially left China in search of less polluted air, but then had enjoyed breathing another kind of fresh air on her arrival."The air was so sweet and fresh and utterly luxurious," she said, according to a video of her speech posted on YouTube."The moment I inhaled and exhaled outside the airport, I felt free," she said. "I grew up in a city in China where I had to wear face masks every time I went outside, otherwise I might get sick."By Tuesday afternoon, the video had been viewed more than 56 million times by users of the Sina Weibo social media platform and prompted a storm of negative comments."People like this, with biased opinions and broken English, should never be allowed to speak publicly as a commencement speaker," read one comment under the YouTube video.Yang later issued a solemn apology on the Sina Weibo social media platform, asking Chinese internet users for forgiveness, official media reported."I love my country and hometown and am proud of its prosperity ... I also hope to make contributions to it with what I have learned overseas," Yang wrote in comments reported by the tabloid Global Times newspaper, which has close ties to the state-run mouthpiece People's Daily."In my speech, I just wanted to share my overseas experience," she wrote. "I had no intention of belittling my country and hometown ... I'm deeply sorry and hope for forgiveness."Support for YangU.S.-based Yi Sulaiman Gu, a Chinese Muslim studying at the University of Georgia, said he supports Yang's comments."Yang Shuping's comments were in fact a comment on the necessity of freedom of expression and citizen participation in politics," Gu told RFA. "She was considered to be insulting China according to the received consensus of patriotic Chinese students overseas.""But in actual fact, the China they are protecting is the Communist Party regime, which has seriously damaged the health of its own people with heavy pollution," he said. "The spirit of the Chinese people has been crippled by this regime, so I don't think Yang Shuping was insulting her country at all.""It's the regime behind the patriotic students that is really insulting our country," he said.Xia Ming, a political science professor at the College of Staten Island in New York, said the entire state propaganda machine, including the official media, has a distorted view of reality."They are obsessed with projecting the image of a rising superpower, which is really pretty empty," Xia said. "So, when you hit them on a sore point, such as shoddy building construction, they get very, very angry.""And yet the highest echelons of leadership have already made their choices very clear, as their children and property and households have already been relocated somewhere else, somewhere safe," he said."So the elite is really cheating the ordinary people of China," he said.Call for toleranceMeanwhile, the University of Maryland called for tolerance: "It is critical to hear different viewpoints, to embrace diversity, and demonstrate tolerance when faced with views with which we may disagree.""Listening to and respectfully engaging with those whom we disagree are essential skills, both within university walls and beyond," the school said in a statement.The Global Times cited official government air quality figures, said many comments on China's tightly controlled internet hit out at Yang for "degrading China.""How can a Chinese make such comments on her motherland while speaking to a bunch of foreigners?" it quoted one user as saying.The paper also quoted a former president of the government-backed Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA) as saying that Yang had "insulted the motherland."The group, which is known to keep close tabs on Chinese students overseas to check for ideological aberration, is now calling on more patriotic members to make videos praising their hometowns to counter Yang's view.The People's Daily website showed a story about criticism of Yang's speech as its most-viewed news item on Tuesday.Reported by Ng Yik-tung and Sing Man for RFA's Cantonese Service.

China defends prison care of ailing Nobel Peace laureate LiuAssociated Press InternationalJune 29, 2017 Thursday 7:33 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 1029 wordsByline: By DIDI TANG, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - In the midst of a growing outcry, China appears to be responding to criticism that prison authorities failed to provide sufficient care to ailing Nobel Peace laureate Liu Xiaobo, saying that he received regular health checks but nothing abnormal was detected until May.Liu, 61, has been released from prison on medical parole after being diagnosed earlier this month with late-stage liver cancer and is being treated in a hospital in the northeastern city of Shenyang. He had been more than half-way through an 11-year sentence after being convicted in 2009 on subversion charges.A statement released overnight Wednesday by Shenyang's judicial bureau said doctors found suspicious symptoms during a routine physical checkup on May 31. It said a 22-member medical team was convened and a week later diagnosed Liu with liver cancer that had metastasized. Defending Liu's care, it listed the steps taken and medical units involved."Liu Xiaobo and his family expressed their satisfaction with the treatment work undertaken by the prison and hospital," the statement said. Liu's wife, Liu Xia, who has been living under house arrest despite not being charged with any crime, was accompanying him in Shenyang, the statement said.Meanwhile, a video clip without a clear provenance emerged overnight on YouTube in which Liu thanks wardens for taking care of him. The clip, released anonymously, appears to show Liu receiving checkups, medical consultations and undergoing a magnetic resonance imaging procedure."Since I came here, both Captain Dai and Captain Jin truly have taken good care of me, especially of my health," said Liu, wearing a gray prison uniform. He appears relaxed in the footage, which seemed to have been shot over a period of time and edited together.It is unclear when the footage was taken and by whom, though it is likely that only prison, police and other officials in the security apparatus had such close access to Liu during his incarceration. Also unclear is whether the footage had been manipulated and whether it accurately reflected the conditions of his eight-year detention.The video spread after the popular dissident news site Boxun.com posted it on its YouTube account with a comment: "This must have been released by the authorities." Watson Meng, who runs Boxun, said he had noticed the video elsewhere on YouTube but didn't know its source."Keep in mind, the clip has been edited to show Liu happy and smiling," Meng told The Associated Press.Attempts Thursday to independently verify the video with officials at the Shenyang government and judicial bureau were either met with rejection or claims of ignorance."We cannot comment on Liu Xiaobo case," said a person who answered phone at the Shenyang judicial bureau and who refused to give his name.Liu, a literary critic and vocal opponent to China's one-party political system, was convicted of "incitement to subvert state power," after he co-authored a document known as "Charter '08" calling for democracy and political reforms in China. He was awarded the Nobel Peace prize in 2010.Liu's illness has drawn worldwide attention. Human rights groups and the United States have called for his unconditional release and accountability for his health care while incarcerated.China has rejected all outside appeals over Liu's case, and foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang on Wednesday said Beijing had no intention of discussing the fate of one its incarcerated citizens."This issue is China's domestic affair. As we have said repeatedly, no country has the right to make irresponsible remarks on China's domestic affairs," Lu told reporters.Following the revelation Monday of his deteriorating health, Liu's supporters questioned whether he'd been neglected or abused while incarcerated.Chen Bingzhong, a former health ministry official and ex-head of a health education research institute, alleged negligence on the part of the prison in the small city of Jinzhou."Among all cancers, liver cancer is the easiest one to detect and diagnose, and early detection can lead to early, effective treatment," Chen said. "It's a chronic illness that does not develop overnight, but has ample time and shows sufficient symptoms for earlier diagnosis."The prison has "inescapable responsibility for having failed to check him, to detect the cancer and offer timely treatments," Chen said, adding that the apparent negligence amounted to "another form of persecution."Wu'er Kaixi, a Chinese dissident in exile, also blamed the authorities for Liu's illness."We believe that the reason why his health deteriorated so badly was because of the Chinese government's barbaric and cruel treatment over the past eight years," he told reporters in Taiwan.In its official statement, the city of Shenyang's judicial bureau said Liu had hepatitis B before going to jail. It said he had been receiving an annual physical exam, supplemented by bi-monthly checks. The prison added screenings for hepatitis and cancer in 2012, but detected no abnormality until May 31, it said.After the diagnosis by the 22-member group, the hospital summoned eight specialists from top hospitals around the country for seven rounds of consultations and, upon family request, added traditional Chinese medicine doctors with experience treating tumors, the statement said.The statement offered no prognosis, although a brief video clip has been circulating of a deeply distressed Liu Xia telling a friend that no treatment - surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy - would be effective at this stage.Supporters have called for Liu to be allowed to seek medical treatment abroad, but it's unclear if Liu and his family - apparently under tight supervision - so desire. Friends say they are unable to get in touch with them."They are really cut out from the outside world," said family friend Liao Yiwu, who released a handwritten note from Liu Xia in April that expressed the couple's desire to leave the country."My biggest fear is that Liu Xiaobo dies, and Liu Xia remains under house arrest in China," Liao said.___Associated Press video journalists Johnson Lai in Taipei and Isolda Morillo in Beijing contributed to the report.Load-Date: June 30, 2017End of Document

ALEXEY MILLER SPEAKS AT CNPCS ROUNDTABLE ON OIL AND GAS COOPERATION AS PART OF BELT AND ROAD FORUMStates News ServiceMay 16, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 991 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: MOSCOW, Russia BodyThe following information was released by OAO Gazprom:A roundtable on oil and gas cooperation was held today by Chinas CNPC at the Belt and Road International Forum in Beijing. The event was attended by a Gazprom delegation led by Alexey Miller, Chairman of the Gazprom Management Committee.In his speech at the roundtable, Alexey Miller noted that natural gas formed the basis for building an effective hi-tech economy. Thanks to its abundant availability, competitive prices, flexible supply channels, and diverse fields of application, gas is a perfect energy source that can help ensure the sustainable development of the energy industry for decades to come.Asian countries, above all China, have a similar vision of the future of the global energy industry. The Chinese Government is implementing a large-scale coal-to-gas program. In 2016 alone, over a thousand coal mines were shut down, with coal consumption and production dwindling for three consecutive years. Decommissioned capacities are mainly compensated by increased gas-fired power generation.China is one of the worlds biggest natural gas consumers. At the same time, the share of gas in the countrys energy mix is a mere 6 per cent. The Chinese Government intends to raise that figure to 8.310 per cent by 2020. In the context of Chinas economy, even a 1 per cent increase for gas in the energy balance could mean tens of billions of cubic meters in gas imports. Such amounts cannot be secured by the growing indigenous production alone.With its tremendous capabilities and unique competencies in the gas sector, Gazprom is committed to help China bring its ambitious plans for gas market development to fruition. The Company is currently building the Power of Siberia gas trunkline as part of the project for Russian gas supplies to China via the eastern route. It is the worlds largest investment project in the field of gas transportation. As of May 16, 2017, 745 kilometers of the pipeline were built and 1,009 kilometers were welded in one string. Gazprom is negotiating future gas deliveries from Russias Far East. It is planned to reach an agreement on the supply terms by the end of 2017.Gazproms cooperation with Chinese companies is not limited to gas supplies. On May 15, 2017, three contracts were signed at the Belt and Road Forum to conduct pre-development surveys for the purposes of creating underground gas storage facilities in Chinas Heilongjiang and Jiangsu provinces.Gas-fired power generation is yet another important area for collaboration between Gazprom and Chinese companies. In the course of the Belt and Road Forum, Gazprom, CNPC, and China Huaneng Group signed a Memorandum of Understanding to pursue joint efforts in the power sector within China. Power generation projects could give a new dimension to the established contract relationship, with commercial terms based on joint businesses in the Chinese territory.Alexey Miller underlined the enormous potential of Russian-Chinese interaction in the use of liquefied natural gas as a vehicle fuel. The Silk Road Economic Belt project proposed by the Chinese Government entails the creation of the Europe Western China international transport corridor, which will stretch for some 2,300 kilometers just in the Russian territory. On May 15, 2017, Gazprom, CNPC, Russian Highways, and China Communications Construction Company Ltd. inked a Memorandum of Cooperation aimed at developing road infrastructure and promoting the use of liquefied natural gas as a vehicle fuel along the aforementioned route.Russia and China also continue to expand their collaboration through such projects as the Silk Way international rally initiated by Gazprom. Similar to the Europe Western China transport corridor, the race passes through Russia, Kazakhstan, and China.Gas pipelines not only bring heat to homes, but also serve as a common thread for different economies, helping them thrive and develop. There is no doubt that the steel arteries of our gas trunklines, along with transport corridors running for thousands of kilometers, will become a symbol of the ever-growing strategic cooperation and connectivity between Russia and China in the 21st century, a shining example for the rest of the world, said Alexey Miller in conclusion of his speech.BackgroundThe roundtable participants included Liu He, Executive Director for Regulation of Chinas National Energy Administration, Wang Yilin, Chairman of the Board of Directors of CNPC, Zhang Jianhua, President of CNPC, Sauat Mynbayev, Chairman of the Board of KazMunayGas National Company, Alisher Sultanov, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Uzbekneftegaz, Rovnag Abdullayev, President of the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic, Wang Yupu, Chairman of Sinopec, Yuan Guangyu, Chief Executive Officer of CNOOC, Wang Yanzhi, President of Silk Road Fund, Wang Gefan, Chief Operations Officer of China Development Bank, Chan Chauto, President of CEFC China Energy Company Ltd., and other representatives of energy and financial companies.Gazproms main partner in China is CNPC, a state-owned oil and gas company.In 2014, Gazprom and CNPC signed the Sales and Purchase Agreement for Russian gas to be supplied via the eastern route (Power of Siberia gas pipeline). The 30-year Agreement provides for gas deliveries to China in the amount of 38 billion cubic meters per year.In 2015, Gazprom and CNPC inked the Heads of Agreement for pipeline deliveries of natural gas from Western Siberian fields to China via the western route (Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline).In 2015, Gazprom and CNPC inked the Memorandum of Understanding for the project of pipeline gas supplies to China from Russias Far East.In 2016, Gazprom and CNPC signed the Memorandum of Understanding on underground gas storage and gas-fired power generation in China.On November 7, 2016, Gazprom and CNPC signed the Memorandum to explore the opportunities for cooperation in the NGV sector.Load-Date: May 17, 2017End of Document

Yahoo accused of mismanaging fund for dissidents in ChinaAssociated Press InternationalApril 12, 2017 Wednesday 4:10 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: DOMESTIC NEWSLength: 443 wordsByline: By MICHAEL LIEDTKE, AP Technology WriterDateline: SAN FRANCISCO BodySAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A lawsuit accused Yahoo of breaking a financial promise it made to Chinese dissidents almost a decade ago as penance for helping the Chinese government find and jail other activists.The complaint, filed Tuesday in a Washington, D.C., federal court by a group of Chinese dissidents, contends that Yahoo mismanaged a $17 million fund set up to provide financial aid to activists.EMBROILED IN CHINAYahoo created the human rights fund in 2007, days after U.S. legislators roasted the company for providing authorities with information that led to the imprisonment of two Chinese dissidents, Wang Xiaoning and Shi Tao.The complaint alleges that Yahoo allowed Harry Wu, a now-deceased dissident from China, to spend about $13 million of the fund enriching himself and pursuing other projects tied to his interests.Only $700,000 has been doled out to Chinese dissidents who had been imprisoned for expressing their opinions online, the reason Yahoo bankrolled the fund, according to the lawsuit.Yahoo declined to comment.The plaintiffs want Yahoo to replenish the fund and to pay unspecified damages. The suit arrives at a delicate time for Yahoo, which is preparing to sell its online operations to Verizon Communications for $4.5 billion.LECTURED BY CONGRESSThe unflattering portrait drawn in the lawsuit represents yet another blotch on Yahoo's record in China.

China reportedly detains chief of insurer that held talks with Kushner firmCNN WireJune 14, 2017 Wednesday 3:21 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 527 wordsByline: By Alec MacfarlaneDateline: HONG KONG (CNNMoney) BodyHONG KONG (CNNMoney) --  The head of a deal-hungry Chinese insurer that recently held talks with the Kushner family over a New York office tower is reported to have been detained by Chinese authorities. Wu Xiaohui, the chairman of Anbang Insurance Group, was taken away Friday as part of a government investigation into the company, according to a report late Tuesday by Chinese business news magazine Caijing.Anbang has drawn global attention in recent years for its aggressive pursuit of assets around the world. It owns the Waldorf Astoria in New York and last year tried to buy Starwood Hotels. But the company, which has faced questions over who owns it, has also attracted scrutiny from Chinese authorities at a time when they're attempting to stabilize the country's financial services industry and clamp down on corruption.In a statement on its website, Anbang said Wu "cannot perform his duties due to personal reasons." It said other executives have stepped in and the company's operations are "all normal."The Caijing report, which cited multiple unidentified sources, was later deleted from the magazine's website without explanation. But The New York Times subsequently cited an Anbang executive and business partner as confirming Wu had been detained.A spokesman for Anbang declined to comment further on the situation.Anbang was founded in 2004 as a sleepy provincial car insurer and has since grown into an aggressive overseas buyer of insurers and real estate. It claims to have over 30,000 employees globally and more than 800 billion yuan ($118 billion) in assets. Its sprawling portfolio includes life insurers in the Netherlands and South Korea, a Belgian bank and luxury hotels.The firm has made a splash on the global stage in recent years, but mostly for deals that haven't worked out. In March, the family firm of Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, said talks with Anbang to redevelop a Manhattan office tower had been shelved. Members of Congress had raised concerns about the opaque insurer's ties to the Chinese government and a potential conflict of interest for Kushner.In April, U.S. life insurer Fidelity & Guaranty said it killed a deal to be bought by Anbang for $1.6 billion after deciding it was no longer in "the best interests" of its shareholders. A person familiar with the matter told CNNMoney at the time that officials in New York weren't satisfied with Anbang's disclosure of its ownership structure and asked the firm to refile its application, which it didn't do before a deadline. Anbang also walked away from its $14 billion offer for Starwood Hotels last year following a bidding war with Marriott International. It gave little explanation for abandoning its bid.This isn't the first time Anbang has landed itself in hot water with Chinese authorities. Just last month, the country's insurance regulator barred the firm from offering new insurance products for three months following what it described as "the improper sale" of those products.-- Serenitie Wang and Serena Dong contributed to this report.TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Cambodia deports 74 Chinese over alleged internet scamAssociated Press InternationalJuly 6, 2017 Thursday 7:09 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 140 wordsDateline: PHNOM PENH, Cambodia BodyPHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) - Cambodia has deported more than 70 Chinese citizens accused of defrauding people back home in an internet scam.Gen. Ouk Haiseila, chief of the Cambodian Interior Ministry's Immigration Investigation Bureau, said the 74 suspects were flown out of the capital on Thursday on a plane sent by the Chinese government.Police did not release any details on the alleged scam.Since 2012, Cambodia has deported at least 982 Chinese and Taiwanese to China.Deportations of Taiwanese to China are controversial because Cambodia defers to China's claim to sovereignty over the self-governing island. But the immigration investigation bureau chief said none of the suspects departed Thursday are Taiwanese.China is a key diplomatic ally of Cambodia and has provided millions of dollars in aid and investment over the past decade.Load-Date: July 7, 2017End of Document

Media: China's Silk Road Forum Proves Propaganda Power, Finds European DissentThe FrontrunnerMay 16, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 339 wordsBodyThe Washington Post (5/15, Rauhala, Denyer, 11.43M) reports the promotional campaign leading up to China's "Belt and Road Forum" is not only a projection of Chinese power, but also "a vivid display of the power of Chinese propaganda," in which "truths, half-truths and state-sanctioned talking points, mixed and repeated, begin to pass as fact." The Post says that while the impact of the "Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-century Maritime Silk Road" could be larger than the US-led Marshall Plan, international reactions have been mixed. The US, India and others have expressed concern about the Chinese program's geostrategic implications, and others question its social and environmental impact.Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal (5/15, Magnier, Wong, Subscription Publication, 6.37M) focuses on European dissent at the forum. Diplomats say China did not secure European endorsement of a planned statement on trade, a development that tarnished an apparently convivial gathering. The European officials said the trade statement left out clauses on transparency and standards in tendering contracts, despite China's endorsement of similar clean-governance language at past G20 and Asia-Europe summits. The Journal says a US National Security Council director gave brief remarks on Sunday that likewise emphasized the importance of fair procurement practices.US, European, Asian Trade Groups Push China To Delay Cybersecurity Law.The Wall Street Journal (5/15, Dou, Subscription Publication, 6.37M) reports 54 trade US, European, and Asian trade groups penned a letter Monday calling on China to delay the implementation of a cybersecurity law - adopted late last year and set to go into force June 1 - that sets up a committee that would conduct security reviews of technology products for the Chinese government and critical industries. The groups say the measure could discriminate against foreign business. Critics also say the measure's vague wording provides Chinese regulators with broad powers to block tech firms' products.Load-Date: May 17, 2017End of Document

Markets brush aside China rating downgradeAssociated Press InternationalMay 24, 2017 Wednesday 11:26 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; Financial MarketsLength: 389 wordsByline: By The Associated PressDateline: LONDON BodyLONDON (AP) - Global stock markets traded in narrow ranges Wednesday, with investors brushing aside Moody's decision to cut China's debt rating.KEEPING SCORE: In Europe, the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was up 0.3 percent at 7,506 while Germany's DAX fell 0.2 percent to 12,635. The CAC 40 in France was 0.1 percent lower at 5,341. U.S. shares were poised for a flat opening with both Dow futures and the broader S&P 500 futures unchanged.CHINESE DEBT: Moody's cut the Chinese government's rating to a still-relatively robust A1 from Aa3 and changed its outlook to stable from negative. The move, it said, reflects an expectation "China's financial strength will erode somewhat" and economy-wide debt will rise. The Chinese finance ministry criticized the move and said Moody's overestimated the difficulties facing the economy while failing to give adequate weight to economic reforms underway.ANALYST TAKE: "Today's ratings downgrade reveals little that investors didn't already know about credit growth in China and the risk that it requires the government to accept a big increase in its debt load in future," said Mark Williams, chief China economist at Capital Economics. "The greater concern though, we believe, should be that this debt build-up is contributing to a slowdown in China's sustainable growth rate."ASIA'S DAY: Following an early retreat, the Shanghai Composite Index ended up barely changed at 3,064.08. Hong Kong's Hang Seng ended little-changed at 25,428.50. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 rose 0.7 percent to 19,742.98 and Seoul's Kospi gained 0.2 percent to 2,317.34. Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 advanced 0.2 percent to 5,769.00.OPEC FOCUS: The OPEC oil cartel and other producers, notably Russia, are this week expected to extend last year's production cut in a concerted attempt to prevent oil prices from falling. With prices likely to fall because of an oversupply in the market if they don't, both Russia, and OPEC oil giant Saudi Arabia have spoken out in favor of an extension ahead of Thursday's meeting.ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 13 cents to $51.60 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange while Brent crude, used to price international oils, advanced 20 cents to $54.35 in London.CURRENCY: The euro was unchanged at $1.1186 while the dollar rose 0.1 percent to 111.82 yen.Load-Date: May 25, 2017End of Document

CHINESE NATIONAL PLEADS GUILTY TO ECONOMIC ESPIONAGE AND THEFT OF A TRADE SECRET FROM U.S. COMPANYStates News ServiceMay 19, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 1390 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Department of Justice:Today, Xu Jiaqiang, 31, formerly of Beijing, China, pleaded guilty to economic espionage and theft of a trade secret, in connection with Xu's theft of proprietary source code from Xu's former employer, with the intent to benefit the National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People's Republic of China. Xu pleaded guilty to all six counts with which he was charged.The announcement was made by Acting Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Dana Boente and Acting U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim for the Southern District of New York. The pleas were entered before U.S. District Judge Kenneth M. Karas in White Plains, New York federal court."Today, Xu pleaded guilty to stealing trade secrets from his former employer for his own profit and intending to benefit the People's Republic of China," said Acting Assistant Attorney General Boente. "The Economic Espionage Act is a key tool in protecting our economic and security interests. The National Security Division will pursue and prosecute any individual who steals intellectual property from American businesses to benefit a foreign government.""Xu Jiaqiang admitted and pled guilty today to stealing high tech trade secrets from a U.S. employer, intending to benefit the Chinese government. What Xu did was not only a federal crime, but a threat to our national security and the American spirit of innovation. Our Office is committed to finding, arresting and holding accountable those who take advantage of American businesses by engaging in economic espionage."According to the allegations contained in the Complaint and the Superseding Indictment filed against Xu, as well as statements made in related court filings and proceedings:From November 2010 to May 2014, Xu worked as a developer for a U.S. company (the "Victim Company"). As a developer, Xu enjoyed access to certain proprietary software (the "Proprietary Software"), as well as that software's underlying source code (the "Proprietary Source Code"). The Proprietary Software is a clustered file system developed and marketed by the Victim Company in the U.S. and other countries. A clustered file system facilitates faster computer performance by coordinating work among multiple servers. The Victim Company took significant precautions to protect the Proprietary Source Code as a trade secret. Among other things, the Proprietary Source Code is stored behind a company firewall and can be accessed only by a small subset of the Victim Company's employees. Before receiving Proprietary Source Code access, Victim Company employees must first request and receive approval from a Victim Company official. Victim Company employees must also agree in writing at both the outset and the conclusion of their employment that they will maintain the confidentiality of any proprietary information. The Victim Company took these and other precautions in part because the Proprietary Software and the Proprietary Source Code are economically valuable, which value depends in part on the Proprietary Source Code's secrecy.In May 2014, Xu voluntarily resigned from the Victim Company. Xu subsequently communicated with one undercover law enforcement officer ("UC-1"), who posed as a financial investor aiming to start a large-data storage technology company, and another undercover law enforcement officer ("UC-2"), who posed as a project manager, working for UC-1. In these communications, Xu discussed his past experience with the Victim Company and indicated that he had experience with the Proprietary Software and the Proprietary Source Code. On March 6, 2015, Xu sent UC-1 and UC-2 code, which Xu stated was a sample of Xu's prior work with the Victim Company. A Victim Company employee ("Employee-1") later confirmed that the code sent by Xu included proprietary Victim Company material that related to the Proprietary Source Code.Xu subsequently informed UC-2 that Xu was willing to consider providing UC-2's company with the Proprietary Source Code as a platform for UC-2's company to facilitate the development of its own data storage system. Xu informed UC-2 that if UC-2 set up several computers as a small network, then Xu would remotely install the Proprietary Software so that UC-1 and UC-2 could test it and confirm its functionality.In or around early August 2015, the FBI arranged for a computer network to be set up, consistent with Xu's specifications. Files were then remotely uploaded to the FBI-arranged computer network (the "Xu Upload"). Thereafter, on or about Aug. 26, 2015, Xu and UC-2 confirmed that UC-2 had received the Xu Upload. In September 2015, the FBI made the Xu Upload available to a Victim Company employee who has expertise regarding the Proprietary Software and the Proprietary Source Code ("Employee-2"). Based on Employee-2's analysis of technical features of the Xu Upload, it appeared to Employee-2 that the Xu Upload contained a functioning copy of the Proprietary Software. It further appeared to Employee-2 that the Xu Upload had been built by someone with access to the Proprietary Source Code who was not working within the Victim Company or otherwise at the Victim Company's direction.On Dec. 7, 2015, Xu met with UC-2 at a hotel in White Plains, New York (the "Hotel"). Xu stated, in sum and substance, that Xu had used the Proprietary Source Code to make software to sell to customers, that Xu knew the Proprietary Source Code to be the product of decades of work on the part of the Victim Company, and that Xu had used the Proprietary Source Code to build a copy of the Proprietary Software, which Xu had uploaded and installed on the UC Network (i.e., the Xu Upload). Xu also indicated that Xu knew the copy of the Proprietary Software that Xu had installed on the UC Network contained information identifying the Proprietary Software as the Victim Company's property, which could reveal the fact that the Proprietary Software had been built with the Proprietary Source Code without the Victim Company's authorization. Xu told UC-2 that Xu could take steps to prevent detection of the Proprietary Software's origins i.e., that it had been built with stolen Proprietary Source Code including writing computer scripts that would modify the Proprietary Source Code to conceal its origins.Later on Dec. 7, 2015, Xu met with UC-1 and UC-2 at the Hotel. During that meeting, Xu showed UC-2 a copy of what Xu represented to be the Proprietary Source Code on Xu's laptop. Xu noted to UC-2 a portion of the code that indicated it originated with the Victim Company as well as the date on which it had been copyrighted. Xu also stated that Xu had previously modified the Proprietary Source Code's command interface to conceal the fact that the Proprietary Source Code originated with the Victim Company and identified multiple specific customers to whom Xu had previously provided the Proprietary Software using Xu's stolen copy of the Proprietary Source Code.In connection with the economic espionage counts charged in the Superseding Indictment, Xu stole, duplicated, and possessed the Proprietary Source Code with the intent to benefit the National Health and Planning Commission of the People's Republic of China.Xu pleaded guilty to three counts of economic espionage, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison, and three counts of theft of a trade secret, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. The maximum statutory sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes. If convicted of any offense, the sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the court based on the advisory Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.Xu's sentencing is scheduled for October 13.Mr. Kim praised the FBI's outstanding investigative efforts. He also thanked the U.S. Department of Justice's National Security Division.The case is being handled by the Office's Terrorism and International Narcotics Unit and its White Plains Division. The prosecution is being handled by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Benjamin Allee, Ilan Graff and Shane T. Stansbury for the Southern District of New York, with assistance from Trial Attorney David Aaron of the National Security Division's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.Load-Date: May 19, 2017End of Document

China Flouts Global Trade Rules to Detriment of U.S. Advanced Industries, ITIF Testifies Before House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee; Time for New Doctrine of Constructive, Alliance-Backed ConfrontationTargeted News ServiceApril 26, 2017 Wednesday 4:39 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 664 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Information Technology and Innovation Foundation issued the following news release:China is flouting global rules and norms governing trade and economic policy, threating the U.S. economy and its advanced-technology industries, as well as the entire global economy, said Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), in testimony today before the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific. It's time for a new response to China's "innovation mercantilism" that moves beyond passive dialogue and toward constructive, alliance-backed confrontation, Atkinson urged. U.S. policymakers should lead an international coalition that pressures the Chinese government to stop rigging markets and start competing on fair terms."Previous U.S. administrations sought engagement and dialogue with China's leaders in the hope that it would compel China to give up on its mercantilist policies. But that hasn't worked," argued Atkinson, who leads the top-ranked U.S. science- and tech-policy think tank in North America. "Rather than reform, China has doubled down on its unfair, mercantilist strategies and is now seeking global dominance in a wide array of advanced industries that are key to U.S. economic and national security interests. It's time for a new approach.""Any effort to confront China needs to involve a strong and unified coalition, because China is no longer as dependent as it used to be on the U.S. economy--and countries like Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom have all been hurt by China's mercantilism, too. By working together, we can show China it has no good options other than modifying its unfair industrial strategy."Atkinson explained there is an important difference between losing commodity-based, low-skilled industries to China, as happened in the 2000s, and being challenged for leadership in advanced, technology-based industries, as we are seeing now. When the United States loses its advantage in these advanced industries, it is especially harmful, because they pay about 75 percent more than average U.S. wages. It is also detrimental to U.S. national security and the defense industrial base because U.S. defense leadership is not based principally on America's size or budget, but on its technological prowess, said Atkinson.Atkinson's testimony detailed how China has positioned itself as the main economic rival for the United States through a mercantilist strategy that hinges on both defensive protectionism and offensive efforts to dominate a wide array of advanced-technology industries, including semiconductors. Its tactics include stealing competitors' intellectual property, making market access contingent on handing over proprietary technologies, lavishly subsidizing Chinese technology enterprises, and more.Atkinson recommended that Congress and the Trump administration take a two-pronged approach to confronting China: First, U.S. policymakers should work with other nations to limit China's ability to access the most important technologies and roll back China's broader unfair mercantilist practices, including subsidies for domestic firms. Second, the United States must develop and implement its own strategy to bolster its competitiveness in advanced industries."Implementing a strategic, measured, and respectful approach with China will not only level the playing field so American companies can effectively compete with Chinese companies there and around the world, but also help restore faith in the integrity of the global trading system. Pairing that with a national innovation strategy will help ensure that U.S. technology firms maintain global market share, securing not just good U.S. jobs, but U.S. defense capabilities."Read written testimony (http://www2.itif.org/2017-testimony-foreign-affairs-committee-china.pdf?_ga=2.92254042.1102067228.1493282393-590304636.1491648095).Copyright Targeted News Services88Kelton-5846278 88KeltonLoad-Date: April 27, 2017End of Document

Combined, these developments will work to enable the Company to provide educational opportunities to Chinese students who seek a joint  international degree program between U.S. schools and a Chinese school,international vocational training certificate program, students' international study tour and other programs.Highlights of DevelopmentsOn June 26, 2017, PDN finalized the formation of AETSI, Inc., a Delaware wholly-owned subsidiary which will operate the U.S. side of the Company's international education services division.On July 4, 2017, PDN (China) International Cultural Development Company, Limited, the Company's wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary, finalized a partnership with Ji'An College in China to deliver educational services to Chinese students seeking an international joint degree program,  international vocational training certificate program, students' international study tour and other programs.The Company is in negotiations with several U.S. schools and expects to finalize its choice of a U.S. college or university partner in the near future.The Company expects its partnership to service part of the large demand for career based education in China and benefit economically from fees relating to advising students from application to graduation and ultimately for career placement activities.Today's announcement continues the Company's delivery on its expectations regarding its new business operations in China. PDN has previously announced its plans to commence business operations in three Chinese market sectors: (1) education and training for business people; (2) networking, skills and lifestyle services for successful women through the Company's International Association of Women ("IAW"); and (3) international education services.First, on June 26, 2017, the Company updated its previous announcements on the success of what have now been six "Shared Economy Events," the venue through which PDN is providing for-profit education and training for Chinese business people.Second, the Company  has launched its services for successful Chinese women by holding its first IAW event in China  at the end of June. The Company will disclose details in a separate release.Now, the Company announces that its business in the third China market sector it identified    the provision of secondary school international education services    is well underway. The provision of these services requires schools in the U.S. and China to partner with PDN.

Due to the Chinese government's identification of nursing as a key sector for strategic development, the Company intends to first focus on joint nursing education using Jiangxi Ji'An College and its U.S. partner school. The Company's recent formation of its new, wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary, AETSI, Inc. (the Association of Education and Training Schools International, or "AETSI"), allows the Company to formalize an agreement with a U.S. school or schools, the negotiations for which are already in progress and expected to be complete by the end of July. PDN anticipates that it will begin to deliver these international education services during the 2017 academic year.Jim Kirsch, PDN's Executive Co-Chairman, said "We could not be more pleased with our progress and the delivery on our commitment to our shareholders. We identified three Chinese market sectors and, with today's announcement, are operating in each.

CHINESE NATIONAL PLEADS GUILTY TO ECONOMIC ESPIONAGE AND THEFT OF A TRADE SECRET FROM U.S. COMPANYUS Fed NewsMay 19, 2017 Friday 3:40 PM  ESTCopyright 2017 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 1373 wordsBodyNEW YORK, May 19 -- The US Department of Justice's US Attorney's office for Southern District of New York issued the following press release:Joon H. Kim, the Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and Dana Boente, Acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security, announced today that XU JIAQIANG pled guilty to economic espionage and theft of a trade secret, in connection with XU's theft of proprietary source code from XU's former employer, with the intent to benefit the National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People's Republic of China. XU pled guilty earlier today to all six counts with which he was charged, before the U.S. District Judge Kenneth M. Karas in White Plains federal court.Acting U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim said: "Xu Jiaqiang admitted and pled guilty today to stealing high tech trade secrets from a U.S. employer, intending to benefit the Chinese government. What Xu did was not only a federal crime, but a threat to our national security and the American spirit of innovation. Our Office is committed to finding, arresting and holding accountable those who take advantage of American businesses by engaging in economic espionage."Acting Assistant Attorney General Dana Boente said: "Today, Xu pleaded guilty to stealing trade secrets from his former employer for his own profit and intending to benefit the People's Republic of China. The Economic Espionage Act is a key tool in protecting our economic and security interests. The National Security Division will pursue and prosecute any individual who steals intellectual property from American businesses to benefit a foreign government."According to the allegations contained in the Complaint and the Superseding Indictment filed against XU, as well as statements made in related court filings and proceedings:From November 2010 to May 2014, XU worked as a developer for a particular U.S. company (the "Victim Company"). As a developer, XU enjoyed access to certain proprietary software (the "Proprietary Software"), as well as that software's underlying source code (the "Proprietary Source Code"). The Proprietary Software is a clustered file system developed and marketed by the Victim Company in the United States and other countries. A clustered file system facilitates faster computer performance by coordinating work among multiple servers. The Victim Company takes significant precautions to protect the Proprietary Source Code as a trade secret. Among other things, the Proprietary Source Code is stored behind a company firewall and can be accessed only by a small subset of the Victim Company's employees. Before receiving Proprietary Source Code access, Victim Company employees must first request and receive approval from a particular Victim Company official. Victim Company employees must also agree in writing at both the outset and the conclusion of their employment that they will maintain the confidentiality of any proprietary information. The Victim Company takes these and other precautions in part because the Proprietary Software and the Proprietary Source Code are economically valuable, which value depends in part on the Proprietary Source Code's secrecy.In May 2014, XU voluntarily resigned from the Victim Company. XU subsequently communicated with one undercover law enforcement officer ("UC-1"), who posed as a financial investor aiming to start a large-data storage technology company, and another undercover law enforcement officer ("UC-2"), who posed as a project manager, working for UC-1. these communications, XU discussed his past experience with the Victim Company and indicated that he had experience with the Proprietary Software and the Proprietary Source Code. On March 6, 2015, XU sent UC-1 and UC-2 a code, which XU stated was a sample of XU's prior work with the Victim Company. A Victim Company employee ("Employee-1") later confirmed that the code sent by XU included proprietary Victim Company material that related to the Proprietary Source Code.XU subsequently informed UC-2 that XU was willing to consider providing UC-2's company with the Proprietary Source Code as a platform for UC-2's company to facilitate the development of its own data storage system. XU informed UC-2 that if UC-2 set up several computers as a small network, then XU would remotely install the Proprietary Software so that UC-1 and UC-2 could test it and confirm its functionality.In or around early August 2015, the FBI arranged for a computer network to be set up, consistent with XU's specifications. Files were then remotely uploaded to the FBI-arranged computer network (the "Xu Upload"). Thereafter, on or about August 26, 2015, XU and UC-2 confirmed that UC-2 had received the Xu Upload. In September 2015, the FBI made the Xu Upload available to a Victim Company employee who has expertise regarding the Proprietary Software and the Proprietary Source Code ("Employee-2"). Based on Employee-2's analysis of technical features of the Xu Upload, it appeared to Employee-2 that the Xu Upload contained a functioning copy of the Proprietary Software. It further appeared to Employee-2 that the Xu Upload had been built by someone with access to the Proprietary Source Code who was not working within the Victim Company or otherwise at the Victim Company's direction.On December 7, 2015, XU met with UC-2 at a hotel in White Plains, New York (the "Hotel"). XU stated, in sum and substance, that XU had used the Proprietary Source Code to make software to sell to customers, that XU knew the Proprietary Source Code to be the product of decades of work on the part of the Victim Company, and that XU had used the Proprietary Source Code to build a copy of the Proprietary Software, which XU had uploaded and installed on the UC Network (i.e., the Xu Upload). XU also indicated that XU knew the copy of the Proprietary Software that XU had installed on the UC Network contained information identifying the Proprietary Software as the Victim Company's property, which could reveal the fact that the Proprietary Software had been built with the Proprietary Source Code without the Victim Company's authorization. XU told UC-2 that XU could take steps to prevent detection of the Proprietary Software's origins - i.e., that it had been built with stolen Proprietary Source Code - including writing computer scripts that would modify the Proprietary Source Code to conceal its origins.Later on December 7, 2015, XU met with UC-1 and UC-2 at the Hotel. During that meeting, XU showed UC-2 a copy of what XU represented to be the Proprietary Source Code on XU's laptop. XU noted to UC-2 a portion of the code that indicated it originated with the Victim Company as well as the date on which it had been copyrighted. XU also stated that XU had previously modified the Proprietary Source Code's command interface to conceal the fact that the Proprietary Source Code originated with the Victim Company and identified multiple specific customers to whom XU had previously provided the Proprietary Software using XU's stolen copy of the Proprietary Source Code.XU, 31, formerly of Beijing, China, pled guilty to three counts of economic espionage, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison, and three counts of theft of a trade secret, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the judge.Xu's sentencing is scheduled for October 13, 2017.Mr. Kim praised the FBI's outstanding investigative efforts. He also thanked the U.S. Department of Justice's National Security Division.The case is being handled by the Office's Terrorism and International Narcotics Unit and its White Plains Division. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Benjamin Allee, Ilan Graff, and Shane T. Stansbury, with assistance from Trial Attorney David Aaron of the National Security Division's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, are in charge of the prosecution.

Mobility trends: What's ahead for automotive semiconductorsMcKinsey & CompanyApril 28, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 McKinsey & Company, Inc All Rights ReservedLength: 3681 wordsByline: McKinsey & CompanyHighlight: New mobility trends are diversifying demand for automotive semiconductors. Here's what companies need to know about new opportunities.Body Link to Image Consumers who arrived in Las Vegas for the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show-one of the premiere exhibitions of new technologies for the general public-might have wondered if they were at an auto show. This annual conference, which attracts leading high-tech companies across sectors, featured more than 500 exhibits on mobility solutions for cars. Many global automotive OEMs and automotive suppliers participated, introducing innovative sensors, mapping applications, connectivity platforms, and other new technologies. These improvements, combined with the expansion of electric vehicles (EVs), will alter mobility-the market that includes public and private transport, as well as the transportation of goods. In the new environment, a car's electronic components and functionalities-already an important buying consideration-may become the feature that differentiates it from the crowd. Semiconductors have enabled most of the recent innovations in automotive technology, including vision-based, enhanced graphics processing units (GPUs) and application processors, sensors, and DRAM and NAND flash. As cars become even more complex, demand for automotive semiconductors will continue to rise steadily and provide a major new long-term growth engine. With many semiconductor companies aggressively pursuing automotive opportunities and forming partnerships along the value chain, players that move more slowly might be left behind. This article discusses three topics that all semiconductor companies must consider as they prepare for the future: trends shaping the automotive landscape, factors that affect demand for automotive semiconductors, and major strategic issues that players must address as they adapt to the evolving market. The evolving automotive market The automotive market has seldom experienced so many simultaneous disruptions. In the past few years, we have seen various technologies increasingly incorporated into the mass production of cars, including matrix LED lights, enhanced lidar sensors-those that use lasers to measure distance to a target-and better camera-based sensors. We have also seen improvements in 3-D mapping applications, EV batteries, and augmented-reality technologies, such as heads-up displays. And 5G networks-the next generation of mobility solutions-could soon be available. On the customer side, we are seeing new preferences and attitudes toward cars-for instance, a decrease in the number of consumers who consider vehicle ownership important. In a 2016 McKinsey report, Automotive revolution-perspective towards 2030, we reviewed the major forces shaping the industry, focusing on four that we deemed particularly important.Vehicle electrification. Excluding full hybrids-cars that can run using just battery power-EVs represented less than 1 percent of new-vehicle sales in 2016. Over the next decade, however, their sales could surge as technological advances address two major impediments to growth: high battery costs and limited charging capabilities. EVs could represent about 5 to 10 percent of car sales by 2020, depending on the extent to which they comply with emission regulations, and between 35 and 50 percent by 2030. The latter estimate is broad because it is difficult to predict many factors that affect growth, including the rate of technological advance, government regulations, and shifts in electricity and oil prices.Increased connectivity. With hands-free mobile service and online navigation now standard in most new vehicles, automotive players have moved to the next wave of innovation in connected cars. New offerings include telematics services that rely on human-machine interfaces, including voice assistance (such as turn-by-turn audio instructions) and eCall (a program that prompts vehicles to make automatic calls to emergency services in the event of a crash). Both vehicle-to-infrastructure and vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity are increasing and will be supported by 5G networks by around 2020. For instance, BMW vehicles connect to smart-home services such as Deutsche Telekom's SmartHome app, which allows drivers to adjust their home's heating and lighting while they are on the road. Connectivity strongly influences vehicle-purchase decisions and may have an even greater impact in the future. In a 2016 McKinsey survey of 3,000 consumers in three countries, 41 percent of respondents stated that they would switch to a new vehicle brand to obtain better connectivity.1 The survey also showed that connectivity features are particularly important in certain countries. For instance, 62 percent of Chinese buyers stated that they would be willing to shift to a new brand to obtain the latest connectivity features, compared with 37 percent of drivers in the United States and 25 percent in Germany. As connectivity solutions become more important, the revenue they produce for OEMs could rise from about $30 billion today to more than $60 billion by 2020.The growth of autonomous driving. Although OEMs have introduced many new advanced-driver-assistance-systems features, such as automatic braking and adaptive cruise control, highly autonomous vehicles-in other words, level 4 cars-are not expected to hit the road until sometime between 2020 and 2025 (see sidebar, "How are autonomous cars classified based on their driving capabilities?"). They could then experience steady growth, with McKinsey's most highly disruptive scenario for 2030 suggesting that 35 percent of cars sold will have conditional automation (level 3) and 15 percent will have high automation (level 4). The exact growth trajectory will depend on multiple factors, including improvements in core technologies, pricing, consumer acceptance of self-driving cars, and the ability of OEMs and suppliers to address fundamental concerns about safety and the potential for hacking.Shared mobility services. While car-ownership rates have been increasing in developed markets, they are expected to slow or remain flat with the rise of shared mobility services and the rapid growth of car-sharing and e-hailing services such as car2go. In North America, for instance, membership in car-sharing services increased more than 400 percent between 2008 and 2015. Even greater gains are expected in the future. One McKinsey forecast suggests that e-hailing or ride-sharing services could account for 10 percent of vehicle purchases by 2030-a shift that is prompting many OEMs to increase their efforts to capture this market.A shifting and diversifying revenue poolGlobal automotive revenue now totals about $3.5 trillion annually, with the vast majority coming from new-car sales and the aftermarket (repairs and other services provided after an initial vehicle purchase) (Exhibit 1). Only $30 billion, or less than 1 percent of the total, can be attributed to recurring revenue-a broad category that includes proceeds resulting from e-hailing or car-sharing services, as well as those from data-connectivity services such as apps, navigation tools, in-vehicle entertainment, and software upgrades. We are about to see major changes in both the size and composition of the revenue pool, however. Under one highly disruptive scenario, it could total more than $6.7 trillion by 2030, with $5.2 trillion, or about 78 percent, coming from new-car sales and the aftermarket. Recurring revenue, expected to total more than $1.5 trillion, would account for the remaining 22 percent-a 50-fold increase from 2015. The four trends just described will play an important role in the revenue pool's diversification and growth. The increase in recurring revenue that results from the rise of mobility services and greater connectivity is perhaps the most striking change. But the four trends will also affect other areas. For instance, autonomous vehicles (both levels 3 and 4) have high price points, which will increase revenue from new-car sales. Within the aftermarket, new mobility services will raise revenue, because shared vehicles have higher maintenance costs. However, there will also be downward pressure in the aftermarket, because EV powertrains are less expensive to maintain than those for conventional vehicles, and crash-repair costs for autonomous cars can be up to 90 percent lower. All of these shifts could change the source of demand for semiconductors and other components. Implications for the automotive-semiconductor market Despite the potential uncertainties, we expect demand for automotive semiconductors to increase over the mid- to long term as the industry tries to enhance safety, comfort, and connectivity features within vehicles. The move to automated-driving capabilities will be particularly significant. Over the long term, the growth of the EV segment will also accelerate growth, because hybrid EVs contain about $900 worth of semiconductors, while standard EVs have more than $1,000 worth-much higher than the average $330 value for the semiconductor content of conventional vehicles. Between 1995 and 2015, semiconductor sales to automotive OEMs rose from about $7 billion to $30 billion (Exhibit 2). With this increase, automotive semiconductors now represent close to 9 percent of the industry's total sales. Current projections suggest that sales of automotive semiconductors will continue on their upward trajectory, increasing about 6 percent annually between 2015 and 2020-higher than the 3 to 4 percent growth predicted for the semiconductor sector as a whole. That would put annual sales for automotive semiconductors in the $39 billion to $42 billion range. Although the opportunities ahead appear vast, our analysis of the automotive-semiconductor sector suggests that they will differ significantly by geography, automotive-application segment, and device segment. We have explored some of these variations to guide semiconductor companies in strategic planning. Geographic growth: New forces rising in the automotive-semiconductor industry Although the Americas and Europe account for most demand in automotive semiconductors, China now leads the world in annual sales growth, with average gains of 15 percent between 2010 and 2015 (Exhibit 3). China is expected to remain the world leader in sales growth, although average gains will fall to 10 percent through 2020, since the country's economy is slowing and car sales, which have been surging, may flatten. Demand by device and application segment: A shifting landscape In addition to studying geographic trends, we explored how semiconductor demand might change for core automotive-application segments and device categories.Identifying pockets of growth among diverse automotive-application segments. We examined growth patterns in the core-application segments: safety, powertrain, body, chassis, and driver information. Trends suggest that the greatest growth through 2020 will occur within the safety segment (Exhibit 4). Within each core-application segment, some product categories will see much higher growth than others. For instance, within the safety category, collision-warning systems are expected to have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22 percent between 2015 and 2020, when sales will reach $4.1 billion. Looking at long-term developments after 2020, we expect continued growth in the engine-control segment, including e-motors and power electronics. We will also see more growth in integrated systems and solutions, such as engine-control units (ECUs) for fusion sensors and integrated-control systems that enable level 4 autonomous driving.Understanding device growth. We also examined semiconductor demand across device segments: memory, microcomponents, logic, analog, optical and sensors, and discretes. While some segments will see more growth than others, we do not expect any major shifts through 2020. Around that time, EVs will begin to proliferate. In addition to containing more semiconductor content than conventional vehicles, EVs also require different types of automotive semiconductors, which will shift demand patterns. For instance, up to 10 percent of automotive semiconductors in conventional cars are incorporated into discretes (power electronics). By contrast, about 35 to 40 percent of automotive semiconductors in hybrid EVs are in discretes, as are up to 50 percent of those in other EVs. Even though EVs are not expected to gain widespread popularity until around 2020, sales of these vehicles are already trending upward. That means demand for automotive semiconductors is already beginning to shift. As with the core automotive-application segments, there will be pockets of opportunity within each semiconductor-device segment. For instance, with the microcomponent segment, the CAGR will be highest for microprocessor units (14 percent) and more moderate for microcontroller units (MCUs) (9 percent) and digital signal processors (3 percent) (Exhibit 5). After 2020, we still expect growth to continue in all core segments. However, the growth of autonomous driving and EVs will benefit some applications, such as GPUs and sensors, more than others. Strategic questions and next steps We have engaged in many discussions with semiconductor-industry leaders, as well as experts in the Americas, Asia, and Europe, about the challenges ahead in the automotive industry. Their critical questions include the following: How can we differentiate our offerings? Most leaders mentioned that a focus on hardware would not deliver the desired value in the evolving automotive industry. They all wanted to provide systems or solutions by adding software algorithms to their offerings, and some are also working with partners to differentiate their products in other ways. For example, NVIDIA recently announced that it plans to continue collaborating with the high-definition (HD) mapping player HERE. Together, they will develop HERE HD Live Map, a real-time mapping product for autonomous vehicles. Intel also announced the creation of the Intel GO Automotive 5G platform. This is the one of the first 5G platforms that would allow automotive manufacturers and tier-one suppliers to proof their designs for 5G. If companies focus on systems, rather than the addition of individual chips, they can avoid intense price pressures. For example, NXP Semiconductors just launched a software-defined radio solution for in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) systems called the SAF4000. The company claims that this is the world's first one-chip system covering all global audio broadcast standards, including AM/FM, DAB+, DRM(+), and HD. Will we see any changes regarding the life cycle of semiconductors in vehicles? In the future, we may see OEMs purchasing chips at more frequent intervals, as long as a car is on the market. This trend will gain momentum as upgrades for optional features, such as IVI, are decoupled from other hardware upgrades, such as those related to powertrains. How much integration is needed to reduce material costs while ensuring redundancy? Some leaders are trying to build systems as an integrated unit, with multiple MEMS, MCUs, and other sensors, to ensure redundancy. In this context, redundancy refers to duplication of critical components or functions of a system to increase reliability of the system. For instance, redundancy may provide a backup or fail-safe. OEMs might also find that certain redundancies improve performance, such as the inclusion of additional ECUs. Some have also investigated the use of x-by-wire (electrical or electromechanical systems that perform vehicle functions traditionally controlled by mechanical linkages) for braking or steering. Questions remain, however, about how much redundancy is needed and when industry players will feel comfortable with less of it. How should semiconductor companies collaborate with automotive OEMs and tier-one suppliers? Semiconductor companies are increasingly working directly with both OEMs and tier-one automotive suppliers. For instance, BMW, Intel, and Mobileye announced that they have collaborated to create a fleet of about 40 autonomous test vehicles that will be on the roads by the second half of 2017. Similarly, Audi said that its continued collaboration with NVIDIA will introduce innovative features to its newest A8 luxury sedan, including systems that enable automated driving in complicated situations, such as those involving highways and traffic jams. Audi and NVIDIA have also formed a partnership to create what they have described as the "world's most advanced AI [artificial-intelligence] car," which they hope to have on the road by 2020. For collaborations to succeed, semiconductor companies must first identify the areas where these opportunities bring complementary skills-for instance, a venture where their hardware expertise could benefit a company with strong software skills. They should then decide which form of collaboration-M&A deals, joint ventures, exclusive partnerships, or strategic partnerships-will best suit their needs. How will the automotive landscape evolve and will this affect semiconductor companies? Some shifts in the competitive landscape and the value chain could affect semiconductor players. Although leading global OEMs are expected to remain dominant within the global market, those that focus on the mass market may start to lose revenue share as disruptive players, including new Chinese OEMs, establish or expand their operations. Information and communication technology (ICT) players in other countries are also seeing demand grow for their products, including sensors and software, which could give them a larger role in the value chain. Finally, some tier-one automotive suppliers could gain bargaining power equivalent to that of less dominant OEMs. How far should we expand into security offerings? It will be critical for semiconductor companies to incorporate security features into chips, but this will not entirely address all safety concerns, including those related to hacking. In consequence, they should also consider developing other security solutions, especially in the neglected area of automotive connectivity. A few semiconductor players, such as NXP Semiconductors, are already working with automotive partners to develop end-to-end security solutions, and others may follow their example. As they embark on security ventures, semiconductor companies may find some inspiration from companies in other high-tech sectors that have created innovative offerings. For instance, Bosch recently announced a keyless entry and start product that allows drivers to access their vehicles securely, using only a smartphone that provides full encryption. How should we address the China market? Semiconductor companies should look at the China market from several angles. While it will be an important source of demand, the country could also become a major testing location for autonomous cars and EVs, partly because the consumer market has some unique characteristics. In the 2016 McKinsey survey of more than 3,000 car buyers in three countries, we found that Chinese consumers were more open to car-to-car data sharing-having vehicles exchange information about location, speed, and other factors-than drivers in Germany and the United States.2 We also found that they were more willing to upgrade the IVI within their vehicles. Both of these factors might encourage automotive OEMs to test and market new automotive technologies in China, especially since car-ownership rates are rapidly growing. China also provides semiconductor companies with a large and diverse pool of potential partners for automotive ventures. This fact was on display at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show, where Chinese companies had more than 1,300 displays and accounted for more than 20 percent of the 500 exhibits on vehicle technology. As in the United States and other countries, some of the most promising partners may be new entrants into the automotive sector. For instance, Baidu, the Chinese web giant, is attempting to develop its autonomous-driving and EV technology through partnerships with global OEMs. Semiconductor companies can also be optimistic about China-both as a market and a source of partners-because the Chinese government has launched several initiatives to support domestic manufacturing. For instance, the government's "Made in China 2025" policy provides subsidies and other incentives to local companies that upgrade their facilities and focus on innovation. Semiconductor companies may thus find that the pool of potential partners will become even more substantial in coming years. The Chinese government has also displayed a strong interest in promoting technologies for autonomous cars and EVs, as well as technologies related to the Internet of Things that enable many connected car features. The government's support has already encouraged more automotive and ICT players to establish a stronger presence in China. Many semiconductor companies are moving quickly to develop automotive innovations, with some poised to become leading suppliers to OEMs that market autonomous vehicles and EVs. Other players, however, have been slow to form partnerships with automotive players or further invest in technologies that will meet their needs, perhaps because they are reluctant to assume the risks associated with an uncertain and rapidly evolving market. But those companies that hesitate to address strategic questions may now lose market share to more aggressive competitors, even if they take decisive action later. With the automotive market poised to serve as one of the semiconductor industry's greatest growth drivers, their lack of action is the real risk.About the authorsStefan Burghardt is a specialist in McKinsey's Munich office, where Florian Weig is a senior partner; Seunghyuk Choi is an associate partner in the Seoul office.Footnotes1  McKinsey connectivity and autonomous driving consumer survey, 2016.  2  McKinsey connectivity and autonomous driving consumer survey, 2016.  McKinsey InsightsFor more of McKinsey's latest thinking, install our app for iPad or            Android.Load-Date: February 20, 2020End of Document

Mobility trends: What\x92s ahead for automotive semiconductorsMcKinsey & CompanyApril 28, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 McKinsey & Company, Inc All Rights ReservedLength: 3672 wordsByline: McKinsey & CompanyHighlight: New mobility trends are diversifying demand for automotive semiconductors. Here\x92s what companies need to know about new opportunities.Body Link to Image Consumers who arrived in Las Vegas for the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show-one of the premiere exhibitions of new technologies for the general public-might have wondered if they were at an auto show. This annual conference, which attracts leading high-tech companies across sectors, featured more than 500 exhibits on mobility solutions for cars. Many global automotive OEMs and automotive suppliers participated, introducing innovative sensors, mapping applications, connectivity platforms, and other new technologies. These improvements, combined with the expansion of electric vehicles (EVs), will alter mobility-the market that includes public and private transport, as well as the transportation of goods. In the new environment, a car's electronic components and functionalities-already an important buying consideration-may become the feature that differentiates it from the crowd.Semiconductors have enabled most of the recent innovations in automotive technology, including vision-based, enhanced graphics processing units (GPUs) and application processors, sensors, and DRAM and NAND flash. As cars become even more complex, demand for automotive semiconductors will continue to rise steadily and provide a major new long-term growth engine.With many semiconductor companies aggressively pursuing automotive opportunities and forming partnerships along the value chain, players that move more slowly might be left behind. This article discusses three topics that all semiconductor companies must consider as they prepare for the future: trends shaping the automotive landscape, factors that affect demand for automotive semiconductors, and major strategic issues that players must address as they adapt to the evolving market.The evolving automotive marketThe automotive market has seldom experienced so many simultaneous disruptions. In the past few years, we have seen various technologies increasingly incorporated into the mass production of cars, including matrix LED lights, enhanced lidar sensors-those that use lasers to measure distance to a target-and better camera-based sensors. We have also seen improvements in 3-D mapping applications, EV batteries, and augmented-reality technologies, such as heads-up displays. And 5G networks-the next generation of mobility solutions-could soon be available. On the customer side, we are seeing new preferences and attitudes toward cars-for instance, a decrease in the number of consumers who consider vehicle ownership important.In a 2016 McKinsey report, Automotive revolution-perspective towards 2030, we reviewed the major forces shaping the industry, focusing on four that we deemed particularly important.Vehicle electrification. Excluding full hybrids-cars that can run using just battery power-EVs represented less than 1 percent of new-vehicle sales in 2016. Over the next decade, however, their sales could surge as technological advances address two major impediments to growth: high battery costs and limited charging capabilities. EVs could represent about 5 to 10 percent of car sales by 2020, depending on the extent to which they comply with emission regulations, and between 35 and 50 percent by 2030. The latter estimate is broad because it is difficult to predict many factors that affect growth, including the rate of technological advance, government regulations, and shifts in electricity and oil prices.Increased connectivity. With hands-free mobile service and online navigation now standard in most new vehicles, automotive players have moved to the next wave of innovation in connected cars. New offerings include telematics services that rely on human-machine interfaces, including voice assistance (such as turn-by-turn audio instructions) and eCall (a program that prompts vehicles to make automatic calls to emergency services in the event of a crash). Both vehicle-to-infrastructure and vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity are increasing and will be supported by 5G networks by around 2020. For instance, BMW vehicles connect to smart-home services such as Deutsche Telekom's SmartHome app, which allows drivers to adjust their home's heating and lighting while they are on the road.Connectivity strongly influences vehicle-purchase decisions and may have an even greater impact in the future. In a 2016 McKinsey survey of 3,000 consumers in three countries, 41 percent of respondents stated that they would switch to a new vehicle brand to obtain better connectivity.1 The survey also showed that connectivity features are particularly important in certain countries. For instance, 62 percent of Chinese buyers stated that they would be willing to shift to a new brand to obtain the latest connectivity features, compared with 37 percent of drivers in the United States and 25 percent in Germany. As connectivity solutions become more important, the revenue they produce for OEMs could rise from about $30 billion today to more than $60 billion by 2020.The growth of autonomous driving. Although OEMs have introduced many new advanced-driver-assistance-systems features, such as automatic braking and adaptive cruise control, highly autonomous vehicles-in other words, level 4 cars-are not expected to hit the road until sometime between 2020 and 2025 (see sidebar, "How are autonomous cars classified based on their driving capabilities?"). They could then experience steady growth, with McKinsey's most highly disruptive scenario for 2030 suggesting that 35 percent of cars sold will have conditional automation (level 3) and 15 percent will have high automation (level 4). The exact growth trajectory will depend on multiple factors, including improvements in core technologies, pricing, consumer acceptance of self-driving cars, and the ability of OEMs and suppliers to address fundamental concerns about safety and the potential for hacking.Shared mobility services. While car-ownership rates have been increasing in developed markets, they are expected to slow or remain flat with the rise of shared mobility services and the rapid growth of car-sharing and e-hailing services such as car2go. In North America, for instance, membership in car-sharing services increased more than 400 percent between 2008 and 2015. Even greater gains are expected in the future. One McKinsey forecast suggests that e-hailing or ride-sharing services could account for 10 percent of vehicle purchases by 2030-a shift that is prompting many OEMs to increase their efforts to capture this market.A shifting and diversifying revenue poolGlobal automotive revenue now totals about $3.5 trillion annually, with the vast majority coming from new-car sales and the aftermarket (repairs and other services provided after an initial vehicle purchase) (Exhibit 1). Only $30 billion, or less than 1 percent of the total, can be attributed to recurring revenue-a broad category that includes proceeds resulting from e-hailing or car-sharing services, as well as those from data-connectivity services such as apps, navigation tools, in-vehicle entertainment, and software upgrades.We are about to see major changes in both the size and composition of the revenue pool, however. Under one highly disruptive scenario, it could total more than $6.7 trillion by 2030, with $5.2 trillion, or about 78 percent, coming from new-car sales and the aftermarket. Recurring revenue, expected to total more than $1.5 trillion, would account for the remaining 22 percent-a 50-fold increase from 2015.The four trends just described will play an important role in the revenue pool's diversification and growth. The increase in recurring revenue that results from the rise of mobility services and greater connectivity is perhaps the most striking change. But the four trends will also affect other areas. For instance, autonomous vehicles (both levels 3 and 4) have high price points, which will increase revenue from new-car sales. Within the aftermarket, new mobility services will raise revenue, because shared vehicles have higher maintenance costs. However, there will also be downward pressure in the aftermarket, because EV powertrains are less expensive to maintain than those for conventional vehicles, and crash-repair costs for autonomous cars can be up to 90 percent lower. All of these shifts could change the source of demand for semiconductors and other components.Implications for the automotive-semiconductor marketDespite the potential uncertainties, we expect demand for automotive semiconductors to increase over the mid- to long term as the industry tries to enhance safety, comfort, and connectivity features within vehicles. The move to automated-driving capabilities will be particularly significant. Over the long term, the growth of the EV segment will also accelerate growth, because hybrid EVs contain about $900 worth of semiconductors, while standard EVs have more than $1,000 worth-much higher than the average $330 value for the semiconductor content of conventional vehicles.Between 1995 and 2015, semiconductor sales to automotive OEMs rose from about $7 billion to $30 billion (Exhibit 2). With this increase, automotive semiconductors now represent close to 9 percent of the industry's total sales. Current projections suggest that sales of automotive semiconductors will continue on their upward trajectory, increasing about 6 percent annually between 2015 and 2020-higher than the 3 to 4 percent growth predicted for the semiconductor sector as a whole. That would put annual sales for automotive semiconductors in the $39 billion to $42 billion range.Although the opportunities ahead appear vast, our analysis of the automotive-semiconductor sector suggests that they will differ significantly by geography, automotive-application segment, and device segment. We have explored some of these variations to guide semiconductor companies in strategic planning.Geographic growth: New forces rising in the automotive-semiconductor industryAlthough the Americas and Europe account for most demand in automotive semiconductors, China now leads the world in annual sales growth, with average gains of 15 percent between 2010 and 2015 (Exhibit 3). China is expected to remain the world leader in sales growth, although average gains will fall to 10 percent through 2020, since the country's economy is slowing and car sales, which have been surging, may flatten.Demand by device and application segment: A shifting landscapeIn addition to studying geographic trends, we explored how semiconductor demand might change for core automotive-application segments and device categories.Identifying pockets of growth among diverse automotive-application segments. We examined growth patterns in the core-application segments: safety, powertrain, body, chassis, and driver information. Trends suggest that the greatest growth through 2020 will occur within the safety segment (Exhibit 4).Within each core-application segment, some product categories will see much higher growth than others. For instance, within the safety category, collision-warning systems are expected to have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22 percent between 2015 and 2020, when sales will reach $4.1 billion. Looking at long-term developments after 2020, we expect continued growth in the engine-control segment, including e-motors and power electronics. We will also see more growth in integrated systems and solutions, such as engine-control units (ECUs) for fusion sensors and integrated-control systems that enable level 4 autonomous driving.Understanding device growth. We also examined semiconductor demand across device segments: memory, microcomponents, logic, analog, optical and sensors, and discretes. While some segments will see more growth than others, we do not expect any major shifts through 2020. Around that time, EVs will begin to proliferate. In addition to containing more semiconductor content than conventional vehicles, EVs also require different types of automotive semiconductors, which will shift demand patterns. For instance, up to 10 percent of automotive semiconductors in conventional cars are incorporated into discretes (power electronics). By contrast, about 35 to 40 percent of automotive semiconductors in hybrid EVs are in discretes, as are up to 50 percent of those in other EVs. Even though EVs are not expected to gain widespread popularity until around 2020, sales of these vehicles are already trending upward. That means demand for automotive semiconductors is already beginning to shift.As with the core automotive-application segments, there will be pockets of opportunity within each semiconductor-device segment. For instance, with the microcomponent segment, the CAGR will be highest for microprocessor units (14 percent) and more moderate for microcontroller units (MCUs) (9 percent) and digital signal processors (3 percent) (Exhibit 5). After 2020, we still expect growth to continue in all core segments. However, the growth of autonomous driving and EVs will benefit some applications, such as GPUs and sensors, more than others.Strategic questions and next stepsWe have engaged in many discussions with semiconductor-industry leaders, as well as experts in the Americas, Asia, and Europe, about the challenges ahead in the automotive industry.

One McKinsey forecast suggests that e-hailing or ride-sharing services could account for 10 percent of vehicle purchases by 2030-a shift that is prompting many OEMs to increase their efforts to capture this market.A shifting and diversifying revenue poolGlobal automotive revenue now totals about $3.5 trillion annually, with the vast majority coming from new-car sales and the aftermarket (repairs and other services provided after an initial vehicle purchase) (Exhibit 1). Only $30 billion, or less than 1 percent of the total, can be attributed to recurring revenue-a broad category that includes proceeds resulting from e-hailing or car-sharing services, as well as those from data-connectivity services such as apps, navigation tools, in-vehicle entertainment, and software upgrades.We are about to see major changes in both the size and composition of the revenue pool, however. Under one highly disruptive scenario, it could total more than $6.7 trillion by 2030, with $5.2 trillion, or about 78 percent, coming from new-car sales and the aftermarket. Recurring revenue, expected to total more than $1.5 trillion, would account for the remaining 22 percent-a 50-fold increase from 2015.The four trends just described will play an important role in the revenue pool's diversification and growth. The increase in recurring revenue that results from the rise of mobility services and greater connectivity is perhaps the most striking change. But the four trends will also affect other areas. For instance, autonomous vehicles (both levels 3 and 4) have high price points, which will increase revenue from new-car sales. Within the aftermarket, new mobility services will raise revenue, because shared vehicles have higher maintenance costs. However, there will also be downward pressure in the aftermarket, because EV powertrains are less expensive to maintain than those for conventional vehicles, and crash-repair costs for autonomous cars can be up to 90 percent lower. All of these shifts could change the source of demand for semiconductors and other components.Implications for the automotive-semiconductor marketDespite the potential uncertainties, we expect demand for automotive semiconductors to increase over the mid- to long term as the industry tries to enhance safety, comfort, and connectivity features within vehicles. The move to automated-driving capabilities will be particularly significant. Over the long term, the growth of the EV segment will also accelerate growth, because hybrid EVs contain about $900 worth of semiconductors, while standard EVs have more than $1,000 worth-much higher than the average $330 value for the semiconductor content of conventional vehicles.Between 1995 and 2015, semiconductor sales to automotive OEMs rose from about $7 billion to $30 billion (Exhibit 2). With this increase, automotive semiconductors now represent close to 9 percent of the industry's total sales. Current projections suggest that sales of automotive semiconductors will continue on their upward trajectory, increasing about 6 percent annually between 2015 and 2020-higher than the 3 to 4 percent growth predicted for the semiconductor sector as a whole. That would put annual sales for automotive semiconductors in the $39 billion to $42 billion range.Although the opportunities ahead appear vast, our analysis of the automotive-semiconductor sector suggests that they will differ significantly by geography, automotive-application segment, and device segment. We have explored some of these variations to guide semiconductor companies in strategic planning.Geographic growth: New forces rising in the automotive-semiconductor industryAlthough the Americas and Europe account for most demand in automotive semiconductors, China now leads the world in annual sales growth, with average gains of 15 percent between 2010 and 2015 (Exhibit 3). China is expected to remain the world leader in sales growth, although average gains will fall to 10 percent through 2020, since the country's economy is slowing and car sales, which have been surging, may flatten.Demand by device and application segment: A shifting landscapeIn addition to studying geographic trends, we explored how semiconductor demand might change for core automotive-application segments and device categories.Identifying pockets of growth among diverse automotive-application segments. We examined growth patterns in the core-application segments: safety, powertrain, body, chassis, and driver information. Trends suggest that the greatest growth through 2020 will occur within the safety segment (Exhibit 4).Within each core-application segment, some product categories will see much higher growth than others. For instance, within the safety category, collision-warning systems are expected to have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22 percent between 2015 and 2020, when sales will reach $4.1 billion. Looking at long-term developments after 2020, we expect continued growth in the engine-control segment, including e-motors and power electronics. We will also see more growth in integrated systems and solutions, such as engine-control units (ECUs) for fusion sensors and integrated-control systems that enable level 4 autonomous driving.Understanding device growth. We also examined semiconductor demand across device segments: memory, microcomponents, logic, analog, optical and sensors, and discretes. While some segments will see more growth than others, we do not expect any major shifts through 2020. Around that time, EVs will begin to proliferate. In addition to containing more semiconductor content than conventional vehicles, EVs also require different types of automotive semiconductors, which will shift demand patterns. For instance, up to 10 percent of automotive semiconductors in conventional cars are incorporated into discretes (power electronics). By contrast, about 35 to 40 percent of automotive semiconductors in hybrid EVs are in discretes, as are up to 50 percent of those in other EVs. Even though EVs are not expected to gain widespread popularity until around 2020, sales of these vehicles are already trending upward. That means demand for automotive semiconductors is already beginning to shift.As with the core automotive-application segments, there will be pockets of opportunity within each semiconductor-device segment. For instance, with the microcomponent segment, the CAGR will be highest for microprocessor units (14 percent) and more moderate for microcontroller units (MCUs) (9 percent) and digital signal processors (3 percent) (Exhibit 5). After 2020, we still expect growth to continue in all core segments. However, the growth of autonomous driving and EVs will benefit some applications, such as GPUs and sensors, more than others.Strategic questions and next stepsWe have engaged in many discussions with semiconductor-industry leaders, as well as experts in the Americas, Asia, and Europe, about the challenges ahead in the automotive industry. Their critical questions include the following:How can we differentiate our offerings?Most leaders mentioned that a focus on hardware would not deliver the desired value in the evolving automotive industry. They all wanted to provide systems or solutions by adding software algorithms to their offerings, and some are also working with partners to differentiate their products in other ways. For example, NVIDIA recently announced that it plans to continue collaborating with the high-definition (HD) mapping player HERE. Together, they will develop HERE HD Live Map, a real-time mapping product for autonomous vehicles. Intel also announced the creation of the Intel GO Automotive 5G platform. This is the one of the first 5G platforms that would allow automotive manufacturers and tier-one suppliers to proof their designs for 5G.If companies focus on systems, rather than the addition of individual chips, they can avoid intense price pressures. For example, NXP Semiconductors just launched a software-defined radio solution for in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) systems called the SAF4000. The company claims that this is the world's first one-chip system covering all global audio broadcast standards, including AM/FM, DAB+, DRM(+), and HD.Will we see any changes regarding the life cycle of semiconductors in vehicles?In the future, we may see OEMs purchasing chips at more frequent intervals, as long as a car is on the market. This trend will gain momentum as upgrades for optional features, such as IVI, are decoupled from other hardware upgrades, such as those related to powertrains.How much integration is needed to reduce material costs while ensuring redundancy?Some leaders are trying to build systems as an integrated unit, with multiple MEMS, MCUs, and other sensors, to ensure redundancy. In this context, redundancy refers to duplication of critical components or functions of a system to increase reliability of the system. For instance, redundancy may provide a backup or fail-safe. OEMs might also find that certain redundancies improve performance, such as the inclusion of additional ECUs. Some have also investigated the use of x-by-wire (electrical or electromechanical systems that perform vehicle functions traditionally controlled by mechanical linkages) for braking or steering.Questions remain, however, about how much redundancy is needed and when industry players will feel comfortable with less of it.How should semiconductor companies collaborate with automotive OEMs and tier-one suppliers?Semiconductor companies are increasingly working directly with both OEMs and tier-one automotive suppliers. For instance, BMW, Intel, and Mobileye announced that they have collaborated to create a fleet of about 40 autonomous test vehicles that will be on the roads by the second half of 2017. Similarly, Audi said that its continued collaboration with NVIDIA will introduce innovative features to its newest A8 luxury sedan, including systems that enable automated driving in complicated situations, such as those involving highways and traffic jams. Audi and NVIDIA have also formed a partnership to create what they have described as the "world's most advanced AI [artificial-intelligence] car," which they hope to have on the road by 2020.For collaborations to succeed, semiconductor companies must first identify the areas where these opportunities bring complementary skills-for instance, a venture where their hardware expertise could benefit a company with strong software skills. They should then decide which form of collaboration-M&A deals, joint ventures, exclusive partnerships, or strategic partnerships-will best suit their needs.How will the automotive landscape evolve and will this affect semiconductor companies?Some shifts in the competitive landscape and the value chain could affect semiconductor players. Although leading global OEMs are expected to remain dominant within the global market, those that focus on the mass market may start to lose revenue share as disruptive players, including new Chinese OEMs, establish or expand their operations. Information and communication technology (ICT) players in other countries are also seeing demand grow for their products, including sensors and software, which could give them a larger role in the value chain. Finally, some tier-one automotive suppliers could gain bargaining power equivalent to that of less dominant OEMs.How far should we expand into security offerings?It will be critical for semiconductor companies to incorporate security features into chips, but this will not entirely address all safety concerns, including those related to hacking. In consequence, they should also consider developing other security solutions, especially in the neglected area of automotive connectivity. A few semiconductor players, such as NXP Semiconductors, are already working with automotive partners to develop end-to-end security solutions, and others may follow their example. As they embark on security ventures, semiconductor companies may find some inspiration from companies in other high-tech sectors that have created innovative offerings. For instance, Bosch recently announced a keyless entry and start product that allows drivers to access their vehicles securely, using only a smartphone that provides full encryption.How should we address the China market?Semiconductor companies should look at the China market from several angles. While it will be an important source of demand, the country could also become a major testing location for autonomous cars and EVs, partly because the consumer market has some unique characteristics. In the 2016 McKinsey survey of more than 3,000 car buyers in three countries, we found that Chinese consumers were more open to car-to-car data sharing-having vehicles exchange information about location, speed, and other factors-than drivers in Germany and the United States.2 We also found that they were more willing to upgrade the IVI within their vehicles. Both of these factors might encourage automotive OEMs to test and market new automotive technologies in China, especially since car-ownership rates are rapidly growing.China also provides semiconductor companies with a large and diverse pool of potential partners for automotive ventures. This fact was on display at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show, where Chinese companies had more than 1,300 displays and accounted for more than 20 percent of the 500 exhibits on vehicle technology. As in the United States and other countries, some of the most promising partners may be new entrants into the automotive sector. For instance, Baidu, the Chinese web giant, is attempting to develop its autonomous-driving and EV technology through partnerships with global OEMs.Semiconductor companies can also be optimistic about China-both as a market and a source of partners-because the Chinese government has launched several initiatives to support domestic manufacturing. For instance, the government's "Made in China 2025" policy provides subsidies and other incentives to local companies that upgrade their facilities and focus on innovation. Semiconductor companies may thus find that the pool of potential partners will become even more substantial in coming years. The Chinese government has also displayed a strong interest in promoting technologies for autonomous cars and EVs, as well as technologies related to the Internet of Things that enable many connected car features. The government's support has already encouraged more automotive and ICT players to establish a stronger presence in China.Many semiconductor companies are moving quickly to develop automotive innovations, with some poised to become leading suppliers to OEMs that market autonomous vehicles and EVs. Other players, however, have been slow to form partnerships with automotive players or further invest in technologies that will meet their needs, perhaps because they are reluctant to assume the risks associated with an uncertain and rapidly evolving market. But those companies that hesitate to address strategic questions may now lose market share to more aggressive competitors, even if they take decisive action later. With the automotive market poised to serve as one of the semiconductor industry's greatest growth drivers, their lack of action is the real risk.About the authorsStefan Burghardt is a specialist in McKinsey's Munich office, where Florian Weig is a senior partner; Seunghyuk Choi is an associate partner in the Seoul office.Footnotes1  McKinsey connectivity and autonomous driving consumer survey, 2016.  2  McKinsey connectivity and autonomous driving consumer survey, 2016.  McKinsey InsightsFor more of McKinsey's latest thinking, install our app for iPad or Android.Load-Date: August 20, 2020End of Document

IBM Watson Health Announces Baheal Group will Bring Watson for Genomics to China; Baheal will serve as the primary channel partner for Watson for Genomics in China, building on the company's momentum bringing Watson to the marketPR NewswireJune 21, 2017 Wednesday 7:00 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 864 wordsDateline: QINGDAO, China and ARMONK, N.Y., June 21, 2017 Body IBM Watson Health (NYSE:IBM) today announced that Baheal Pharmaceutical Group will bring Watson for Genomics to clinicians across China. As IBM's primary channel partner for Watson for Genomics in China, Baheal will establish an ecosystem within China to sell the molecular data interpretation technology to clinicians and researchers across the country. The new multi-year agreement comes less than 3 months after Baheal and IBM launched a strategic alliance to distribute Watson for Oncology in China.Last year, the Chinese government launched a $9.2 billion precision medicine initiative to invest in the growing field of genomics, which holds particular promise in oncology.(1) Physicians and researchers have made groundbreaking discoveries on the genetic drivers of cancer, which in some cases turn out to be the best indicator for the right treatment. Yet, even if a patient's genome is sequenced, few doctors have access to the tools they need to turn that information into better treatment decisions. Precision oncology could help improve cancer survival rates in China, where one-fifth of all deaths are caused by cancer. (2)  Every year in China, more than 4.3 million people are diagnosed with cancer.(3)Watson for Genomics analyzes massive bodies of genomic, clinical and pharmacological knowledge to help uncover potential therapeutic options that target the tumor's genetic alterations. Then, Watson produces a report for physicians that identifies genetic alterations that are actionable based on literature as well as drugs and clinical trials that target those alterations. Watson for Genomics has been tested and validated at more than 20 leading cancer institutes worldwide, and is now commercially available. "Despite the promise of precision medicine, data-driven challenges make it difficult for oncologists to bring genomic advances to their patients," said Gang Fu, Chairman, Baheal Pharmaceutical Group. "We believe Watson will help accelerate this growing field so that research advances can be accessed for patient benefit more quickly. We are proud to now serve as IBM's primary distribution channel for both Watson for Genomics and Watson for Oncology." Baheal Group has a proven track record delivering value to hospitals across China working with more than 12,000 hospitals today, and the company has already implemented Watson for Oncology at 8 hospitals."With the rapid proliferation of clinical, research and genomic data, we are proud to work with Baheal Group to bring the promise of cognitive computing to doctors and researchers all across China," said Rob Merkel, General Manager of Oncology and Genomics, IBM Watson Health. "Watson for Genomics can empower oncologists to deliver genomic insights to their patients faster and easier than it can now be done. We believe this has the power to scale expertise and ultimately help oncologists make more informed decisions."IBM Watson Health is actively partnering with organizations like Baheal within China's healthcare and technology community to establish an ecosystem that will bring the benefits of machine learning into clinical practice to serve the needs of doctors and patients while maintaining compliance with local laws and regulations, including data privacy and security requirements.Sources[1]http://www.nature.com/news/china-embraces-precision-medicine-on-a-massive-scale-1.19108[2] Goss et al.

The rule in question requires companies that publish information online to register with the government.Related: Russia blocks China's biggest messaging appRussian media regulator Roskomnadzor said that WeChat has now "provided the information that is necessary to include them in the registry" of online firms. It said restrictions on the app had been lifted.WeChat, owned by homegrown tech giant Tencent, is China's most popular messaging app with over 900 million monthly active users. It had been offline in Russia since Friday, according to Russian state media.Related: China's WeChat is censoring group chats without users' knowledgeTencent said Monday that it was "in discussions with relevant authorities" in Russia. It did not respond to a request for comment sent after office hours on Thursday.Russian authorities increasingly view the internet as a serious political threat and are trying to copy China's model of censorship and internet control, according to a recent analysis from New America, a Washington-based think tank.In 2015, Russia passed a law requiring companies to store data about Russian citizens in the country. That law appears similar to Chinese regulations preventing data collected in China from leaving the country.WeChat frequently censors topics deemed sensitive by the Chinese government, like Tibet or the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989.-- Sherisse Pham and Anastasia Anashkina contributed reporting.Load-Date: May 12, 2017End of Document

China's new cyber law just kicked in and nobody's sure how it worksCNN WireJune 2, 2017 Friday 3:21 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 428 wordsByline: By Sherisse PhamDateline: HONG KONG (CNNMoney) BodyHONG KONG (CNNMoney) --  China's controversial new cybersecurity law came into effect Thursday in the face of criticism and confusion from international companies. The new law is meant to strengthen the protection of personal information and combat online fraud. But some experts say it's vague and leaves foreign businesses, especially tech firms, confused about how it will affect their operations. For one thing, Chinese lawmakers approved the law late last year, but left many of the details regarding rules and implementation to regulators like the Cyber Administration of China, the country's internet regulator. "The legislators kicked the can on some of the more difficult aspects," said Paul McKenzie, a managing partner at law firm Morrison & Foerster in Beijing.While the law has officially taken effect already, the internet regulator says the work of putting in place the new rules and standards isn't finished yet, according to a transcript of a news conference posted on its website Wednesday.One of the most contentious parts of the new law involves measures allowing China to conduct security reviews of technology products and services that could affect national security. Critics have slammed the plans as intrusive and trade-inhibiting. As the law kicks in, it remains unclear what kinds of products fall under the vague "national security" definition and how the reviews will work in practice.In May, dozens of industry organizations, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, lobbied the Chinese government to delay the cybersecurity law, citing concerns over unfair advantages for Chinese companies and trade barriers. China's internet regulator did delay one part of the law which requires certain companies to store personal and "significant data" on servers in China. Critics had warned that requirement would hinder trade and innovation, as foreign businesses operating in China usually need to transfer information outside the country. On Thursday, the regulations on moving data out of China were "still murky," said McKenzie.

Report: China orders carriers to block access to VPNsUPIJuly 11, 2017 Tuesday 10:49 AM ESTCopyright 2017 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 309 wordsByline: ELIZABETH SHIMDateline: Dec. 31 BodyVirtual private networks allow Internet users in China to get around a heavy online censorship regime, but access to VPNs may be taken away in the world's most populous country.Bloomberg reported Monday the Chinese government has instructed state-run telecommunications companies to bar user access to the private networks by Feb. 1, 2018.Beijing's online censorship program is already one of the world's most vigorously enforced. The Chinese Communist Party is wary of media critical of its rule that could lead to social instability, according to the report.Chinese censorship rules prevent Internet users from accessing social network platforms like Facebook or Twitter. It also blocks The New York Times and other foreign news services.Kaiser Kuo, former head of international communications at Baidu, one of the largest companies in the world, said the latest regulation warns of "dark days ahead.""If they're as interested in security and stability as they say they are, then they should leave VPNs accessible," Kuo said in a Facebook post. "The number of people using them in China is really small, but really vocal -- and I don't think they'll just take this lying down. Will reflect very badly on the party. Dark days ahead."Foreign individuals and entities operating in China should be prepared for the worst, according to U.S. analysts."This seems to impact individuals most immediately," said Jake Parker, the vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council. "VPNs are incredibly important for companies trying to access global services outside of China.""In the past, any effort to cut off internal corporate VPNs has been enough to make a company think about closing or reducing operations in China. It's that big a deal."The three Internet providers China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom are state-owned, according to The Guardian.Load-Date: July 12, 2017End of Document

Chinese tech giant's $2 billion deal to buy Vizio collapsesCNN WireApril 11, 2017 Tuesday 5:13 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 268 wordsByline: By Sherisse PhamDateline: HONG KONG (CNNMoney) BodyHONG KONG (CNNMoney) --  A major Chinese tech deal in the U.S. just fell apart.Beijing-based LeEco has pulled the plug on a plan to buy U.S. electronics maker Vizio for $2 billion. In a statement, the companies blamed "regulatory headwinds" for the deal's collapse but didn't elaborate.It's a sharp turnaround from July, when LeEco touted the acquisition of the U.S. smart TV maker as "an important step" in its efforts to grow in North America.But the Chinese company -- whose businesses range from digital content to electric vehicles -- has run into difficulties since then in its grand plans for global expansion.The Chinese government has begun restricting overseas investments and acquisitions in recent months in order to rein in the huge sums of money flowing out of its economy. That appears to have sunk other high-profile deals, including one by China's richest man to buy the producer of the Golden Globes.LeEco has also reported financial problems of its own. Its founder and CEO, Jia Yueting, recently slashed his annual salary to 15 cents after acknowledging the company was running low on cash. Jia, who founded the company in 2002, apologized to shareholders and employees in a memo in November and promised to rein in the company's ambitions.Despite the deal's demise, LeEco and Vizio say they will continue to "explore opportunities" to work together. For LeEco, that means getting its app and content onto Vizio's smart TVs. In return, LeEco would help bring Vizio's products to the vast Chinese consumer market.TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Global Poll Finds Most Believe the U.S. Tops China as World's Leading Economic PowerUSNEWS.comJuly 13, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Best Countries; Vol.; No.Length: 455 wordsByline: Megan TrimbleHighlight: But in many European countries and Canada, China is considered more dominant.BodyMost still view the United States as the world's leading economic power, despite challenges from            China and other emerging economies that threaten the long-held reputation. A Pew Research study that polled 38 nations found a median of 42 percent say the U.S. is the leading economy, compared to 32 percent that named China. But China, the study found, is closing the global perception gap with the U.S. MORE: [Survey Shows Global Disapproval of U.S. President Donald Trump]Global perception of relative U.S. economic power has decreased in the eyes of some of the country's key trading partners and allies over the past year, according to the findings, released Thursday. Seven of the 10 European Union nations surveyed in the study, including            Spain,            France and            Germany, named China as the leading economic power. Global publics in            Russia,            Australia and            Canada also considered China to lead the U.S. in terms of economic dominance. The U.S. still has the upper hand in Latin America, Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where most of the surveyed countries tended to view the country as the world's top economic leader. And more than half of Americans also picked the U.S. over China. South Korea, the study found, is most likely to say the U.S. is the leading economic power. Conversely, Australia is the country most convinced that China is the world's leading economic power, with 58 percent of Australians holding the view. When it comes to China's global image, a median of 47 percent of those surveyed have a favorable view of the country. The highest favorability ratings can be found in sub-Saharan Africa, where the Asian country has invested in trade-related infrastructure projects. READ: [International Tourism in U.S. Declines Since Donald Trump Elected President]Meanwhile, many believe the country leaves something to be desired when it comes to civil liberties. A median of 58 percent of those polled believe that the Chinese government does not respect the personal freedoms of its citizens. A brave few -- including Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo -- have fought for this to change.  Xiaobo was arrested in 2008 for co-authoring a pro-democracy charter calling for more rights for Chinese people. He died Thursday of liver cancer at the age of 61. In terms of commonalities, "one thing that China and the U.S. share is that leaders of both countries are currently viewed negatively around much of the world," the study found.Megan Trimble is an associate editor of social media for the News division at U.S. News & World Report.

CHINA IS WORLD-LEADING CENSOR WITH 'TOTAL CONTROL' OVER NEWS: PRESS FREEDOM GROUPStates News ServiceApril 27, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 678 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:China, a global leader in censorship operations, remains near the bottom of global press freedom rankings, the Paris-based press freedom group Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said in its annual report, amid a global "tipping point" for the freedom of information.Calling the head of the ruling Chinese Communist Party, President Xi Jinping, the world's "leading censor and press freedom predator," RSF said Xi had succeeded in establishing total control over news coverage in China, which is now ranked 176th out of 180 nations for press freedom.More than 100 journalists and bloggers are currently behind bars in China, including three former winners of RSF press freedom awards: Huang Qi, founder of the Sichuan-based rights website Tianwang, and bloggers Lu Yuyu and Li Tingyu.Li Tingyu, who has been held in the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture Detention Center on suspicion of "picking quarrels and stirring up trouble" since last June, was recently tried in secret by the Dali People's Court on April 20, according to her lawyer Ge Yongxi.Li was detained at the same time as her boyfriend Lu Yuyu, who ran a blog under the social media handle @wickedonnaa, but her case is being dealt with separately from his and she may be handed a suspended jail term in return for a "confession," Ge said.Ge said both bloggers, who compiled meticulous, publicly available lists of more than 30,000 "mass incidents" that never get reported in the country's tightly controlled state media, are innocent."There's really nothing to see here," he said. "All they did was research the facts."Li was forced under intense political pressure to drop out of a translation and interpretation degree at Guangzhou's prestigious Zhongshan University after publishing articles out of the reach of Chinese government internet censors.A former migrant worker, Lu had been previously detained for short periods in Shanghai and Guangzhou for "illegal assembly," and began compiling statistics of public protests and unrest in October 2012 under the title Fei Xinwen, or "Not the News."A relative of Li's who declined to be named said she is expected to be released soon, but declined to give further details.Lu, on the other hand, may face tougher treatment if he refuses to "confess," his lawyer Huang Simin told RFA.But both lawyers said that even if Li is released from detention, she may yet face very strong curbs on her freedom.'No improvement'During the past two years, citizen journalists, bloggers, and human rights activists, including foreign ones, have been arrested and forced into "confession," RSF said in its report, carried on its website."There has been no improvement in the press freedom situation in China, which is now 176th in the rankings," RSF's East Asia director Benjamin Ismail said."As the Chinese Communist Party tries to promote its global clout in terms of trade and economic influence, it is at the same time stepping up its persecution domestically of journalists, bloggers and human rights lawyers," Ismail said.By contrast, the democratic island of Taiwanwhich China claims as an inalienable part of its territorycame top in regional press rankings, in 45th place overall, two spots below the United States.Meanwhile, China's neighbor and Stalinist ally North Korea ranked last. The country's "totalitarian regime continues to keep its citizens in a state of ignorance and fear of being sent to a concentration camp for listening to radio broadcasts from outside the country," RSF said.It said the latest index highlights the danger of a "tipping point" in the state of media freedom, especially in leading democratic countries.It said the U.S. fell from 41st to 43rd position, while the U.K. also dropped two places from 38th to 40th. In both cases RSF cited an "obsession with surveillance and violations of the right to the confidentiality of sources."Reported by Xi Wang for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Ng Yik-tung and Sing Man for the Cantonese Service.

China's top messaging app is back online in RussiaCNN WireMay 11, 2017 Thursday 1:53 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 275 wordsByline: By Rishi IyengarDateline: NEW DELHI (CNNMoney) BodyNEW DELHI (CNNMoney) --  China's biggest messaging app has been unblocked in Russia. Access to WeChat was restored by Russian authorities on Thursday, nearly a week after the app was taken offline for running afoul of the country's information laws. The rule in question requires companies that publish information online to register with the government. Russian media regulator Roskomnadzor said that WeChat has now "provided the information that is necessary to include them in the registry" of online firms. It said restrictions on the app had been lifted. WeChat, owned by homegrown tech giant Tencent, is China's most popular messaging app with over 900 million monthly active users. It had been offline in Russia since Friday, according to Russian state media. Tencent said Monday that it was "in discussions with relevant authorities" in Russia. It did not respond to a request for comment sent after office hours on Thursday.Russian authorities increasingly view the internet as a serious political threat and are trying to copy China's model of censorship and internet control, according to a recent analysis from New America, a Washington-based think tank.In 2015, Russia passed a law requiring companies to store data about Russian citizens in the country.

The Latest: Protesters in Hong Kong demand Liu's releaseAssociated Press InternationalJuly 10, 2017 Monday 1:26 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 453 wordsDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - The Latest on China's best-known political prisoner, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, who doctors say is in critical condition with liver cancer (all times local):8:30 p.m.Dozens of people are staging a sit-in protest in Hong Kong urging China to allow ailing Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo to be treated for late-stage liver cancer overseas.The activists waved banners and chanted slogans as they marched Monday to the Chinese government's representative office.They sat down holding placards with images of Liu and said they would not leave until he is released from China.Human rights lawyer Albert Ho called it a "marathon sit-in" aimed at sending a strong message to the Chinese government and President Xi Jinping that Liu should be allowed to leave China for medical treatment wherever he chooses.The Chinese hospital treating the country's best-known political prisoner says his condition is now critical.___7:50 p.m.The German Embassy in Beijing has expressed deep concern over leaked audio and video surveillance recordings of a visit by a German specialist to imprisoned Chinese Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo at a Chinese hospital.Though the statement did not specify the content of the recordings, one such video circulating Monday on YouTube appears to show German expert Markus W. Buechler of Heidelberg University telling Liu's wife that Chinese doctors were doing their utmost to help Liu.The embassy said Monday the recordings were made against the wishes of the German side and leaked to some Chinese state media.The embassy said "it seems that security organs are steering the process, not medical experts," and that such actions undermine trust in the authorities dealing with Liu.The hospital treating China's best-known political prisoner said Monday his condition is now critical.___6 p.m.The German government says Chancellor Angela Merkel hopes for a "signal of humanity" toward imprisoned Chinese Nobel Peace laureate Liu Xiaobo and his family, which hopes he will be allowed to receive treatment for advanced liver cancer abroad.Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Berlin last week and attended the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg. Asked whether the chancellor discussed with Xi the family's wish for Liu to be treated in another country, Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert said Monday he wouldn't comment on confidential conversations.But he told reporters in Berlin, "I can assure you that this tragic case of Liu Xiaobo is a great concern of the chancellor, and that she would like a signal of humanity for Liu Xiaobo and his family."A German doctor visited Liu at a hospital on Saturday.Seibert said the latest report of Liu's worsening health is depressing.Load-Date: July 11, 2017End of Document

Anhui Xinen Technology Launches Revolutionary EV Battery Pack that Prevents Explosions and Enhances Consumer Safety; The Chinese company's groundbreaking battery packs mitigate the impact of defective EV battery cellsPR NewswireJune 5, 2017 Monday 9:00 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 777 wordsDateline: ANQING, China, June 5, 2017 Body Anhui Xinen Technology Company, Ltd.("Xinen") (安徽新能科技有限公司) today announced the launch of its revolutionary electric vehicle (EV) battery pack that is fire, water, leak and temperature resistant and prevents explosions, resolving the most critical problem in the EV industry to provide uncompromised safety and reliability for consumers.Xinen's patented battery pack module is composed of hundreds of battery cells positioned in closely-packed cylinders arranged in a honeycomb configuration that delivers the highest density in the industry: 518 cells, compared to 444 cells for a comparable battery pack from the leading EV maker. The additional cells increase vehicle power for greater performance and driving range.Our battery-cell cylinders are submerged and surrounded by coolant fluid. This process creates very even temperature distribution among battery cells, preventing hot spots and improving cell longevity. Our process also isolates each cell, similar to rockets or missiles in launch tubes. Thus, in the event one cell becomes defective for whatever reason and explodes, the explosion will not propagate to neighboring cells, which prevents the possibility of a catastrophic explosive event. In the very rare instance of an explosion, Xinen's patented design directs the explosion away from passengers.Xinen's battery pack uses silicone rubber to make it fire resistant, water resistant, leak resistant, shock and vibration resistant, and  it allows the battery pack to operate in a wide range of temperatures. This keeps the cells thermally isolated from the environment, thus minimizing the power required to maintain the battery cells at the required optimal temperature for charging, discharging or parking.Xinen's battery modules have been validated by third-party certification labs, such as China Automotive Technology and Research Center (CATARC) and others. Our battery modules meet all current Chinese Government Safety Tests as well as U.S. regulatory requirements, such as: Over Charge and Over Discharge Test, Short Circuit Test, High Temperature Test, Compression Test, Low Pressure Test, Seawater Immersion Test, Drop Test, Thermal Cycle Test, and Vibration Test. Xinen battery modules also passed the Ingress Protection Code of IP68 with immersion under 2 meters of water."EVs should be as safe, if not safer than gas-fueled cars," said John Chan, co-founder and CEO of Xinen. "We believe our technology resolves many concerns about EV batteries and takes them to the next level of safety and performance, giving consumers greater peace of mind on the road."Xinen is currently offering two types of battery modules for EVs: Module 518 for cars, and Module 92 for motorcycles. Xinen is delivering samples to customers such as JAC Motors, Youxia Motors, Pilot Motorcycle and Corbin Technology. Xinen expects to begin broader distribution by end of the year.Xinen battery packs can also be used for mobile power storage and wall-mounted power storage.Mr. Chan is a veteran technologist. He started his career designing the Fail Safe System for the missile system at Lockheed shortly after he graduated from college. He also developed the solar array drive and antenna positioning system for communication satellites at Ford Aerospace. He also worked in the disk drive industry and invented the 3.5 inch microfloppy disk. A decade ago, Mr. Chan and Mr. Vinod Rao, a veteran of the disk and optical drive industries, developed and supplied battery cooling tubes to the leading EV maker and they continue to be the sole supplier.In 2015, Mr. Chan established Xinen after he was approached by SAIF Partners, one of the leading private equity firms in China, to create a battery pack that addresses the global need for safer EVs. Mr. Chan co-founded Xinen with Mr. Rao and developed the company's first patent on the Xinen battery pack.For information on purchasing Xinen battery packs, please contact Jerry Wang, phone: +86-187-0986-1862, e-mail:wzh1862@aqarn.comAbout Anhui Xinen Technology Company LTD.Xinen was founded in 2015 to develop electric vehicle (EV) battery packs that prevent fires and explosions, and provide increased safety for consumers worldwide. The company is headquartered in Anhui, China, with employees in Beijing, Hong Kong and Silicon Valley. Xinen has funding from SAIF Partners and Anhui ARN Group.

Chinese students produce American TV at media campCumberland Times-News (Maryland)July 30, 2017 SundayCopyright 2017 Cumberland Times-NewsDistributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWSLength: 505 wordsByline: Heather B. Wolford, Cumberland Times-News, Md.BodyJuly 30--FROSTBURG -- Students from the Beijing and Nanjing campuses of Communication University of China completed a three-week summer media camp hosted by the Frostburg State University Mass Communications Department on Friday with smiles, certificates and lasting relationships."It was wonderful," said Yang Dasheng, CUC freshman and media camp graduate.The first Frostburg Media Camp kicked off with field trips to some major U.S. cities, including New York City, where students had the chance to tour the National September 11 Memorial & Museum as well as the Newseum in Washington, D.C.During the other two weeks, students wrote, produced and edited two full television shows comprised of four stories each at the Catherine R. Gira Center for Communications and Information Technology.Dasheng said his only wish was for more time to "do it perfect.""If we had time, we would do it over and over again until it would be perfect," he said.Among the TV stories were a ghost chase at Allen Hall, a comparison of American food and Chinese cuisine at the FSU Chesapeake Dining Hall, and a brief tour of Frostburg's Main Street. Students had the option to use their own cameras to shoot, or borrow the university's Sony NX70. Footage was edited using Adobe Premiere.As faculty and students gathered into the GIRA Planetarium on Friday to view the finished product, students laughed as they watched themselves on video. Melanie Lombardi, cable channel manager for FSU-TV3, said students are often their own worst critic, but she offered them a little help during the process."I helped with some spelling issues and a few graphics on Photoshop," she said.Liu Xinyi, a sophomore at CUC, said she enjoyed hosting the shows and valued her time in the Mountain City."Frostburg is very peaceful and there are so many beautiful houses on Main Street," she said, "and so many lovely animals on campus."As part of the curriculum, students watched numerous examples of American media as a way to compare broadcasts with Chinese media outlets.Dasheng said the media in the U.S. is "more free.""America is free," he said. "People can say whatever they want."According to John Lombardi, professor of mass communication who led the camp, there are still limits to the United States' "free media.""Media is owned by the (Chinese) government, but it's similar pressure because our media is privately owned, so it's controlled by those companies and those people's philosophies."This is not FSU's first partnership with CUC, and officials hope it is not the last. The university has a cooperative Master of Science program in applied computer science and international student exchanges.This was the first trip to the United States for all 16 of the students. Dasheng said he wants to return."I think I have to," he said.Follow staff writer Heather Wolford on Twitter @heatherbwolford.___ (c)2017 the Cumberland Times News (Cumberland, Md.)

China: Human Rights Lawyer Released on Bail Amid Relentless CrackdownTargeted News ServiceMay 10, 2017 Wednesday 6:14 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 750 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: LONDON BodyAmnesty International issued the following news release:The release of Xie Yang on bail does not represent a break in China's relentless crackdown against human rights lawyers, Amnesty International said today.Xie Yang was tried in Changsha City Intermediate People's Court in southern China on 8 May for "inciting subversion of state power" and "disrupting court order" and apparently released on bail even though a verdict has not been announced."This unusual sequence of events does nothing to alleviate the concerns about torture in this case," said Patrick Poon, China Researcher at Amnesty International. "While it is a relief that Xie Yang is no longer in detention, it doesn't diminish the fact that he should never have been arrested in the first place.""While on bail, Xie Yang is likely to experience constant surveillance and severe restrictions to his freedom of movement as we have witnessed in other such cases," said Patrick Poon. "Such tactics appear to be the authorities' modus operandi against those defending human rights."The court announced the trial would be broadcast on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, only approximately 20 minutes before it began.At the trial Xie Yang said that he was not tortured, contradicting what he told his lawyers in January when he recounted prolonged torture he had suffered during his detention, including lengthy interrogations, beatings, and deprivation of water and sleep.Xie Yang is one of almost 250 lawyers and activists targeted in an unprecedented crackdown by the Chinese government which started in July 2015."The charges against Xie Yang are baseless. The authorities know it and that is why they have resorted to torture and other forms of coercion against him and his family"After accounts of Xie Yang's torture were made public by his lawyers in January 2017, the authorities have rejected any further requests from his lawyers to meet with their client. Another detained human rights lawyer Jiang Tianyong, was seen "confessing" on mainland media in March 2017 to fabricating the evidence of Xie Yang's torture.Xie Yang's family had also been threatened in an attempt to coerce him to "confess" and provide incriminating statements against other human rights defenders.Xie Yang was represented at the trial by court-appointed lawyers after those hired by his family were removed from the case by the authorities.The authorities have repeatedly warned Chen Jiangang, one of Xie Yang's original defence lawyers, to stop discussing the case with international media and initiated an investigation into Chen's own eligibility to practice law.Chen Jiangang and his family and activist Zhang Baocheng and Zhang's wife, Liu Juefan,were taken away by police in Yunnan when they were travelling there on 3 May. After they were released, Chen had to drive back to Beijing from Yunnan, escorted by public security officers while Chen's wife and their two young children were allowed to take a flight back to Beijing."The charges against Xie Yang are baseless. The authorities know it and that is why they have resorted to torture and other forms of coercion against him and his family" said Patrick Poon.Relentless crackdownThe detention of lawyer Wang Yu and her family on 9 July 2015 marked the beginning of an unprecedented government crackdown on human rights lawyers and other activists. Over the following weeks, almost 250 lawyers and activists were questioned or detained state security agents, and many of their offices and homes were raided.Apart from Xie Yang, another five have been convicted of "subverting state power". In August 2016, activists Zhai Yanmin and Gou Hongguo, aka Ge Ping, were given suspended prison sentences. Activist Hu Shigen and lawyer Zhou Shifeng were sentenced to seven and a half years and seven years' imprisonment respectively. Lawyer Li Heping was tried in Tianjin on 25 April and then sentenced to three years imprisonment, suspended for four years, on 28 April. His whereabouts remained unknown after the verdict until he returned home on 9 May, although images show he has lost weight and his hair has turned noticeably grey.Three others remain in detention and are awaiting trial dates or verdicts. The trial date of human rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang still has not been set. Activists Yin Xu'an and Wang Fang are still waiting for their verdicts after appearing in court in September last year and in February this year respectively.Copyright Targeted News Services88Kelton-5860683 88KeltonLoad-Date: May 11, 2017End of Document

While China's beverage manufacturing increased by 9.5% year-on-year as of October 2016.The future of China's food and beverage market is expected to keep growing , while it remains the world's largest consumer. The industry is driven by factors such as the rapid rise of the middle class population and average household incomes, improvements in infrastructure for food and beverage distribution, and the increasing sales of E-commerce for food and beverage.Connect with over 4,000 food and beverage companies in China listed on BizVibe.China's Meat Consumption Continues to Rise, While Government Tries to Cut It DownChina is one of the largest meat consumers in the world . China currently consumes nearly 30% of the world's meat, including half of the world's pork. In 2016, meat consumption per capita in China totalled over 50kg, compared to only 13 kg/capita three decades ago. However, Chinese government has introduced new initiatives to cut its citizens' meat consumption by half with aims of tackling greenhouse gas and population health issues.According to the environmental organization WildAid, China's high meat consumption would add an extra 233 million tonnes of greenhouse gases every year, and put increased strain on the country's water supply, as well as degrade country's arable land and increase the country's health issues with obesity and diabetes.Connect with over 800 meat and poultry companies in China listed on BizVibeIn addition to food and beverage companies, BizVibe is home to a total of 7 million companies across a variety of industries.

Hi, everybody. Thanks for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, April 13th. Here are your top stories 6:00 am on the East Coast.The Republican health care plan getting another shot at life. The chairman of the House Freedom Caucus says that he's trying to make a deal with House Speaker Paul Ryan. President Trump in my exclusive interview last week, this -- earlier this week, said that healthcare is key to pursuing tax reform.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have to do healthcare first to pick up additional money so that we get tax reform. So we're going to have a phenomenal tax reform but I have to do healthcare first. I want to do it first to really do it right.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: now the president reportedly looking to pressure democrats to get them on board, we will take a look.Plus, a low point for U.S.-Russia relations, that's how Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson characterize the situation following his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday. We're taking a closer look this morning.We are watching the financial sector, earnings season kicking off with a banks. We are hearing from J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo, Citi Group all ahead of the open this morning. We will bring you the numbers when they hit the wires.Oil prices this morning in focus, a new warning on oil demand globally.

Take a look at oil at 53.08 right now.President Trump's comments on the dollar, weighing on global markets, he told the Wall Street Journal the dollar is, "Too strong." Futures this morning look like this as they are following the dollar lower this morning, down about 40 points on the DOW Jones Industrial average, NASDAQ, S&P500 down as well. The president once again moving markets with the Journal. In Europe this morning, the indices look like this, as you can see, the FTSE100 down half a percent as is the CAC krone. The DAX Index in Germany down a quarter of a percent. In Asia overnight, mixed performances, take a look, the Asian indices where Japan and Hong Kong were lower and China and Korea were higher.

The technology giant though took swift action against it, we will tell you what happened.Plus, trying to keep the Ram in St. Louis, the city filing a lawsuit against the NFL to prevent the team from moving to Los Angeles. All those stories coming up this morning on a busy Thursday morning.Joining me to talk all about it, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell. 32 Advisors CEO, Robert Wolf with us. And the Wall Street Journal's Deputy Editor-in-chief, Matt Murray is here. Good morning.ROBERT WOLF, CEO, 32 ADVISORS: Good morning.MATT MURRAY, "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL": Good to see you.BARTIROMO: Great to see you.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Some very fine gentlemen to help may -- could make the world sense.BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes, exactly.WOLF: Maria, in 30 seconds, healthcare, taxes, banks, oil, dollar, geopolitical risk, I mean you think we could talk about more into the morning?BARTIROMO: A lot to come and really, I'm loving the interview that you did with the Wall Street Journal and the president. Moving markets, the dollar, also you got into the Federal Reserve Chairman, Janet Yellen.MURRAY: Yes. it didn't even sound like him, right? Yesterday, what did he do yesterday? Janet Yellen's not toast, the dollar is too high, China is not a currency manipulator, NATO is a good thing --WOLF: And (inaudible) coming back.MURRAY: (inaudible) bank is a good thing.WOLF: Yes. I mean, he's kind of leading my way now.BARTIROMO: That's it.MCDOWELL: It's called leading. It's called he's been in the job since late January and he sees the world differently than he did when he was campaigning.BARTIROMO: And, of course, right after telling us that he's got to do healthcare first which was completely a surprise to see that they were so knee-deep still into healthcare that they would not get into tax reform.MCDOWELL: And you broke the news yesterday morning quite frankly that the administration was not going to label China a currency manipulator, you repeated that over and over again. So a lot of people --BARTIROMO: And then he confirms it with the Wall Street Journal yesterday.WOLF: The last 24 hours has moved some markets.BARTIROMO: It sure has.WOLF: And the two interviews were fantastic.BARTIROMO: Great. Great. We got a lot to talk about this morning and this is the group to talk about it.Coming up this morning to join the conversation, a Member of the House Foreign Affairs and Oversight Committees as well as the Freedom Caucus Member, Florida Congressman Ron DeSantis is with us, a lot to talk about with Congressman DeSantis. The CIO, Chief Investment Officer of Wells Fargo Investment Institute is here, Darrell Cronk going through bank earnings as well as the dollar movements. Former Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs under President George W. Bush, Nicholas Burns is with us. And the Former CKE Restaurant CEO and, of course, the Former Labor Secretary Nominee, Andy Puzder is with us. And the Former Chairman and CEO of Morgan Stanley, John Mack is here as well. Lots to talk about this morning, we'll get in to regulatory issues with John Mack along with the banking sector.We kick it off though now with healthcare, President Donald Trump is threatening to stop payments to insurers in a bid to get democrats to negotiate new legislation according to the Wall Street Journal. Here's what President Trump said during my exclusive sit down earlier this week about that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: healthcare has been going along some negotiations, I do. And it's just a negotiation and it's going to take a little while longer but as you probably here in congress it's coming along, we have some great people at congress, they want it to happen. We will have no democrats, zero. That means we have to get close to 100 percent of the republicans, not an easy way to run a government.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Senate Minority Leader, Chuck Schumer reportedly responded and here's what he said, "President Trump is threatening to hold hostage healthcare for millions of Americans. Many of whom voted for him to achieve a political goal of repeal that would take healthcare away from millions more, this cynical strategy will fail."Matt Murray, let's talk about that. Some republicans think this healthcare payments approved by Former President Barrack Obama are unconstitutional in the first place, do you think withholding these payments would actually happen and what is the impact?MURRAY: I think it's unlikely that he's actually going to withhold the payments. I mean the ones who would affect the most would be the low income Americans who would feel it the deepest and the democrats would (inaudible) with that forever.But he's trying to use whatever tools he's got to negotiate in pressure and he's still -- it's still a pretty tough needle to thread, Maria, because he's got even if the freedom caucus is moving toward him and we'll talk to Congressman DeSantis, moderates and republicans were also part of the problem, the democrats are really sending off no signals that they're going to cooperate with him at all here.BARTIROMO: It's really unfortunate actually unfortunate actually what's going on. I mean one thing that he said to me earlier this week is that he's incredibly hateful, Robert Wolf.I mean the truth is, the congress used to have coffee and get together. I mean there's real hatred between them. How do you get anything done in that regard?WOLF: No, it's incredibly polarized. It's disappointing.BARTIROMO: It is.WOLF: What I would say is I would recommend the president, take a pause on healthcare. I agree with Matt. They're going to need to thread the needle. If they're not going to get the moderate senators like Portman and Mikulski and Collin.So I don't think it will pass and therefore they're already now starting to say tax reform may not happen this year. My recommendation is the most bipartisan policy issue we can take on is infrastructure. Unions of four chamber commerce for it, business is for it.BARTIROMO: Can you do it side-by-side Robert? Can you do tax reform and infrastructure?WOLF: You could do tax reform and infrastructure in my opinion. Almost -- this is what I think you can do, you can do infrastructure and business tax reform. You cannot do personal tax reform.So I would take infrastructure and business tax reform, that would be my focus for 2017 and you have a shot to get it done. I think when you get into personal tax reform, it gets into all the itemized items, I think then it becomes incredibly difficult.BARTIROMO: That's not what they're doing now.WOLF: They're not.MURRAY: If they don't it now they can't do it next year with midterms coming.WOLF: But you don't know if this is just a little rhetoric if Trump saying, "I haven't given up on it." And that's how he is. He's a battler.BARTIROMO: Right. They're negotiating and even yesterday, right, Dagen -WOLF: They have other things going on.BARTIROMO: -- the Freedom Caucus Chairman, Mark Meadows, he was out and he told the radio station in North Carolina that a healthcare deal was very close. He said that.WOLF: No, I know. But Ryan immediately said afterwards, we have to fund the insurance payments. So that thing I think really is a little more easy.MURRAY: Yes. I think the freedom --MCDOWELL: When you talk about the division between republicans and democrats, the division between the freedom caucus and the rest of the republicans in office or in congress is the reason that that healthcare bill didn't go to a vote.And one of the things that Meadows said in that interview that he did that that you're referencing was talking about we're going to drive down premiums. Will the CBO score on the GOP bill in the first place said that premiums would be lower, 10 percent lower by 2026. I know that that's out, that's further out, that's past -- certainly past the midterms but they can't -- they're cutting off their nose despite their face.That's how I see with the freedom caucus digging in their heels over what was small issues, by the way, because the senate was going to rip it up anyway whatever the house pass.WOLF: President's right though on -- for him on tax reform if he got healthcare passed first that actually is the impetus to moving healthcare and tax reform in either way.BARTIROMO: Because of the $900 billion --WOLF: Because of the $900 billion.BARTIROMO: -- in savings.WOLF: But I just think if you focus on business tax reform, they would near a solution under President Obama, they are going to be closer to a solution under President Trump because there's just a big pro business force behind it.BARTIROMO: One thing that he did say earlier in the week was, "Look, if we can't and we don't get healthcare done then I will do just cut taxes. In that regard, I took it as there's no tax reform package coming, just cutting corporate taxes.MCDOWELL: And can we also talk about the fact that there's so much going on on the geopolitical stage. You're talking about Syria, Iran, Russia, China, North Korea. Does that take the momentum away from the domestic agenda? Because he -- to say he has his hands full is an understatement.MURRAY: But I think Syria helped him right now Dagen. I think that Syria turned it around a little bit --BARTIROMO: It gave them leverage in Russia, no doubt about it.MURRAY: And he even gave some of the people who are just implacably opposed to him some reason to support him. It turned the tide a little bit with some people.He's clearly feeling that he can do a little more as president not just having failure, failure headlines but the success is and the people phrase it --BARTIROMO: There are deals being done. I mean given what has taken place in Syria, now they have the leverage to say to Russia, "You're going to be backing this guy or you're going to be backing the U.S.?"And then there's another deal being done and that is China. So China suggest that they are going to help us with North Korea, you're right, I did report yesterday that they were going to have the currency report and not label them China a currency manipulator, that was a big deal.MURRAY: Yes. There's one challenge with him though, I think -- and I think all the news yesterday showed it which is it's very much in his pocket. He's the one talking about China is a currency manipulator, he's the one talking about tax reform. Very hard steel I think for many people and markets to know -- to pin down exactly what he thinks because his views can change pretty quickly.MCDOWELL: Can we just point out though that like before -- after the election, before the inauguration, the -- I'm not even going to the collusion there, but the narrative was Trump closer to Russia, pulling away from China. It's the exact opposite, it is the exact opposite.BARTIROMO: That's right.WOLF: But I think --BARTIROMO: And he's doing a deal with China.MCDOWELL: Right.WOLF: He (inaudible) to China, "If you help us with North Korea, we'll be good on trade we won't label you currency manipulator." Sorry Robert.WOLF: Listen, I think Maria yesterday this is a guy who likes to win. He's the president, he wants a legislative win. I think he has a little win behind his back right now.I'm very surprised that he's still focusing on healthcare but I really think he could get a real win on tax reform this year and that would be a home run because it hasn't been able to get done in decades.BARTIROMO: It's true. Yes. We'll talk all about this. A lot happening this morning, stay with us.At 7:00am Eastern, I'll be speaking with Freedom Caucus Member and Florida Congressman Ron DeSantis, you don't want to miss that, giving all of the issues around freedom caucus and the healthcare situation.First though, the turbulence continues for United Airlines this morning, the man violently removed from the overbooked flight might be pressing charges now, the legal ramifications coming up.And then GM puts on the breaks, the automaker will idle truck and SUV factories, we'll tell you what's behind that move next. Back in a moment hright here.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The passenger dragged from his seat over an overbooked United Airlines flight now is suing the airline. Lauren Simonetti with the latest now. Lauren, good morning to you.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: The drama continues Maria. Dr. Dao who is left with a bloody face after forcibly removed from that overbooked United flight on Sunday lures with the doctor now asking an Illinois court to order the airline to preserve surveillance footage and any other information related to the flight.They plan to hold a news conference in Chicago this morning. Meanwhile, the city itself also taking action, two more officers involved in removing Dr. Dao from the flight, they were placed on administrative leave while investigators continue to review what happened. And the airline itself now offering a refund to every single passenger on board that flight also promising to no longer have police remove paying passengers from overbooked plane. Take a look at UAL shares, they fell one percent yesterday, so far this week the company has lost $250 million in market value because of that incident that Sunday.Meanwhile, Fox News has learned that a cartel member accused of fatality shooting U.S. Border Patrol Agent, Brian Terry in 2010 using a U.S. government issued gun is now in custody. A joint U.S.-Mexico taskforce apprehended the man, his name Heraclio Osorio-Arellanes at a ranch in North Western Mexico. Authorities had placed $250,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. Terry was killed during a gunfight between border patrol agents and a five-men cartel group also known as the "Rip Crew." They're also known to rob dealers along the border. His death exposed, Operation Fast and Furious in which the government allowed criminals to buy guns with the intention of tracking them once they made their way into Mexico, two of those guns were found at the scene of Terry's killing.Meanwhile, Michigan State Capital, Lansing, now we're sending its decision to call itself the "Sanctuary City" amid pressure from business. The Lansing City Council voted 5-2 to reverse last week's six to nothing vote to give the city sanctuary status, a measure efforted by the City's mayor. Here's what the mayor had to say Tucker Carlson on Fox News last night on the pushback from businesses.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: It seems like your city council didn't agree, why did they see the brilliance of your plan?JAMES FOUTS, MAYOR OF WARREN, MICHIGAN: Now come on now Tucker, I said nothing like that. I think we're a great city now.CARLON: I think, look --FOUTS: What we're seeing is democracy in action Tucker and this discussion is part of it, I think we should have more conversations where we shed light and not heat.(END VIDEO CLIP)SIMONETTI: And finally the Wall Street Journal reporting that investor David Einhorn ramping up pressure on General Motors to split its common stock into two classes.The move comes as Einhorn's hedge fund Greenlight Capital nominates three new candidates for the company's board and also accuses GM of misrepresenting his proposal to investors and ratings firms.Meanwhile, Bloomberg is reporting that the automaker has drawn attention for upping its inventory here in the U.S. but now the company says it's only building up its stock pile because of plans to idle truck and SUV factories for 10 weeks in order to retool them for the newer models. Maria, back to you.BARTIROMO: All right. Thanks so much. A lot of pressure on GM right now particularly as you see Tesla, Robert Wolf increasing in value, highest market value in many automaker?WOLF: You know what, it's either -- Elon Musk either is the most brilliant guy ever or --BARTIROMO: Lucky.WOLF: Or he has the greatest short squeeze going on I've ever seen in the history of markets because the idea that it's valued more than GM in for now is absolutely incredible. There has to be a short squeeze going on because it was not based on multiple.BARTIROMO: Yes.MURRAY: I mean, Einhorn is pressuring GM. So far he didn't seem to be getting very far with it, so I don't really know where that's going for him. This is just another tech company that's getting a lot of attention from investors and it will go up and I don't know if it will stay up.BARTIROMO: Does it feel like 1990s to you Dagen, I mean with Tesla and with Amazon and you look at these market values versus these traditional?MCDOWELL: Tesla is not pets.com, at least they make something. But in terms of the valuation, money loser, they have not proven that they can ramp up production in any significant way.Ford and General Motors know how to mass manufacture a variety of different vehicles and do it quite well even with being union shops. Tesla has yet to prove that it can mass produce a car that's reasonably priced for the American people and the valuation is just not -- it's not incredible, it's absurd.BARTIROMO: Absurd. Right. That's right. Come back to `90s.WOLF: You have to also give GM CEO Mary Barra a lot of credit. She kind of -- when Trump went after her she's took a hard line, Einhorn's going after her, she's taking a hard line, she said no multiple (inaudible) she's tough.MCDOWELL: I'll add one quick thing.BARTIROMO: Yes, real quick.MCDOWELL: That CEOs of car companies are usually showman and great salesman, Elon Musk, a little prickly to be the head of a car company. That's all I'm saying. That he might be great at selling under rich folks but you start trying to sell them to the people I grew up with, good luck buddy.BARTIROMO: More on that. Coming up next, trouble for the energy sector, oil demand growth expected to slow down for a second year in a row, what that means for you at the pump.And then Burger King's attempt for free advertisement getting foiled, why Google puts a stop to the latest commercial, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets are mixed today, take a look at oil for example, the International Energy Agency warning that it expects demand growth to slow down for a second straight year.Joining us right on the phone is PRICE Futures Group Analyst, Fox News Contributor, Phil Flynn. And Phil, oil at 53 in change right now, your thoughts on this report.PHIL FLYNN, ANALYST, PRICE FUTURES GROUP: You know, I mean there's no doubt that they're expecting demand to slow a little bit but a lot of that is because of what we saw in Russia, in India earlier in the year.Right now, India have some currency movements that slowed their oil demand a little bit but I don't think it's indicative of what we're all demanding. Even with that swelling demand, the International Energy Agency is saying that right now the global oil market is very close to being imbalance, both that continues for production cut we could actually fall into a supply deficit later this year.WOLF: Hey Phil, it's Robert, how are you? What are you --FLYNN: Hey (inaudible).WOLF: Nice to see you. What do you think OPEC continues to say based on output? And do you think they actually stay within what they're saying? It seems like some people, they go outside, they make a statement then they do what they want.FLYNN: Well I think at this point you cannot underestimate the result of OPEC. I mean they chalked everybody even the International Energy Agency says that there's -- their compliance is at 99 percent.Other private forecaster say it's even higher than that, 104 percent. So anybody who underestimates OPEC's result really has got it wrong. And if you look at the Non-OPEC compliance, it's improving dramatically and that bodes very well for an extension of cuts at this OPEC meeting in May.WOLF: So what do you think they'll -- where do you think -- at what price are the happy do you think over the next six month period?FLYNN: They want to see oil trade to $60 a barrel and I think -- people, they keep talking about the increase in its oil output, they're not afraid of that.They realize that it's going to take time for U.S. a (inaudible) producers to match their cuts. And even with the slower demand growth of 1.3 million barrels a day, that's going to need a much tighter market and higher prices for the cartel.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll leave it there. Oil right now down just a fraction this morning. Phil Flynn, good to see you. Thank you so much.FLYNN: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Looking at the oil companies, we'll be hearing from the oil company soon in terms of the first quarter earnings reporting season. What do you think?WOLF: Well, Phil's right. If OPEC stays within their supply book-ends, then I think at the end of the day you'll see oil continue to trend up higher.BARTIROMO: You think higher. Because I would think that even the policies --WOLF: But I'm surprised.BARTIROMO: Yes, you're surprised. Given the policies of tapping into the energy sector, Dagen, having more supply in the global market, the oil price is lower over the long-term.WOLF: The geopolitical risk though bodes well for oil prices, right? I mean, look to your left, look to your right, there's something going on somewhere.MURRAY: Yes. And it's been a good period for the U.S. industry as Phil said right at the end emerging a little bit more as OPEC pulls back.MCDOWELL: But I think our use of our energy sector in terms of giving us more leverage on the world stage, if we make it easier to pump oil in this country, it gives us more control and more leverage over Russia for example and (inaudible) the fact that the Secretary of Energy sit now as part of the National Security Council is significant.Again, the -- our ability to produce fossil fuels here in the United States is an important point to making us less reliant on countries that hate us for oil.BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, there apparently is a growing divide between the U.S. and Russia right now. President Trump is declaring relations between the countries maybe at an all time low, the escalating tensions there. We'll give you the backdrop of that meeting yesterday.Plus, the first Muslim woman to serve as U.S. judge has been found dead after being reported missing in the Hudson River the body was found, the details as the authorities investigate the cause of death. We'll bring you that story next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Happy Thursday, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo.And it is Thursday, April 13. Here are your top stories, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast. An all-time low -- President Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson highlighting the strained relationship between the U.S. and Russia right now.Tillerson had his first official meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday following last week's strike in Syria.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REX TILLERSON, SECRETARY, DEPARTMENT OF STATE: Clearly, our view is that the reign of the Assad family is coming to an end. And they have again brought this on themselves with their conduct of the war in these past few years.We discussed our view that Russia as their closest ally in the conflict perhaps has the best means of helping Assad recognize this reality.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The strain with Russia coming amid rising tensions over North Korea -- the very latest as satellite imagery suggests that North Korea is planning yet another nuclear test reportedly today. On Wall Street, it's all about the banks today.We are going to be hearing first quarter earnings from JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, all ahead of the earning -- ahead of the opening of trading. That will certainly set the tone for stock prices today.We will bring those numbers to you as soon as they hit the wires. President Trump's comments on the dollar weighing on global markets this morning.He told "The Wall Street Journal" yesterday that the dollar is getting too strong. And with that, the dollar sold off, futures indicating a lower opening for stock prices as the stock market follows the dollar down this morning, down about a quarter of a percent.In Europe, declines across the board there as well -- the FTSE 100 down two-thirds of a percent as is the CAC 40 in Paris, the DAX index in Germany down a third of a percent. In Asia overnight, here is the story.The Nikkei average was down two-thirds of a percent, Hang Seng down a quarter of a percent, but the Kospi in Korea up almost one percent. So was it a smart move or a Whopper of a mistake?We are taking a look at Burger King's new commercial that's getting pushback from Google this morning. Plus, more problems with Qualcomm to tell you about -- why the chip-maker was forced to pay Blackberry over $800 million.And then the gateway to the West, also one (ph) to the courtroom for the NFL -- the details behind St. Louis lawsuit against the NFL this morning. First though, our top story this half hour -- rising tensions between the U.S. and Russia.President Trump spoke last night about the deepening divide with Moscow over Syria and other issues.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: It would be wonderful as we were discussing just a little while ago if NATO and our country could get along with Russia. Right now, we're not getting along with Russia at all.We may be at an all-time low in terms of relationship with Russia. This is built for a long period of time.But we're going to see what happens.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is former U.S. Army Intelligence Officer, Andrew Peek.Andrew, great to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.ANDREW PEEK, FORMER OFFICER, ARMY INTELLIGENCE: Great to be back.BARTIROMO: What -- how do you see the relationship right now? What do you think needs to happen to repair relations with Russia?PEEK: Well, I think saying that relations are at an all-time low is a little bit hyperbolic, right? I mean, the Cuban missile crisis was a -- was a big low.BARTIROMO: Good point.MCDOWELL: But that's -- you basically read my thought bubble.(CROSSTALK)PEEK: Yes, the Korean war, the Vietnam war.BARTIROMO: Yes.PEEK: .you know, the Berlin airlift, I think, look, I think it says something to the depth of divide between the U.S. and Russia that with the most potentially pro-Russian president in history, or at least in modern history since end of the Cold War, the U.S. and Russia are at the same lodger heads they were under Obama and under Bush and under Clinton and so on and -- and so forth.So look, I'm not sure anything can repair the relationship with Russia. They want to hang on into Assad. They want to have freedom of action on Eastern Europe.And we want to prevent that.WOLF: Andrew, I mean, you're talking about the two places that have the largest stockpile of nuclear. And so we have to make sure that we -- even though they're adversary, that we get along and we figure how to play in the sand box to the best of each other's ability.How do you start getting there?PEEK: Well, look, I think that's part of Tillerson's mission, right? Tillerson's over there to play the good cop to Nikki Haley's bad cop at the U.N.You know, he's not saying regime change. He's clearly with a message about Assad personally and Assad's family and also the future use of chemical weapons.So what I would suspect Tillerson is saying to him is hey, look, we don't mind having this someone in this regime running the country in the future. We don't even mind having a major U.S. presence in the country in the future.What we do mind is having Assad personally there. So I think coming to a Dayton (ph) on Syria is first step on that.MURRAY: Andrew, one of the big news events yesterday didn't happen in Moscow. It happened when President Trump said, actually, I believe in NATO now.And actually, I support NATO and NATO is strong. What do you make of that stance and that turn and -- and what it says about the -- the Russia-U.S. relationship going forward?PEEK: Boy, you know, the best thing in Washington is when the swamp creatures start being nice to you, you know.(LAUGHTER)So no, again, I mean, I think it speaks to the -- the permanence of U.S. national interest that once you become the president, you realize that these alliance structures are really important. And I think -- I think also they have learned a little bit to -- to speak the -- the correct words, you know, and diplomatic jargon, how to reassure NATO allies without necessarily committing yourself to a major course of action.But certainly, both the president and the secretary of state over the last two weeks have said a lot more things that make our NATO allies comfortable.BARTIROMO: Let's -- let's move onto North Korea. Things feels like they're getting real dangerous out there.Take a look at this satellite imagery suggesting that the nation is preparing for a sixth nuclear test possibly to coincide with the hundred and fifth anniversary of the birth of the state founder, Kim Il-Sung, on Saturday. President Trump told me earlier in the week that he expects China's leader, Xi Jinping to cooperate on stopping the nuclear threat from the hermit kingdom.They're doing a deal. If China helps the U.S. on that, perhaps they get better terms on trade. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: But I think China can help us. I hope China can help us. We talked about trade. And I can tell you, China will do much better on trade if they help us with North Korea.BARTIROMO: And you think he knows that?TRUMP: I think he knows that. I told him that, yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Is trade policy enough to convince China to actually do something -- do something concrete?PEEK: Well, you know, there have been two really interesting articles appearing (ph) the state-run press in China, one saying -- one telling North Korea, a close Chinese ally, to avoid provocations when these U.S. warships are near it. The second one saying that North Korea nuclear tests are a strategic embarrassment for China and potentially, a danger to -- to Beijing itself, not just the United States and the region.So I think there's definitely the emergence of a second narrative within China and within the Chinese government that there may be -- that North Korea is not necessarily the strategic asset they thought it was. And yet, there might be room to cooperate with the U.S. and finding a more permanent solution.MCDOWELL: And read into this for what it's worth. China sent some North Korean freighters loaded with coal back to North Korea and then turned around and placed orders for coal from -- with -- with the United States.So at least that, in terms of trying to parse China's actions, and then on top of that with the USS Carl Vinson and the -- the strike group there moving to the Korean Peninsula, it's expected that at least Japan moves warships into the region to join forces with the United States. So there's a lot happening and a lot of like incremental steps in terms of putting pressure on North Korea from our allies in China.MURRAY: But are there more levers really? I mean, the -- the rap on the Chinese have always been they rhetorically can -- can ramp it up. But they don't really press the levers.They'd rather have that regime there than a united Korean Peninsula. Are there more levers they can be pulling and should be pulling?PEEK: Well, of course. And in fact, this is why historically, Korea has often been divided because it's in the area where there's competing great powers like China, like Japan, like oceanic powers like the United States. And they each want a piece of it.So certainly, yes, there's more -- there's more levers that Chinese could be pulling. I think the coal embargo is such a huge piece because coal is 90 percent of North Korea's export income.So anytime that -- anytime that that cash flow, which North Korea doesn't have a lot of is restrained, you're going to see -- you're going to see serious behavioral changes from the Kim regime.BARTIROMO: So do you expect anything out f these, you know, military drills in -- in South Korea this morning? I mean, do you expect -- what -- what will be the impact?PEEK: Well, I think the most dangerous moment is April 15, which is a big day in North Korea because it's Kim Jong-un's birthday, you know.BARTIROMO: This Saturday.PEEK: .this Saturday, exactly. And they, you know, suspect he celebrates his birthday a little bit differently than we do in the United States. But, you know, no, I think there is -- we are closer to a military confrontation in North Korea than we have been since Kim Jong-un took power in 2012.WOLF: When -- when President Trump talks about the trade and currency manipulation with respect to China, I don't think that's really the carrot (ph) that gets anything because when U.S. had the sanctions on Russia, China immediately did an oil deal with Russia. When we did had it (ph) with Iran, they did a deal with Iran.So at the end of the day, China is a global player. They're going to move and navigate in the end to wherever it's best for them.But I think it's all about the idea of not wanting the -- this confrontation to take place in the -- in the South Sea so.PEEK: Absolutely, not least because any confrontation with North Korea gives us an excuse to strengthen our military allies in the pacific rim, particularly Japan, South Korea, Australia, the Philippines, elsewhere. Ordinarily, the Chinese would have a lot of reason to complain about that and gains (ph) some sympathy in the region.But if it's right in the wake of a North Korea nuclear provocation, then the sympathy is with us.WOLF: Can you just talk for 30 seconds about what President Trump kind of did the last week and what -- that we moved into North Korea and -- and the changes that took place because it got a lot of press but.BARTIROMO: He said it was an armada that they sent -- that they sent.(CROSSTALK)WOLF: .right, but based on what's going on in Syria and Russia, you didn't hear as much about it.BARTIROMO: He said it was incredibly powerful and it was armada. I'm just wondering what he was trying to say about that armada.WOLF: Right. That's what I was wondering.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: .because he said it was incredibly powerful. And where there nukes on that -- on that armada?PEEK: I think it was the biggest ever. No, I.WOLF: The biggest chocolate cake.PEEK: .yes, the biggest -- look, OK.BARTIROMO: Hey, we have chocolate cake (ph).(CROSSTALK)PEEK: .so this carrier group, the Carl Vinson's, had been in -- around the Korean Peninsula the month before participating in war games. So its actual presence is not that unusual.I -- I would say that it is unusual that the president is consciously translating his deterrent success in Syria into a confrontation in North Korea. I mean, he's linking that very explicitly.And now, a little bit the onus is on Kim Jong-un to say, hey, I'm not Bashar Assad. You want a confrontation, you can have one.BARTIROMO: Yes, I want to -- I want to switch gears because I want to tell you that the earnings that you've seen (ph) in the tape (ph), guys, JPMorgan just reported earnings, a dollar $0.65 a share versus a dollar $0.52. The -- the revenue coming in at $25.5 but on a managed basis, $25.9 billion, the stock a moment ago was trading down.What's your take on the banks right now?MURRAY: They're expected to have a pretty good quarter.BARTIROMO: Yes.MURRAY: .because a year ago was a pretty bad quarter for them. One of the things I'd like to look more at is what's business lending like for JPMorgan and for the other banks, which have been off (ph) a little bit.But JPMorgan, I think, is doing pretty well relative to others.BARTIROMO: That's the leaders. I mean, the stock is now off (ph).(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: U.S. banks are in really good position right now.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: And especially.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: . I mean, really good position.BARTIROMO: .if the -- the regulations are rolled (ph) back.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: .how big is that going to be for them?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Between reg reform, between business sector feeling better, confidence up, the U.S. consumer is doing better, credit cards, U.S. banks are in a good position right now.MCDOWELL: And the Federal Reserve poised to raise interest rates two or even three more times this year.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Except for Trump saying he loves.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: By the way, Jamie Dimon is saying the U.S. consumer is healthy today. They've got internal data about the consumer.He's been saying that for a while, that the consumer is doing really well. It has been the business sector and.(CROSSTALK)MURRAY: The business sector has been a little soft.BARTIROMO: Right, right.MURRAY: .in a way that surprised them. And we'll see how it goes (ph).WOLF: The credit cards' balance is over a trillion. So -- so now, you have, you know, the highest it's been in maybe ever.BARTIROMO: Yes. All right, we will leave it there.Andrew, it's great to see you this morning.PEEK: Great to be back.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Andrew Peek joining us there. Please come back soon.PEEK: Great.BARTIROMO: Great insights as always from you. Coming up next, new details released on the fugitive who allegedly sent an anti-government manifesto to President Trump -- why the suspect claims he needed to steal the firearms.And then Google says it is not OK to Burger King -- the technology giant quickly shutting down a new burger commercial that attempts to highjack home devices -- details coming up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Check out markets this morning. The stocks are lower, down a fraction 28 points from the Dow Jones Industrial Average.But it is following the dollar lower after President Trump's comments to "The Wall Street Journal." We'll take a look at a couple of names on the move this morning -- Qualcomm ordering to pay over $800 million to Blackberry as part of an arbitration case.The payment centers around patent royalty disputes over past sales. Qualcomm shares today at $53.43. We're watching shares of Wells Fargo -- Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway cutting its stake in the bank with plans to sell nine million shares.This move is keeping Berkshire's ownership of the bank below 10 percent. Wells Fargo is going to be reporting first-quarter earnings later this morning.We did get JPMorgan earnings. And they were better than expected at a dollar $0.65 on revenue of $29.5 billion. That stock is up.The first female Muslim judge in the United States found dead in the Hudson River. Lauren Simonetti with the very latest.Lauren, what a story.SIMONETTI: Hey, Maria. I know. The body of Sheila Abdus-Salaam found on the bank of the Hudson River.She's also the first black woman appointed to New York's highest court. Authorities say her body had no obvious signs of trauma or injury.The cause of her death is under investigation. Well, the Wisconsin man accused of robbing a gun store and sending anti-government threats to the White House apparently wrote an apology letter to the store owner.Joseph Jakubowski said that he wanted to purchase the guns to protect himself and his family but was legally barred from doing so because he is a felon. The letter also thanked the gun shop owner for protecting the second amendment right of U.S. citizens.Well, a nationwide manhunt underway for Jakubowski. He's been on the run for seven days now. Video of him apparently recorded before the theft shows that he's holding an oversized white envelope containing a hundred and 61-page manifesto addressed to President Trump.Well, Burger King set off an online battle with this new ad campaign last night. It was intended to trigger voice-activated speakers in homes and some Android phones with the description of the Whopper. Here you go.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're watching a 15-second Burger King ad, which is unfortunately not enough time to explain all the fresh ingredients in the Whopper sandwich. But I got an idea.OK, Google, what is the Whopper burger?(END VIDEO CLIP)SIMONETTI: So Google got wind (ph) of that gimmick and disabled the voice command about three hours after Burger King introduced the spot on YouTube and that set off a battle on Wikipedia, troll-exchanged (ph) the Whopper description in Wiki to say things like the burger contains cyanide, a hundred percent rat and toenail clippings. And after a few back-and-forth entries, Burger King eventually restored the original content.Well, in the markets, the biggest U.S. banks kicking off earnings season when they report their first quarter earnings this morning. JPMorgan Chase already out, Citi and Wells Fargo reporting before the open.JPMorgan just reported stronger than expected earnings per share of a dollar $0.65. That beats (ph) its expectation, the stock trading higher in premarket right now.Citi expected to post higher earnings from a year ago while analysts are looking for Wells Fargo to report slightly lower earnings because of the scandal -- the sales scandal last year. Bank stocks have rallied since the election, although the sector has been under pressure since early March.Maria?BARTIROMO: All right. Thank you, Lauren.SIMONETTI: Sure.BARTIROMO: Coming up next, ramping up a fight for the Rams -- St. Louis filing a lawsuit against the NFL. That's blocked the team's move to Los Angeles -- details next, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Scary moment at Yankee Stadium yesterday. Jared Max with the story now and all (ph) the (ph) day in sports.Jared?JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS REPORTER: Good morning, Maria. Happy Thursday. A collision at first base knocked two players out of the Yankees' race game yesterday.The Yankees' Brett Gardner appeared to get the worst of it. It was the bottom of the sixth inning.There were runners on first and third as Gardner hits a ground ball, sprints toward first base, but throws into (ph) dirt, so -- well, the Rays' Rickie Weeks, Jr. had a maneuver toward the baseline, run scores. But Week's head collided with Gardner's chest -- oh.Now, Weeks has said to have sustained shoulder and neck soreness. Gardner, who had the presence of mind to crawl back to first base, lay on the ground a few minutes after.And then he was able to walk off the field. There's (ph) no conscious, it appears. But Gardner has bruised jaw, strained neck.Yankees won the game eight to four. Chicago Cubs World Series champions has a nice ring to it. Last night at Wrigley Field, the Cubs received their World Series rings -- rings designed with input from the players who delivered the team's first World Series title in a hundred eight years and those hundred eight years represented on that special ring.It has 214 diamonds, 5.4 carats, plus 3 carats of red rubies to form the letter C and spell Cubs plus another two and a half carats of sapphires on (ph) the bezel (ph) that's surrounded by 108 white diamonds. That signifies a hundred eight years between Cubs' World Series titles.Cubbies (ph) lost two-nothing to the Dodgers. The original Mr. triple- double honored the modern-day statistical monster last night in Oklahoma City. Before the Thunder played their regular season finale, a man who's 55-year record he broke for the most triple-doubles in a season, hall-of- famer Oscar Robertson saluted Russell Westbrook.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OSCAR ROBERTSON, FORMER NBA PLAYER: I'll (ph) have one more thing to say, MVP.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)MAX: That's hard to imagine it's even a discussion for MVP. But many think the race is between Westbrook and the Rockets' James Harden.While the NBA's top two triple-double men will meet in the first round fo the playoffs, which will begin this weekend. The Thunder and the Rockets open their best of seven series Sunday so do top overall seed (ph) Warriors against the Blazers.Saturday, Spurs, Grizzlies, also Clippers and the Jazz, they'll play that (ph) in L.A. Now, because the Indiana Pacers and Chicago Bulls won their season finales last night, both got into the playoffs.Chicago will open at Boston on Sunday and Indiana takes on Cleveland, Toronto against Milwaukee and Washington goes up against Atlanta.BARTIROMO: Jared, what about this lawsuit -- city of St. Louis reportedly filing a lawsuit against the NFL, basically saying they're (ph) for relocating the Rams to Los Angeles.MAX: Robert, would you agree that this is sour grapes for sale?BARTIROMO: They want a billion dollars in damages, however (ph). He's (ph) naming the league along with 32 teams and their owners.WOLF: Listen, they're private owners. They're allowed to do what they want to do. And they don't -- most of them don't take any municipal funding.It's private stadium financing. So a hard -- it's a hard argument.BARTIROMO: The -- the officials say that the NFL violated the own (ph) relocation guidelines and profited off the move that's leaving the city without a football team.MAX: But Maria, it's all -- think about it, the NFL has this -- it's this monster entity unlike really anything else we have -- 32 owners. But it's still one league.So the purpose is make as much money as possible for the NFL. They weren't going to get done in St. Louis.That's why they left. The fact that we've had three teams relocate in just over a year speaks volumes. The NFL -- why would it work against itself?BARTIROMO: But now, what -- but now, St. Louis doesn't have a team, Dagen. Does it.MCDOWELL: Well, you know what, if they would have -- should have done more as a city and a people to hang on to the team that they had, and that's one of the reasons they relocated, am I wrong?MAX: No, you're -- you're spot on. If -- if a city can't support.(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hard to compare (ph) St. Louis and L.A. on T.V. rights and everything.MAX: Exactly.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: .who are we kidding (ph)?MCDOWELL: No offense. Better barbecue, though.(CROSSTALK)MURRAY: If you look at -- if you look at the numbers of those (ph) sued (ph) -- the numbers of those (ph) sued are true. They -- they take a big economic hit from this thing.And they don't have nearly the base obviously.(CROSSTALK)MAX: Well, they -- they need to be able to support the team. Just quick, you know, I've got the American flag pin on today.And -- and this would be for the three American NHL teams which went three and 0 against the Canadians last night.BARTIROMO: Great.MAX: Stanley Cup playoffs underway (ph).BARTIROMO: Awesome. Thanks, Jared.(APPLAUSE)Thumbs up to that. Catch Jared's sports reports on Fox News Headlines 24/7 or SiriusXM 115. Take a break, then passing up perks -- the shocking number of people who choose not to redeem credit card rewards, next hour.BARTIROMO: Good Thursday morning, everybody. Welcome back. Thanks so much for being here. I'm Maria Bartiromo.Load-Date: April 13, 2017End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 27 of 291China Polysilicon Industry Report 2017: By the End of 2017, the Annual Production Capacity of Polysilicon in China Will Reach 250-260 Thousand Tons/Year  Page 29 of 291China compiles its own Wikipedia, but public can't edit it  Page 31 of 291China compiles its own Wikipedia, but public can't edit it  Page 33 of 291China compiles its own Wikipedia, but public can't edit it  Page 35 of 291China compiles its own Wikipedia, but public can't edit it  Page 37 of 291China compiles its own Wikipedia, but public can't edit it  Page 39 of 291China compiles its own Wikipedia, but public can't edit it  Page 42 of 291CHINA TO BAR PRIVATE COMPANIES FROM PROVIDING ONLINE NEWS  Page 44 of 291IFJ Opposes Apple Decision to Block Content for China, Hong Kong, Taiwan Users  Page 46 of 291HUMAN RIGHTS: LIU XIAOBO IN CHINA, A.
