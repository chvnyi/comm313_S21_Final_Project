Renowned Chinese professor discusses multimedia in journalismThe Signal: College of New JerseyFebruary 21, 2017 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 505 wordsByline: Jonathan EdmondsonBodyBy JonathanEdmondsonStaff WriterWhen describing the way in which traditional news media fairs in today's digital world, China's most prominent journalism professor said it's like a "very small ship in a big sea."Traditional print media is no longer the dominant force behind how citizens get their news, he explained. Instead, media convergence is the key to future news consumption.Jianwu Song, who visited the College on Feb. 13, spoke to a group of journalism students in the Beats and Deadlines class about media convergence in China and the ways in which news organizations are adapting to keep up with evolving technology.Song is a professor at Renmin University of China, where he is also the director of the AsiaInfo Media Convergence Lab. His recent trip to America took him from coast to coast, visiting places like Stanford University and Google, to discuss the current media landscape across the globe.Song's research centers on media convergence, which is the way in which traditional print text combines with other forms of media, such as audio and video, to create more engaging content."Traditional media has lost its effect on citizens," said Song, whose talk was translated by Yifeng Hu, an associate professor of communication studies at the College.As Song explained, 53 percent of the Chinese population uses cell phones as their primary way of accessing news. As a result, news outlets in China have looked to media convergence to adapt and survive. The Chinese government, which has extensive control over the journalism community, is also pushing for this media renaissance.To embrace media convergence, Song and his team developed what is known as a "Media Hub," which is a place where content flourishes and attracts a lot of citizens. In addition to news articles, it also features places where users can enjoy digital entertainment like gaming, pay traffic fines and other tickets, interact with government officials and even make cultural industry investments.Song considers the Media Hub to be similar to a central kitchen."These seats are for the main chefs who cook the nicest dish," Song said. He laughed while showing a picture of where the bosses sit in the hub, which includes a 75-foot-long screen for showcasing content.While others are trying to mimic Song's work, he currently has the most advanced media convergence setup in China.Even with his focus on evolving technology, Song acknowledges that journalism is facing a period of growth and uncertainty worldwide."It used to be quite the honorable thing to be a journalism student," Song said in an interview with The Signal, citing his time as a college student. "Now things have changed. ... A lot of individuals who work in the industry have left and switched to other industries."He has hope, though, that others will embrace the media's changes."We are thinking of what kind of training can we provide to new students because the media is changing and society is changing," Song said. "We are exploring these issues, as well."RelatedLoad-Date: February 21, 2017End of Document

China: Order to Restrict Children's Books Troubling Step Toward Ideological ConformityTargeted News ServiceMarch 14, 2017 Tuesday 11:24 PM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 529 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyPEN America issued the following news release:The Chinese government's reported introduction of new measures to restrict children's access to books written by foreign authors is the next step in China's growing restrictions on free thought and free expression, PEN America stated today.Both the South China Morning Post and the Financial Times reported late last week that Chinese regulators had given instructions to publishers to limit publication of children's books written by foreign authors. The new order, which has not been made public, would reportedly reduce the number of foreign-authored children's book titles available in China, from thousands to only a few hundred. One source for the Morning Post report, a mainland publishing official, stated that the regulation was intended to ensure ideological conformity with Communist Party dogma.The reported regulatory order comes days after the announcement that Taobao, a prominent Chinese online shopping site, would prohibit the sale of all foreign publications on its site from all vendors not officially licensed by the government, starting March 10.PEN America has documented the tightening restrictions on access to foreign writing within China in several reports. This includes the practice of censorship of Chinese translations of the works of foreign authors, as PEN America documented in its May 2015 report "Censorship and Conscience"; and China's harsh restrictions of access to foreign journalism, which have tightened under the tenure of President Xi Jinping, as documented in PEN America's September 2016 report "Darkened Screen." PEN America's most recent report, "Writing on the Wall," examined the detention and forced disappearances of several Hong Kong booksellers known for selling titles banned in mainland China."China's efforts to restrict access to foreign children's literature suggest that President Xi is stretching to new lengths to try to control what citizens--especially younger generations--read, think, and say," said James Tager, Free Expression Programs Manager at PEN America. "Preventing children from reading foreign authors will only narrow their worldview. Unfortunately, this appears to be the goal of such regulation."PEN America, a literature and free expression advocacy organization, also has a long history of advocating against book bans within the United States. This advocacy includes the work of its longstanding Children's and Young Adult Book Authors Committee, which supports writers and librarians whose books have been banned or challenged. PEN America's most recent report on book banning in the United States was its September 2016 report "Missing from the Shelf."PEN America stands at the intersection of literature and human rights to protect open expression in the United States and worldwide. We champion the freedom to write, recognizing the power of the word to transform the world. Our mission is to unite writers and their allies to celebrate creative expression and defend the liberties that make it possible.Contact: Sarah Edkins, director of communications, 646/779-4830, sedkins@pen.orgCopyright Targeted News Services07M-Furigay-5804410 07M-FurigayLoad-Date: March 15, 2017End of Document

China Mobile Selects Brocade NFV Software Appliance to Support Internet Plus Mission; Mobile Giant to Break New Ground in China Service Provider Landscape with Leading-Edge SDN/NFV DeploymentMarketwiredJanuary 18, 2017 Wednesday 12:01 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Marketwire, L.P. All Rights ReservedLength: 721 wordsDateline: BEIJING, CHINA; Jan 18, 2017Body Brocade (NASDAQ: BRCD) today announced that China Mobile Ltd (SEHK: 0941) (NYSE: CHL), the world's largest mobile communications service provider, has selected an advanced network functions virtualization (NFV) solution from Brocade to support its most strategic corporate development initiative. Deployment of the Brocade(R) Virtual Traffic Manager (vTM) within key China Mobile data centers will help the company deliver highly available and agile cloud services, while keeping operating costs under control.As one of the country's major service providers, China Mobile is playing a leading role in the Chinese Government's Internet Plus initiative to increase competitiveness and support the development of new business models within conventional industries through information technologies, such as fixed and mobile Internet connectivity, cloud computing, Big Data, and the Internet of Things. In addition to providing IP connectivity services, China Mobile has also taken on the role of a large-scale cloud service provider capable of meeting the needs of major enterprise and government customers. Brocade vTM will initially be deployed at China Mobile's Southern Base and Northern Base data centers in conjunction with Nokia which, through its acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent, became China Mobile's strategic supplier of software-defined networking (SDN) and NFV infrastructure. Brocade vTM software will run within the Nuage Networks Virtualized Services Platform, a commercially supported version of the standard-based OpenStack SDN orchestration environment. "The promise of network functions virtualization is the ability to scale services on demand. When it comes to service providers, they don't come much bigger than China Mobile in terms of potential scale," said Henry Zhu, country manager of Brocade China. "We're naturally delighted that Brocade's advanced NFV appliance technology has been selected by China Mobile. This is a groundbreaking project within China's service provider landscape and we are fully committed to ensuring it results in complete success."As an NFV software appliance, Brocade vTM runs on the same industry-standard hardware and virtualization environment employed throughout China Mobile's cloud data centers. During testing, the project team was able to spin up a Brocade vTM instance of 200 Mbps on a single virtual machine host. With the orchestration upgrade for China Mobile's Cloud data center, Brocade vTM can achieve elastic capacity from 1 to 1000 Mbps on a single virtual machine host. The testing also revealed that getting the equivalent load balancing performance on a hardware-based application delivery controller would be 50 percent more expensive than the Brocade vTM solution. About Brocade Brocade (NASDAQ: BRCD) networking solutions help the world's leading organizations turn their networks into platforms for business innovation. With solutions spanning public and private data centers to the network edge, Brocade is leading the industry in its transition to the New IP network infrastructures required for today's era of digital business.

CHINA TO VET ALL ONLINE CONTENT, SERVICE AND EQUIPMENT PROVIDERSStates News ServiceFebruary 6, 2017 MondayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 559 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:The Chinese government is planning a nationwide probe of all internet services, software, and hardware that might be considered a threat to national security, according to draft plans published this week.But online freedom of speech activists said the aim of the review is likely to further strengthen the ruling Chinese Communist Party's control over what citizens can see online ahead of a top-level meeting later in the year.According to draft plans issued on Feb. 4 for public consultation by the China National Internet Information Office and other government agencies, the review will look at security vulnerabilities that could allow "illegal control, interference, and interruption" of online products and services.It will also seek to identify risks at the RandD stage, the delivery stage,and in technical support services.But the mandate for the plan also covers any other risks "that could endanger national security or the public interest," the draft plans said.The government will focus on "important online products and services ... and their providers," requiring companies to show their "commitment" to national security and carrying out government supervision including lab tests, inspections, online monitoring, and vetting procedures, according to the plans.The Chinese Communist Party and all government departments will then be required to drop any suppliers of internet-related products and services that fail the review process, the plans said.This could mean that products and services sourced overseas will be required to undergo extensive inspections and vetting procedures, or face being dropped, media reports indicated.National security concernsThe Beijing News quoted information security expert Zuo Xiaodong as saying that China is particularly concerned about the role imported technology could play in its security vulnerabilities."At the moment it relies on the best technology from overseas, because it hasn't broken into the core technology market yet," the paper quoted Zuo as saying. "That's why they have to ensure it is secure."The review forms part of the government's implementation of the draconian Cybersecurity Law, which was passed into law last November, and will likely take effect from June 1.But online activist Wu Bin said that national security is a euphemism for the stability of Communist Party rule, and that the new measures will simply enable greater state control of its own citizens."They aren't bringing this out now because they see a potential cybersecurity threat. It's because they see a potential threat to their regime," Wu said."It's all about stability maintenance, and things are going to be ever more tightly controlled in future," he said. "It's [a coup], like in the days of [Xin dynasty founder] Wang Mang.""Ordinary citizens won't know what's hit them; it will be so easy to break the law," he said.Nanjing resident Zhang Haoqi agreed."The direction in which they are headed has been clear for a very long time now, it's just that now they are stepping up the intensity of their strategic thinking," Zhang said."There's no doubt about it: their control over the internet is going to get tighter and tighter."Reported by Yang Fan for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by the Cantonese Service.

CONGRESSMAN PITTENGER COMMENDS PRESIDENT TRUMP, COMMERCE SECRETARY ROSS FOR HOLDING CHINA ACCOUNTABLEStates News ServiceMarch 7, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 354 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of North Carolina Rep. Robert Pittenger:Today, Chinese telecom firm ZTE Corporation agreed to pay an $892 million fine and plead guilty to violating U.S. law for selling embargoed equipment to an Iranian government-controlled entity which could be used to oppress human rights.Congressman Robert Pittenger (NC-09) has worked since April 2016 to urge the Commerce Department to punish this misconduct, including writing a letter to then-Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker which was co-signed by 22 additional Members of Congress."President Obama knew about ZTE for four years and incredibly chose to suspend sanctions. President Trump has been in office two months, and already ZTE has pled guilty and agreed to a substantial fine. This is genuine accountability on behalf of hardworking Americans."ZTE is just one example of questionable communist Chinese trade practices which unfairly undermine America's economy and basic human rights. China does not play by our rules, and we must be vigilant against potential national security risks associated with Chinese investments that may be controlled or heavily influenced by China's communist leadership," said Congressman Pittenger.Click here to read Congressman Pittenger's April 2016 letter to then-Commerce Secretary Pritzker.In 2012, ZTE violated U.S. export controls by selling embargoed equipment which would enable the Iranian government to monitor and control all electronic communication within its borders. ZTE Corporation maintains close ties with the Chinese government, which is the number one global state-sponsor of corporate cyber-espionage and malicious cyber-attacks.Last year, Congressman Pittenger led a successful bipartisan effort to request a Government Accountability Office (GAO) review of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which hasn't been substantially updated since the 1970s. At Congressman Pittenger's request, GAO is currently examining whether CFIUS statutory and administrative authorities have kept pace with the rapidly evolving national security landscape.###Load-Date: March 7, 2017End of Document

INTERNET BLOCKED IN TIBETAN AREAS OF CHINA IN RUN-UP TO SENSITIVE ANNIVERSARYStates News ServiceMarch 10, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 501 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Authorities in southwestern China's Sichuan province are blocking internet access in a Tibetan prefecture in the run-up to a sensitive political anniversary, fearing Tibetan residents may organize protests inspired by exiles living outside the country, sources say.The move blocks service in 10 counties of the Kardze (in Chinese, Ganzi) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and remains in effect through March 17, according to a document issued by prefecture authorities and obtained by RFA's Tibetan Service."Now, because of the March 10 anniversary of National Uprising Day, the authorities are concerned that residents of Tibetan areas could create problems under the influence of activities organized outside the country," one resident of the area told RFA."The authorities have therefore blocked internet service so that Tibetans cannot see, hear, or read about protests or other activities organized by Tibetans [living in exile]," RFA's source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Counties affected by the ban include Dartsedo (in Chinese, Kangding), Tawu (Daofu), Draggo (Luhuo), Kardze (Ganzi), Sershul (Shiqu), Dege (Dege), Palyul (Baiyu), Nyagrong (Xinlong), Lithang (Litang), and Bathang (Batang), according to the order, titled Document 24 of 2017.Other, unspecified areas will also have service blocked, the order says."Based on past experience, the Ngaba [Aba] Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture will also be affected," a second Tibetan source told RFA.Military parade heldMeanwhile, government employees in the neighboring Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) are being assigned in rotation to guard their offices around the clock, "and security is probably being heightened in [the TAR capital city] Lhasa," the source said.On March 10, 1959, Tibetans in Lhasa rose up in protest of Beijing's tightening political and military control of the formerly independent Tibetan region, sparking a rebellion in which thousands were killed.Tibet's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama fled Tibet into exile in the midst of the uprising, and Beijing has repeatedly accused exiled Tibetans, including the Dalai Lama, of stoking dissent against its rule ever since.On March 3 this year, Chinese troops staged a military parade in Lhasa that appeared "intended to discourage public protests or expressions of dissent," New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a March 9 statement.In addition, foreign travel to Lhasa has been closed for all of March, with the entire region placed on a security alert, HRW said."Chinese authorities are once again shutting off travel and holding military parades to bully the Tibetan population into silence," HRW China director Sophie Richardson said."Progress on human rights is only going to happen if the Chinese government replaces its intimidation tactics with a more open approach to information, expression, and peaceful dissent," Richardson said.Reported by RFA's Tibetan Service.

Hong Kong Elections Approach Amid Growing Local AnxietyUSNEWS.comMarch 22, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Best Countries; Vol.; No.Length: 1172 wordsByline: Christy ChoiHighlight: As the Chinese territory prepares to select a new leader, young adults are increasingly questioning their future.BodyHONG KONG -- On a recent gray spring day, Joshua Wong took a break from the scrum of interviews he was granting by sheltering in Citic Tower, the downtown office building that overlooks the vast reclamation works taking place along this city's harbor front. Wong's role as one of the student leaders of the 2014 "Umbrella Movement," sit-in demonstrations that unsuccessfully demanded greater public participation in the election of the city's top public official, has earned him the role of international poster boy for democracy in Hong Kong. As this weekend's election approaches for the chief executive, Hong Kong's top government position, news media are interested in Wong's views. Wong was born just a year before the United Kingdom returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule and theoretically should identify with a greater            China more so than his parents and grandparents. But like so many in his generation who have grown up in Hong Kong, Wong sees himself different from the mainland Chinese, and this burgeoning sense of identity has Beijing rattled. "We're the generation being blacklisted by China," Wong says, accusing the central government in Beijing of fueling local resentment by punishing the participants of the 2014 protests. "Even those who only gave out water ... gave out leaflets [during the 2014 pro-democracy protests] were all banned from entering China. So, how can we get a sense of belonging to China?" The March 26 election for Hong Kong's chief executive is more than a vote on who will lead the territory's government. The election is placing a focus on Hong Kong's youth and young adults, who increasingly believe their futures are being shortchanged by a system they fear is rigged in favor of mainland Chinese. This year marks the 20-year anniversary of the British handover and Beijing's promise of preserving the "One country, two systems" model of governance for Hong Kong, where the laws and courts drawn up during the British colonial era remain intact. This year also was supposed to be the year that Hong Kong voters could directly elect the chief executive, a promise Beijing made in 2007, and then reneged on in 2014 -- a move that triggered the Umbrella Movement protests. "The promise [of democracy] has always been there, the expectation was always there," says Jasper Tsang, founding chairman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, a political party largely seen to be pro-Beijing. Hong Kong remains an open society compared to mainland China. Freedom of speech is guaranteed, and internet regulation is much looser. As Chinese President Xi Jinping cracks down on dissent, however, many in Hong Kong worry about an erosion of civil liberties in the territory. The election for chief executive officially has three contenders, but the voting system is stacked in favor of business and government interests that are openly pro-Beijing. In a city of more than 3.7 million registered voters, ballots for the chief executive are cast by 1,194 members of an election committee, themselves chosen by roughly a quarter of a million people. Carrie Lam, the candidate Beijing is viewed to support, is expected to draw almost 600 of the committee member's votes. Wong's views about identity represent a sharp, recent change. It's only in recent years that surveys have shown a large segment of Hong Kong residents identifying as being purely from Hong Kong. It's a trend that began in late 2008, after the height of unity felt during and in the lead up to the Beijing Olympics,            according to polling by the University of Hong Kong. Rising inequality across the territory also is fueling the increasing local self-identification, says Shirley Lin, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. She traces the roots of this identity crisis to 2003, when the Hong Kong government became reliant on measures from Beijing to solve the economic crisis spurred by the deadly outbreak Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. Those measures encouraged greater integration between the territory and the mainland and included allowing more tourists and immigration from the mainland into Hong Kong. It also meant Hong Kong businesses became reliant on mainland China, shaking the foundation of one-country two-systems. "Our economy is totally hijacked by the Chinese businesses, but you have to realize that most of it is [Chinese] government-owned," says Lin, who is a former Goldman Sachs executive. "I'm not talking about private businesses that are running the stock market here. We have to curry favor in order to get more companies to list here." Hong Kong firms once dominated the real-estate market. In the past year, however, 53 percent of government land sales went to mainland Chinese firms, up from just 1 percent in 2011, according to Bloomberg. Further fueling a local protectionist attitude is China's focus on using economic incentives to reward those that behave "well" and to punish those that don't, Lin says. The practice fuels a sense of marginalization and widening divide between rich and poor in the city. Other issues confronting Hong Kong are homegrown. The territory's education system is a microcosm of the city's inequality problem. Most of the top schools are private and expensive, costing more than that of a college education. Education is increasingly out of reach for most families in a city where the median household monthly income is about $3,000. Affordable quality public schools exist, but they are diminishing, as the government pulls subsidies from semi-private schools once favored by the British government. "Most public officials' kids study abroad, so why would they care about Hong Kong?" Wong says. "It proves they have less faith or trust in the education system." Trust between Hong Kong residents and Beijing is shaky, at best. In the eyes of Hong Kong residents, the central government keeps changing the rules, such as delaying a date for direct elections. In the eyes of the leaders in Beijing, Hong Kong residents refuse to be patriots. In 2003, Beijing lost faith in the Hong Kong's leadership's ability to keep a grip on the populace. The Hong Kong government's failure to pass national security legislation due to strong public opposition, the subsequent failure to pass national education legislation in 2012 and then the pro-democracy protests in 2014 led Beijing to worry that Hong Kong was moving away from the motherland. "It's a vicious cycle," says Tsang, of the Democratic Alliance political party. The more Beijing tightens its grip on Hong Kong, the more Hong Kong people want more autonomy. Tsang says Hong Kong residents and Beijing have fundamentally different views on governance. Beijing and his party hardliners, Tsang says, want a judge who always rules in favor of the Communist Party, a media that isn't critical and opposition not supported by the people. "But take these away, and it's not Hong Kong."Christy Choi is a journalist based in Hong Kong.

A moving experience in ChinaMars' Hill: Trinity Western UniversityJanuary 25, 2017 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: SPORTS; Pg. 1Length: 553 wordsBodyBy Jarrett FontaineWhen I was in grade three I used to joke about digging all the way to China. After 13 years of digging without so much as breaking through the crust of the earth, I decided to fly there alongside all my buddies on the Spartan Men's Hockey team. The team spent two weeks touring three different cities building relationships between China and Canada. Outside of touring the Great Wall and the modern architecture of Shanghai, there were experiences that put life into perspective for me, leading me to a realization of how fortunate I am.We first had the Changde Tournament, a four-day tournament on a rink built on a pond in the Emperor's summer palace garden. We would dress up in the hotel in our hockey equipment and ride a bus. Along the walk we saw many locals participating in zumba-like dances, as well as salsa, hacky sack, and badminton.Going for the first skate on the rink gave me the chills. We were all in awe of the opportunity we were given and our warm-up for the game consisted of selfies on the ice. The surrounding garden was full of Chinese locals taking pictures and playing charades with us to ask questions because of the language barriers. The people looked at us as if we were famous; we were posing for pictures, holding babies, signing babies, and all that fun stuff.Off the ice, we were building relationships with the other teams-specifically with the Russian team. We would sit around a hotel room and pass around an iPad to translate what we wanted to say. Through this, we were able to create lifelong friendships. The Changde Tournament showed me how fortunate I am to play the sport of hockey, how grateful I am for the places it has brought me, and how cool it was to play against people from halfway around the world that share same passion.We were also fortunate enough to hear the story of Pastor Yan, who leads an underground church in China. China is a communist country and everything is run by the government-even the churches. Christianity is viewed as a threat to the Confucian values set in place by Chinese government because they both give guidance for how to live. Because of this, the church's the message is controlled and the full truth is not being portrayed. Pastor Yan is illegally running his underground church because he cares so much about the Word of God, and he is risking his well-being to present it to people. He runs eleven services a week in many different small farming communities, in homes, or wherever they can find a place of meeting. Pastor Yan told us there are 15 pastors like himself who are behind bars right now-and that really showed me the depths that he is going to in order to spread Christianity. He then took us to a government-run church that we needed to be granted access to just to enter. Here we performed a pretty choppy version of Amazing Grace for the people there. I observed two interesting things while at this church: one, it's pretty easy to lose the priest fairly early, since the service is in Mandarin; two, the songs are all international. The music was the same, but the language of the words was all that had changed. It was a cool experience, and made me appreciate the freedoms we have here in Canada.I am glad we experienced China, and glad China was able to experience the Spartans Hockey Team.Load-Date: January 25, 2017End of Document

It Can Get Worse for Qualcomm: Legal Blitz Threatens NXP Semiconductor AcquisitionThe Daily Cardinal: University of Wisconsin - MadisonFebruary 10, 2017 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 906 wordsBodyIt's been a rough start to the year for semiconductor giantQualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM). After putting what many hoped were the worst of its legal troubles behind it, Qualcomm's shares have plummeted so far this year, as several new legal entanglements place continued pressure on the company's patent licensing segment.These legal troubles could negatively affect the chipmaker in a number of ways. Particularly worrisome, though, is that at least one analyst has expressed concerns that its courtroom battles could hamper Qualcomm's pending acquisition ofNXP Semiconductor (NASDAQ: NXPI).QCOM data by YChartsHaving unfolded in several stages around the world, Qualcomm's five-year legal ordeal can be broken down into five major points. Each suit has focused on the company's Qualcomm technology licensing segment, which produces roughly two-thirds of the chipmaker's annual pre-tax profits.In 2013, the Chinese government launched an antitrust investigation into Qualcomm's patent licensing practices, which led Qualcomm to pay a $975 million fine to Chinese regulators early last year. As part of its settlement, Qualcomm agreed to lower the per-device royalty rates it charges Chinese mobile-device OEMs. Collecting royalty payments for its standard-essential 3G and 4G patents, which typically range from 3.25% to 5% of a mobile device's wholesale price before potential rebate savings, has been a headache for Qualcomm in China. Many Chinese OEMs either simply didn't pay Qualcomm or allegedly underreported their royalty payments to the company, so many had hoped that resolving its Chinese legal issues would represent the conclusion of Qualcomm's legal woes. As it turns out, those problems were just the beginning.In late 2015, the EU initiated a similar antitrust investigation into potential anti-competitive practices by Qualcomm. The European Commission, the EU's regulatory watchdog, has yet to reach a verdict against Qualcomm. Many expect the EU to render its findings, including potential fines, at some point this year. Then late last year, South Korean regulators fined Qualcomm $854 million on similar antitrust grounds. Qualcomm is currently appealing this decision.Finally, Qualcomm was hit with two more blockbuster lawsuits in late January. The first suit came from the Federal Trade Commission, claiming that Qualcomm used its competitive position to gain unfair advantages in the baseband chip market. Three days later,Apple, one of Qualcomm's largest customers, filed a $1 billion lawsuit against Qualcomm, alleging that the chipmaker engaged in a number of anticompetitive tactics. The charges make for some ugly reading.Qualcomm is fighting each of its suits and has responded with some compelling arguments. It doesn't make sense to speculate about possible verdicts at this point, though some analysts say the company's mounting legal woes could delay or even jeopardize its pending NXP Semiconductor acquisition, an outcome that would damage Qualcomm's long-term growth trajectory.Image source: QualcommFew analysts seem to believe that Qualcomm's patent licensing lawsuits alone could compel regulators to block the NXP acquisition. The important issue here is that Qualcomm's current products don't compete in the same areas of the semiconductor market as NXP. However, it appears Qualcomm's growing number of legal entanglements could slow the merger approval process, especially in markets such as the EU, where Qualcomm is currently battling antitrust charges. In fact, one sell-side analyst recently downgraded Qualcomm shares on the assumption that the NXP deal will indeed now take longer than expected to close, in which case NXP's growth will take longer to have a positive impact on Qualcomm's financial performance.Equally important, extending the time for the deal to close also increases the odds that an unforeseen event could affect the acquisition. What if Apple's suit fundamentally alters QTL's licensing practices? Could that affect Qualcomm's ability to finance the $39 billion deal? Perhaps. Could Apple's lawsuit embolden other major customers -- say, Samsung -- to file a similar complaint? If so, what would that mean? What if another country files yet another antitrust charge against it?The point is that even a delay leaves the door open for some other outside factor to come along and derail Qualcomm's critical NXP purchase. Again, such a scenario appears unlikely. However, given NXP's place as Qualcomm's entry point to the Internet of Things market, any potential overhang that could threaten the deal becomes a must-watch item for its investors.10 stocks we like better than QualcommWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Research Report on China's Graphene Industry, 2017-2021: Major Driving Forces and Market Opportunities in China Graphene Industry - Research and MarketsPR NewswireFebruary 15, 2017 Wednesday 12:10 PM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 663 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, Feb 15, 2017 BodyResearch and Marketshas announced the addition of the"Research Report on China's Graphene Industry, 2017-2021"report to their offering.In China, graphene materials are generic names of graphene with no more than 10 layers of carbon atoms and relevant derivatives. In contrast, graphene materials with more than 10 layers of carbon atoms generally belong to graphite for the loss of high graphene performance.Many countries including Europe, the U.S.A. and Japan issued a series of policies supporting the development of the graphene industry. Transnational companies pay attention to the graphene market for the promotion of R&D together with application of graphene such as Dow Chemical Company, Samsung, IBM, General Motors, Xerox, Bayer and BASF.The graphene industry started due to the cost reduction and expanded downstream application in China. In recent years, the production costs decreased to 10% in 2016 of that in 2011 with the improvement of graphene processing technics. Graphene realizes the industrialized application in multiple fields such as energy storage materials, sensors, touch devices, conductive ink pastes and composite materials and is ready for mass volume. Meanwhile, graphene is sold for profits in some products of multiple front applications to be broke through such as lithium batteries conductive paste, heat conduction film, composite materials and flexible displays.According to market research, graphene manufacturers are generally medium and small scale enterprises mainly at the downstream of the industry chain. Meanwhile, the market is at its infancy while the development is rapid. Graphene enterprises released some products in fields such as touch screens, graphene lithium ion batteries and functional coatings to promote the development of this industry.For example, mass production of graphene is achieved in energy storage material fields including conductive agents and flexible displays. Meanwhile, graphene conductive agents are mainly applied in 3C and power battery field for higher charging speed of lithium iron phosphate battery. Large-scale application of graphene films developed by 2D Carbon is achieved in flexible touch screens with the sales revenue of more than CNY 10 million in 2015.Through this report, readers can acquire the following information:- Support Polices of Chinese Government on the Graphene Industry- Major Manufacturing Methods of Graphene in China- Forecast on Supply and Demand in China Graphene Industry- Major Downstream Application of Graphene Industry- Major Manufacturers of Graphene in China, 2013-2016- Competition Status of Graphene Industry in China- Major Driving Forces and Market Opportunities in China Graphene Industry- Risks and Challenges in China Graphene Industry- Development Trend of China Graphene Industry, 2017-2021Companies Mentioned- 2D Carbon (Changzhou) Tech Co., Ltd.- Beijing Graphene Holdings Co., Ltd.- Leaguer Stock Co., Ltd.- Qingdao Haoxin New Energy Technology Co., Ltd.- Qingdao Hua Gao Ink Polytron Technologies Inc- Qitaihe Baotailong Graphene Material Co., Ltd.- Shenzhen Beiterui New Energy Resources Material Co., Ltd.- The Sixth Element (Changzhou) Materials Technology Co., Ltd.- Xiamen G-CVD Graphene Technology Co., Ltd.- Xiamen Knano Graphene Technology Corporation Limited- Zhenjiang Browah Technology Co., Ltd.For more information about this report visithttp://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/ss7w7s/research_reportMedia Contact:Laura Wood, Senior Managerpress@researchandmarkets.com For E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900U.S. Fax: 646-607-1907Fax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/research-report-on-chinas-graphene-industry-2017-2021-major-driving-forces-and-market-opportunities-in-china-graphene-industry---research-and-markets-300407861.htmlSOURCE Research and MarketsLoad-Date: February 16, 2017End of Document

Wants More Broadband CustomersThe Daily Cardinal: University of Wisconsin - MadisonMarch 24, 2017 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 718 wordsBody"asset-content" data-asset-uuid="73a73cb3-ffbe-59f4-b31b-58f04f38a0ca">China Mobile (NYSE: CHL) reported fourth-quarter results early Thursday morning. Let's take a look at what we learned.China Mobile's fourth-quarter results: The raw numbersMetricQ4 2016Q4 2015Year-Over-Year ChangeOperating revenue$24,264$23,1824.7%Net income attributable to shareholders$3,022$3,621(16.5%)Earnings per share (diluted)$0.15$0.17(15.2%)Data source: China Mobile. Using average dollar-to-yuan exchange rates of 1-for-6.83 in Q4 2016 and 1-for-6.39 in Q4 2015, using data from Oanda. Operating revenue and net income attributable to shareholders in millions.Image source: Getty Images.What happened with China Mobile this quarter?The world's largest mobile phone network (about triple the size of the two largest American carriers combined) saw profits sliding in the face of higher total sales. The value of U.S. dollars against the Chinese yuan also increased 7% year over year, limiting China Mobile's dollar-value revenue growth while magnifying the profit declines.• The company reported 849 million mobile customers at the end of December 2016, up from 844 million three months earlier and a 2.7% increase from 826 million in the year-ago period.• A total of 77.6 million wireline broadband subscribers represent a 3.4 million quarter-over-quarter increase and a 22.6 million annual boost. That's a 41% annual growth rate.• The fourth quarter of 2015 included a large one-time profit from the transfer of tower assets into a joint venture China Mobile created with two of its largest rivals.Management provided the following performance targets for fiscal year 2017:• China Mobile is aiming for revenue growth above industry average and industry-leading profitability, without committing to hard targets.• The company should add at least 100 million customers to its 4G network this year. By comparison, the number of 4G subscribers increased by 223 million in 2016, landing at 535 million.• As China Mobile also hopes to gain 20 million net new mobile subscribers overall, this works out to a 4G penetration target of roughly 73% -- up from 63% at the end of 2016 and 38% in 2015.• Finally, management plans to double the company's number of Internet of Things connections, which stood at approximately 100 million in December 2016.Image source: China Mobile.What management had to sayBesides presenting its results, China Mobile also introduced a new CFO on Thursday. Taohai Xue announced his immediate retirement after 15 years of service and was replaced by Xin Dong, who served in several positions within the Chinese government before leading various regional departments at China Mobile.Leaving no room for pause, Dong discussed financial details in Thursday's earnings call.Furthermore, CEO Yue Li outlined strong demand for broadband data services, both wired and wireless. Seventy-seven percent of China Mobile's wireline customers now subscribe to a data plan of at least 20 megabits per second. On the wireless side, data consumption more than doubled in 2016. For the first time in the company's history, wireless data revenue surpassed the combined sales of voice and text messaging services.Looking aheadSign Up!

The relevant agreement was signed on March 16, 2017. Quangoutong owns certain permits and licenses from local governments in China to conduct certain on-line financial service businesses in China. The purchase price for Quangoutong will be nominal as it has divested itself of several of its traditional businesses and all of its assets and debts. The FinTech industry is an emerging sector that utilizes computer programs and innovative technology to support the delivery of payment and financial services."The acquisition of Quangoutong is an important strategic move for the Company as it is based on the Company's development plan, which is to diversify our business to include lighter asset businesses in addition to our more capital intensive operations," said Mr. Hongke Xue, Chief Executive Officer of SkyPeople. "We believe that a healthy flow of capital is essential to all modern enterprises, and our entry into the FinTech space is intended to strengthen our own business, reinforce and develop strong partnering collaborations and capitalize upon an emerging high technology sector."The Company believes that the acquisition of Quangoutong will bring an innovative business development and sales model to SkyPeople, including a rewards points system that has cooperation agreements with other alliances. The reward points systems can be applied to SkyPeople's subsidiaries, including but not limited to Hedetang, its consumer fruit juice products business, and Hede Jiachuan, its food products concern. The Company also plans to use Quangoutong to apply online third party payment license with Chinese government to upgrade our distribution and sale system to better integrate internet and our traditional business.SkyPeople also believes that it will benefit from Quangoutong's advanced sales model such as its large-scale product customization business, which is designed to facilitate strategic cooperation among companies and platforms, and in so doing, to boost sales. Meanwhile, the Company will continue to develop its risk control and operation standardization processes in the FinTech industry and will work to improve and advance its competitive positioning in the space.About SkyPeople Fruit Juice, Inc.SkyPeople Fruit Juice, Inc., a Florida company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Pacific Industry Holding Group Co., Ltd.

FORMER WIFE OF FUGITIVE CHINESE OFFICIAL PLEADS GUILTY TO CONSPIRING TO COMMIT IMMIGRATION FRAUD RELATED TO EB-5 INVESTOR VISAUS Fed NewsJanuary 10, 2017 Tuesday 9:41 PM  ESTCopyright 2017 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 703 wordsBodySANTA ANA, Calif., Jan. 10 -- The US Department of Justice's US Attorney's office for Central District of California issued the following press release:The ex-wife of a former Chinese government official has pleaded guilty to charges that she conspired to fraudulently obtain visas to enter the United States through the immigrant investor program.Shilan Zhao, 53, of Newcastle, Washington, pleaded guilty yesterday to one count of conspiring with her ex-husband to commit immigration fraud by submitting false documents to federal authorities. As part of a plea agreement with prosecutors, Zhao agreed to cooperate with the government's investigation into this matter.Zhao and her ex-husband - Jianjun Qiao, also known as Feng Li, 53 - were charged in a federal grand jury indictment unsealed in March 2015. Qiao remains a fugitive who is being sought by federal authorities.According to the indictment, Zhao and Qiao were divorced, but, in documents filed with U.S. immigration authorities, they falsely claimed to be married. The indictment also accused them of lying about the source of Zhao's investment in the U.S., an investment which was required under the EB-5 immigrant investor program to obtain U.S. immigrant visas.Zhao pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement in which she admitted that she submitted false documents, prepared or obtained by her ex-husband, to U.S. immigration authorities under penalty of perjury to support her immigration application. Those documents included a false marriage certificate and documents that purported to show the source of the money used for her investment."We will continue to fight fraud and abuse in our immigration system," said United States Attorney Eileen M. Decker. "There is a lawful process that can be followed to obtain legal status in this nation. Those who attempt to undermine the system by fraud threaten our national security and compromise the attempts of other immigrants who follow the rules to lawfully gain entry to the United States."In her plea agreement, Zhao agrees that $25,000 used to pay her bond can be applied to any restitution or other monetary penalties ordered in this case. Additionally, she agreed to forfeit her interest in several parcels in Monterey Park; a house in Newcastle, Washington; and a condominium in Flushing, New York."Immigration benefit fraud is a serious crime," said Joseph Macias, special agent in charge for HSI Los Angeles. "Not only do schemes like this potentially rob deserving immigrants of benefits they rightfully deserve, they also create a security vulnerability that could be exploited by criminals and others who pose a danger to our community. HSI will aggressively target those who conspire to corrupt the integrity of America's legal immigration system and put our nation's security at risk in the process.""The EB-5 investor visa program requires all immigrant investors to accurately document the source of their funds in their application," stated IRS Criminal Investigation Acting Special Agent in Charge Anthony J. Orlando. "IRS Criminal Investigation will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that ill-gotten gains received in foreign countries are not fraudulently laundered through the United States financial system."Zhao pleaded guilty yesterday before United States District Judge Stephen V. Wilson, who scheduled a sentencing hearing for November 6. At sentencing, Zhao will face a statutory maximum penalty of five years in federal prison.This case is the product of a joint investigation conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and IRS - Criminal Investigation, which received assistance from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The Supreme People's Procuratorate and Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China also provided assistance.This case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Vicki Chou of the Cyber and Intellectual Property Crimes Section and Assistant United States Attorney John J.

A first in the Construction Industry: Fingerprint and Face Recognition Technology Control Access at a Construction site in Dongguan, ChinaPR NewswireMarch 6, 2017 Monday 6:36 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1048 wordsDateline: SHUNDE, China, March 6, 2017 BodyIt is certainly unusual to see an advanced fingerprint and face recognition system, something rarely seen outside of futuristic movies and the most modern of office buildings, being used at a noisy construction site, as the way of controlling access for its workers. Country Garden Holdings, a construction firm in Dongguan, a mid-sized city in China's Guangdong province, has installed such a system at its Country Garden-Chashan Mansion project. Ou Peikang, an administrator of the Chashan project working on the construction site, said, as he was placing his hands on the scanner and facing the monitor, "the workers got used to the system in a matter of days.""All the construction workers enter the site every day through the system," Mr. Ou added. "The workers tell me that working here is a completely new and different experience for them," stated Mr. Ou. "Our project uses a large number of preformed partition boards in constructing interior walls, replacing the previous bricklaying and plastering processes and delivering better and more uniform quality. On-site casting is directly controlled by cement pumps, so there is no need for workers to lug around huge bags of cement and other construction materials. There isn't too much heavy manual work. That's why we are envied by many of our peers in the construction industry."Mr. Wang, a worker with many years of experience in the field, said, "This is the cleanest and most orderly construction site I have ever seen in my career as a construction worker." The methodic approach to every aspect of the site is immediately obvious as soon as one reaches the entrance gate: the entrance area is inlaid with grooves so vehicles can be washed and cleaned by an automated car wash and the accompanying spraying and aspirating systems. A digital screen, also located in the entrance area, displays the current weather information, including PM2.5, PM10 and humidity, constantly monitoring the environment within the site.Workers on the site can access information about the construction materials by scanning the QR code with their smartphone. Portable toilets are intelligently placed on several floors of the buildings under construction, saving the workers long and wasteful trips to a facility on the ground floor. Many peers in the construction industry and property owners openly expressed surprise at and demonstrated admiration for the highly detailed and customized design of the site when they visited during the opening day.The ability to adopt such a methodical and systematic approach is mainly due to the application of a complete array of recently-developed Standard and Shareable Geospatial Foundation (SSGF) building solutions. Sun Jun, vice president of Country Garden Holdings for Dongguan and Shenzhen, is the man responsible for promoting the process. "The solutions employ some of the existing established construction technologies in China while adding in several technologies from Japan and Europe," explained Mr. Sun. "The technologies can fully eliminate the need for plastering and significantly reduce the use of lumber, sand, cement and water while maximizing efficiencies in terms of human resources, allowing for energy conservation and environmental protection."The new technologies include climbing frames, aluminum molds, cast-in-place walls, precision-made flooring, water interception systems on every floor, prefabricated panels, complete bathroom units, cement forming using high pressure spray guns, prefabricated polycarbonate components, fully interspersed construction and PVC wallpaper. The new process can significantly reduce the time needed to complete a construction project of this size by six to eight months. The process is so "clean" that it makes it appear that the buildings under construction at the site have already been completed but for the barely noticeable climbing frames on top of the buildings. A field engineering technician explained, "The self-elevating climbing frames rise based on the height of how much of the mainframe of the building has been completed and will be dismantled about half a month after the capping of the buildings, contributing in large measure to the vast reduction in the timeline for the project. The process makes the buildings look as if they are being printed by 3D printers."This is not the first time that a Chinese project has deployed the latest in housing industrialization technologies. The country started using the technology experimentally at the end of the last century. In 1998, the Residential Industrialization Promotion Center under the aegis of the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development was established. The ministry followed up with the approval and establishment 10 national housing industrialization demonstration bases, with, in 2006, Shenzhen selected as the first pilot city for the project. In 2013, use of the technology took off, with the construction of 12 million square meters of floor space applying the technologies. The Chinese government's roll out of the 13th Five-year Plan for Housing Industrialization and Modernization, a program for updating construction technology between 2016 and 2020, calls for the addition of around 20 pilot cities or districts, among which, approximately 10 will be located in the eastern part of the country, 5 in the central part and 5 in western part.With approximately 20 years of development under its belt, the technology has become increasingly mature. Nevertheless, a construction project is a complicated and complex task. Mr. Sun, the Country Garden VP, said, "The technology lowers technological requirements for workers. It takes about a week for the construction workers to pick up the necessary knowledge and skills. However, it considerably raises the bar as for what is required from designers and managers. The process is a lot more than simply retraining the construction staff. If you want to build a truly state-of-the-art building, yes, there are real challenges in doing so."To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/a-first-in-the-construction-industry-fingerprint-and-face-recognition-technology-control-access-at-a-construction-site-in-dongguan-china-300418275.htmlSOURCE Country Garden HoldingsCONTACT: Huang Dou, +86-139-2666-9275, huangdou@countrygarden.com.cnLoad-Date: March 7, 2017End of Document

Billionaire Antigua-Barbuda diplomat 'disappears' in Hong KongCaribbean News Now, Grand Cayman, Cayman IslandsFebruary 3, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 Caribbean News Now, Grand Cayman, Cayman IslandsDistributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWSLength: 567 wordsByline: Caribbean News Now, Grand Cayman, Cayman IslandsBodyFeb. 03--ST JOHN'S, Antigua -- One of Antigua and Barbuda's economic envoys and diplomatic passport holder, Xiao Jianhua, a billionaire with ties to the Chinese government, has reportedly been abducted from his Hong Kong residence by Chinese police.Xiao, 45, was allegedly taken from his residence in a Hong Kong hotel and transported into mainland China. He has been missing since Friday, and if the Chinese police are involved in his absence, it would violate Hong Kong's constitution, which only permits Hong Kong police to operate in Hong Kong, a former British colony.The Chinese-born Xiao, a Canadian citizen, is the founder and owner of Tomorrow Holdings, which controls nearly 1 trillion Yuan (US$160 billion) of assets, ranging from banks and securities houses.Tomorrow Holdings controls nine listed companies, holding shares in over 30 financial institutions, including 12 city commercial banks, six securities companies, trust firms, insurers, mutual fund companies, futures firms and asset management companies.In 2013 he invested in an equity firm owned by the sister and brother-in-law of Chinese president Xi Jinping to help them divest their financial holdings, and has since acted as a banker to the Chinese government elite, the New York Times reported on Tuesday.Since his disappearance, Xiao posted two messages on his company's website, since removed, saying he was "recuperating abroad" and was not abducted. "Abroad" is a semi-official signal meaning outside of the Chinese mainland, and the person close to Xiao said the messages were meant to diminish interest in the story, the New York Times said.Citing reports, the Guardian said Xiao is in police custody somewhere on the Chinese mainland and may be assisting the Chinese government with a graft investigation.In the wake of Xiao's disappearance, Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne said he is prepared to recall all diplomatic passports.On Wednesday, Browne told local media, "From all indication, he never utilised his appointment as an envoy to commit any crime. We are still unclear as to whether it was an abduction or arrest, and if it is the latter, what crime, if any, was committed."He nonetheless noted that "if he is eventually charged with any wrongdoing" then "potential action involves revocation of his status of economic envoy".The prime minister added that changes will be made to the system for issuing diplomatic passports and he said he is "absolutely determined" that Antigua and Barbuda should operate with complete transparency in this respect."The changes are likely to include the recall of all diplomatic passports and re-issue with biometric passports under a new policy. The new policy would also include publication of the list of diplomatic passports issued," he said.To this end a new policy on the issue of diplomatic passports has been drafted and will be brought to Cabinet for discussion on Saturday. If approved, details of the new policy will be published next week and, in due course, not only will a list of all diplomatic passport holders be given to all countries with which Antigua and Barbuda has bilateral diplomatic relations but also made available to the general public.___ (c)2017 the Caribbean News Now (Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands) Visit the Caribbean News Now (Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands) at www.caribbeannewsnow.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.Load-Date: February 3, 2017End of Document

Also, as the likes ofTencent Holdings raise their content game by investing in online video, Baidu will find it difficult to boost revenue.Data by YChartsAs a matter of fact, Baidu revenue has now started shrinking, and it needs to find its next big home run prospect to push forward. This is the reason why Baidu is aggressively looking to tap the potential of self-driving cars. But will it find success in a market that's getting increasingly crowded?Image Source: BaiduBaidu has set lofty ambitions for itself in the self-driving car space as its first autonomous car is expected to hit the market in the next couple of years. What's more, Baidu believes that it will be able to mass produce self-driving cars starting in 2020. This gives Baidu three years to ramp up its technology and production, which seems like an aggressive timeline considering that it just started testing autonomous vehicles on the road in Dec. 2015.However, the company began working on autonomous vehicle technology back in 2013, and in less than two years, it was able to complete a comprehensive road test along a 19-mile route. This made Baidu the first company in China to have "demonstrated full autonomy under mixed road conditions", in its own words. Google parentAlphabet, by comparison, had started testing its self-driving technology in 2009.Baidu has moved at such great speed in the autonomous vehicle space due to certain key partnerships and progress in the field of artificial intelligence, or AI. Baidu started making an aggressive push in AI by hiring former Alphabet executive Andrew Ng back in 2014 to head its AI lab in Silicon Valley.Then, in Oct. 2016, Baidu set up a $3 billion fund to invest in mid-to-late stage internet companies focused on AI, augmented reality, and virtual reality. Last month, Baidu hired formerMicrosoft executive and AI expert Qi Lu as its Chief Operating Officer. Baidu CEO Robin Li had the following to say about the latest hire:To achieve our goals, especially in artificial intelligence, which is a key strategic focus for the next decade, we will need to continue attracting the best global talent. With Dr. Lu on board, we are confident that our strategy will be executed smoothly and Baidu will become a world-class technology company and global leader in AI.This aggressive expansion into AI has been one of the reasons behind the rapid development of its self-driving car as well. Baidu has harnessed the power of AI and deep learning to develop its AutoBrain self-driving platform, which is at the center of its autonomous technology .The AutoBrain software can detect a vehicle's position accurately down to a few centimeters using Baidu's maps that record road data in 3D, and then uses environmental perception and decision-making to guide the self-driving car.Apart from developing its own technology, Baidu is partnering with the likes ofNVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) to accelerate its progress. In September last year, Baidu teamed up with the GPU-maker to develop a self-driving operating system. This system will provide algorithm-driven inputs based on Baidu's mapping technology to NVIDIA's supercomputer platform, which will then provide navigation data to autonomous cars.Now, Baidu and NVIDIA have both been using artificial intelligence in order to develop their self-driving technology. This is why the partnership should reap benefits in the long run as the companies gather more data by driving on public roads, which will eventually contribute toward the development of their operating system.One of the best things about Baidu's autonomous car project is that it hasn't lost sight of the business potential. While partnerships with the likes of NVIDIA will help it enhance its autonomous technology, other partners will allow Baidu to tap a huge self-driving market in China.At CES 2017, Baidu announced that it is teaming up with Chinese state-owned automotive company BAIC. The two companies will showcase a BAIC-built self-driving car that will be powered by Baidu technology at the Shanghai auto show in April. Additionally, Baidu and BAIC will start testing a self-driving car with Level 3 autonomy by the end of the year.Level 3 autonomy means that the driver will have to be present inside the vehicle, but critical safety functions can be completely shifted to the car. This means that the car will require the intervention of the driver only when necessary. From Level 4 onwards, the car does not require a driver at all, which means that Level 3 autonomy is the highest autonomous level that can be achieved without going fully driverless.Now, the Chinese government plans to make 10% to 20% of the cars on the country's roads highly autonomous by 2025, which indicates Level 3 autonomy. Additionally, China expects that 10% of its vehicles will achieve full autonomy by 2030. Forbes reports that China's auto sales are expected to hit an annual level of 40 million units in 2025, which means that at least four million cars will carry self-driving capabilities.So, Baidu's partnership with BAIC to develop a driverless vehicle for the Chinese market is a smart move from a long-term perspective. BAIC is a Chinese government-owned enterprise with annual car sales of 2.85 million units in 2016 and a market share of 10.2%. Therefore, it has the required capacity to mass produce vehicles on a large scale in China. Since Baidu is an internet company with no expertise in automotive manufacturing, it needs this kind of partner.With the help of BAIC, Baidu can stick to its aggressive timeline of mass producing self-driving cars by 2020. This puts the Chinese search giant on track to profit from the government-led goal of putting millions of cars with autonomous capabilities on the road by 2025.10 stocks we like better than BaiduWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

New Colombia Resources Inc. Announces US$ 90 Million Purchase Order for Metallurgical Coal from a Major Steel Trader for Delivery to China Steel Mills; First shipment is scheduled for April 2017 with subsequent shipments through DecemberMarketwiredJanuary 5, 2017 Thursday 5:00 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Marketwire, L.P. All Rights ReservedLength: 1172 wordsDateline: BARRANQUILLA, COLOMBIA; Jan 05, 2017Body New Colombia Resources, Inc. (OTC: NEWC) ("New Colombia or the 'Company"), a Colombian company listed in the U.S. with premium metallurgical coal properties and medical marijuana operations, is pleased to announce they have signed a US$ 90 Million purchase agreement for metallurgical coal with American Steel Industries, LLC (ASI) of Philadelphia, PA, a joint venture partner with a Chinese Government owned Multi-Billion Dollar Commodities and Steel Trading Company. ASI has been exporting steel from China for the past 12 years and is one of its largest steel exporters, for more information about ASI, visit http://www.asi-steel.com/.Deliveries loaded at the port in Colombia for shipment to South China in 2017 will be as follows: --  April- 60,000 tonnes --  May- 40,000 tonnes --  June- 40,000 tonnes --  July-December- 60,000 tonnes/month This contract will be filled by New Colombia's joint venture with MSG Mining Corp. The joint venture has sourced the coal to make timely deliveries per the agreement. Some of the coal will be supplied by the joint venture's Mina San Gregorio in Cucuta, Colombia with the remainder being sourced from third party producers. The coal will be stored at the Company's coal yard in Cucuta with a 50,000 tonne capacity and industrial scale, then trucked or barged to a port on the Caribbean coast for shipment to South China.In November 2016, New Colombia Resources entered into a joint venture agreement to operate metallurgical coal Concession Contract JC3-15231 located in the municipality of Zulia, approximately 25 km from Cucuta, Colombia. New Colombia Resources and MSG Mining Corp. are registering a Colombian subsidiary that is 51% owned by New Colombia Resources and 49% owned by MSG Mining Corp. Engineers have been onsite since early December updating the Work Plan and Environmental Management Plan for a 10,000 tonne/month operation to begin coal mining in February 2017.The coal from this area has a high 15,000 Btu/lb. calorific value that is appetizing for metals producers. The concession contract has an approved Work Plan by the National Mining Agency (ANM) and an Environmental License from the local environmental agency. For a copy of the Work Plan, Environmental License, mining title, reserve report, SGS Coal Analysis, and pictures of the stock yard, click here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxSKP5j2FlsecVJUeGhJYTFwRGc.The Work Program identifies at least two coal formations, Cuervos and Carbonera, with over 8 coal seams with estimated reserves between 1 to 13 Million tonnes each. Based on the Work Program, the Companies initially expect to begin extracting coal from Seam 1 (Manto 1) of the Cuervos Formation with an estimated 2.4 Million tonnes of reserves that are believed to be easily accessible. In February 2017, the Companies anticipate initiating a coal operation to produce 10,000 tonnes per month that can be scaled up to 30,000 tonnes/month. During extraction of the Cuervo Formation, they will explore the Carbonera formation coal seams with estimated reserves between 12-13 Million tonnes each. Total Reserves are estimated at over 40 Million tonnes.The San Gregorio Mine will be a showcase mining project in Water and Wastewater Management. New Colombia's joint venture partner MSG Mining Corp. is owned by Tito C. Castillo, title holder to the Concession Contract. Mr. Castillo, a Chemical Engineer/ MBA, has been in the Water Treatment Equipment Industry for over 25 years in the U.S. and elsewhere. He spent 6 years in the Middle East working with the latest technologies in the Reverse Osmosis Process and the past few years assisting the Government of Colombia with water issues. The Water and Wastewater Large Modular Plant System is the latest technology that will play a vital role in Colombia's mining sector since the country is desperately trying to conserve the Andes Mountain Range and their river system while mining their rich mineral reserves. This Mine project will give the industry a pilot system to show that mining does not mean the destruction of the Eco system.New Colombia Resources is also developing mining concessions in Guaduas, Cundinamarca where they control close to 4000 hectares of metallurgical coal concession contracts. Their first contract in Guaduas, ILE-09551, has an approved Work Plan for coal and is awaiting approval of the addition of building materials to begin operations. They purchased a 1000 m3/day rock crushing plant that is expected to be operating this quarter, and the Greenfields where these operations will begin within 3 miles of the biggest road project in Colombia.In addition to mining, New Colombia Resources has a medical marijuana joint venture manufacturing medical products since 2014.

Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker Issues Cabinet Exit MemoTargeted News ServiceJanuary 5, 2017 Thursday 3:44 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 7429 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Department of Commerce issued the following Cabinet Exit Memo by Secretary Penny Pritzker:IntroductionThe Department of Commerce (the Department) sits at the intersection of all business and economic issues, both domestically and abroad. A single mission unites our 12 bureaus and 46,000 employees: to help create the conditions for economic growth, job creation, and opportunity across the United States.The Department helps American companies prosper in the global economy. We issue patents and trademarks, as well as licenses to sell sensitive technologies abroad. We collect and provide data on demographics, the economy, and the weather, as well as a common language businesses can use to manage cybersecurity risk. We invest in advanced manufacturing clusters and facilitate foreign investment in the United States. We link minority-owned businesses with the capital, contracts, and markets they need to grow, and we connect communities across America through expanded broadband access.Throughout President Obama's Administration, we took strides to make our team more outcome-driven and responsive and provide important commercial perspectives in policy discussions. Critical to our success has been our work to build a stronger bridge to the business community, include the private sector in our policymaking process, and serve as a key member of the President's economic cabinet.Record of ProgressThe Department of Commerce has played an integral role in America's economic recovery. While government alone cannot create companies or jobs, it can help create the conditions for the private sector to grow and prosper. Our record of progress is focused on five areas: trade and investment, innovation, data, environment, and operational excellence.Trade & Investment: Opening Global Markets and Encouraging Investment in the United StatesOur Department has supported the President's economic growth agenda by aggressively enforcing trade laws, increasing foreign direct investment, negotiating trade deals that create a level playing field for American workers, and using the power of America's business leaders to help shape policy in markets around the world. Our team has worked to steadily open new markets to U.S. goods and services, reduce trade barriers facing U.S. firms, and help our companies navigate challenging markets abroad.Commercial DiplomacyCommercial diplomacy (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/commercial-diplomacy) is based on a simple premise: America's commercial power and influence is unmatched. In an increasingly complex world, that power must be more effectively harnessed as a force alongside our more traditional foreign policy tools. Our allies and trading partners want American investment and the promise of private sector-led growth. And they know American companies can bring capital that creates jobs and economic opportunities. This provides our business leaders with an influential voice in foreign capitals, which can be used to promote policies consistent with our common strategic goals. This in turn helps level the playing field for American companies to sell more American products abroad while creating well-paying jobs here at home. As such, when our objectives have aligned, we have worked with the private sector as our policy partner. The Commerce Department has invested heavily in building a commercial diplomacy agenda, and the next Administration should continue developing more effective and focused commercial diplomacy strategies to support the President's foreign policy priorities.Enforcing Our Trade Laws in Record NumbersThe viability of U.S. manufacturers and the livelihoods of American workers has been threatened by ill-advised policies of certain foreign governments that subsidize the costs of production and artificially decrease the price of their exports at the expense of their trading partners. This Administration has taken substantial steps to confront this problem, and the Department has played a leading role. Antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) investigations have reached historic highs. Specifically, the Department of Commerce and U.S. Customs and Border Protection are currently enforcing 350 AD/CVD orders that address dumped and/or unfairly subsidized imports. To meet this challenge of increased dumping, we expanded our capacities by adding more than three dozen positions in an effort to more quickly and effectively use our trade remedies. We also secured legislative changes that strengthen the effectiveness of the AD/CVD remedy, including provisions that improve Commerce's ability to deal with foreign producers that do not cooperate in AD/CVD proceedings and enhance the ability of Customs and Border Protection to combat evasion of anti-dumping and countervailing duties.ChinaThe scope and nature of our interactions with the Chinese government has evolved dramatically. We have worked to make the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT) (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/us-china-joint-commission-commerce-and-trade-jcct) a continuous process in tandem with the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, and have made it a more dynamic and productive dialogue. While we have continued to use the JCCT to push the Chinese to address core commercial policy challenges - including excess capacity in steel and other sectors, the persistent theft of intellectual property and trade secrets, and an increasingly hostile and protectionist approach to digital policy challenges - we also have attempted to use it and our other engagements with senior officials to focus energy on deepening our understanding of their strategic economic priorities and looking for opportunities for greater collaboration. In addition, we are working to end China's dangerous and market-distorting approach to developing an indigenous semiconductor industry and have continued to prioritize and invest heavily in trade enforcement.MexicoRecognizing that the U.S. government had underinvested in the U.S.-Mexico economic relationship, the Department prioritized building stronger bilateral commercial ties with one of our most important economic partners, and we have achieved enormous success. Working closely with Vice President Biden, the Department has led the High Level Economic Dialogue (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/us-mexico-high-level-economic-dialogue-hled) since its 2013 launch. This mechanism has enabled our governments to more effectively collaborate on commercial priorities like developing modern border infrastructure that promote growth and job creation. We have made considerable progress on border infrastructure, energy, economic and workforce development, travel and tourism, and innovation and entrepreneurship.IndiaThe Department has taken the lead on elevating our commercial ties with India through the creation of the U.S.-India Strategic and Commercial Dialogue (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/us-india-strategic-and-commercial-dialogue-scd). This mechanism will endure as a platform for commercial and strategic engagement on a wide range of issues. We have made great progress in key areas affecting our economic relationship, including ease of doing business, smart cities and infrastructure development, innovation and entrepreneurship, and standards harmonization.AfricaOne major goal of the Administration has been to transform the U.S.-Africa relationship from one based on aid to one based on trade. Consistent with these goals, the Department created and launched the President's Doing Business in Africa (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/doing-business-africa-dbia) initiative, which has allowed us to double our presence in African countries by opening new offices throughout the continent facilitating greater investment and supporting jobs here at home.In partnership with Bloomberg Philanthropies, the Department also created the U.S.-Africa Business Forums (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/us-africa-business-forum), which took place in 2014 and 2016. The Forums brought together hundreds of American and African CEOs, and nearly every African head of state to facilitate U.S. private sector engagement in Africa, which helped generate $23.1 billion in investment. The first U.S.-Africa Business Forum also led to the formation of the President's Advisory Council on Doing Business in Africa (PAC-DBIA) (           https://www.commerce.gov/tags/presidents-advisory-council-doing-business-africa-pac-dbia), which I chair.CubaThe Department has taken a lead role to fundamentally change U.S. policy toward Cuba. We launched the U.S.-Cuba Regulatory Dialogue (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/us-cuba-regulatory-dialogue) and, in coordination with the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Department has published six sets of regulatory changes aimed at empowering the Cuban people through increased economic engagement. From January 2015 through September 2016, we issued 738 licenses for proposed exports and re-exports to Cuba valued at $9.4 billion. In addition, we worked with the private sector to identify the most effective ways to increase economic engagement and ultimately benefit the Cuban people.SelectUSAIn 2011, the Department launched SelectUSA (https://www.commerce.gov/selectusa), the first federal initiative focused on creating world-class investment promotions to attract foreign direct investment to the United States. To date, this successful effort has facilitated $23 billion in foreign direct investment creating and/or retaining tens of thousands of jobs across the country. The 2016 SelectUSA Investment Summit (           https://www.commerce.gov/tags/selectusa-investment-summit) alone brought together 2,500 participants representing 70 international markets. SelectUSA has also established a presence at the U.S. embassies in each of the 30 largest markets for U.S. investment globally.Export Control ReformThe Department has led a comprehensive reform of the export control (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/export-control-reform-ecr) system. Prior to this effort, the government's controls on defense items essentially were one-size-fits-all regardless of technological sensitivity, end use, or end user. Now, tens of thousands of less-sensitive defense items are subject to more nuanced and flexible regulations. The end result has been stronger military interoperability with our allies; reduced incentives for those allies' products to avoid U.S. content; government's resources focused on transactions of greatest concern; and improved regulatory reliability and predictability.National Travel and Tourism StrategyIn partnership with the Department of the Interior, the Department of Commerce co-authored the National Travel and Tourism Strategy (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/national-travel-and-tourism-strategy), which sets an ambitious goal to welcome 100 million annual international visitors by 2021. In 2015, 76 million people visited the United States, up from 67 million before the strategy's implementation. These visitors spent a record $217 billion on goods and services, supporting 1.1 million U.S. jobs and making travel and tourism our country's number one services export.Looking AheadComplete the Trans-Pacific PartnershipThe completion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/trans-pacific-partnership-tpp) is essential to America's economic strength, to our leadership in the Asia-Pacific region, and to our national security. But trade remains a complicated and highly charged topic for many citizens. To address these challenges, our government needs to reconsider our approach to delivering the benefits of completed trade agreements to our citizens. In addition, the inability of Congress to pass the agreement has left a vacuum that China is already attempting to fill with its own multilateral agreement that will exclude the U.S. and disadvantage our businesses and workers.Growing Our Footprint at Home and AbroadThe Department's traditional trade responsibilities include helping American companies resolve specific issues abroad, working with foreign governments to address systemic trade policy challenges, enforcing trade laws, and building stronger ties to cultivate economic opportunities for companies to compete for new customers around the world. Globalization is creating a huge and growing demand by American companies for the Department's trade services and expertise. To meet this challenge and accomplish these goals, I believe there exists a need to increase the Department's Foreign Commercial Service (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/us-foreign-commercial-service) and Export Assistance Center (           https://www.commerce.gov/tags/us-export-assistance-center) footprint as well as our enforcement resources, so that we can keep pace with growing caseloads.Increase ExportsIn addition, we need to open new markets and help U.S. companies grow exports. Rebalancing our economy to sell more globally is necessary because 95 percent of the world's consumers live outside the United States. This will represent an important shift in how our economy does business. We need to open new markets and maintain a level playing field, simultaneous with expanded export counseling and trade finance capabilities. To meet this opportunity, the Department's Commercial Service should expand to ensure that all American firms in tradeable sectors fully capitalize on the opportunities created by our trade agreements.Innovation: Supporting Advanced Manufacturing, Skills Training, Entrepreneurship, and a Robust Digital EconomyBetween 1948 and 2012, over half the total increase in U.S. productivity growth, a key driver of economic growth, came from innovation and technological advancement. As "America's Innovation Agency," the Department of Commerce is responsible for fostering an environment that supports the invention and commercialization of new products and technologies. We are proud to have five Nobel Prize winning scientists on our team who embody our Department's commitment to innovation.Advanced ManufacturingManufacturing USAThe Department manages and coordinates the Manufacturing USA (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/manufacturing-usa) Network (formerly the National Network of Manufacturing Innovation), an inter-agency initiative to develop and deploy the technologies and workforce of the future in a collaborative public-private partnership. This effort will have launched a network of public-private manufacturing institutes that will enhance America's competitive advantage in advanced manufacturing by bringing cutting edge technologies from lab to market. Already, the more than $600 million in federal funding invested in the first nine institutes has been matched by more than $1.3 billion in non-federal investment. And more institutes are on the way.Investing in Manufacturing Communities PartnershipCommerce is the lead agency for the Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/investing-manufacturing-communities-partnership-imcp), an initiative that encourages local leaders from the private sector, local government, higher education, and economic development organizations to collectively identify a sector of manufacturing where their community has a comparative advantage and create a strategic plan that addresses every element of competitiveness from workforce and supply chain to infrastructure and trade. Twenty-four communities have been designated for preferred access to federal funding totaling approximately $1.3 billion, and more than 65 other communities received technical assistance and benefitted from the strategic planning undertaken as part of the application process.Skills TrainingSkills for BusinessThe Department plays a critical role in federal workforce development policymaking through our newly created Skills for Business (https://www.commerce.gov/skills-for-business) initiative. While our Department does not fund training, advancing 21st century skills is integral to strengthening American competitiveness given the importance of talent development to our economy, especially in key sectors like manufacturing, cybersecurity, and engineering. We have led the effort to assure federal workforce expenditures are job driven, sponsored research on the value of apprenticeships to employers, and strengthened regional workforce development efforts.EntrepreneurshipPromoting a Robust and Effective Intellectual Property SystemThe strength and vitality of the U.S. economy depends on effective mechanisms that protect and encourage the development of new ideas. With the passage of the America Invents Act (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/america-invents-act-aia), the Department continues to improve our service to American innovators by improving patent quality, speeding the patent process, and curbing abuse. In the last five years, we opened the first-ever permanent Patent and Trademark regional offices in Detroit, Denver, Silicon Valley, and Dallas, bringing our services closer to our customers. We also launched the Patents for Humanity (           https://www.commerce.gov/tags/patents-humanity) program to accelerate the use of patented technologies for humanitarian purposes.Regional InnovationThrough our Regional Innovation Strategies (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/regional-innovation-strategies-program-ris) program and the i6 Challenge (           https://www.commerce.gov/tags/i6-challenge), the Department awarded $59 million in capacity-building grants to help entrepreneurs in diverse regions of the country move ideas to market, supporting the creation and expansion of research-commercialization centers and early-stage seed-capital funds.Harnessing Private Sector Expertise to Support EntrepreneurshipThe Department is committed to supporting startups at every phase of their business cycle. In 2014, we created the Presidential Ambassadors for Global Entrepreneurship (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/presidential-ambassadors-global-entrepreneurship-page) Program, which I chair. Through this effort, 20 of the nation's most recognized and successful entrepreneurs commit to mentoring the next generation of innovators both domestically and abroad. The Department also created and leads the National Advisory Council for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (NACIE) (           https://www.commerce.gov/tags/national-advisory-council-innovation-and-entrepreneurship-nacie). Comprised of experts from the public and private sectors, NACIE is responsible for providing executable recommendations on how our innovation and entrepreneurship policies and programs can be most effective.Moving Technologies from Lab to MarketThe Department has played a leading role in the Lab-to-Market (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/lab-market) initiative, a whole-of-government effort to increase the economic impact of Federally-funded research and development by accelerating and improving the transfer of new technologies from the laboratory to the commercial marketplace. The Department has worked with partners across the federal government to create more open access to federal opportunities and to empower more effective collaborations by streamlining policies and tools that help connect entrepreneurs with federal agencies.Strengthening our Digital EconomyCybersecurityIn an economy increasingly vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, the Department plays a central role in the federal government's policymaking focused on securing America's data networks and systems. In 2014, the Department released the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/cybersecurity-framework-critical-infrastructure). Created through unprecedented collaboration between private industry and government, the voluntary Framework consists of standards, guidelines, and practices that promote the protection of critical infrastructure networks. The Framework has become the gold standard for cyber-risk management and has gained widespread acceptance.In addition, the Department worked closely to support the President's Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/commission-enhancing-national-cybersecurity), and will be taking steps to ensure that the Commission's recommendations are incorporated into our future actions. We also lead efforts on state-of-the-art identity protection, cybersecurity workforce training, and solving technological challenges by working cooperatively with the private sector.Protecting a Free and Open Internet: IANA Transition, U.S.-E.U. Privacy Shield, and APECAn open and free internet is the lifeblood of the global economy that powers commerce and promotes economic opportunity and human rights around the world - deeply-held American values that lead to global stability, security, and well-being. This Administration - and President Obama himself - strongly supported the Federal Communications Commission's "net neutrality" decision to adopt the strongest rules possible to ensure Internet Service Providers cannot become gatekeepers to the Internet's content or create paid fast lanes for access to the best services. And for our part, the Department has a number of accomplishments that advance this goal:* On October 1, 2016, the Department transitioned its stewardship role over the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/internet-assigned-numbers-authority-iana) functions to the non-profit, non-governmental entity, Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. The internet stakeholder community is now in charge of overseeing the global domain name system as originally intended. This makes for a stronger, more open Internet, which helps ensure no authoritarian government can ever control it.* The Department's successful completion of the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/eu-us-privacy-shield) framework provides U.S.-based companies with a reliable mechanism for data transfers between the European Union and the United States while maintaining rigorous privacy standards. This framework is essential to supporting the more than $260 billion in cross-Atlantic digital services trade occurring annually.* The United States is working to advance the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation's (APEC) (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/asia-pacific-economic-cooperation-apec) Cross Border Privacy Rules system, a voluntary but enforceable scheme of mutually recognized data privacy practices for companies doing business in participating APEC economies. By minimizing unnecessary barriers to cross-border data flows resulting from inconsistent privacy regulations in participating APEC economies, the system is intended to facilitate trade while strengthening consumer trust across the Asia Pacific.Increasing Digital Access: Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP)(https://www.commerce.gov/tags/broadband-technology-opportunities-program-btop)The Department built a $4.2 billion grant program from scratch and funded projects that increase access to broadband in unserved and underserved areas. The projects helped create jobs and narrowed the digital divide. So far, BTOP has constructed or upgraded 117,000 miles of broadband network infrastructure, connected 25,787 community anchor institutions, enrolled 671,585 new broadband service subscribers, and has disbursed $3.833 billion in grants.Digital Economy Board of AdvisorsWe created the Digital Economy Board of Advisors (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/digital-economy-board-advisors) in 2015. Composed of leading technologists, business leaders, social sector executives, and expert policy makers, the board's mission is to provide advice to increase domestic prosperity, improve education, and facilitate participation in political and cultural life through the application and expansion of digital technologies.Digital AttachesResponding to the changing nature of global trade, in March 2016, the Department launched our Digital Attaches pilot program (https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2016/03/us-secretary-commerce-penny-pritzker-launches-digital-attache-program), placing commercial service officers in six markets abroad to serve as dedicated resources for U.S. companies navigating digital economy hurdles overseas. This past October, we announced an expansion (           https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2016/10/us-department-commerce-extend-and-expand-digital-attache-program) of the program. This initiative will continue to drive policy advocacy on technology issues, ensure linkages between trade policy and trade promotion efforts, and provide front-line assistance for U.S. small and medium enterprises.Infrastructure and Economic DevelopmentFirstNetFirstNet (https://www.commerce.gov/doc/ntia/first-responder-network-authority-firstnet) was created by Congress to design, build, and operate the first-ever self-sustaining interoperable national public safety broadband network. We have worked closely with FirstNet to help them evolve into a more mature organization, and will maintain rigorous review and oversight processes to ensure FirstNet's success as it builds out its network.Strategic Investment in Economic DevelopmentTo implement the President's vision for modernizing support for communities, the Department has taken a leadership role in the integration of federal economic development assistance. This approach has increased the impact of federal support by coordinating the funding streams from multiple agencies and targeting them to communities that have adopted coherent strategies and comprehensive plans. The results can be seen in communities supported by the Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/investing-manufacturing-communities-partnership-imcp) and the Partnerships for Opportunity and Workforce and Economic Revitalization Initiative (           https://www.commerce.gov/tags/partnerships-opportunity-and-workforce-and-economic-revitalization-power-initiative).Looking AheadStrengthening the Digital EconomyThe federal government is currently not properly organized to face the challenges posed by the 21st century digital economy. Looking forward, there needs to be a government-wide focus to address five critical issues: access, trust and security online, promoting a free and open Internet globally, addressing the challenges and opportunities of emerging technologies, and preparing workers for jobs in the digital economy. As the President's statutorily designated principal adviser on telecommunications and information policy issues, the Department can and must quickly transform to be the lead agency with respect to the digital economy, just as it has led with other sectors.* Access: Too many U.S. households still do not have broadband access. Filling that need is not currently happening organically through the marketplace. We must develop policies and incentives and integrate experienced technical network talent to encourage investment in infrastructure to connect all Americans.* Trust and Security Online: The digital economy cannot flourish if consumers and businesses do not trust their privacy and security online. The Administration has made progress with our Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, the U.S.-E.U. Privacy Shield, the Cybersecurity Framework, and the APEC's Cross Border Privacy Rules. But we face a growing global cybersecurity crisis, with consumers and companies suffering at the hands of criminals and nation-states. The next Administration must work with the private sector to promote strong and innovative cybersecurity policies, pursue baseline privacy rules that protect consumers while supporting innovation, and continue the national debate regarding government access to data and the use of encryption as a security tool.* Promoting a Free and Open Internet Globally: We must continue to pursue trade agreements and other policies that protect cross-border data flows, discourage digital protectionism, and ensure open digital markets.* Addressing the Challenges and Opportunities of Emerging Technologies: For America to remain competitive, government must strive to encourage emerging technologies ranging from the Internet of Things to autonomous vehicles to biotechnology to artificial intelligence. The Department's role in this effort is to be an evangelist, a promoter, and to break down barriers to innovation. We must also help the private sector by identifying the tough policy issues raised by new technologies and address them early in the product development life cycle.* Preparing Workers for Jobs in the Digital Economy: Recognizing that 600,000 information technology jobs in America are currently unfilled, the Department must remain engaged as a voice for the business community to encourage policy that helps ensure we have a workforce ready for the challenges presented by the digital economy.Advanced ManufacturingThis Administration has built a strong foundation for continued growth in American manufacturing. To build on that, the Department and Congress should look to grow and better connect the institutes in the Manufacturing USA Network, strengthen the competitiveness of America's small- and medium-sized manufacturing companies through the enhancement of the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/manufacturing-extension-partnership-mep) Program, and invest in training workers with the skills that will be valued by employers.Further Integration of Economic DevelopmentBoth the federal government and communities have benefited from our more strategic approach to supporting economic development. The next Administration could have an even greater impact through closer coordination between our Department and the Department of Agriculture to promote rural development, the Department of Transportation to maximize the impact of transportation investments, and the Environmental Protection Agency to promote brownfields redevelopment and water infrastructure.Unleashing the Power of Government DataThe Department of Commerce, known as "America's Data Agency," is one of the largest publishers of government data, generating more than 20 terabytes daily. Our Department has made it easier for individuals and organizations to gain insights and develop innovations based on our data. We continue to work with the private sector on solutions that make data sets more accessible and usable. Our long-term vision is to enable the innovators, healthcare professionals, charities, non-profits, public servants, and others to use our open data to enable and scale solutions for the public good.Unleashing Our DataTo accelerate our efforts, the Department has:* Created the Commerce Data Service (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/commerce-data-service), an internal team of data scientists and engineers who bring the right expertise in-house;* Started a Data Academy to both teach data science and apprentice our staff on specific projects;* "Wrangled" our data, released more bulk data sets, built application programming interfaces (APIs), created tutorials, and built our own front end tools;* Built scalable internal-facing products (such as visualization and client identification tools) to solve problems and demonstrate what can be done with data in our programs;* Leveraged private-sector innovators who are willing to donate their technology for free to solve public problems;* Created the Opportunity Project (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/opportunity-project), to drive government and tech community collaboration to spur the development of digital tools that use federal open data to increase access to opportunity in communities around the country.* Established Joint Venture Program to partner with universities, nonprofits, and industry professionals and explore innovative technical solutions that help federal agencies responsibly leverage their data to make better decisions.Improving the Quality, Scope, and Timeliness of Economic StatisticsWe have prioritized the improvement of core economic indicators such as GDP (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/gross-domestic-product-gdp), and we have materially reduced the size of revisions from the initial release. We are also working with the private sector to improve the timeliness and quality of our statistics.2010 CensusThe Department of Commerce conducted a successful 2010 decennial census and determined that our nation's population stood at 308,700,000 people, a 9.7 percent increase from the 2000 Census population of 281,400,000.Looking AheadTo achieve the most out of our assets, Commerce must do more than simply make its data available. Below are a number of concrete steps I recommend:2020 CensusBuilding off the lessons learned from 2010, the 2020 Census (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/2020-census) is designed to be more automated, modern, and dynamic. By using new technologies, innovative techniques, and new data sources, there is the potential to save up to $5.2 billion while maintaining the highest standards of accuracy. To achieve this overall cost savings, adequate testing and implementation funds are needed in the coming fiscal years.A Deeper Talent BenchThe next Administration must be bold and creative in finding new ways to hire and pay high-skilled employees. We currently struggle to fill these jobs - and the talent we have too often leaves for the private sector where higher pay awaits them. This is just as true for cybersecurity as it is for data. Whether it be creating a "Cyber Corps" or providing student loan forgiveness, we as a government will find ourselves at a disadvantage if we do not do more to entice and retain technical experts and give them a role at policymaking and program-implementation tables.Privacy and EqualityPolicymakers and regulators must encourage the social and economic benefits from the use of big data analytics, but must also be vigilant about issues like privacy protection, the possibility of re-identification of individuals, and the unintended consequences of algorithmic decision-making. In addition, we must make sure that all parts of our society benefit from more open data. There will need to be significant future investment in infrastructure and services to enable innovation around our data.A Better, Faster Procurement ProcessWe need to push for better, faster ways for the federal government to acquire technologies like modernizing data storage and authorizing use of open source tools. Doing so will enable innovation and make it easier for smaller companies to work with the federal government.New Investments and AuthoritiesSpecific authorizations and appropriations for data science, infrastructure, and software development will be critical. Also, congressional action that would permit the sharing of information among the federal government's statistical agencies could materially advance our work and reduce costs.Environment: Advancing Environmental Intelligence and Ensuring Productive Fisheries and EcosystemsThe Department of Commerce is committed to advancing the scientific research and environmental intelligence necessary to help communities and businesses prepare for a changing climate. Moreover, because U.S. industry is uniquely positioned to devise technological solutions and provide leadership in sustainability practices to confront the challenge of climate change, we are helping facilitate the success of U.S. firms operating in the clean energy sector both domestically and abroad.Advancing Environmental IntelligenceIn 2014, the Department launched the U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/climate-resilience-toolkit), which combines government-wide resources into one easy-to-access location to better support Americans in their efforts to understand and address the climate related risks facing their communities. These resources also inform state, local, and business decision-making to strengthen resilience. In addition, we are providing unique market intelligence to help industry strategically deploy resources in renewable energy, smart grid, and traditional environmental technologies. We are also informing mitigation planning, and making businesses and communities more hazard-resilient through efforts such as our Disaster Resilience Framework.Improving Weather Predictions and Supporting Key Decision MakersThe Department is strengthening the National Weather Service (https://www.commerce.gov/national-weather-service) to be more responsive to stakeholder needs and more effective in supporting emergency managers, first responders, government officials, businesses, and the public. Through development of new weather models coupled with high-performance computing upgrades, we have improved weather forecasts, increasing the lead time for warnings of severe weather events and saving lives.Deploying the Nation's Next Generation Weather SatellitesDuring this Administration, we have developed and deployed the nation's next generation of geostationary and polar orbiting weather satellites, which serve as the backbone of weather forecasts. We just launched the most advanced weather satellite ever built. Called GOES-R (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/goes-r), it will revolutionize forecasting and save lives by collecting three times more data and providing four times better resolution, enabling more effective and targeted warnings of severe weather events. Given the current age and capabilities of our polar orbiting satellites, we must prioritize and execute the planned 2017 launch of JPSS-1 to ensure there will be no gaps in satellite coverage.Opening the National Water CenterIn May 2015 the Department opened the National Water Center (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/national-water-center) at the University of Alabama, the first facility in the nation dedicated to water forecast operations and research. As the country becomes more vulnerable to events like drought and flooding, the National Water Center will serve as a hub of integrated water prediction and forecasting for the federal government.Rebuilding Fisheries and Combating Seafood FraudThe United States has become the global leader in sustainable seafood. During this Administration, we have largely ended the practice of overfishing and successfully rebuilt a record number of fishery stocks that have been depleted. Due to our effective management, overfishing has hit an all-time low and 40 stocks have been returned to productive levels. The U.S. fishing industry contributed nearly $200 billion to the American economy in 2014 and supports 1.83 million jobs. Nevertheless, improper fishing continues to undermine the economic and environmental sustainability of global fisheries. The Department co-chaired the President's Task Force on Illegal Unreported and Unregulated Fishing to level the economic playing field by combatting international pirate fishing and seafood fraud.Building a 21st Century FleetOver the last eight years, we have added three modern vessels to our world-class oceanographic research fleet to support the nation's economic and environmental needs. These vessels provide a wide range of services to the nation, from supporting the science that underpins economic fishery management decisions to charting coastal ports and seaways essential to the maritime industry. However, without new and sustained investment in the future, the aging fleet will be reduced to half its size in just over a decade.Restoring Gulf Coast EcosystemsFollowing the Deep Water Horizon oil spill (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/deepwater-horizon) and the subsequent the implementation of the RESTORE Act (           https://www.commerce.gov/tags/restore-act) in 2012, the Department has stood up the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council (           https://www.commerce.gov/tags/gulf-coast-ecosystem-restoration-council) whose mission is to rebuild and revitalize the ecosystems and economy of the Gulf Coast. The Council set the rules and regulations necessary to disburse the BP and TransOcean settlement dollars and is now working to fund critical restoration projects.Looking AheadThe Department of Commerce should continue to play a convening role to spur U.S. innovators to seize the business opportunity presented by the rapid global energy transformation currently underway. We must continue to build a clean energy economy that both benefits the environment and creates American jobs. To help communities and businesses prepare for a changing climate, while also facilitating the success of American companies that are developing and deploying climate solutions, the Department should look to:Expand Access to Our Climate DataWe should utilize the full array of federal data and services to improve the assessment and quantification of the risks associated with climate change. Businesses and communities alike continue to clamor for better and more actionable information to inform their decisions. Expanding upon these efforts should be a priority.Incentivize States and Businesses to Adopt Clean Energy SolutionsPolicymakers can accelerate job growth by providing financial incentives for states to exceed clean energy goals, and by facilitating the creation of new projects, infrastructure, and industries to match regional energy needs and existing industrial ecosystems. Federal and private industry research investments must be aligned, establishing additional joint public-private research collaborations to bring clean energy innovations to scale.Operational ExcellenceWe have made operational excellence a foundation of our management approach, examples of which are woven throughout this memo. We have prioritized: improving customer service, increasing employee morale, and running the department strategically and professionally.I am proud that our Department has won plaudits for improved customer service from a variety of third parties. Specifically, the Department has been one of the Top Five in the Partnership for Public Service's "Best Places to Work" ranking throughout my tenure. Also, in early 2016, our Business USA (https://www.commerce.gov/tags/businessusa) Team was given the President's Customer Service Award for the ongoing service provided to America's military veterans under their Veteran Entrepreneur Initiative.Looking AheadEnterprise Services InitiativeThe federal systems for hiring and procurement remain a challenge to carrying out the daily work of our employees and launching any new initiatives. Our enterprise services initiative to transform mission enabling services - HR, information technology, financial management, and acquisition - offers the promise of substantial improvement over our current systems so that we can hire and buy more effectively and efficiently in order to fulfill our mission. We have already made enormous progress: we have awarded a contract for human resources services, bringing in a group of experts to tackle our hiring backlog; and we have implemented strategic sourcing to better leverage our buying power across the Department, all while saving millions of dollars.ConclusionI am proud of the team at the Department of Commerce and all of our accomplishments that have advanced the President's priorities. The Department's success stems from the tone and objectives President Obama set to generate broad-based prosperity in America. As part of his commitment to economic growth, he recognized that the Administration needed a stronger relationship with the business community and that our private sector leaders needed to be involved in the policymaking process. Our team has taken that vision seriously and has worked to implement those economic priorities over the last eight years.I have come to believe that American businesses and the American taxpayer would be much better served by a streamlined "Department of Business," similar to the President's 2012 government reorganization proposal. A reorganized Department with a unified strategic plan for trade negotiations and enforcement, economic development, export financing, production of economic statistics and data, technology, and other business-focused services would provide stronger customer service to American businesses competing in a global economy.Serving as the 38th Secretary of Commerce has truly been one of the great honors of my life. I want to thank President Obama for the opportunity he has given me, the trust he has put in our leadership, and the faith he has put in the 46,000 professionals at the Department to execute his vision.It has been my privilege to serve.Copyright Targeted News ServicesEditorVail-5738467 EditorVailLoad-Date: January 6, 2017End of Document

CABINET EXIT MEMO BY SECRETARY PENNY PRITZKERStates News ServiceJanuary 5, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 6855 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Department of Commerce:IntroductionThe Department of Commerce (the Department) sits at the intersection of all business and economic issues, both domestically and abroad. A single mission unites our 12 bureaus and 46,000 employees: to help create the conditions for economic growth, job creation, and opportunity across the United States.The Department helps American companies prosper in the global economy. We issue patents and trademarks, as well as licenses to sell sensitive technologies abroad. We collect and provide data on demographics, the economy, and the weather, as well as a common language businesses can use to manage cybersecurity risk. We invest in advanced manufacturing clusters and facilitate foreign investment in the United States. We link minority-owned businesses with the capital, contracts, and markets they need to grow, and we connect communities across America through expanded broadband access.Throughout President Obama's Administration, we took strides to make our team more outcome-driven and responsive and provide important commercial perspectives in policy discussions. Critical to our success has been our work to build a stronger bridge to the business community, include the private sector in our policymaking process, and serve as a key member of the President's economic cabinet.Record of ProgressThe Department of Commerce has played an integral role in America's economic recovery. While government alone cannot create companies or jobs, it can help create the conditions for the private sector to grow and prosper. Our record of progress is focused on five areas: trade and investment, innovation, data, environment, and operational excellence.Trade and Investment: Opening Global Markets and Encouraging Investment in the United StatesOur Department has supported the President's economic growth agenda by aggressively enforcing trade laws, increasing foreign direct investment, negotiating trade deals that create a level playing field for American workers, and using the power of America's business leaders to help shape policy in markets around the world. Our team has worked to steadily open new markets to U.S. goods and services, reduce trade barriers facing U.S. firms, and help our companies navigate challenging markets abroad.Commercial DiplomacyCommercial diplomacy is based on a simple premise: America's commercial power and influence is unmatched. In an increasingly complex world, that power must be more effectively harnessed as a force alongside our more traditional foreign policy tools. Our allies and trading partners want American investment and the promise of private sector-led growth. And they know American companies can bring capital that creates jobs and economic opportunities. This provides our business leaders with an influential voice in foreign capitals, which can be used to promote policies consistent with our common strategic goals. This in turn helps level the playing field for American companies to sell more American products abroad while creating well-paying jobs here at home. As such, when our objectives have aligned, we have worked with the private sector as our policy partner. The Commerce Department has invested heavily in building a commercial diplomacy agenda, and the next Administration should continue developing more effective and focused commercial diplomacy strategies to support the President's foreign policy priorities.Enforcing Our Trade Laws in Record NumbersThe viability of U.S. manufacturers and the livelihoods of American workers has been threatened by ill-advised policies of certain foreign governments that subsidize the costs of production and artificially decrease the price of their exports at the expense of their trading partners. This Administration has taken substantial steps to confront this problem, and the Department has played a leading role. Antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) investigations have reached historic highs. Specifically, the Department of Commerce and U.S. Customs and Border Protection are currently enforcing 350 AD/CVD orders that address dumped and/or unfairly subsidized imports. To meet this challenge of increased dumping, we expanded our capacities by adding more than three dozen positions in an effort to more quickly and effectively use our trade remedies. We also secured legislative changes that strengthen the effectiveness of the AD/CVD remedy, including provisions that improve Commerce's ability to deal with foreign producers that do not cooperate in AD/CVD proceedings and enhance the ability of Customs and Border Protection to combat evasion of anti-dumping and countervailing duties.ChinaThe scope and nature of our interactions with the Chinese government has evolved dramatically. We have worked to make the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT) a continuous process in tandem with the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, and have made it a more dynamic and productive dialogue. While we have continued to use the JCCT to push the Chinese to address core commercial policy challenges including excess capacity in steel and other sectors, the persistent theft of intellectual property and trade secrets, and an increasingly hostile and protectionist approach to digital policy challenges we also have attempted to use it and our other engagements with senior officials to focus energy on deepening our understanding of their strategic economic priorities and looking for opportunities for greater collaboration. In addition, we are working to end China's dangerous and market-distorting approach to developing an indigenous semiconductor industry and have continued to prioritize and invest heavily in trade enforcement.MexicoRecognizing that the U.S. government had underinvested in the U.S.-Mexico economic relationship, the Department prioritized building stronger bilateral commercial ties with one of our most important economic partners, and we have achieved enormous success. Working closely with Vice President Biden, the Department has led the High Level Economic Dialogue since its 2013 launch. This mechanism has enabled our governments to more effectively collaborate on commercial priorities like developing modern border infrastructure that promote growth and job creation. We have made considerable progress on border infrastructure, energy, economic and workforce development, travel and tourism, and innovation and entrepreneurship.IndiaThe Department has taken the lead on elevating our commercial ties with India through the creation of the U.S.-India Strategic and Commercial Dialogue. This mechanism will endure as a platform for commercial and strategic engagement on a wide range of issues. We have made great progress in key areas affecting our economic relationship, including ease of doing business, smart cities and infrastructure development, innovation and entrepreneurship, and standards harmonization.AfricaOne major goal of the Administration has been to transform the U.S.-Africa relationship from one based on aid to one based on trade. Consistent with these goals, the Department created and launched the President's Doing Business in Africa initiative, which has allowed us to double our presence in African countries by opening new offices throughout the continent facilitating greater investment and supporting jobs here at home.In partnership with Bloomberg Philanthropies, the Department also created the U.S.-Africa Business Forums, which took place in 2014 and 2016. The Forums brought together hundreds of American and African CEOs, and nearly every African head of state to facilitate U.S. private sector engagement in Africa, which helped generate $23.1 billion in investment. The first U.S.-Africa Business Forum also led to the formation of the President's Advisory Council on Doing Business in Africa (PAC-DBIA), which I chair.CubaThe Department has taken a lead role to fundamentally change U.S. policy toward Cuba. We launched the U.S.-Cuba Regulatory Dialogue and, in coordination with the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Department has published six sets of regulatory changes aimed at empowering the Cuban people through increased economic engagement. From January 2015 through September 2016, we issued 738 licenses for proposed exports and re-exports to Cuba valued at $9.4 billion. In addition, we worked with the private sector to identify the most effective ways to increase economic engagement and ultimately benefit the Cuban people.SelectUSAIn 2011, the Department launched SelectUSA, the first federal initiative focused on creating world-class investment promotions to attract foreign direct investment to the United States. To date, this successful effort has facilitated $23 billion in foreign direct investment creating and/or retaining tens of thousands of jobs across the country. The 2016 SelectUSA Investment Summit alone brought together 2,500 participants representing 70 international markets. SelectUSA has also established a presence at the U.S. embassies in each of the 30 largest markets for U.S. investment globally.Export Control ReformThe Department has led a comprehensive reform of the export control system. Prior to this effort, the government's controls on defense items essentially were one-size-fits-all regardless of technological sensitivity, end use, or end user. Now, tens of thousands of less-sensitive defense items are subject to more nuanced and flexible regulations. The end result has been stronger military interoperability with our allies; reduced incentives for those allies' products to avoid U.S. content; government's resources focused on transactions of greatest concern; and improved regulatory reliability and predictability.National Travel and Tourism StrategyIn partnership with the Department of the Interior, the Department of Commerce co-authored the National Travel and Tourism Strategy, which sets an ambitious goal to welcome 100 million annual international visitors by 2021. In 2015, 76 million people visited the United States, up from 67 million before the strategy's implementation. These visitors spent a record $217 billion on goods and services, supporting 1.1 million U.S. jobs and making travel and tourism our country's number one services export.Looking AheadComplete the Trans-Pacific PartnershipThe completion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership is essential to America's economic strength, to our leadership in the Asia-Pacific region, and to our national security. But trade remains a complicated and highly charged topic for many citizens. To address these challenges, our government needs to reconsider our approach to delivering the benefits of completed trade agreements to our citizens. In addition, the inability of Congress to pass the agreement has left a vacuum that China is already attempting to fill with its own multilateral agreement that will exclude the U.S. and disadvantage our businesses and workers.Growing Our Footprint at Home and AbroadThe Department's traditional trade responsibilities include helping American companies resolve specific issues abroad, working with foreign governments to address systemic trade policy challenges, enforcing trade laws, and building stronger ties to cultivate economic opportunities for companies to compete for new customers around the world. Globalization is creating a huge and growing demand by American companies for the Department's trade services and expertise. To meet this challenge and accomplish these goals, I believe there exists a need to increase the Department's Foreign Commercial Service and Export Assistance Center footprint as well as our enforcement resources, so that we can keep pace with growing caseloads.Increase ExportsIn addition, we need to open new markets and help U.S. companies grow exports. Rebalancing our economy to sell more globally is necessary because 95 percent of the world's consumers live outside the United States. This will represent an important shift in how our economy does business. We need to open new markets and maintain a level playing field, simultaneous with expanded export counseling and trade finance capabilities. To meet this opportunity, the Department's Commercial Service should expand to ensure that all American firms in tradeable sectors fully capitalize on the opportunities created by our trade agreements.Innovation: Supporting Advanced Manufacturing, Skills Training, Entrepreneurship, and a Robust Digital EconomyBetween 1948 and 2012, over half the total increase in U.S. productivity growth, a key driver of economic growth, came from innovation and technological advancement. As "America's Innovation Agency," the Department of Commerce is responsible for fostering an environment that supports the invention and commercialization of new products and technologies. We are proud to have five Nobel Prize winning scientists on our team who embody our Department's commitment to innovation.Advanced ManufacturingManufacturing USAThe Department manages and coordinates the Manufacturing USA Network (formerly the National Network of Manufacturing Innovation), an inter-agency initiative to develop and deploy the technologies and workforce of the future in a collaborative public-private partnership. This effort will have launched a network of public-private manufacturing institutes that will enhance America's competitive advantage in advanced manufacturing by bringing cutting edge technologies from lab to market. Already, the more than $600 million in federal funding invested in the first nine institutes has been matched by more than $1.3 billion in non-federal investment. And more institutes are on the way.Investing in Manufacturing Communities PartnershipCommerce is the lead agency for the Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership, an initiative that encourages local leaders from the private sector, local government, higher education, and economic development organizations to collectively identify a sector of manufacturing where their community has a comparative advantage and create a strategic plan that addresses every element of competitiveness from workforce and supply chain to infrastructure and trade. Twenty-four communities have been designated for preferred access to federal funding totaling approximately $1.3 billion, and more than 65 other communities received technical assistance and benefitted from the strategic planning undertaken as part of the application process.Skills TrainingSkills for BusinessThe Department plays a critical role in federal workforce development policymaking through our newly created Skills for Business initiative. While our Department does not fund training, advancing 21st century skills is integral to strengthening American competitiveness given the importance of talent development to our economy, especially in key sectors like manufacturing, cybersecurity, and engineering. We have led the effort to assure federal workforce expenditures are job driven, sponsored research on the value of apprenticeships to employers, and strengthened regional workforce development efforts.EntrepreneurshipPromoting a Robust and Effective Intellectual Property SystemThe strength and vitality of the U.S. economy depends on effective mechanisms that protect and encourage the development of new ideas. With the passage of the America Invents Act, the Department continues to improve our service to American innovators by improving patent quality, speeding the patent process, and curbing abuse. In the last five years, we opened the first-ever permanent Patent and Trademark regional offices in Detroit, Denver, Silicon Valley, and Dallas, bringing our services closer to our customers. We also launched the Patents for Humanity program to accelerate the use of patented technologies for humanitarian purposes.Regional InnovationThrough our Regional Innovation Strategies program and the i6 Challenge, the Department awarded $59 million in capacity-building grants to help entrepreneurs in diverse regions of the country move ideas to market, supporting the creation and expansion of research-commercialization centers and early-stage seed-capital funds.Harnessing Private Sector Expertise to Support EntrepreneurshipThe Department is committed to supporting startups at every phase of their business cycle. In 2014, we created the Presidential Ambassadors for Global Entrepreneurship Program, which I chair. Through this effort, 20 of the nation's most recognized and successful entrepreneurs commit to mentoring the next generation of innovators both domestically and abroad. The Department also created and leads the National Advisory Council for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (NACIE). Comprised of experts from the public and private sectors, NACIE is responsible for providing executable recommendations on how our innovation and entrepreneurship policies and programs can be most effective.Moving Technologies from Lab to MarketThe Department has played a leading role in the Lab-to-Market initiative, a whole-of-government effort to increase the economic impact of Federally-funded research and development by accelerating and improving the transfer of new technologies from the laboratory to the commercial marketplace. The Department has worked with partners across the federal government to create more open access to federal opportunities and to empower more effective collaborations by streamlining policies and tools that help connect entrepreneurs with federal agencies.Strengthening our Digital EconomyCybersecurityIn an economy increasingly vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, the Department plays a central role in the federal government's policymaking focused on securing America's data networks and systems. In 2014, the Department released the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity. Created through unprecedented collaboration between private industry and government, the voluntary Framework consists of standards, guidelines, and practices that promote the protection of critical infrastructure networks. The Framework has become the gold standard for cyber-risk management and has gained widespread acceptance.In addition, the Department worked closely to support the President's Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity, and will be taking steps to ensure that the Commission's recommendations are incorporated into our future actions. We also lead efforts on state-of-the-art identity protection, cybersecurity workforce training, and solving technological challenges by working cooperatively with the private sector.Protecting a Free and Open Internet: IANA Transition, U.S.-E.U. Privacy Shield, and APECAn open and free internet is the lifeblood of the global economy that powers commerce and promotes economic opportunity and human rights around the world deeply-held American values that lead to global stability, security, and well-being. This Administration and President Obama himself strongly supported the Federal Communications Commission's "net neutrality" decision to adopt the strongest rules possible to ensure Internet Service Providers cannot become gatekeepers to the Internet's content or create paid fast lanes for access to the best services. And for our part, the Department has a number of accomplishments that advance this goal:On October 1, 2016, the Department transitioned its stewardship role over the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions to the non-profit, non-governmental entity, Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. The internet stakeholder community is now in charge of overseeing the global domain name system as originally intended. This makes for a stronger, more open Internet, which helps ensure no authoritarian government can ever control it.The Department's successful completion of the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield framework provides U.S.-based companies with a reliable mechanism for data transfers between the European Union and the United States while maintaining rigorous privacy standards. This framework is essential to supporting the more than $260 billion in cross-Atlantic digital services trade occurring annually.The United States is working to advance the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation's (APEC) Cross Border Privacy Rules system, a voluntary but enforceable scheme of mutually recognized data privacy practices for companies doing business in participating APEC economies. By minimizing unnecessary barriers to cross-border data flows resulting from inconsistent privacy regulations in participating APEC economies, the system is intended to facilitate trade while strengthening consumer trust across the Asia Pacific.Increasing Digital Access: Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP)The Department built a $4.2 billion grant program from scratch and funded projects that increase access to broadband in unserved and underserved areas. The projects helped create jobs and narrowed the digital divide. So far, BTOP has constructed or upgraded 117,000 miles of broadband network infrastructure, connected 25,787 community anchor institutions, enrolled 671,585 new broadband service subscribers, and has disbursed $3.833 billion in grants.Digital Economy Board of AdvisorsWe created the Digital Economy Board of Advisors in 2015. Composed of leading technologists, business leaders, social sector executives, and expert policy makers, the board's mission is to provide advice to increase domestic prosperity, improve education, and facilitate participation in political and cultural life through the application and expansion of digital technologies.Digital AttachesResponding to the changing nature of global trade, in March 2016, the Department launched our Digital Attaches pilot program, placing commercial service officers in six markets abroad to serve as dedicated resources for U.S. companies navigating digital economy hurdles overseas. This past October, we announced an expansion of the program. This initiative will continue to drive policy advocacy on technology issues, ensure linkages between trade policy and trade promotion efforts, and provide front-line assistance for U.S. small and medium enterprises.Infrastructure and Economic DevelopmentFirstNetFirstNet was created by Congress to design, build, and operate the first-ever self-sustaining interoperable national public safety broadband network. We have worked closely with FirstNet to help them evolve into a more mature organization, and will maintain rigorous review and oversight processes to ensure FirstNet's success as it builds out its network.Strategic Investment in Economic DevelopmentTo implement the President's vision for modernizing support for communities, the Department has taken a leadership role in the integration of federal economic development assistance. This approach has increased the impact of federal support by coordinating the funding streams from multiple agencies and targeting them to communities that have adopted coherent strategies and comprehensive plans. The results can be seen in communities supported by the Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership and the Partnerships for Opportunity and Workforce and Economic Revitalization Initiative.Looking AheadStrengthening the Digital EconomyThe federal government is currently not properly organized to face the challenges posed by the 21st century digital economy. Looking forward, there needs to be a government-wide focus to address five critical issues: access, trust and security online, promoting a free and open Internet globally, addressing the challenges and opportunities of emerging technologies, and preparing workers for jobs in the digital economy. As the President's statutorily designated principal adviser on telecommunications and information policy issues, the Department can and must quickly transform to be the lead agency with respect to the digital economy, just as it has led with other sectors.Access: Too many U.S. households still do not have broadband access. Filling that need is not currently happening organically through the marketplace. We must develop policies and incentives and integrate experienced technical network talent to encourage investment in infrastructure to connect all Americans.Trust and Security Online: The digital economy cannot flourish if consumers and businesses do not trust their privacy and security online. The Administration has made progress with our Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, the U.S.-E.U. Privacy Shield, the Cybersecurity Framework, and the APEC's Cross Border Privacy Rules. But we face a growing global cybersecurity crisis, with consumers and companies suffering at the hands of criminals and nation-states. The next Administration must work with the private sector to promote strong and innovative cybersecurity policies, pursue baseline privacy rules that protect consumers while supporting innovation, and continue the national debate regarding government access to data and the use of encryption as a security tool.Promoting a Free and Open Internet Globally: We must continue to pursue trade agreements and other policies that protect cross-border data flows, discourage digital protectionism, and ensure open digital markets.Addressing the Challenges and Opportunities of Emerging Technologies: For America to remain competitive, government must strive to encourage emerging technologies ranging from the Internet of Things to autonomous vehicles to biotechnology to artificial intelligence. The Department's role in this effort is to be an evangelist, a promoter, and to break down barriers to innovation. We must also help the private sector by identifying the tough policy issues raised by new technologies and address them early in the product development life cycle.Preparing Workers for Jobs in the Digital Economy: Recognizing that 600,000 information technology jobs in America are currently unfilled, the Department must remain engaged as a voice for the business community to encourage policy that helps ensure we have a workforce ready for the challenges presented by the digital economy.Advanced ManufacturingThis Administration has built a strong foundation for continued growth in American manufacturing. To build on that, the Department and Congress should look to grow and better connect the institutes in the Manufacturing USA Network, strengthen the competitiveness of America's small- and medium-sized manufacturing companies through the enhancement of the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program, and invest in training workers with the skills that will be valued by employers.Further Integration of Economic DevelopmentBoth the federal government and communities have benefited from our more strategic approach to supporting economic development. The next Administration could have an even greater impact through closer coordination between our Department and the Department of Agriculture to promote rural development, the Department of Transportation to maximize the impact of transportation investments, and the Environmental Protection Agency to promote brownfields redevelopment and water infrastructure.Unleashing the Power of Government DataThe Department of Commerce, known as "America's Data Agency," is one of the largest publishers of government data, generating more than 20 terabytes daily. Our Department has made it easier for individuals and organizations to gain insights and develop innovations based on our data. We continue to work with the private sector on solutions that make data sets more accessible and usable. Our long-term vision is to enable the innovators, healthcare professionals, charities, non-profits, public servants, and others to use our open data to enable and scale solutions for the public good.Unleashing Our DataTo accelerate our efforts, the Department has:Created the Commerce Data Service, an internal team of data scientists and engineers who bring the right expertise in-house;Started a Data Academy to both teach data science and apprentice our staff on specific projects;"Wrangled" our data, released more bulk data sets, built application programming interfaces (APIs), created tutorials, and built our own front end tools;Built scalable internal-facing products (such as visualization and client identification tools) to solve problems and demonstrate what can be done with data in our programs;Leveraged private-sector innovators who are willing to donate their technology for free to solve public problems;Created the Opportunity Project, to drive government and tech community collaboration to spur the development of digital tools that use federal open data to increase access to opportunity in communities around the country.Established Joint Venture Program to partner with universities, nonprofits, and industry professionals and explore innovative technical solutions that help federal agencies responsibly leverage their data to make better decisions.Improving the Quality, Scope, and Timeliness of Economic StatisticsWe have prioritized the improvement of core economic indicators such as GDP, and we have materially reduced the size of revisions from the initial release. We are also working with the private sector to improve the timeliness and quality of our statistics.2010 CensusThe Department of Commerce conducted a successful 2010 decennial census and determined that our nation's population stood at 308,700,000 people, a 9.7 percent increase from the 2000 Census population of 281,400,000.Looking AheadTo achieve the most out of our assets, Commerce must do more than simply make its data available. Below are a number of concrete steps I recommend:2020 CensusBuilding off the lessons learned from 2010, the 2020 Census is designed to be more automated, modern, and dynamic. By using new technologies, innovative techniques, and new data sources, there is the potential to save up to $5.2 billion while maintaining the highest standards of accuracy. To achieve this overall cost savings, adequate testing and implementation funds are needed in the coming fiscal years.A Deeper Talent BenchThe next Administration must be bold and creative in finding new ways to hire and pay high-skilled employees. We currently struggle to fill these jobs and the talent we have too often leaves for the private sector where higher pay awaits them. This is just as true for cybersecurity as it is for data. Whether it be creating a "Cyber Corps" or providing student loan forgiveness, we as a government will find ourselves at a disadvantage if we do not do more to entice and retain technical experts and give them a role at policymaking and program-implementation tables.Privacy and EqualityPolicymakers and regulators must encourage the social and economic benefits from the use of big data analytics, but must also be vigilant about issues like privacy protection, the possibility of re-identification of individuals, and the unintended consequences of algorithmic decision-making. In addition, we must make sure that all parts of our society benefit from more open data. There will need to be significant future investment in infrastructure and services to enable innovation around our data.A Better, Faster Procurement ProcessWe need to push for better, faster ways for the federal government to acquire technologies like modernizing data storage and authorizing use of open source tools. Doing so will enable innovation and make it easier for smaller companies to work with the federal government.New Investments and AuthoritiesSpecific authorizations and appropriations for data science, infrastructure, and software development will be critical. Also, congressional action that would permit the sharing of information among the federal government's statistical agencies could materially advance our work and reduce costs.Environment: Advancing Environmental Intelligence and Ensuring Productive Fisheries and EcosystemsThe Department of Commerce is committed to advancing the scientific research and environmental intelligence necessary to help communities and businesses prepare for a changing climate. Moreover, because U.S. industry is uniquely positioned to devise technological solutions and provide leadership in sustainability practices to confront the challenge of climate change, we are helping facilitate the success of U.S. firms operating in the clean energy sector both domestically and abroad.Advancing Environmental IntelligenceIn 2014, the Department launched the U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit, which combines government-wide resources into one easy-to-access location to better support Americans in their efforts to understand and address the climate related risks facing their communities. These resources also inform state, local, and business decision-making to strengthen resilience. In addition, we are providing unique market intelligence to help industry strategically deploy resources in renewable energy, smart grid, and traditional environmental technologies. We are also informing mitigation planning, and making businesses and communities more hazard-resilient through efforts such as our Disaster Resilience Framework.Improving Weather Predictions and Supporting Key Decision MakersThe Department is strengthening the National Weather Service to be more responsive to stakeholder needs and more effective in supporting emergency managers, first responders, government officials, businesses, and the public. Through development of new weather models coupled with high-performance computing upgrades, we have improved weather forecasts, increasing the lead time for warnings of severe weather events and saving lives.Deploying the Nation's Next Generation Weather SatellitesDuring this Administration, we have developed and deployed the nation's next generation of geostationary and polar orbiting weather satellites, which serve as the backbone of weather forecasts. We just launched the most advanced weather satellite ever built. Called GOES-R, it will revolutionize forecasting and save lives by collecting three times more data and providing four times better resolution, enabling more effective and targeted warnings of severe weather events. Given the current age and capabilities of our polar orbiting satellites, we must prioritize and execute the planned 2017 launch of JPSS-1 to ensure there will be no gaps in satellite coverage.Opening the National Water CenterIn May 2015 the Department opened the National Water Center at the University of Alabama, the first facility in the nation dedicated to water forecast operations and research. As the country becomes more vulnerable to events like drought and flooding, the National Water Center will serve as a hub of integrated water prediction and forecasting for the federal government.Rebuilding Fisheries and Combating Seafood FraudThe United States has become the global leader in sustainable seafood. During this Administration, we have largely ended the practice of overfishing and successfully rebuilt a record number of fishery stocks that have been depleted. Due to our effective management, overfishing has hit an all-time low and 40 stocks have been returned to productive levels. The U.S. fishing industry contributed nearly $200 billion to the American economy in 2014 and supports 1.83 million jobs. Nevertheless, improper fishing continues to undermine the economic and environmental sustainability of global fisheries. The Department co-chaired the President's Task Force on Illegal Unreported and Unregulated Fishing to level the economic playing field by combatting international pirate fishing and seafood fraud.Building a 21st Century FleetOver the last eight years, we have added three modern vessels to our world-class oceanographic research fleet to support the nation's economic and environmental needs. These vessels provide a wide range of services to the nation, from supporting the science that underpins economic fishery management decisions to charting coastal ports and seaways essential to the maritime industry. However, without new and sustained investment in the future, the aging fleet will be reduced to half its size in just over a decade.Restoring Gulf Coast EcosystemsFollowing the Deep Water Horizon oil spill and the subsequent the implementation of the RESTORE Act in 2012, the Department has stood up the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council whose mission is to rebuild and revitalize the ecosystems and economy of the Gulf Coast. The Council set the rules and regulations necessary to disburse the BP and TransOcean settlement dollars and is now working to fund critical restoration projects.Looking AheadThe Department of Commerce should continue to play a convening role to spur U.S. innovators to seize the business opportunity presented by the rapid global energy transformation currently underway. We must continue to build a clean energy economy that both benefits the environment and creates American jobs. To help communities and businesses prepare for a changing climate, while also facilitating the success of American companies that are developing and deploying climate solutions, the Department should look to:Expand Access to Our Climate DataWe should utilize the full array of federal data and services to improve the assessment and quantification of the risks associated with climate change. Businesses and communities alike continue to clamor for better and more actionable information to inform their decisions. Expanding upon these efforts should be a priority.Incentivize States and Businesses to Adopt Clean Energy SolutionsPolicymakers can accelerate job growth by providing financial incentives for states to exceed clean energy goals, and by facilitating the creation of new projects, infrastructure, and industries to match regional energy needs and existing industrial ecosystems. Federal and private industry research investments must be aligned, establishing additional joint public-private research collaborations to bring clean energy innovations to scale.Operational ExcellenceWe have made operational excellence a foundation of our management approach, examples of which are woven throughout this memo. We have prioritized: improving customer service, increasing employee morale, and running the department strategically and professionally.I am proud that our Department has won plaudits for improved customer service from a variety of third parties. Specifically, the Department has been one of the Top Five in the Partnership for Public Service's "Best Places to Work" ranking throughout my tenure. Also, in early 2016, our Business USA Team was given the President's Customer Service Award for the ongoing service provided to America's military veterans under their Veteran Entrepreneur Initiative.Looking AheadEnterprise Services InitiativeThe federal systems for hiring and procurement remain a challenge to carrying out the daily work of our employees and launching any new initiatives. Our enterprise services initiative to transform mission enabling services HR, information technology, financial management, and acquisition offers the promise of substantial improvement over our current systems so that we can hire and buy more effectively and efficiently in order to fulfill our mission. We have already made enormous progress: we have awarded a contract for human resources services, bringing in a group of experts to tackle our hiring backlog; and we have implemented strategic sourcing to better leverage our buying power across the Department, all while saving millions of dollars.ConclusionI am proud of the team at the Department of Commerce and all of our accomplishments that have advanced the President's priorities. The Department's success stems from the tone and objectives President Obama set to generate broad-based prosperity in America. As part of his commitment to economic growth, he recognized that the Administration needed a stronger relationship with the business community and that our private sector leaders needed to be involved in the policymaking process. Our team has taken that vision seriously and has worked to implement those economic priorities over the last eight years.I have come to believe that American businesses and the American taxpayer would be much better served by a streamlined "Department of Business," similar to the President's 2012 government reorganization proposal. A reorganized Department with a unified strategic plan for trade negotiations and enforcement, economic development, export financing, production of economic statistics and data, technology, and other business-focused services would provide stronger customer service to American businesses competing in a global economy.Serving as the 38th Secretary of Commerce has truly been one of the great honors of my life. I want to thank President Obama for the opportunity he has given me, the trust he has put in our leadership, and the faith he has put in the 46,000 professionals at the Department to execute his vision.It has been my privilege to serve.Load-Date: January 5, 2017End of Document

Even Tokyo, too, will play into it toward the end of the show, because today we're talking about hospitality, gaming, and a few developments with a notable former start-up, upstart and then also a kind of outlook for gaming and how some of the new resorts in Macau have been performing and what you've seen firsthand from your trip.For our first topic we'd like to revisit Airbnb a little bit. I actually was surprised to find that we haven't really covered the company, substantially at least since 2015. Of course, they have not gone through their IPO yet, but some of the rumors are building up that 2017 is going to be the year after 2016 amounted to a rather slow year for Silicon Valley IPOs. Airbnb though, just in case for anyone who hasn't used the service, quick overview what it is, what they do.McNew: Yes, sure. Airbnb at its core, it's booking rooms but through private listers. As opposed to a hotel that either licenses or owns properties and you're booking straight through them. Airbnb is just the social platform that allows people with open rooms to list those rooms and then renters can go on the app and book a room.Shen: The way I've heard you describe which I really like is, you're essentially crowdsourcing various places to stay in these various cities all over the world, and their reach is incredible now, I think they're in like a 190 countries. Airbnb started in 2008. They have millions and millions of guests across many, many, many listings. I think the theme that we're seeing that will take the focus today for the company is that for a long time now in the overall vacation travel booking industry, companies likePriceline,Expediahave seen the value in bundling essentially. By offering you or giving you the option to book through them, not only your airfare, but we where you're going to stay, maybe your car rental, by bundling that and giving you a discount, it's still more lucrative for the company. It seems like with some recent news in November and December that Airbnb is very much embracing this model with the launch of what they're calling Trips, right?McNew: Right. It's pretty amazing to remember that Airbnb is less than a decade old. It started in 2008 and here we saw it was disrupting the hotel industry and maybe now online travel agencies, maybe something else but the launch of Trips really shows how they're able to use their platform to really diversify.Shen: In case you haven't seen the release for Trips, the way they describe it, kind of break it down into three components which is their Experiences, their Places, and their Homes. The Experiences aspect of it is very interesting. I believe they started testing for this as early as June of last year, but I think the more official release went out in November. As of early December, the most recent number I could find, Airbnb is offering 500 experiences available in about 12 cities around the world, and I am pretty sure that is expanding quickly to at least another 30 or 40 cities if it hasn't already. Just an example, and I think it's really interesting what these experiences might be, one example is you get to surf and explore the outdoors with a local in Los Angeles. The price is for three days of this immersed experience is $349 per person.Another example, in Tokyo, where you just came from, you learn the art of the samurai. This is another that they kind of highlight on the Airbnb site. Two days for $437, and you can even book with hosts who have partnered with nonprofit organizations, and the company cites that 100% of the guest payment goes to the organization itself which I thought was interesting.Reading through the frequently asked questions for people who would like to host an experience, they've obviously implemented some pretty strict standards making the experience unique, value-added, having that local touch and flavor that you might not be able to get as a tourist traveling there just for a week or two. These experiences can break down into two categories from what I find. Something that's just a couple hours and then something that's more of a multi-day immersion.I was surprised they actually mentioned these numbers. The average price for bookings for the shorter experiences is just a $100, whereas the average for the multi-day immersions is about $270. The way the company makes money here is they collect a 20% booking service fee on the experiences from the hosts, not the guests, which is interesting because for their more traditional business model, they have that 3% listing fee I believe it is, and they charge usually 6% to 12% of the cost of the stay to the guests.That's the Experiences part of it . . .McNew: This is just by chance, I did one of these in Tokyo. I did an experience so I took a . . .Shen: Oh, perfect! Here we go.McNew: I took a bike ride around Tokyo. It happened to be an American who's been living in Tokyo. It was about three hours long. He took us on a bike all around these alley ways in Tokyo and we got to see the city. It was only about $22. It was great, we got to message with him on the app right before hand, all the payments were taken through Airbnb.Shen: Did he just stay with you for like an afternoon about?McNew: Yeah. I think it started in the mid-afternoon. We took a bike ride around sunset, and then we all had dinner together. It was definitely a full experience and well worth the $22 for sure.Shen: Awesome! That sounds really cool. This, again, is part of Airbnb's efforts to start branching out beyond just the where you put your head each night, and to bring in not just the experiences like what you just described. The second part of this Trips platform which is what they describe as their Places. This has several options itself. The first one I could that find was with these guidebooks. I'm not sure if you saw any of these during your travels, but they call them Insider Guidebooks. Basically, the press release describes them as "hidden gems identified by cultural experts and neighborhood insiders." There's a hundred of these guidebooks available at launch in six cities. They're also pushing meetups, I think encouraging local businesses to organize meetups among locals and also travelers in the same city. They have these audio walks where they partner with Detour. At launch, it's only available in Los Angeles, but that's expected to expand to San Francisco, Paris, London, Tokyo, and Seoul this spring. It's basically supposed to be unique, very much value-added audio walks.Those are the two components, and of course the third component of the trips is what they describe as Homes which is their traditional business. I found the exact numbers here. They have three million homes now available in 50,000 cities spread across 191 countries. Quite the footprint. Overall, what do you think about . . . I think the question that a lot of people have on their mind around Airbnb with this news and in general, the company having at this point a $30 billion valuation, when is the IPO going to happen? I know a lot of this is going to be coming from rumors and the momentum of other deals, but what do you think?McNew: Yeah, exactly! It's really all speculation at this point. The company hasn't announced any specific plans other than saying that they are working to shore up their financial position so that they're ready for an IPO, but pretty much the CEO says it's not in their near-term plans. Now what near-term means, none of us know. Does that mean late 2017, we're not really sure. I think the really interesting part is that the valuation is there. Their most recent round, which was in part by an arm ofAlphabet, listing them as valuing at $30 billion, second largest right behindMarriott.Shen: The company at this point has raised specifically over $3 billion in it's eight, nine years of existence. With that $30 billion valuation, for the numbers that I could find, it's really hard obviously because they haven't filed an S-1 or anything like that, but the 2015 revenue number that I could find was $900 million. Estimates of 2016 revenue at $1.7 billion which is 90% year-over-year top line growth, pretty incredible. Definitely seems like they're managing to maintain that momentum behind new listings being added, guests buying into the service, but the core issue for a lot of these unicorns still is on the bottom line. Not surprisingly, the company is still operating at a loss. The most recent number I could find was for 2015. The operating loss was estimated as $150 million. You're absolutely right, company management could be biding their time trying to figure out -- the process might take six months, but you want to know what the market is like for IPOs. One bad deal from a big tech start-up could spell bad news for a lot of deals that are expected to come after that.Beyond Airbnb though, or beyond the IPO, I think another issue is of the legal challenges and regulations you mentioned to me before the show that when you just search news for Airbnb, the majority of the content is around some legal challenge or hearing in some city abroad or even within the States like New York City. What are they facing right now? What's the big challenge?McNew: I think you're right, and it's coming from cities internationally as well. Europe, they're having huge issues with that, some of the government regulations there. I think the big challenge is, how are you going to maintain that top line growth if your biggest markets, New York, San Francisco, if the governments there are working to limit how much people can make using Airbnb, how long they can list properties for -- those kinds of things.I think they're doing the right things to try to combat this. They're diversifying a little bit. They're working with regulators to make sure that they can get the right tax information. They recently, last year had hired former US Attorney General Eric Holder to be on their board to help them navigate some of these things. I think they're doing the right things. It's certainly a risk, but we'll just have to see how that shapes out.Shen: For anyone who's traveled with Airbnb and you love the service, some of the, I guess the qualms that local governments have had is the issue of the short-term rentals potentially limiting housing availability in already very high demand metropolitan cities. Also, driving up pricing for a lot of housing. I think the company has made efforts as a result of all these lawsuits and hearings to try and crack down a little bit on what essentially amount to professional Airbnb landlords.People who have multiple listings. Instead of being somewhere they live, and that they rent out on occasion, I think the limit in certain places for example is 90 days a year. No more than 90 days in the U.K., but some of these properties are available 40 weeks a year. Obviously, that is their business to rent it out on a regular basis, that's having issues on housing market in general in these cities. That seems to be the issue people are trying to figure out. Take all that into account, I think the question becomes also -- $30 billion company now, you mentioned second one behind Marriott -- what has the rise of Airbnb done to the more traditional hospitality industry? How are some of these players facing it? Do you think it is all that different for example, from Marriott's business model which is very franchise and management based?McNew: Yes, I think when we look at those three million listings, that's obviously a lot more. Marriott has 1.1 million rooms around the world.Shen: In its whole network.McNew: In its whole network of rooms, but from what I've read, management of these companies doesn't seem too concerned right now. They're biggest business is U.S. business or business around the world. It's kind of business travel and Airbnb really is looking for that more leisure travel. You're not really going to have business conferences in people's private homes. Until Airbnb can kind of figure out that part of it, I think these hotels are pretty well insulated, but of course it's still eating into some of their business and when you're in a very low growth sector that hotels are in right now, that's going to be an issue.Looking back in 2016, the market hasn't been too concerned clearly. Marriott,Hilton, andHyatt's stock prices all risen over 20% each throughout 2016, so they've done OK, even with this threat.Shen: Okay. Overall, I definitely will be curious to follow the news, see when this company starts maybe management commentary, narrows down the timing a little bit. I think a company that everyone is watching to drive or to set the pace or set the tone for IPOs this year will be Snap. That seems to be the one that's expected near term. Other big deals like Uber and Airbnb will follow. We'll have to watch, see how the market reception is to these earlier deals.Moving on now to your travels a little bit, let's first go to Macau. I've had you on here before as like my insider having lived there for a little bit, and experience again now at the newest resorts that have opened fromWynn (NASDAQ: WYNN) and other major casino operators in that region. What did you see?McNew: Macau has grown so much since I lived there. It was great to be back. The city looks completely different. There are tons of new resorts open, but what struck me is, it didn't seem to have that many people. Having come from Vegas, the resorts look amazing and the whole area, and Macau has really grown up. It's just not like packed streets like you'd see in Vegas. That was a bit of a concern, but the resorts themselves . . . I went to each of the new resorts. I'd say the two that really struck out were the new Wynn Palace which is just opulent and incredible. There's a gondola that takes you from the front side of the lake all the way up to your room. Inside it's just like you'd expect from Wynn. It's beautiful in its design. Great shopping, great casinos. There's not really a lot of entertainment aspects of it outside of the shopping and casinos, but that's kind of Wynn style.Moving on toLas Vegas Sands (NYSE: LVS) though, this was my favorite, it's the Parisian. It's kind of this French inspired resort. A 50%-scale Eiffel Tower right outside. You walk in, there are mime shows, there are clowns walking around. The place is the most interesting casino I've been in in any country yet.Shen: Did you notice at all, I think, a big trend that people have talked about in Macau was the decline of what was previously the segment that really drove business there which was the VIPs. Did you feel like as these resorts, the industry overall tries to target what they call the mass market gamblers a little bit more. Did you see that actually when you were at the resorts in terms of the tables, the clientele there? Did you feel like you saw a lot more high roller VIPs which you might expect at Wynn, known for its opulence versus some of the other resorts or anything like that?McNew: Yeah. I think that gets back to kind of how the companies even before Macau taking it's dive pitched to their audience. Wynn is much more upscale kind of VIP experience, as it is in Las Vegas. Las Vegas Sands has always been kind of more of that mass market, but even more so now you really see that divide where when you go to the Parisian, that's the Las Vegas Sands, when you really see that it's entertainment first and gambling second, where the Wynn still feels the other way. It still feels gambling first, entertainment second.Shen: Okay. For the market overall, do you feel like it's finally at that point where people are seeing that recovery after a year, year and half, two years at most of ongoing declines. Month over month seeing their overall gaming revenue in that region fall by pretty significant amounts. How are the numbers now for that region looking?McNew: It was actually a little longer. I think it was 26 months of year-over-year declines since 2014. Actually, January was the fifth month in a row of year-over-year increases, at 8%, nothing to shake a leg at. It's definitely starting to grow again. Full-year for 2016 was still down 3% over 2015, but analysts are expecting that 2017 will return to growth for the first time in a while. I think that's looking pretty good.For how much gambling revenue Macau still has, which is about three times as much as Las Vegas, it still just has a lot fewer visitors than Las Vegas has. I think ramping up the number of visitors with things like governments having better policies toward visitation, more entertainment focused things to the mass market. I think we're really going to see a change there in the next couple of years.Shen: Just to add some context if you haven't been following the situation, I feel like overall, tourist traffic levels to that region took a dive overall once the Chinese government kind of cracked down on some of the VIP gaming. This was around more issues with like money laundering and essentially the ultra-wealthy in China taking their money out of the country and using Macau to kind of cycle it through. The President and the rest of the Government had a real crack down policy on that which really shifted things from Macau resorts catering to VIPs, to trying to reach a wider audience.McNew: Yeah, and it actually wasn't just the VIPs, it was even just travel restrictions for all people from mainland China going into Macau for amount of time they could spend, how often they could return to Macau. Those regulations kind of eased up a little bit in 2016 which helped those numbers to grow a little bit, but as we saw in December, there was news that the Chinese government was going to restrict ATM withdrawals, which again sent each of these stocks down. We can see that it's still volatile there. I'm trying to understand what the government policies will be, but as of right now, it still looks pretty positive.Shen: The last topic I wanted to touch on, and this is a huge opportunity, big news for the gaming industry was in December. The Japanese Parliament finally passed the law legalizing casinos. Still a lot of work to be done on the regulation side of determining taxes, social programs things like that, but overall, it appears that government leaders will be welcoming some of the major casino operators like the ones we've talked about: Wynn, Las Vegas Sands,MGM. The thing is, seems like they're targeting not smaller operations, but these large integrated resorts, kind of looking to Singapore, for example, as a model.According to one piece of research I found, it's from Daiwa Research, they estimate that just three casinos in Japan could generate as much as $10 billion in annual net profits in this market. What do you think? What is some of the timing? How are companies viewing this? Because this seems like a huge, huge opportunity.McNew: Yeah, and we've been covering this for a while about every Congress session there. They've really tried to pass this, and it finally got through. People are really excited about this. It still has to go through some regulatory looks before they're going to figure out licensing, but for the companies that win a license to be there, I really think this is the next frontier for growth for this industry.Shen: Interestingly enough, I think the casino operators and a lot of other tourists are very excited, but some surveys that I found, actually locally among the Japanese population show quite a bit of actual hesitation about this move. They were like 12% really supported the idea, but the numbers behind this opportunity are undeniable.McNew: I think some of that hesitation is just people are afraid of having a casino here. That's why the integrated resort model that worked in Singapore could really work so well. The Singapore government had invited these casinos knowing that it's going to be a small casino, but lots of other entertainment options with full resorts of restaurants and theaters and those kinds of things.Shen: Obviously, the political opposition was worried about issues like gambling addiction, money laundering, influence of organized crime, but those are things that they will be working through as a framework gets built out over the next few years. Keep in mind that from what I could find, no one actually expects these new resorts that will be opening in the country to start operations until at least 2022 or 2023, so quite a ways out. Like you said, the licenses haven't even been figured out yet. How many? Who's it going to go to? I'm not sure how much detail you have around this, but I have to imagine that the various major casino operators are already positioning themselves as much as they can to meet partnerships, to get their foot in the door as soon as the flood gates essentially open.McNew: I'm sure these licenses will be kind of parsed out with local investors as well, so they'll be some partnerships. I think when you're trying to figure out which companies are going to win licenses, you can just look at what's happened in Singapore. Las Vegas Sands was one of the ones that won there, and its resort there is beautiful. That's kind of become the model of how these integrated resorts can really drive business for a country.Shen: Yup. The last thing I will touch on is the fact that Japan itself is no stranger to gambling. There's actually a pretty substantial market there already in two forms that I could find. Currently, horse, boat, and bicycle races already take legal bets, so that's already a pretty well-established industry for gaming in the country. From what I could find, the horse races alone managed to bring in about $25 billion in wagers in 2015, so quite significant.You combine that with the existing, and this is a really interesting world. For any Fools listening, do a little bit more research. Just search pachinko parlors or the history of them. It's very interesting. These Pachinko parlors essentially, like adult arcades I guess operate in a bit of a legal gray area, very ambiguous. You collect tokens, you can exchange it for a physical prize to avoid regulations, but then you can take that physical prize to another location and exchange that for cash. It's just gray area, the best way to describe it but, in terms of the size of that market, pachinko players spent almost $200 billion in 2015 which is actually down from I think its height in the 90's. Clearly i think with such a large economy and generally very wealthy citizens, I can totally understand why the casino operators are extremely excited about the market that Japan presents.McNew: Absolutely.Shen: Otherwise, I'm going to leave it off there. Any other takeaways that you think for Airbnb or gaming industry, Macau? Anything and then we'll just wrap up.McNew: No, I'll just say for Airbnb, for anybody who's interested in this space, I would really try to use the platform just to see how well it really does work.Shen: Okay. Now that you mention that, there's two other things I forgot to touch on during our previous discussion. This again goes back to the way that they have been trying to bundle as many services as possible. This is something that actually just came through this morning in terms of news, and that is a potential deal that Airbnb might be closing soon with a social payment start-up called Tilt. Basically, would effectively give Airbnb experience with payments, and the key thing is Tilt is focused on social events which allow its users to do things like split bills, plan trips, pay as a group.They also have their Trip Itinerary which brings a guests trip timeline all together into something simple and easy to use. I think with each of these moves, integrating everything more and more into the overall Airbnb service really does indicate to me that timing 2017 could very much be the year.Thanks a lot, Seth!

NATIONS: China to self-report emissions under Paris AgreementClimateWireJanuary 11, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLCSection: INTERNATIONAL; Vol. 10; No. 9Length: 187 wordsBodyChina may be eyeing a global leadership position on climate action, but experts think the country's lack of transparency could be a problem. Transparent and accurate emissions data form the basis of the Paris Agreement, since it would be impossible to track individual countries' progress without it. But the Chinese government has declined to allow international parties to track its emissions. Instead, it intends to provide the figures on its own. Some analysts have raised concerns about the accuracy of China's self-generated data, especially in terms of coal consumption ? a critical component of climate models, since it's one of the largest contributors of greenhouse gas emissions. A 2015 report suggests China's coal consumption has been 12 to 14 percent higher than reported for the last 11 years. "Over time, it would be desirable if the reporting systems are improved. The fact that the census leads to 10 percent revisions in such an important commodity is a little worrying," said Glen Peters, with the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research-Oslo (Edward Wong, New York Times, Jan. 10). ?

Baidu and Tencent Just Invested in this Electric Vehicle MakerThe Daily Cardinal: University of Wisconsin - MadisonMarch 23, 2017 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 938 wordsBody"asset-content" data-asset-uuid="a331a2e8-7378-53dd-9b62-ca8b2c3a249c">Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU) andTencent (NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) are generally considered fierce rivals in the Chinese internet market. Both companies are expanding their online-to-offline (O2O) ecosystems by bundling multiple services within their mobile apps, and both companies frequently invest in rival companies.However, Baidu and Tencent recently came together to lead a 600 million yuan ($87 million) funding round in Shanghai-based electric vehicle makerNIO, formerly known as NextEV. That round -- which attracted other major investors like DG Capital, TPG, Hillhouse Capital, andLenovo -- valued the start-up at 20 billion yuan ($2.9 billion). NIO has raised nearly $1 billion within the past two years.NIO's EP9, the fastest EV supercar in the world. Image source: NIO.NIO was founded in 2014 by Li Bin, the former chairman of Chinese automotive marketing siteBitauto.com. Last November, NIO unveiled the EP9, which set a world record as the fastest electric vehicle in the world at the Nürburgring Nordschleife racetrack in Germany. The company also recently announced that it would launch its NIO EVE autonomous EVs in the U.S. market in 2020.Why this investment matters to BaiduBaidu is commonly called the "Google of China", but its core search business has been slowing down due to competitive pressure from social networking rivals like Tencent's WeChat andWeibo, e-commerce rivals likeAlibaba's Taobao and Tmall, and a government crackdown on misleading ads -- particularly regarding healthcare products.Baidu is trying to offset that slowdown by expanding into adjacent markets like cloud services, artificial intelligence, and driverless cars. Those three businesses can be integrated with Baidu's market-leading search and maps -- which could eventually let users hail a ride from the Baidu app, pay with Baidu Wallet, and be ferried to their destination by an autonomous EV.That's why Baidu recently made some big moves into the automotive market. It started testing out driverless cars on public roads in late 2015, formed a driverless tech research center in Silicon Valley last April, and unveiled the fully autonomous, Chinese-made Chery eQ EV last August. Baidu has declared that its first commercial vehicle, an autonomous shuttle bus, will arrive next year.Baidu and Chery's fleet of autonomous EVs. Image source: Chery.Baidu powers these vehicles with a combination ofNVIDIA's automotive chips, HERE Maps, and its own AI algorithms. Baidu also holds a minor stake in Didi Chuxing, the Chinese ride hailing leader which acquired Uber's Chinese business last year. In early March, Baidu established an Intelligent Driving group led by the company's president and chief operating officer, Lu Qi. All these efforts could make Baidu's dream of merging its ecosystem with autonomous EVs come true.Why this investment matters to TencentTencent owns the biggest social networks in China -- its QQ chat app has 877 million monthly active users (MAUs), and its WeChat mobile messaging app has 846 million MAUs. Over the past few years, Tencent expanded WeChat from a basic messaging app into a platform which lets users hail cabs, make payments, order products, play games, and perform other tasks without ever leaving the app.This strategy, which lets Tencent build an app ecosystem within iOS and Android without actually owning a mobile OS, forced Baidu and other rivals to add similar services to their apps. Like Baidu, Tencent wants its users to seamlessly hail autonomous EVs from WeChat and make payments with its WePay mobile wallet.WeChat's mobile app. Image source: iTunes.Last year, Tencent,Foxconn, and Chinese automakerHarmony Auto co-founded EV makerHexiefuteng. Hexiefuteng will produce low to mid-range EVs, and its subsidiary Future Mobility will launch pricier EVs for the luxury market. Last July, Future Mobility declared that it could launch a fully autonomous EV by 2020.Last December, Tencent, Singapore's GIC sovereign wealth fund, and Chinese mapping companyNavinfo jointly acquired a 10% stake in HERE Maps. That move will bolster Tencent's biggest weakness against Baidu -- its lack of a widely used mapping service. Only about eight million people use Tencent's own mapping service, compared to 341 million mobile MAUs who use Baidu Maps.Keep up with money news, sent to your inboxSign Up!

For now, the battles between Baidu and Tencent will be waged with the expansion of their O2O ecosystems, investments in companies like NIO, and the founding of new companies like Hexiefuteng.10 stocks we like better than BaiduWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

DIGITAL ASIA HUB EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ON PRIVACY IN ASIAStates News ServiceFebruary 8, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 690 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: DHARAMSALA, India BodyThe following information was released by the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD):On Thursday, February 2nd the Executive Director of the Digital Asia Hub think tank, Malavika Jayaram, delivered a talk entitled "Privacy in Asia" at the Wikimedia Foundation in San Francisco. Jayaram explained emerging attitudes towards privacy and privacy-infringing technological developments primarily in India and China, covering topics such as India's nationwide biometric identification system and China's new social credit system. Currently in a pilot testing phase, the social credit system is a big data initiative in which Chinese citizens' web browsing, online shopping, social media, gaming, educational, and other personal data are used as inputs in deriving credit scores. Not only are these meant to someday replace traditional credit scores, but they are also used to confer benefits such as waived deposits for apartment and car rentals.Jayaram cited a Chinese government planning document that characterized the social credit system as being able to "allow the trustworthy to roam everywhere under heaven while making it hard for the discredited to take a single step. She raised questions about the "unidirectional idea of trust" inherent in such a project, in which citizens place an enormous amount of trust in tech companies and the government to appropriately use and secure their personal data. Moreover, she pointed out that the nontransparent, closed nature of the social credit system could lead to weighting of internally-generated government and commercial data which citizens would be unable to view or contest. Arguing that "if it's free, you are the product," Jayaram pointed out that it is often the poorest and most vulnerable members of society who bear the highest costs and risks of big data collection initiatives. Contrary to the notion that digital record-keeping measures encourage inclusion, Jayaram finds that the logic behind social credit and similar systems is "if you can't be counted, you don't count."Jayaram noted that in several conversations with Chinese citizens, her questions about why people are acceptant of censorship have been met with an unexpected response: a seemingly positive outcome of Google, Facebook, and other major U.S. tech companies' services being blocked in China has been that domestic companies were pressured to innovate in order to meet local demand for search engines and social media outlets. By this line of reasoning, Chinese tech companies ultimately produced what are seen in China as superior products compared with those of their foreign competitors, even if they come at the expense of users' privacy protections. This point of viewalong with opinions Jayaram has heard in India and other parts of Asia that privacy is a luxury, a Western value, or part of a trade-off for access to technologyreflects the kind of mentality that she hopes to challenge in an effort to "make privacy cool again."One of Jayaram's and Digital Asia Hub's goals is to reframe discussions around privacy in newly capitalizing Asian states. Suggested approaches included presenting privacy as a collective rather than an individual value, in accordance with new research on group privacy. Other solutions may involve establishing due process for big data and revising technological default options. An additional consideration that is specific to China involves the notion of "saving face" as a catalyst for securing digital privacy, which the University of California, Hastings School of Law researcher Jill Bronfman has written about in the paper "Saving Face: Unfolding the Screen of Chinese Privacy Law. Jayaram likewise referenced Graham Greenleaf's schematization of how privacy laws vary across Asia in his book Asian Data Privacy Laws: Trade and Human Rights Perspectives. Though she questioned whether Asian societies are becoming complacent in accepting the loss of privacy as part of adopting new information technologies, Jayaram expressed optimism that there will be many opportunities for changing ideas about digital privacy practices across Asia in the future.Load-Date: February 10, 2017End of Document

SolarWorld USA Applauds New Agenda for Tougher Enforcement of U.S. Laws Against Unfair TradeBusiness WireMarch 2, 2017 Thursday 7:35 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business Editors; Government Writers; Manufacturing WritersLength: 830 wordsDateline: HILLSBORO, Ore. BodySolarWorld , the largest U.S. crystalline-silicon solar panel manufacturer for more than 40 years, today praised the outlines of a tough stance on unfair trade that are contained in a new "President's National Trade Policy Agenda for 2017," released Wednesday. The            document calls for strict enforcement of U.S. trade laws to prevent subsidized imports from distorting markets and harming domestic industries and workers.SolarWorld says the statement is particularly welcome for the U.S. solar-manufacturing sector, which is among those industries that for years has been under attack from injurious dumping, especially by Chinese state-financed companies. Dozens of U.S. companies went bankrupt after China started massively exporting dumped solar products during that country's 11th and 12th five-year plans. The same happened in Europe and other free markets. Only following imposition of anti-dumping and countervailing measures in 2012 was the U.S. manufacturing industry able to recover enough to restart investing and creating jobs.SolarWorld, with the full application of so-called PERC technology and the ability to deliver high-power bifacial solar modules, is again a technological leader in the global solar industry, the company says. Nevertheless, a new wave of Chinese overcapacity and dumping, orchestrated by the Chinese government, as well as major circumvention activities and other violations of existing measures, have again led to a critical situation for the whole U.S. solar manufacturing industry, SolarWorld says."The sun is our strongest energy source for the future," says Juergen Stein, U.S. president of SolarWorld. "Americans were the first to reach the moon. We cannot allow China now to monopolize the sun by violating trade rules and engaging in unfair competition. The same is true for all of the other industries that are a strategic focus of Chinese dumping and unfair trade. Acting against dumping has nothing to do with protectionism. The opposite is true. Trade defense is necessary to address the fact that non-market economies such as China are strategically building up state-financed overcapacities and severely damaging market-economy industries."The new national trade policy agenda emphasizes the importance of clear trade rules and the use and enforcement of trade defense instruments to restore fair competition and maintain efficient markets. The executive branch "will not tolerate these unfair trade practices that harm American workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses," the trade-agenda document says. "These practices lower living standards for all Americans by distorting U.S. and global markets and preventing resources from being allocated in the most efficient manner."Stein says the company welcomes the emphasis on trade law enforcement in light of its potential to save U.S. jobs and manufacturing. Having been subject to Chinese dumping, cyberhacking and subsidies for more than five years, the company says it has fought through two sets of trade cases against what the U.S. government numerous times has deemed illegal trade practices on the part of China and its state-sponsored solar industry."We have done all the right things," Stein says. "We have invested more than $1 billion in U.S. manufacturing, we have innovated in our technology, we have maintained more than 800 U.S. jobs, and we have fought long trade battles. But still we must count on the Administration and our Congressional leaders to support heightened trade law enforcement to make sure our U.S. workers can remain on the job and we can continue to make U.S. investments in industry-leading technology."About SolarWorld REAL VALUE: SolarWorld manufactures and sells high-tech solar power solutions and, in doing so, contributes to a cleaner energy supply worldwide. The group, headquartered in Bonn, Germany, employs 3,288 people and operates facilities in Freiberg and Arnstadt, Germany and Hillsboro, Oregon, USA, as well as in a joint venture with Qatar Solar Technologies.

EDITORIAL: Apple caved in to censorship and tyrannyThe Daily Star (Oneonta, New York)January 17, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 The Daily StarDistributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: COMMENTARYLength: 582 wordsByline: The Daily Star, Oneonta, N.Y.BodyJan. 17--We know it's an outrageous concept, but there should be some things more important than profit.Things such as integrity and the courage to tell a major client that there are just some things his threats won't make you do.Well, we did say it was an outrageous concept.We doubt very much whether the folks who own the majority shares in Apple -- the multi-multibillion-dollar operation that sold you your iPhone -- are hurting for money.We mean, how many billions of dollars are enough? As the old saying goes, how many horses can you ride when you only have one tushie?Last week, Apple caved in to the demands of Chinese authorities to pull New York Times news apps from the App Store in China.For those who don't spend a lot of time on a computer, an app -- short for "application" -- is a software program that is easy to use online or on mobile phones. In this case, the New York Times app was a way for people in China to partially circumvent the massive amount of censorship regarding the internet in that country.The New York Times app still works for users who had previously downloaded it, but anti-censorship group GreatFire.org said the app will no longer be updated for Apple devices and so will eventually stop working, according to a story on the CNN website."We have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations. As a result, the app must be taken down off the China App Store," Apple said in a statement. "When this situation changes, the App Store will once again offer the New York Times app for download in China."Violation of local regulations? Friends, you will rarely see a better example of corporate doublespeak than that.We understand what a massive market China must be for Apple, and we understand how competitive the industry must be, and we understand that there are stockholders who would scream from here to Beijing if Apple executives were to tell the Chinese where they could shove their threats and censorship.Apple should have done it, anyway.Apple just became complicit in depriving millions of people information they have every right to possess."The request by the Chinese authorities to remove our apps is part of their wider attempt to prevent readers in China from accessing independent news coverage by The New York Times of that country -- coverage which is no different from the journalism we do about every other country in the world, including the United States," Times spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said in a statement.Apple, sadly, isn't the only American company that lacks a backbone and thus promotes tyranny.Amnesty International told CNN that there is a growing trend of big tech companies effectively aiding China in its crackdown on freedom."It's extremely worrying that Apple is kowtowing to China's censorship by deleting New York Times apps," Patrick Poon, an Amnesty researcher, told CNN..Want to know something just as worrying?The Chinese government has internet detox boot camps for thousands of children, teenagers and young adults that include beatings and electroshock therapy, according to a New York Times story Friday. It said a new law has been drafted that would deal with the camp's worst excesses, but would not specify what those were.That is the government Apple is helping to subjugate its people.In its surrender, this is an Apple rotten to its core.___ (c)2017 The Daily Star (Oneonta, N.Y.)

Internet of Things Inc. to Combine Data Analytics With IoT Applications for Enhanced Production and Operational EfficienciesMarketwiredMarch 30, 2017 Thursday 5:30 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Marketwire, L.P. All Rights ReservedLength: 1237 wordsDateline: TORONTO, ON; Mar 30, 2017BodyInternet of Things Inc. (TSX VENTURE: ITT) (FRANKFURT: 71T) ("IoT Inc." or the "Company"), an IoT software and solutions provider, is providing additional insight into the recently announced New Hope - IoT Inc. joint venture.IoT Inc.'s planned joint venture partnership with New Hope Data Technology Co., Ltd., a New Hope Group affiliated and invested company (collectively "New Hope"), is focused on bringing industrial IoT solutions to Chinese factories. As part of this program, New Hope has built out a robust data analytics platform and a professional services team, that works with factory management to monitor and analyze industrial processes and inputs, converting them into actionable insight and knowledge. This helps management improve operational stability, product quality, profitability and reduce downtime.One of the key challenges that many Chinese factories face, is lack of common communication interfaces between the machines, operators and managers. According to GSMA, China leads the world in the adoption of Machine-to-Machine ("M2M") services, with 74 million connections at the end of 2014, representing almost a third of the global base, and is expected to grow at an annual rate of 29% to reach 336 million connections by 2020. M2M connections, which involve connecting multiple machines, devices and appliances to the internet by multiple networks, are a key part of the Internet of Things.International Data Corporation ("IDC") research identifies the Internet of Things as one of the key drivers to the Chinese Government's National Industry Innovation strategy, as it serves as an important driver to transform and upgrade traditional industries. At present, Chinese industrial enterprises' status is often described as Industrial 3.0 as they require significant improvements, especially in cost control, production efficiency and process management. More importantly, the Internet of Things combined with Big Data, will help push forward the third wave of China's information technology transformation. IDC projects that the Industrial IoT market in China alone will grow from US$215.5 Billion in 2016 to US$361.0 Billion by 2020.According to New Hope, "there are thousands of Chinese factories just in the chemical industry sector alone that still rely on paper-based reporting systems. In addition, banks are now requesting that Chinese manufacturers institute Industrial IoT solutions, in order to help them mitigate operational and financial risks. New Hope is looking to partner with providers of IoT solutions that address this M2M communication gap; provide real-time plant and equipment monitoring and analytics; provide predicative monitoring and analytics capabilities; and advanced energy management systems. The goal is to help New Hope's network of factories and businesses, in addition, to other customers across China to become part of the Industry 4.0 revolution.""We believe that New Hope's Big Data platform, will enable our joint venture to clearly differentiate itself, and provide customers with leading end-to-end solutions for their growing Industrial IoT requirements," said Michael Frank, IoT Inc.'s President & CEO. "Our vision includes integrating a suite of IoT solutions in a modular way, which will meet the needs of individual organizations amongst the New Hope owned factories and other manufacturing facilities across China."About New Hope GroupNew Hope Group (en.newhopegroup.com) was founded in 1982. New Hope Group now has more than 600 subsidiaries in 30 countries, with nearly 70,000 employees and annual revenues of nearly 80 Billion Yuan.

The9 Limited Announces Receipt of Nasdaq Notice of DeficiencyPR NewswireJanuary 26, 2017 Thursday 11:00 PM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 614 wordsDateline: SHANGHAI, Jan. 26, 2017 BodyThe9 Limited (the "Company" or "The9") has received a written notification from the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. ("Nasdaq") dated January 20, 2017 indicating that the Company no longer meets the continued listing requirement of minimum Market Value of Listed Securities ("MVLS") for the Nasdaq Global Market, as set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A), because the market value of the Company's total outstanding shares for the last 30 consecutive business days was below the minimum requirement of US$50,000,000. Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C), the Company has a compliance period of 180 calendar days (or until July 19, 2017) to regain compliance. If at any time during this compliance period the Company's MVLS closes at US$50,000,000 or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, Nasdaq will notify the Company that it has achieved compliance with the MVLS requirement and this matter will be closed. In the event the Company does not regain compliance with Rule 5450(b)(2)(A) prior to the expiration of the compliance period, the Company will receive written notification that its securities are subject to delisting from the NASDAQ Global Market.The Company's management is looking into various options available to regain compliance and maintain its continued listing on The NASDAQ Global Market, and is also considering other options, including a potential transfer of its listing of securities to the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Nasdaq Capital Market is a continuous trading market that operates in substantially the same manner as the Nasdaq Global Market where listed companies must meet certain financial requirements and comply with Nasdaq's corporate governance requirements.Safe Harbor Statement This announcement contains forward-looking statements.

The 5 Biggest Risks to Weibo Corp. (ADR) StockThe Daily Cardinal: University of Wisconsin - MadisonFebruary 26, 2017 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 923 wordsBodyChinese social networkWeibo (NASDAQ: WB) has surged more than 240% over the past 12 months, fueled by quarter after quarter of double-digit sales growth and triple-digit earnings growth. But as we all know, stocks never go up in a straight line, and Weibo plummeted 16% on Feb. 23 after reporting its fourth-quarter earnings.However, Weibo's fourth-quarter numbers actually crushed analyst expectations. Its revenue rose 43% annually to $213 million, beating estimates by $6 million, and its non-GAAP earnings grew 134% to $77 million, or $0.34 per share -- topping forecasts by $0.06. It also expects its first-quarter revenues to rise 55%-59% annually -- well above forecasts for 51% growth.Image source: Getty Images.Weibo's big sell-off might simply be caused by investors booking profits after the stock's monstrous gains over the past year. But if you plan to buy the dip, you should be familiar with the five main risks facing the company today.Weibo currently trades at 106 times its GAAP earnings and 62 times its non-GAAP earnings for fiscal 2016. Those lofty P/E ratios are much higher than the industry average of 50 for internet information providers, but they are well supported by its 211% GAAP earnings growth and 167% non-GAAP earnings growth in 2016.Analysts estimate that Weibo's non-GAAP earnings will rise 56% in fiscal 2017. That gives Weibo a forward P/E of 40, which looks reasonable relative to its growth potential. Nonetheless, Weibo's high multiples still leave it highly exposed to big sell-offs in a frothy market.Weibo is one of China's biggest social networks, but it's still dwarfed byTencent's (NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) WeChat, the country's most popular mobile messaging app. WeChat's monthly active users rose 30% annually to 846 million last quarter.WeChat isn't just a simple chat app. It's a monolithic "super app" that lets users share content through its "Moments" news feed, play integrated mobile games, hail cabs, order food, transfer money, make e-commerce purchases, and access other online-to-offline services -- all without leaving the app. The growth of that ecosystem is dangerous for any rival, like Weibo, which provides similar services.WeChat's mobile app. Image source: iTunes.The term "weibo" means "microblog"" in Chinese. The Weibo we're discussing in this article was once the microblogging arm of online portal giantSina (NASDAQ: SINA), which spun off Weibo as a separate company in 2014 and maintained a majority voting stake.However, there are other rival weibos in China, including Tencent Weibo,Sohu (NASDAQ: SOHU) Weibo, andNetEase Weibo. All these weibos act as social extensions of these internet and media companies' ecosystems. None of these weibos is bigger than Sina Weibo, but they could eventually steal market share away from the company. Tencent Weibo is particularly dangerous, because it's integrated with QQ, its older PC-based messaging platform, which still has 877 million active users.Weibo's biggest backers are Sina and e-commerce giantAlibaba, which respectively control 51% and 32% of the company. The support of Sina gives Weibo streamlined access to the portal site's news stories and content, while Alibaba integrates e-commerce and payment features into Weibo's app.That support helps Weibo, but it could also potentially block Sina and Alibaba's rivals from integrating their services with the platform. That means Sina rival Sohu or Alibaba's business-to-consumer competitorJD.com probably won't partner with Weibo anytime soon. Both companies have already partnered with WeChat instead -- which could throttle Weibo's growth potential in the ongoing ecosystem wars in the Chinese internet market.Lastly, Weibo isn't a platform for free speech. The Chinese government expects Weibo to self-censor posts related to controversial subjects and frequently orders the company to delete posts. The government once threatened to shut down all of Sina's news services for spreading "illegal" information, so it wouldn't be surprising to see regulators attempt a similar crackdown on Weibo.Weibo could also face regulatory pressures in the United States. The SEC has probed the accounting firms that audited U.S.-listed Chinese companies, and it recently put Alibaba under the microscope over allegations of falsifying sales figures. If the SEC hits Weibo with a similar probe (although there's no evidence that it ever will), investors will undoubtedly start questioning the company's growth story.I believe that Weibo is a risky and volatile stock, but I still believe it has room to grow. Its impressive top- and bottom-line numbers, expanding user base, and strong growth in adjacent markets such as data licensing and live video streaming all indicate that it won't peak anytime soon. However, Weibo isn't for risk-averse investors, and you should fully understand these risks before buying the stock. 10 stocks we like better than WeiboWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

A Strong Case for Buying Baidu Inc. (ADR)The Daily Cardinal: University of Wisconsin - MadisonFebruary 26, 2017 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 936 wordsBodyWhen the parent company for China's largest search engine, Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU), reported earnings this month, the results weren't pretty. Revenue was down; the company lost over 18% of its online marketing customers; and if not for a timely investment in Uber China, earnings would have fallen 21%. That's a recipe for disaster, and it helps explain why over $3 billion in shareholder value was eliminated in one trading session. But if you're a long-term investor and can take the view from 30,000 feet, a very strong case can be made that now is the time to consider buying shares.Image source: Getty ImagesIf you're unfamiliar with Baidu or what's been happening recently, here's the elevator pitch: Baidu is by far the biggest and most powerful search engine in China. But rather than rest on its laurels, the company -- led by founder/CEO Robin Li -- has plowed cash back into technologies of the future, including artificial intelligence and online-to-offline (O2O) initiatives.There's some risk involved with this under normal circumstances. Reliable advertising income that Baidu's core search engine kicks in reduces that risk. However, last year, a Chinese student died after seeking questionable treatment because of an ad he saw on Baidu. That caused the Chinese government to crack down on Baidu's advertising practices. As you might imagine, it makes the company's forays into AI and O2O more precarious, as the normally reliable stream of advertising revenue has fallen off.What we are left with is a company that appears to be floundering. Revenue is falling, earnings are diving, advertisers are leaving, and the stock trades for 45 times earnings. But that's short-sighted, and I'm backing that assertion up with my own skin in the game. Here's why.Even I was surprised at just how dramatically the number of advertisers dropped at Baidu. Last year, there were about 555,000 Chinese companies advertising on Baidu's platform. In just 12 months, that number dropped by over 100,000. Most of them are presumably healthcare companies, as they were the ones affected by the government ruling.But we need to remember that The Age of the Internet is still very young in China. Currently, only 52% of Chinese citizens are on the Internet. That's where the United States was back in 2001 -- the iPod had just been released and Enron had just gone under.The difference is that now, virtually everyone is coming online with mobile devices, where Baidu is the dominant search engine. The power of the company's data to serve targeted ads to consumers will win the day. Even during this down quarter, Baidu was able extract $5,099 per online ad customer -- up 14% from roughly $4,470 the same time last year. That speaks to the power of Baidu's platform.From where I'm sitting, the crackdown on questionable health-related ads created some short-term pain but will spur the company to become even stronger -- and safer -- over the long run.Baidu's investments in AI and O2O are also major potential catalysts. "We are thrilled by the opportunities that our existing platform has opened up and are excited to build the next generation of AI-enabled businesses," Li said during the company's release. He added that "we will [maintain] investment in key AI-enabled initiatives such as financial services, cloud, and autonomous driving." Image source: Getty ImagesThe O2O side is equally compelling. The company is trying to make it easier for users to purchase things on its platform. If you want to buy a movie ticket, instead of paying on the theater's website, it can be done through Baidu. That's good not only for Baidu, but also for vendors who don't have the expertise or size to set up a payment system themselves.Already, the number of activated Baidu Wallet accounts, while not a perfect proxy for O2O, reached 100 million in December, up 88% from the end of 2015.If these factors aren't enough to persuade you to put your own money into Baidu, consider that the company has more than enough cash to be just fine, and the company's leaders have lots of their own skin in the game.At the end of last quarter, Baidu had $13 billion in cash and investments. That's against just under $1 billion in long-term debt. In addition, the company produced $2.63 billion in free cash flow over the past year -- a 27% increase from 2015. That means shares now trade for a pretty reasonable 23 times free cash flow.An investment at today's prices also means you're investing alongside Robin Li. As of the company's last annual report, he owned 16% of shares outstanding. That's a significant sum that's remained high over the years. He is dedicated to creating long-term shareholder value, and if you're patient enough, I believe he will deliver.And those aren't empty words: Baidu currently makes up 10% of my real-life holdings. If it weren't already so big, I'd be buying more now. But for the time being, I'm content to sit back and (patiently) watch as this all plays out. 10 stocks we like better than BaiduWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Bitcoin trading above $1,000, highest level in three yearsUPIJanuary 2, 2017 Monday 1:08 PM ESTCopyright 2017 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 379 wordsByline: BROOKS HAYSDateline: HONG KONG, Jan. 2 BodyThe trading value of bitcoin has breached the $1,000 trading level for the first time in its three-year history. The early 2017 feat has the currency already building on its 2016 gains.The digital coin increased more than 125 percent in value in 2016. Some traders expect the coin's accelerated growth to continue in 2017.Much of bitcoin's recent trading success is owed to growing interest in China and India, where capital controls are putting a squeeze on cash. Fears over trade wars, currency manipulation and economic tension in the wake of Brexit and the election of  also saw the currency's value spike.India Prime Minister  recently announced a ban on high demonization rupees, fueling interest in online currencies like bitcoin.In China, citizens can exchange up to $50,000 yuan with the bank each year. Growing interest in such exchanges, given the ongoing devaluation of the Chinese currency, may inspire the Chinese government to execute stricter capital controls to keep money from flowing out of the Chinese economy.Bitcoin's already enjoys its highest trading volumes in China, and it may become even more popular if things play out as Chinese investors and market experts expect."We are seeing the aftermath of zero interest rates run amok," , CEO of BTC China, a major global bitcoin exchange, told CNBC. "So bitcoin is a healthy reminder that we don't have to hold on to dollars or renminbi, which is subject to capital controls and loss of purchasing power. Rather it's a new asset class."The simple fact that bitcoin is harder to "mine" -- thanks to a process called "halving" -- and is being used by more people, makes it more valuable."The value of Uber in any city is directly dependent on the number of drivers and number of users, it's not linear, it's exponential. The same is true of the value of bitcoin," Lee said.Bitcoin is an anonymous currency that is exclusively digital and unrecognized by any government. There are only a finite amount of Bitcoins, 21 million, so the currency can't be manipulated."Bitcoin payments are impossible to block, and bitcoin wallets can't be frozen," according to the coin's website. "Short of turning off the entire world's internet, and keeping it turned off, the bitcoin network is unstoppable and uncensorable."Load-Date: January 3, 2017End of Document

Progressive political conference held in BinghamtonPipe Dream: SUNY at BinghamtonMarch 27, 2017 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 746 wordsByline: Erica PrushBodySimone Scheurer/Pipe Dream PhotographerZephyr Teachout, former New York state gubernatorial and congressional candidate, speaks at the New York Progressive Action Network annual public conference. Over 300 people attended the event at Binghamton High School. CloseDemocratic Party reform and money in politics were two central topics of the New York Progressive Action Network's spring conference held this Sunday at Binghamton High School.Over 300 people gathered at the conference, which featured panels on Social Security and Medicaid, energy democracy and running for public office. Zephyr Teachout, candidate for New York state governor in 2014 and the House of Representatives in 2016, was the featured speaker.Other speakers included Stephanie Miner, the mayor of Syracuse, and Nomiki Konst, an investigative reporter for "The Young Turks," a progressive news and commentary YouTube channel. Binghamton City Councilman Conrad Taylor, a junior majoring in political science, was also present at the conference, where he spoke on a panel covering effectively running for office.The New York Progressive Action Network is a newly founded progressive organization that grew out of Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, and its focus is on uniting progressive organizations such as Long Island Activists and Democracy in Progress of Central New York. The network's treasurer, Arthur Schwartz, hailed Teachout as the "godmother" of the progressive movement in his introduction to her talk."At the end of Zephyr's campaign [for governor] I told her that we had to take her campaign energy and launch a group out of it, and with a little help from [Sanders], now we're here with [the New York Progressive Action Network]," Schwartz said.Teachout's talk highlighted money and politics. An associate law professor at Fordham University and author of "Corruption in America: From Benjamin Franklin's Snuff Box to Citizens United," Teachout began with a lesson on the emoluments clause in the U.S. Constitution, which states that any officer of the United States may not receive gifts, offices or titles of nobility, of any kind whatever, from foreign governments."On the day that our president took office, he began violating the constitution," Teachout said. "The Chinese government is one of the largest tenants in Trump Tower. That is money going from the Chinese government going into our president's pocket while we are negotiating our trade relationship with China."Teachout also spoke of President Donald Trump's international royalties from "The Celebrity Apprentice," which in some foreign countries come from government-owned entities."We have to be honest about Trump voters who wanted something to change too," she said. "If we ignore the reason why so many people feel there is corruption in our system, we really ignore at our own peril."She went on to speak of the need to rework the Democratic Party vision to one that exists without the fear of butting heads with the wishes of big donors."We can't stand for the clean air and the clean water we need if at the same time we are being silent about fossil-fuel infrastructure because of who's paying our candidates," she said. "So often corruption in money and politics doesn't work to lead to loud shrills and loud voices. It leads to silence."Stephen Carpineta, '04, director of Tioga County Progressive Committee, which is a member of the New York Progressive Action Network, was the main organizer responsible for bringing the conference to the city of Binghamton. He said the city's central location in the state made it an easy choice."We have a lot of business to cover being a new organization," he said. "But this is our public-facing, more fun, upbeat conference."Carpineta said most of the conference's speakers are members of the network or are people he personally met when he helped organize the Sanders rally in Downtown Binghamton last April. He added that all of the major talks and panels from the conference will soon be available to watch online on the network's Facebook page.Kayleigh Eames, a member of the Roosevelt Institute and a sophomore majoring in political science, said that she thought hosting the event in the city of Binghamton was a huge step for the area."People are really ignoring the progressive movement in Binghamton," she said. "I think it's really important that it's coming here and that people in upstate New York who are progressive are organizing and mobilizing."Load-Date: March 27, 2017End of Document

The Latest: Trump cancels business talks in 3 countriesAssociated Press State & LocalJanuary 4, 2017 Wednesday 11:43 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 1780 wordsDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - The Latest on President-elect Donald Trump (all times EST):6:35 p.m.The Trump Organization is canceling talks over possible projects in Brazil, Argentina and India as the president-elect pulls back from deal-making less than three weeks before taking office.Trump lawyer Alan Garten says the company has cancelled a "memorandum of understanding" to continue discussions with local partners over a possible office tower in Rio de Janeiro. He also said the company won't continue "exploratory" talks over projects in Pune, India, and in Argentina.The moves follow the cancellations late last year of licensing deals for hotels in Brazil, Azerbaijan and the neighboring country of Georgia.Trump has pledged to do "no new deals" while president and to leave management of his company to his two adult sons. He has promised to offer details at a news conference next week.___6 p.m.Congress has distributed free tickets for Donald Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, but some people are trying to turn them into cash.Websites including Craigslist and GreatSeats.com have tickets to the swearing-in on sale for $490 or more.That's not OK with the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, which gave inaugural tickets to congressional offices for free distribution to the public.Laura Condeluci, communication director for the joint committee, said Wednesday the panel is working with sites like eBay and StubHub to prevent such sales, as it has done in the past.Condeluci says, "Tickets to view the swearing-in of our next president are meant to be free, and it should remain that way."There didn't appear to be any tickets to the swearing-in available on eBay or StubHub.___4:20 p.m.Donald Trump has hired a political adviser whom New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie cut ties with two years ago in the fallout from the George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal.Trump on Wednesday named Bill Stepien as deputy assistant to the president and political director.Stepien wasn't charged in the so-called "Bridgegate" case. But the government's star witness testified that the close Christie adviser knew about the plan to punish a Democratic mayor who didn't endorse Christie.Stepien's attorney has said his client had no role in the scheme.David Wildstein also testified Stepien knew about plans to use the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for political favors to gain endorsements from Democrats.Two former Christie allies were convicted in November and are to be sentenced next month.___3:40 p.m.A Mexican presidential candidate has staged a one-man protest at Trump Tower.Gerardo Fernández Noroña on Wednesday sat down in the lobby of the Manhattan skyscraper and briefly refused to leave. He held a map of the United States labeled "Mexico in 1830" and showed it to the reporters and photographers gathered in the lobby.Noroña was then escorted from the building. He later tweeted that he was "satisfied" with the nonviolent protest.Noroña, a politician and sociologist, has staged similar demonstrations in his native Mexico. A spokeswoman for Trump, who lives in the skyscraper's penthouse, did not respond to a request for comment.Many Mexicans are nervous about relations with Trump, who began his campaign by suggesting that many of them who entered the U.S. illegally were rapists.___3:30 p.m.Donald Trump's choice for ambassador to China is demurring about whether the president-elect may be making his potential future assignment more difficult.Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad says, "It would be inappropriate for me to comment."Branstad has known Chinese President Xi Jinping since early in their political careers. He says he hopes the relationship will "help me to be able to communicate to the Chinese the changes that are taking place in American foreign policy."Since the Nov. 8 election, Trump has irritated Chinese officials by talking with the president of Taiwan, violating the U.S. one-China policy.Earlier this week, Trump complained that China "won't help" the U.S. effort to prevent North Korea from developing an intercontinental ballistic missile.The Chinese government has urged Trump to tone down such remarks.___2:30 p.m.It's a big hiring day for the incoming Trump White House.President-elect Donald Trump has picked Katie Walsh as deputy to chief of staff Reince Priebus (ryns PREE'-bus). Walsh worked for Priebus at the Republican National Committee and helped with party fundraising.Rick Dearborn, who used to work on Capitol Hill, is taking over a top job dealing with Congress.Joe Hagin - who's worked in three GOP White Houses - is coming on board as deputy chief of staff for operations.The White House political director is Bill Stepien, a former political adviser to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Stepien was fired by Christie in the wake of the Bridgegate scandal.Omarosa Manigault, a former contestant on "The Apprentice," will focus on public engagement in the White House.And Keith Schiller, Trump's longtime personal security guard, will be director of Oval Office operations.___1:50 p.m.White House press secretary Josh Earnest says he found common ground with President-elect Donald Trump's pick for press secretary during a meeting at the White House.Earnest says he and Trump aide Sean Spicer had a long conversation on Tuesday, joined by Obama communications director Jen Psaki. Earnest says he's considered it a "genuine honor" to serve in the role and that Spicer "sees it the same way."He says the meeting focused on the "complicated logistics" of working in the White House and the approach that he and Psaki took. Earnest isn't commenting on Spicer's suggestions he may make changes to the tradition of a daily, televised White House press briefing.__1 p.m.The United Nations says the new U.N. secretary-general had "a very positive discussion" with Donald Trump on U.S.-U.N. relations.U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq says Antonio Guterres called the president-elect on Wednesday - and their introductory conversation went well.Trump criticized the U.N. last month after the United States allowed the Security Council to condemn Israeli settlements in the West Bank.He tweeted: "As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th" - inauguration day.A later tweet said the U.N. "has such great potential but right now it is just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time. So sad!"Haq told reporters Guterres and Trump discussed "a number of avenues for participation and cooperation between the United States and the United Nations"___11:15 a.m.The CIA and FBI directors - along with the director of national intelligence - will brief President-elect Donald Trump on the investigation into Russia's alleged hacking efforts during the 2016 election.Transition officials say CIA Director John Brennan, FBI Director James Comey (KOH'-mee) and national intelligence chief James Clapper will meet with Trump in New York on Friday.Trump has cast doubt on the case being made by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee.Trump has blamed the DNC itself and sided with WikiLeaks founds Julian Assange (ah-SAHNJ'), who claims Russian wasn't involved.This will be Trump's first meeting with Comey since Comey's October announcement that the FBI was reviewing additional emails connected to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Many Democrats blame the letter for turning the election to Trump.___10:55 a.m.President-elect Donald Trump wants Wall Street lawyer Jay Clayton to be chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.Trump says in a statement that Clayton is "a highly talented expert on many aspects of financial and regulatory law." Trump says his nominee will work to ensure that financial institutions "can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time."The Senate must OK the nomination of Clayton, a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell LLP.Clayton is the latest Trump pick with deep ties to Wall Street - having represented Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Barclays Capital Inc.Trump says he wants to undo many regulations that he says have "stifled investment" in Americans businesses.Clayton says he'll "carefully monitor" the financial sector and set policies that encourages companies to create jobs.___9:30 a.m.Donald Trump is warning Republicans against letting Democrats escape blame for problems with President Barack Obama's health care law.The president-elect is making his views known in a series of new tweets and he's taking aim at the Senate's Democratic leader, New York's Chuck Schumer - a top defender of the health overhaul.Trump has this advice for fellow Republicans: "Don't let the Schumer clowns out of this web." And Trump says "massive increases" in health costs will occur this year "and Dems are to blame for the mess."Trump also says the law "will fall of its own weight - be careful."Trump's tweeting comes as the new GOP-led Congress begins initial steps toward dismantling Obama's law.Obama is holding a Capitol Hill strategy session with congressional Democrats about how to combat the Republican effort. Vice President-elect Mike Pence is meeting separately with GOP lawmakers___7:24 a.m.President-elect Donald Trump is suggesting the Democratic National Committee's carelessness led to the hack that roiled the 2016 presidential campaign."Why was the DNC so careless?" Trump tweeted early Wednesday. He was referring to the hacking last year of the committee's private email traffic, including emails of John Podesta, a top adviser to Hillary Clinton. Trump said WikiLeaks founder "Julian Assange said 'a 14-year-old could have hacked Podesta'...Also said Russians did not give him the info!"Assange has said his source for the emails WikiLeaks released was not a state, but that left open the prospect that he acquired it from a third party. The U.S. intelligence community, along with numerous Republicans and Democrats, allege that Russia did the hacking.___3:45 a.m.President-elect Donald Trump is raising new questions about the nation's intelligence community, tweeting fresh criticism at the same people who will help inform his most sensitive decisions once he takes office.Trump charged Tuesday on Twitter, without evidence, that the timing of an upcoming intelligence briefing on suspected Russian interference in the 2016 election had been delayed. "Perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange!" he wrote, using quote marks around the word "intelligence."Trump's tweet, in line with repeated criticism of his nation's intelligence leaders, caused confusion among intelligence officials, who said there was no delay in the briefing schedule.Load-Date: January 5, 2017End of Document

He also said the company won't continue "exploratory" talks over projects in Pune, India, and in Argentina.The moves follow the cancellations late last year of licensing deals for hotels in Brazil, Azerbaijan and the neighboring country of Georgia.Trump has pledged to do "no new deals" while president and to leave management of his company to his two adult sons.

But the government's star witness testified that the close Christie adviser knew about the plan to punish a Democratic mayor who didn't endorse Christie.Stepien's attorney has said his client had no role in the scheme.David Wildstein also testified Stepien knew about plans to use the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for political favors to gain endorsements from Democrats.Two former Christie allies were convicted in November and are to be sentenced next month.___3:40 p.m.A Mexican presidential candidate has staged a one-man protest at Trump Tower.Gerardo Fernández Noroña on Wednesday sat down in the lobby of the Manhattan skyscraper and briefly refused to leave.

LONDON BRIEFING: Insurers Hit As Injury Claim Discount Rate SlashedMT Newswires Live BriefsFebruary 27, 2017 Monday 3:32 AM ESTCopyright 2017 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 1552 wordsBody London Stock Exchange Group cast major doubt over its proposed merger with Deutsche Boerse after revealing the European Commission is unlikely to approve the deal in its current form.LSE shares were down 3.1% on Monday morning at 3,029.0 pence per share.The European Commission had requested that LSE divest from MTS SpA, an electronic trading platform for European government bonds in order to satisfy commission concerns and gain approval for the merger.LSE said it couldn't commit to such a divestment and would not submit a remedy proposal, which is due on Monday. "Based on the commission's current position, LSE Group believes that the commission is unlikely to provide clearance for the merger," LSE said.Although LSE still believes in the benefits of a merger, it did state that it is "highly confident" in the strength of its own business, strategy and outlook on a standalone basis, and said full year results for 2016 will be posted on March 3.LSE "expects to report strong progress across all business areas and has continued to invest to drive multiple growth opportunities".Meanwhile, insurance shares Direct Line and Admiral Group were the biggest FTSE 100 decliners, down 6.3% and 4.2%, respectively, after the UK Ministry of Justice changed the discount rate for personal injury damages to minus 0.75% from positive 2.5%, which will increase the cost of personal injury claims. Here is what you need to know at the London market open:----------MARKETS----------FTSE 100: up 0.3% at 7,267.67FTSE 250: up 0.2% at 18,628.60AIM ALL-SHARE: flat at 907.97----------Hang Seng: down 0.2% at 23,925.05Nikkei 225: closed down 0.9% at 19,107.47DJIA: closed up 0.1% at 20,821.76S&amp;P 500: closed up 0.2% at 2,367.34----------GBP: down at USD1.2408 (USD1.2495)EUR: flat at USD1.0583 (USD1.0578)GOLD: flat at USD1,255.89 per ounce (USD1,255.95)OIL (Brent): up at USD56.56 a barrel (USD56.04)(changes since previous London equities close)----------ECONOMICS AND GENERAL----------Monday's Key Economic Events still to come (all times in GMT)0900 Italy trade balance0900 EU M3 money supply and private loans1000 EU economic sentiment indicator, consumer confidence1230 Switzerland SNB governing board member Zurbrugg speech 1330 US durable goods orders1500 US pending home sales1530 US Dallas Fed manufacturing business index----------Demand in the services sector picked up a little in the three months to February, the quarterly Service Sector Survey from the Confederation of British Industry showed. The business and professional services reported that the volume was flat over the quarter, while consumer services said the volume, at 33%, was the highest since August 2015. Optimism among consumer services firms rose for the first time since May 2016, while sentiment stabilized in business and professional services.----------UK Prime Minister Theresa May is preparing for the Scottish government to call a second independence referendum to coincide with the triggering of Article 50 next month, The Times reported. Senior government sources say there is serious concern that Nicola Sturgeon will use the start of the Brexit process to demand another vote on the future of the UK and that Whitehall is planning for that event, the newspaper said. The prime minister could reject the demand, but such a move would risk causing a constitutional crisis. If she agreed, ministers have been warned, she would risk the break-up of the United Kingdom on a "coin toss", the Times reported. ----------Jeremy Corbyn has promised to bring forward "very coherent", "credible" and "solid" policies that will help revive Labour's fortunes following its humiliating Copeland by-election defeat. The UK Labour leader appeared to reject suggestions his leadership style was to blame for the party's poor performance, telling The Guardian "people obviously have a view, perceptions, about party leaders, and I have mine". He suggested the defeat to the Tories in the Cumbrian seat of Copeland, which had been held by Labour since 1935, was down to demographic change, with the party's majority gradually tumbling in recent elections.----------High winds, icy conditions and snow are predicted to hit parts of the UK as Storm Ewan sweeps across Ireland.

At a regional meeting of her Christian Democrats (CDU) in Stralsund, 95% of the 140 delegates voted to support her. Merkel's parliamentary constituency of Stralsund is in the mostly rural north-eastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. She has stood from here since Germany's reunification in 1990. The CDU and its Bavarian ally, the Christian Social Union (CSU), have already backed Merkel's bid for a fourth term as chancellor.----------US President Donald Trump's nominee for secretary of the navy, Philip Bilden, has withdrawn his name from consideration, the Pentagon said in a statement. Bilden cited privacy concerns and financial matters as his reasons for not taking the job.----------The US Democratic Party chose progressive former labour secretary Tom Perez as its new party chief Saturday in a bid to re-energize the Democrats after their loss in last November's presidential election. Perez garnered 235 votes in the second round of voting at a meeting in Atlanta on Saturday as opposed to 200 votes for his main rival, Congressman Keith Ellison. The son of Dominican immigrants and a fluent Spanish speaker, Perez, 55, is the first Latino to lead a major US party.----------The Chinese government appointed Guo Shuqing head of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, the China Daily newspaper reported Saturday.

Insurers had been braced for a cut to the discount rate, which they had said would leave them paying out more in lump sum settlements for personal injury claims. The rate is intended to reflect the interest rate at which a successful claimant may be able to invest their settlement. In a statement, Lord Chancellor Elizabeth Truss said the change will come into effect on March 20, though the statutory instrument to effect the change will be laid on Monday.----------Associated British Foods said its full-year results should meet expectations, and said that, while adjusted operating profit is expected be much higher, all the growth is likely to have been generated in the recently ended first half. The Primark-owner said it expects "substantially all of the full year increase in adjusted operating profit to be generated in the first half". That is because the foreign exchange gain in the second half of the year is not forecast to be as strong as the GBP50m gain booked in the first half. ----------COMPANIES - INTERNATIONAL----------Deutsche Bank cut its bonus pool for 2016 by almost 80%, Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reported.

Iowa ag leaders voice concern about trade under TrumpWaterloo Courier (Iowa)January 18, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 Waterloo CourierDistributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWSLength: 634 wordsByline: Andrew Wind, Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier, IowaBodyJan. 18--WATERLOO -- Trade policy -- particularly as it relates to China -- is on the minds of Iowa agricultural leaders as a new president is about to be inaugurated."We're all nervous about the trade piece," said Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Bill Northey. "We ship a lot of soybeans to China."They need our beans," he added, to feed Chinese pigs. "We need them to continue to want to buy our soybeans."Northey was speaking to about 75 farmers and students Tuesday during a roundtable discussion at a Hawkeye Community College ag summit. The day-long summit was organized by Dike farmer Darwin Cannegieter.The agriculture secretary was joined by Craig Hill, president of the Iowa Farm Bureau, and Pro Farmer editor Brian Grete. Pro Farmer is a weekly newsletter produced by Cedar Falls-based Professional Farmers of America.The discussion touched on a number of topics -- commodity markets, the renewable fuel standard, water quality issues and nominees to lead the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Agriculture. But trade policy was the dominant topic.President-elect Donald Trump has spoken out against China's trade policies and his administration is expected to take a hard line on the issue. He also has voiced opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was pushed by the Obama administration and remains unapproved by Congress. While China is not part of that 12-nation trade deal, it involves other Pacific Rim countries in the same region.As a country of 1.4 billion people with a growing middle class, Hill was concerned about how the new administration may handle China. "This economy will have a huge impact on ours," he said.Hill noted the U.S. has 15 claims against China at the World Trade Organization for trade violations. Among those are corn subsidies for Chinese farmers that exceed its WTO agreement by $100 billion. By contrast, he said, U.S. subsidies of all its farm commodities total $25 billion."We've got to have some caution about this," said Hill. Farmers will feel the effect "if we get into a trade war with China."Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox1htmlsubscribeThe CourierCSTemail@newsletter.wcfcourier.comSign Up!4EB045FEF697325896DCD4721783C08FWcfCourier.com Breaking News4EB045FEF6973258509828871CF470A2ObituariesI understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.Grete and Northey talked about the growing tariffs China is slapping on U.S. corn and dried distillers grains, a high protein feed stock left over after ethanol production. Grete said the tariffs were lower in the past because of China's need for ethanol to fuel its vehicles. "Now they're trying to encourage more domestic production," he said.If Congress doesn't pass and the president doesn't sign the TPP agreement, Hill said "we may need to resort to bilateral agreements, particularly with Japan." He suggested the trade deal is too complex to change so it better suits Trump. "You either start over or you say, 'Oh, I guess it's better because it's our administration.'"In the meantime, said Hill, the Chinese government "has accelerated their negotiations" with the countries that are part of the agreement. That could give China trade advantages the U.S. would miss out on without approving the TPP.Northey said the United States currently faces 39 percent tariffs on its beef imports to Japan. Australia, which already has a bilateral deal with Japan, has a 29 percent tariff. "We're already at a 10 percent disadvantage," he noted, asserting the U.S. would do "very well" against Australia under TPP.___ (c)2017 Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier (Waterloo, Iowa) Visit Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier (Waterloo, Iowa) at www.wcfcourier.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.Load-Date: January 18, 2017End of Document

CHABOT STATEMENT ON ZTE'S $1 BILLION SETTLEMENTStates News ServiceMarch 7, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 699 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the House Committee on Small Business:House Small Business Committee Chairman Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) made the following statement on the announcement that a Chinese cellphone equipment company will plead guilty to charges that it violated sanctions restricting technology sales to Iran. The announcement from the Departments of Commerce and Justice that the company, ZTE, will pay a $1 billion settlement to the U.S. government comes the day before the Small Business Committee is scheduled to hold a major hearing on improving the coordination of federal resources to protect small businesses from cyber threats."For years, our Committee has spotlighted the threat to American economic security and national security posed by the illegal trade practices of foreign companies like ZTE," said Chairman Chabot . "Small businesses, including small contractors in the defense and telecommunications supply chain, are especially vulnerable to these types of threats. This episode reminds us why we must remain vigilant in guarding against bad foreign actors who sell malicious hardware and software to our small businesses. This settlement is a good first step because one of the worst offenders has finally been held to account, but more work remains to ensure this does not happen again. As tomorrow's hearing will demonstrate, we must do all we can to protect small business owners, contractors, employees and customers from cyber threats, whether they are foreign or domestic in origin."Chairman Chabot, who also serves as a Senior Member of the House Judiciary and Foreign Affairs Committees, led several members of Congress in sending letters to then-Secretary of State John Kerry and then-Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker last year when reports first surfaced that ZTE may have been used to subvert U.S. sanctions against rogue regimes like Iran.In one of those letters, Chabot and the lawmakers wrote:"We would further note that ZTE specifically built its sanctions-evading strategy on a company it called "F7" in an internal memo. It is clear that "F7" is in fact the Chinese government-influenced telecom company Huawei. Huawei may be the next large company to avoid consequences for its actions unless steps are taken now to prevent it from developing a critical mass of links to American companies and markets."Tomorrow's hearing will be livestreamed on the Committee's website homepage and full written testimony can be read on the hearing page.BACKGROUND:The House Small Business Committee held several major hearings throughout the 114th Congress on foreign cyber threats to U.S. small businesses where expert witnesses identified foreign telecommunications companies as a major area of concern.The Government Accountability Office (GAO) noted in a 2012reportthat the FBI has determined that foreign state actors pose a serious cyber threat to the telecommunications supply chain.The Office of the National Counter Intelligence Executive released areportin 2011 stating that tens of billions of dollars in trade secrets, intellectual property, and technology are being stolen each year from computer systems in the federal government, corporations, and academic institutions. They identified China and Russia as the two largest participants in cyber espionage.According to areportfrom Verizon, 71 percent of cyberattacks occurred in businesses with fewer than 100 employees in 2012.Cybersecurity is a key focus of the House GOP's A Better Way to Keep Us Safe and Free. On page 23, it states: "The United States needs a more comprehensive approach to sharing information on cyber threats. Today, since most networks are interconnected, weaknesses in security can create significant vulnerabilities in both civilian and government infrastructure. Likewise, information that is valuable to one network defender is helpful to all network defendersand must be shared. Although some private-sector actors may be reluctant to share cyber threat information, government and industry have a common goal: to prevent cyber criminals and cyber terrorists from disrupting commerce, disabling critical infrastructure, and weakening national defense."###Load-Date: March 7, 2017End of Document

Iao Kun Group Holding Company Limited to Acquire Majority Interest in Guangzhou LiNiu Network Technology Co. Ltd.; Commences Transformation and Diversification of its OperationsBusiness WireFebruary 7, 2017 Tuesday 2:00 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business Editors; Technology EditorsLength: 1265 wordsDateline: HONG KONG BodyIao Kun Group Holding Company Limited ("IKGH") (NASDAQ: IKGH), announced today that it plans to transform the Company's overall strategy and begin to focus its efforts on the Chinese technology industry.As part of this new strategy, IKGH announced today that it has entered into an agreement to acquire 51% of Jia-Heng Industrial Ltd., the holding company of Guangzhou LiNiu Network Technology Co. Ltd. ("LiNiu Network"), a software technology development company that is currently developing an electronic B2C trading platform focused on the Chinese agricultural industry.As consideration for the acquisition, IKGH will issue 12.484 million ordinary shares upon the transaction's closing, as well as cash consideration that is contingent upon LiNiu Network achieving after-tax income targets. The acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017."Over the last few months, we have conducted an extensive review of our operations and our business strategy in order to right-size IKGH and find a path where we believe we can create long-term value for our shareholders," said Mr. Lam Man Pou, Chairman of IKGH. "After recently completing the review, we concluded that we did not see a path forward toward rebuilding our VIP gaming portfolio. While we will continue to participate in the promotion of our VIP gaming room in Macau, we have no further plans to expand our gaming operations to additional VIP rooms.""While conducting the review, we identified several opportunities to diversify from the gaming sector which we believed were attractive from a value-add standpoint," added Chairman Lam. "After appropriate due diligence, we made the determination to acquire a majority interest in LiNiu Network and will be focusing our near to mid-term efforts on successfully launching its trading platform and rapidly scaling the business. Importantly, the acquisition requires no upfront cash payment and firmly aligns our interests with that of LiNiu Network as the vast majority of their consideration is dependent upon them achieving consistently increasing after-tax profit targets over the next five years."LiNiu Network is currently internally testing its LiNiu ("??") B2C electronic trading platform, which will be focused on the Chinese agricultural industry; in particular, helping to create solutions with respect to the "Three Rural Issues" (agriculture / rural / farmers) to help facilitate the future development and growth of the 900 million people in China tied to the agricultural industry. The Chinese government has recently focused on encouraging farmers and the rural community to enhance their businesses through new opportunities and investment. Through its e-commerce platform, the LiNiu Network will cover both the production and service businesses included in "Three Rural", including agricultural production, information/factors/tools, agricultural sideline products, ecotourism, agricultural finance and market information.Scheduled to officially launch in the first half of 2017, LiNiu Network's directors Wang Shun Yang and Luo Guo Rui have already identified and connected with over 10,000 suppliers, of which more than 1,200 have already signed a letter of intent to join the platform upon launch. LiNiu Network expects to generate revenue on the platform through commissions, advertising and guarantee deposits."We are excited to be partnering with IKGH and playing a key role in their transition into the technology industry," said Mr. Wang. "We see a need to create a more efficient way for individual farmers and Chinese agricultural suppliers to conduct business with their customers, and we believe the LiNiu Network platform is uniquely positioned to fill the current gap."After-Tax Income TargetAs part of the transaction, IKGH will make certain cash payments to the current owners of LiNiu Network only if the after-tax income for LiNiu Network is equal to or in excess of the after-tax income specified in the below table (note, US values based on February 3, 2017 exchange rate of $1 = RMB6.88):YearIncome after-taxCash payment2017RMB20 million (US $2.9 million)RMB5,412,000 (US $0.8 million)2018RMB80 million (US $11.6 million)RMB21,648,000 (US $3.1 million)2019RMB300 million (US $43.6 million)RMB81,182,000 (US $11.8 million)2020RMB500 million (US $72.7 million)RMB135,303,000 (US $19.7 million)2021RMB700 million (US $101.7 million)RMB189,425,860 (US $27.5 million)TotalRMB1.6 billion (US $232.6 million)RMB432,970,860 (US $62.9 million)Cash will be paid to the current owners of LiNiu Network only when the after-tax income target is met or exceeded. The targets will be reviewed yearly and in aggregate at the end of the fifth year. For example, if the aggregate after-tax income target is met after the fifth year, the aggregate cash payment will be RMB432,970,860, even if all of the other after-tax income targets from 2017-2020 were not met. As a counterexample, if the after-tax income targets for 2017 and 2018 are met and the targets from 2019, 2020 and 2021 are not met (with the aggregate after-tax income also under the target of RMB1,600,000,000), then the current owners would only receive the cash payments for 2017 and 2018 (a total of RMB 27,060,000 or US $3.9 million).Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release includes forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts. Such forward-looking statements, based upon the current beliefs and expectations of IKGH's management, are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements. The gaming industry is characterized by an element of chance. Theoretical win rates for IKGH's promotion entities' VIP gaming room operations depend on a variety of factors, some beyond their control. In addition to the element of chance, theoretical win rates are also affected by other factors, including gaming patrons' skill and experience, the mix of games played, the financial resources of gaming patrons, the spread of table limits, the volume of bets placed by IKGH's promotion entities' gaming patrons and the amount of time gaming patrons spend on gambling - thus VIP gaming rooms' actual win rates may differ greatly over short time periods, such as from quarter to quarter, and could cause their quarterly results to be volatile. These factors, alone or in combination, have the potential to negatively impact the VIP gaming rooms' win rates. Investors and potential investors should consult all of the information set forth herein and should also refer to the risk factors set forth in IKGH's Annual Report on Form 20-F filed inMarch 2016, and other reports filed or to be filed from time-to-time with theSecurities and Exchange Commission.About Iao Kun Group Holding Company LimitedIKGH is a holding company that currently participates in the promotion of a VIP gaming room at the City of Dreams Macau in Cotai. In February 2017, IKGH announced its intent to diversify into non-gaming assets with the planned acquisition of a majority interest of Guangzhou LiNiu Network Technology Co. Ltd., which is developing an electronic trading platform focused on the Chinese agricultural industry.View source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170207005894/en/CONTACT: Iao Kun Group Holding Company LimitedRyan Yip, +853 2782 3425ryany@ikghcl.comorJames Preissler, 646-450-8808preissj@ikghcl.comhttp://www.businesswire.comLoad-Date: February 8, 2017End of Document

Pill presses for counterfeit drugs seized in record numbersThe Daily Cardinal: University of Wisconsin - MadisonMarch 17, 2017 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 889 wordsBody"asset-content" data-asset-uuid="7452763c-338c-5f1d-896e-41d59cacc1d3">Machines used to make counterfeit pills are reaching the US border in record numbers.US Customs and Border Protection is seizing pill presses at a rate 19 times higher than in 2011. That's the year the synthetic drug fentanyl exploded in the US drug market, according to the American Association of Poison Control Centers.While the Justice Department's Drug Enforcement Administration deals with a national problem of synthetic fentanyl overdoses, these machines are playing a critical role in getting deadly counterfeit drugs onto American streets."To the naked eye, you can't tell the difference," said John Martin, special agent in charge of the DEA's San Francisco division. "If you have counterfeit pills, you can't make them without pill presses."Counterfeit pills marketed as oxycodone or Xanax but made with fentanyl can be deadly. Fentanyl is 25 to 50 times stronger than heroin and up to 100 times more potent than morphine.The painkiller was once found only in pharmacies but is now manufactured in China in synthetic form and widely available on the American black market.Pill presses -- which can easily be bought online -- allow someone to take powder and press it into a pill that looks legitimate. "People have died from ingesting what they think is a legitimate painkiller, (but really) it's a counterfeit pill that contains fentanyl," Martin said.Across the country, authorities have seen this play out.The death of pop icon Prince may turn out to be one of the most famous cases of counterfeit pills. Police reportedly found mislabeled pills laced with fentanyl in his home, and the drug was found in his system.And with the machines easily available, the demand high and the setup easier than ever, it means the potential profits are huge.Forty-three percent of America's goods from outside the country arrive at the Port of Long Beach, California, according to US Customs and Border Protection. Authorities hold questionable pill press machines while they investigate whether they are coming into the country legally.Most come from China. That's where much of the illegal fentanyl is manufactured, as well. Clandestine Chinese labs manufacture a synthetic version of fentanyl that is easily bought on the dark Web. Mexican drug cartels later began to buy it and resell it across the border.Pill press machines themselves are not illegal, as long as they are properly registered with the DEA before they are shipped. But many of them are not.These devices vary in size from giant industrial electric ones, bigger than refrigerators, to plastic tabletop machines. Some can generate 170,000 pills per minute. CNN got exclusive access to the warehouse where they are kept."With all the overdoses we're seeing, the increase in overdoses in the last couple years, I think these types of interceptions are extremely important," said Cheryl Davies, assistant port director at Los Angeles International Airport. "They have a lot of impact on our communities."Finding the pill presses is difficult. Every 7.8 seconds, a new container is processed at the port. By checking manifests for key words and electronically scanning suspicious containers, customs agents have been able to find and seize dozens of illegally imported presses. Since 2013, there have been more than 80 seized.Get tips on free stuff and fun ideas delivered weekly to your inboxSign Up! I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy. When they find one that is not properly registered, they alert law enforcement.In 2015, Customs alerted the DEA about one such pill press that arrived from China. The DEA got a warrant to place a GPS tracker inside the shipment and traced it to Gary Resnik, a 32-year-old man. When they searched Resnik's home, agents found six pill presses and nearly 30 pounds of acetyl-fentanyl. The DEA alleges that Resnik and three other men were importing the synthetic opiate, making their own pills and selling them in bulk. Authorities later charged Resnik and others with federal narcotics and money laundering in the Los Angeles area.Martin explained that pill presses have made it easier for drug dealers to make millions of dollars out of their homes, without being affiliated with any kind of big drug cartel.It's cheap and easy to order wholesale fentanyl powder and a pill press online. For $5,000 to $6,000, Martin said, someone could potentially make $10 million worth of fake pills."A kilogram of fentanyl wholesale is about $3,500 to $5,000. The pill press, let's say you buy it for about $1,000 and the die for $100, that's not a huge investment. You get the binding material ... on the dark net, and you can start making these pills," he said. "So there's huge profit to be made on these counterfeit pills."The acting DEA administrator, Chuck Rosenberg, went to China in January to meet with officials about keeping synthetic fentanyl and pill presses from being shipped illegally over to the US.Since then, the Chinese government has banned six variations of synthetic fentanyl, but it continues to make up a large portion of the seizures of synthetic drugs recorded by the DEA.Tags• Wire• Cnn• Pill• Pharmacology• Economics• Commerce• Fentanyl• Cartel• John Martin• Press• Drug• GovernmentLoad-Date: January 17, 2018End of Document

Americans Don't Care About NokiaThe Daily Cardinal: University of Wisconsin - MadisonMarch 6, 2017 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 761 wordsBodyWe aren't the world. The most talked-about brands of Mobile World Congress are almost entirely irrelevant to Americans. Some of that doesn't matter, but the reasons for it are worth talking about.During the world's biggest mobile conference, everybody was super excited about the Nokia 3310. I found the whole hullaballoo perplexing. But circa 2000, everybody in the UK owned this phone, and they have a lot of emotional attachment to it. In the US, Nokia-the most talked-about brand at MWC, according to Brandwatch -has been an an irrelevant failure for a decade.The second most talked-about brand at the show, Huawei, is the world's largest infrastructure provider and the No. 3 global handset provider. But Huawei sells almost no phones in the United States.Our Market Is WeirdFirst, let's establish that phone brands in the US market are different from everywhere else in the world. Samsung and Apple dominate in the US and overseas. But Counterpoint Research shows LG, ZTE, and Alcatel rounding out the top five. A report with unlocked phones would also put Blu on the list.Look at IDC's global mobile phone tracker and you see Apple and Samsung, followed by Huawei, Oppo, and Vivo, none of which sell many products in the US. Skip over to Europe, and Kantar Worldpanel says Samsung and Apple lead, followed by Huawei or Wiko in different countries.On the floor at Mobile World Congress, I saw a ton of different brands we never get in the US. There were Vestel and General Mobile from Turkey, Noa from Croatia, and Gionee from China (above). Mobile phones are a much more regional industry than PCs. But what about Nokia and Huawei specifically? They're both reminders of specific ways America is keeping it weird.Our Carriers Are WeirdIf you want to play in the US, you have to play the carrier game. Nokia has been really bad at that. It alienated our carriers 10 years ago by refusing to make customized phones for each carrier. In its Windows Phone days, it made a bunch of unwise exclusivity deals with AT&T, which buried its phones after a short promotional period.The company isn't interested in making phones that use the oddball CDMA standard that Verizon and Sprint need, which eliminates more than half the country as potential customers. The 3310 phone isn't compatible with any US networksat all, so it's a total doorstop here.Nokia has zero relevance, from sea to shining sea. It's a European nostalgia brand making some nondescript low-cost Android phones and hoping to play on emotional resonances that Americans just lack.For a Nokia to win here, it would need to plant a foot on our shores, listen to what our carriers want, and build phones that conform to their needs. HMD Global Oy, the Finnish licensee of the Nokia brand, isn't about to do that. So Nokia will remain a foreign curiosity.Our Politics Are WeirdThere's a more sinister reason for Huawei's limited presence in the US market.If you live here, it's hard to understand what a big deal Huawei has become in the rest of the world. Seriously, it's huge in every country other than ours, as its packed MWC press conference demonstrated.But Huawei can't make any headway with US carriers because it's seen as the agent of an enemy state. Since 2013, Congress has treated Huawei's network equipment as a kind of Trojan horse, a potential way for the Chinese government to gain access to and manipulate US networks. (Huawei says that's ridiculous.) That controversy hasn't extended to Huawei's smartphones, but the US carriers, which control about 88 percent of sales here, seem to have shied away because why go chasing trouble?Huawei's curse doesn't seem to have extended to other Chinese smartphone makers, as ZTE and TCL-Alcatel-both Chinese-are doing quite well here, even though ZTE's networks division is also locked out of our market. That may be because ZTE and Alcatel have spent years building autonomous, US-based organizations able to make decisions on their own, while Huawei remained much more centrally controlled.For Huawei to win here, it has to shake off its Chinese identity and convince our government that it's a global, multinational company with a strong American subsidiary. This is entirely possible (as ZTE has shown) but Huawei hasn't devoted a lot of resources to this approach.I'd give Huawei more of a chance of succeeding here than Nokia. But neither will be a big deal here any time soon even though they had lots of buzz in Barcelona.This article originally appeared on PCMag.com.For copyright information, check with the distributor of this item, PCMag.Load-Date: January 17, 2018End of Document

(NASDAQ: NTES) ("NetEase" or the "Company"), one of China's leading internet and online game services providers, today announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2016."We achieved growth across our business in 2016 as we continued to introduce internet content to entertain and inspire our community, growing our total net revenues by 67.4% for the year and 53.1% for the fourth quarter, compared to the same quarter of 2015," said Mr. William Ding, Chief Executive Officer and Director of NetEase.

The quarter-over-quarter increase in online game gross profit was primarily driven by increased revenue contribution from mobile games such asOnmyojiand the mobile version ofNew Ghost.The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in advertising services gross profit were primarily attributable to NetEase's monetization efforts for its mobile applications, primarily itsMobile NewsApp. The top performing advertising verticals in the fourth quarter were automobile, internet services and financial services.The year-over-year increase in e-mail, e-commerce and others gross profit was primarily due to increased revenue contribution from NetEase's e-commerce business, such asKaola.com.The quarter-over-quarter decrease in e-mail, e-commerce and others gross profit was primarily due to decreased revenue contribution from certain NetEase e-commerce businesses with relatively higher gross profit margins.Gross Profit MarginGross profit margin for the online games business for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 60.7%, compared to 65.0% and 67.2% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2015, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to increased revenue contribution from mobile games and licensed games, which have relatively lower gross profit margins, as a percentage of NetEase's total online games revenues. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to the one-off recognition of certain royalty expenses related to licensed games in the fourth quarter of 2016, as well as increased revenue contribution from mobile games.Gross profit margin for the advertising services business for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 66.5%, compared to 65.3% and 68.1% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2015, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to higher staff-related costs.Gross profit margin for the e-mail, e-commerce and others business for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 23.4%, compared to 33.5% and 6.0% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2015, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter changes in gross profit margin were primarily attributable to changes in NetEase's e-commerce business mix.Operating ExpensesTotal operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2016 were RMB2,596.6 million (US$374.0 million), compared to RMB2,487.0 million and RMB1,801.7 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2015, respectively. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses was mainly due to higher staff-related costs resulting from an increase in headcount, average compensation, research and development investments and selling and marketing expenses. The quarter-over-quarter increase in operating expenses was mainly due to higher staff-related costs and research and development investments, which was partially offset by decreased selling and marketing expenses.Income TaxesThe Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB882.0 million (US$127.0 million) for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to RMB427.2 million and RMB513.8 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2015, respectively. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 19.2%, compared to 13.3% and 19.2% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2015, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter change in the effective tax rate was mainly due to the fact that certain subsidiaries of the Company were approved as Key Software Enterprises in 2016 and subject to a preferential tax rate of 10% for 2015. The Company recognized certain related tax credits in the third quarter of 2016.Net Income After TaxNet income attributable to the Company's shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2016 totaled RMB3.7 billion (US$530.5 million), compared to RMB2.7 billion and RMB2.2 billion for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2015, respectively. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders[1] for the fourth quarter of 2016 totaled RMB4.0 billion (US$569.9 million), compared to RMB3.0 billion and RMB2.4 billion for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2015, respectively.During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company had a net foreign exchange gain of RMB90.5 million (US$13.0 million), compared to net foreign exchange gains of RMB14.8 million and RMB66.3 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2015, respectively. The net foreign exchange gains were mainly due to unrealized exchange gains and losses arising from the Company's U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and short-term loan balances as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over the periods.NetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$4.04 and US$4.01, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2016. The Company reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$3.01 and US$2.99, respectively, for the preceding quarter, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$2.37 and US$2.35, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2015.

Net revenues from e-mail, e-commerce and others were RMB8.0 billion (US$1.2 billion) for fiscal year 2016, compared to RMB3.7 billion for the preceding fiscal year.Gross ProfitGross profit for fiscal year 2016 was RMB21.7 billion (US$3.1 billion), compared to RMB13.4 billion for the preceding fiscal year.The increase in online game services gross profit in 2016 was primarily attributable to increased revenue contribution from the Company's self-developed mobile games such as theWestward Journey OnlineandFantasy Westward Journeymobile games,Onmyojiand the mobile version ofNew Ghost, as well as licensed games such as Blizzard Entertainment'sOverwatch.The increase in advertising services gross profit in 2016 was due to NetEase's monetization efforts for its mobile applications, primarily itsMobile NewsApp. The top performing advertising verticals in fiscal year 2016 were automobile, internet services and telecommunication services.The increase in e-mail, e-commerce and others gross profit in 2016 was primarily due to business development and gross profit margin improvement of certain NetEase e-commerce businesses.Operating ExpensesTotal operating expenses for fiscal year 2016 were RMB9.0 billion (US$1.3 billion), compared to RMB6.1 billion for the preceding fiscal year. The increase in operating expenses in 2016 was primarily due to increased selling and marketing expenses, higher research and development investments and higher staff-related costs resulting from an increase in headcount and average compensation.Income TaxesThe Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB2.1 billion (US$302.8 million) and RMB1.3 billion for fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective tax rate was 15.1% for fiscal year 2016, compared to 15.7% for fiscal year 2015.NetIncome After TaxNet income attributable to the Company's shareholders for fiscal year 2016 totaled RMB11.6 billion (US$1.7 billion), compared to RMB6.7 billion for the preceding fiscal year. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders[1] for fiscal year 2016 totaled RMB12.9 billion (US$1.9 billion), compared to RMB7.4 billion for fiscal year 2015.For fiscal year 2016, the Company reported a net foreign exchange gain of RMB146.5 million (US$21.1 million), compared to a net foreign exchange gain of RMB133.8 million for the preceding fiscal year. The net foreign exchange gains were mainly due to unrealized exchange gains and losses arising from the Company's U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposit and short-term loan balances as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over these periods.NetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$12.73 and US$12.63, respectively, for fiscal year 2016, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$7.38 and US$7.34, respectively, for fiscal year 2015. Non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS were US$14.11 and US$14.00, respectively, for fiscal year 2016, compared to non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$8.13 and US$8.08, respectively, for fiscal year 2015.[1] As used in this press release, non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders is defined to exclude share-based compensation expenses and impairment on long-term investment of available-for-sale securities. See "Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results" at the end of this press release.Quarterly DividendThe board of directors has approved a dividend of US$1.01 per ADS for the fourth quarter of 2016, which is expected to be paid on March 10, 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 3, 2017.NetEase paid a dividend of US$0.73 per ADS for the first quarter of 2016 on June 3, 2016, and US$0.78 per ADS for each of the second and third quarters of 2016 on September 9, 2016 and December 2, 2016, respectively.Under the Company's quarterly dividend policy announced on May 13, 2014, quarterly dividends will be set at an amount equivalent to approximately 25% of the Company's anticipated net income after tax in each fiscal quarter. The determination to make dividend distributions and the amount of such distributions in any particular quarter will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will be based upon the Company's operations and earnings, cash flow, financial condition and other relevant factors.Other InformationAs of December 31, 2016, the Company's total cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current time deposits and short-term investments balance totaled RMB36.9 billion (US$5.3 billion), compared to RMB26.8 billion as of December 31, 2015. Cash flow generated from operating activities was RMB15.5 billion (US$2.2 billion) for fiscal year 2016, compared to RMB8.1 billion for the preceding fiscal year.Share Repurchase ProgramOn September 1, 2015, the Company announced that its board of directors approved a share repurchase program of up to US$500 million of the Company's outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months. NetEase funded repurchases made under this program from available working capital.

Translations of amounts from RMB into United States dollars for the convenience of the reader were calculated at the noon buying rate of US$1.00 = RMB6.9430 on December 30, 2016 as set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into US$ at that rate on December 30, 2016, or at any other certain date. The percentages stated are calculated based on RMB.Notes to Unaudited Financial InformationThe unaudited financial information disclosed in this press release is preliminary. The audit of the financial statements and related notes to be included in the Company's annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2016 is still in progress. In addition, because an audit of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting in connection with section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has not yet been completed, the Company makes no representation as to the effectiveness of those internal controls as of the end of fiscal year 2016.Adjustments to the financial statements may be identified when the audit work is completed, which could result in significant differences between the Company's audited financial statements and this preliminary unaudited financial information.Conference CallNetEase's management team will host a teleconference call with simultaneous webcast at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, February 15, 2017 (Beijing/Hong Kong Time: 9:00 a.m., Thursday, February 16, 2017).

These statements are made under the "safe harbor" provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these forward-looking statements by terminology such as "will," "expects," "anticipates," "future," "intends," "plans," "believes," "estimates" and similar statements. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted by a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online game market will not continue to grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its leading position in that market, which could occur if, for example, its new online games or expansion packs and other improvements to its existing games do not become as popular as management anticipates; the ability of NetEase to successfully expand its mobile internet offerings; the ability of NetEase to effectively market its games and other services and achieve a positive return on its marketing expenditures; the risk that Shanghai EaseNet will not be able to continue operatingWorld of Warcraft®, StarCraft® II, Hearthstone®,Diablo III®: Reaper of Souls(TM), Heroes of the Storm®,Overwatch® or other games licensed by it for a period of time or permanently due to possible governmental actions or the risk that such games will not be popular with game players in China; the risk that changes in Chinese government regulation of the online game market and the market for NetEase's e-commerce services may limit future growth of NetEase's revenues or cause revenues to decline; competition in the online advertising business and the risk that investments by NetEase in its content and services may not increase the appeal of the NetEase websites among internet users or result in increased advertising revenues; the risk that NetEase may not be able to continuously develop new and creative online services, including its ability to maintain and enhance the popularity of its e-mail, mobile and e-commerce services and develop attractive mobile games; the risk that NetEase will not be able to control its expenses in future periods; competition in NetEase's existing and potential markets; governmental uncertainties (including possible changes in the effective tax rates applicable to NetEase and its subsidiaries and affiliates and the ability of NetEase to receive and maintain approvals of the preferential tax treatments and general competition and price pressures in the marketplace); the risk that fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi with respect to other currencies could adversely affect NetEase's business and financial results; and other risks outlined in NetEase's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NetEase does not undertake any obligation to update this forward-looking information, except as required under the applicable law.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresNetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS, as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP").NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders as net income attributable to the Company's shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses and impairment on long-term investment of available-for-sale securities. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders enables NetEase's management to assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses and impairment on long-term investment of available-for-sale securities, which are non-cash charges or non-recurring in nature. NetEase believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the Company's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates investors' assessment of its operating performance.Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses and impairment on long-term investment of available-for-sale securities have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. See "Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results" at the end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. Contact for Media and Investors:Juliet Yang NetEase,

Students Read Between the Lines of NYUSH Textbook PoliciesWashington Square News: New York UniversityJanuary 30, 2017 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 852 wordsBodyStudents Read Between the Lines of NYUSH Textbook PoliciesNYU Shanghai students are outraged at the institute's expensive textbook policies.Photo by Kevin JiangPhoto by Kevin JiangNYU Shanghai students are outraged at the institute's expensive textbook policies.Jemima McEvoy, News EditorJanuary 30, 2017NYU Shanghai implements a unique textbook policy, restricting how students buy textbooks. NYUSH's Student Council has grappled with the administration over altering the policies, but the administration says legal barriers prevent reform.The official policy requires students to either order the e-textbook from the NYUSH's textbook website or legally purchase a physical copy and verify it with the university."If the website shows that the textbook is required in physical hardcopy format, you must order it through the NYU Shanghai Textbooks Website," the policy reads. "No verification of substitutions will be allowed (except the Chinese Books)."This policy prevents students from purchasing textbooks illegally or pirating the books online. NYUSH predominantly uses e-textbooks, and a number of students, who prefer physical copies, illegally print textbooks.NYUSH junior Nofar Hamrany has voiced his concerns to the student leadership platform for three years. Hamrany said that acquiring textbooks, according to campus policies, has caused financial concerns for students.The policy states, "NYU Shanghai charges each student $500 by the Bursar for course materials before the academic semester started but students might receive refund based on the actual costs."Hamrany said that NYUSH has since removed this flat $500 fee and replaced it with a verification policy, which students also oppose because it only applies to NYUSH - other American universities in Shanghai are more flexible with their textbook policies. Verification requires students to buy university-approved books and then confirm their legal acquisition. If this process is not completed, the university purchases the book on the student's behalf.Hamrany also said that the legal issues the university cites should be questioned, because they serve the university more than its students."If I as a student buy an illegal book, it has nothing to do with the school," Hamrany said.Hamrany believes NYUSH is worried about how it is perceived in the United States. The economic repercussions should not affect students.But, John Robertson, Assistant Provost for Academic Affairs, said that many constraints prevent the university from loosening its policies. Two major roadblocks include NYUSH lacking the license to be a textbook vendor and the university being under government scrutiny."One of the reasons that we have to do what we do is that unlike New York - where there are so many different options for students to get books and the university acts as almost a bystander to the process - we have reputational risk involved if we removed ourselves from the process and told students to get books on their own," Robertson said.Robertson said that the university does not want to violate U.S. copyright laws, since publishers hold the university liable if students are caught illegally accessing textbooks."There are stories in the New York Times and papers like [Washington Square News] who look at the labor practices in China and how NYUSH relates to that," Robertson said. "We just want to make sure that if someone in New York or at The New York Times decides they want to write an article about NYUSH and its relationship to U.S. copyright law that we are actually following that copyright law."NYUSH sophomore Hobin Kim, Vice President of NYUSH's Student Government, said that while things have definitely improved during his time dealing with the textbook policy issues, students will never be completely satisfied. Yet, while some students are upset with the policies, Kim does not think this is a unanimous sentiment."It's one of those things where students just complain, even though the admin is trying a lot to improve the quality of life in our school," Kim said. "For some people, they just whine about it, but for some people, they just don't care."Kim said that he believes there is rationale within the current system and that two main issues prevent NYUSH from becoming a legal book vendor: the lack of space for a bookstore and the aforementioned licensing issue. When he explains this to other students, he said that they are mostly able to empathize with the administration. However, he also thinks this understand- ing could stem from students' general affluence."NYUSH is the first jointly established university by America and China, so we are very careful in this situation - we're not really sure if we're going to be existing in 10 or 20 years, because the Chinese government is looking at us," Kim said.A version of this article appeared in the Monday, Jan. 30 print edition.

Targeted Microwave Solutions' Clean Technology Eliminates Toxic Industrial EmissionsMarketwiredJanuary 23, 2017 Monday 6:15 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Marketwire, L.P. All Rights ReservedLength: 1795 wordsDateline: VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA; Jan 23, 2017BodyTargeted Microwave Solutions Inc. (TSX VENTURE:TMS)(OTCQX:TGTMF)(FRANKFURT:A2ACNT) ("TMS", the "Company") is pleased to announce exceptional air emissions and water quality results.TMS recently retained Air Monitoring Specialist, Inc. (AMS) to determine particulate matter and VOC emission levels of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) from the use of the Company's proprietary industrial microwave drying system in King William, Virginia. AMS conducted multiple test runs using montmorillonite clay and coal as sample materials and followed test methods and analytical procedures recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The results of the tests significantly exceeded the minimum targets set by the EPA.Exhibit 1 - Reactor Emissions Summary  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Compound                  Clay Test Run Emissions    Coal Test Run Emissions ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Particulate Matter                  0.0897 lbs/hr                        N/A ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sulfur Dioxide                        0.00 lbs/hr                0.00 lbs/hr ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Nitrogen Oxides                       0.00 lbs/hr                0.00 lbs/hr ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Carbon Monoxide                       0.03 lbs/hr                0.22 lbs/hr ----------------------------------------------------------------------------The emissions test results conclusively show that TMS's proprietary microwave drying system significantly reduces, and in some cases completely eliminates, toxic emissions that contribute to air pollution."Drying systems, no matter how complex, all have the same core function - they remove moisture from a material. Using our system, industries can reduce and, possibly, eliminate toxic emissions depending on the application. When technology eliminates toxic emissions and associated costs, significant growth in production capacity can be unlocked. Industries will be able to lower production costs and reduce their negative impact on the environment. Traditional industrial drying methods, powered by fossil fuel, are expensive, inefficient and emit significant amounts of toxic emissions. With our proven technology, we are positioning TMS to become a global leader in the greening of heavy industry," said Dr. James Young, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman.TMS' Research and Development team also conducted tests on the quality of captured water when processing coal samples. Multiple water samples were tested by qualified third party laboratories and analyzed by Environmental Resources Management (ERM). ERM referred to Chinese standards for drinking and irrigation water to analyze and compare the water samples. Testing was carried out using EPA approved techniques. The results confirmed that the quality of water captured and conserved, exceeded the standards for Agricultural Grade water as set by the Chinese government.The world's largest coal production and consumption occurs in China and India; as a result, they are also the largest emitters of toxic emissions. These two countries are also home to some of the world's highest "water-stressed" environments. Significant amounts of water consumption takes place in coal production and coal based energy production. This makes coal mines and coal-fired power plants in these regions high potential customers for TMS, as TMS' technology is capable of addressing these critical global issues. The Company's excellent test result, demonstrate its superior environmental performance and is further supported by the technology's strong economic benefits."Our technology is revolutionary. Coal mines depend on water to wash and process coal. Coal-fired power plants also require water to generate energy. Our technology has the ability to assist the coal industry to become self-supporting with respect to their water consumption. The agricultural grade water captured and conserved while drying low-rank coal using our Company's technology can be reused. Therefore, our customer's need to draw water from the local aquifers will be reduced," said Steve Lawson, Chief Technology Officer.On behalf of the Board of Directors,- Dr. James Young, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman About Targeted Microwave Solutions Inc. Targeted Microwave Solutions Inc. is a clean technology company that designs and installs vertical microwave reactors to dry and process coal, clay and biomass, including wood fibre. As a global leader in the advancement of microwave technology the Company's mission is to provide the industry with a cleaner and more efficient technology solution by eliminating toxic emissions, reducing energy requirements and conserving significant amounts of water.The Company's R&D and commercial demonstration plant in King William, Virginia is strategically located near several major industrial clay and biofuel manufacturers. The marketing and testing facility in Shanghai, China collects and analyzes material samples from nearby coal power plants and coal mines.

MiR Leads the Global Market for Autonomous Mobile Robots with 500% Growth in Sales in 2016, Putting Robots in Production in More Than 30 CountriesPR.comFebruary 25, 2017 Saturday 6:30 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR.com, distributed by Contify.com All Rights ReservedLength: 840 wordsByline: MiRBodyStony Brook, NY,  February 25, 2017 --(PR.com)-- Mobile Industrial Robots, (MiR), a next-generation developer and manufacturer of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), has seen an astounding 500 percent growth in sales in 2016, with over 200 innovative MiR100 robots and accessories installed in more than 30 countries. The ambitious company has recently expanded its global presence, establishing regional offices in New York and Shanghai. With substantial increases in hiring in 2016, MiR also tripled the size of its Denmark headquarters, relocating to a new location that will support its ongoing expansion. In 2017, the front-runner expects to further consolidate its leadership position with a new product that will be launched in Chicago on April 3, 2017 at Automate, North America's largest automation trade show. This new product is expected to help triple sales increases in 2017, through the combined activities of MiR's 73 distributors across 33 countries."We continue to develop the innovative products that customers need to optimize their production and to make sure their employees are adding value to company processes," says MiR CEO Thomas Visti. "The requirements for automating internal transportation increased substantially this year, and companies need to be able to implement these technologies quickly and easily-and to see a fast return on their investment. That's why we are focused on flexibility and smart, intuitive interaction so customers can effortlessly collaborate with our technologies without changing their existing environment."Multinational manufacturers in automotive, textiles, electronics and food products embrace mobile robotsFounded just four years ago, MiR has already gained a significant number of new customers in the global manufacturing market. While the MiR100 robots are cost-effective, flexible and user-friendly enough to provide significant value for mid-sized manufacturers, buyers of the logistics robots are increasingly multinational companies. MiR customers include Boeing, Unilever, Ericsson, HUGO BOSS, Honeywell, Continental, Flex, Danone, Kamstrup, Assa Abloy and many others.North American market sees dramatic growth in just 10 monthsMiR opened its first North American regional office in New York in April 2016, headed by veteran robotics sales executive Ed Mullen. Since then, the company has gained commitments from 19 North American distributors who have recognized the exciting opportunities for mobile robots and the leadership of MiR's products. Every distributor has demonstration robots on-site and has been fully trained in beginning, intermediate and advanced programming to support a wide range of customer needs."Distributors across North America are investing in MiR's innovative technology and partnering closely with us because they recognize the dramatic growth opportunities we bring," says Mullen. "In just 10 months, we've gone from zero presence in North America to having sold significant numbers of robots into a broad range of industries that includes automotive, electronics, aerospace, consumer goods, food products and more. Having this kind of success so quickly with a new technology just demonstrates the immediate recognition of the value of our mobile autonomous robots. The competitive advantage we offer is clear."Chinese beachhead establishedTo spearhead sales in China, MiR has brought onboard Will Dong, an experienced area sales manager who is working out of MiR's new Shanghai sales office."There is enormous potential for mobile robot sales in China, and the timing is just right," says Dong. "The Chinese Government has launched several initiatives to promote investment in automation, including the 'Made in China 2025' plan, but robotic expertise is relatively low in China. It's precisely for this reason that our user-friendly, intuitive robots, which require no programming experience, are perfect for the Chinese market. And MiR robots can be installed in a factory without needing to modify the internal production layout. We have already sold MiR robots in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan."About MiRMobile Industrial Robots is headquartered in Odense, Denmark where the company was founded in 2013 by experienced professionals from the Danish robotics industry.MiR develops and sells the MiR100, the most advanced mobile robot for internal transportation of goods in both the manufacturing and health care industries. MiR has quickly established a global distribution network in more than 30 countries, and the company has grown rapidly with a 500 percent increase in sales from 2015 to 2016. The company recently set up regional offices in Shanghai and New York.MiR supplies its collaborative, safe and autonomous robots to multinational industrial groups and mid-sized companies. MiR robots carry out internal transportation tasks quickly, easily and cost-effectively, to free employees for more valuable activities.

Zecotek Signs LFS Scintillation Crystal Supply Agreement Worth $21 million Over the Next 3 YearsMarketwiredJanuary 25, 2017 Wednesday 12:05 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Marketwire, L.P. All Rights ReservedLength: 920 wordsDateline: SINGAPORE; Jan 25, 2017BodyZecotek Photonics Inc. (TSX VENTURE: ZMS) (FRANKFURT: W1I) (OTC PINK: ZMSPF), a developer of leading-edge photonics technologies for healthcare, industrial and scientific markets, is pleased to announce that it has signed a LFS scintillation crystal supply agreement with the Shanghai based company EBO Optoelectronics, to supply over $21 million worth of scintillation crystals over the next three years. The agreement stipulates that the supply of the LFS crystals will continue on a yearly basis after the initial three year period, unless otherwise agreed to by both parties. Zecotek will become the main supplier of Lutetium silicate based scintillation crystals to EBO."The Shanghai EBO Optoelectronics Company is a strategic customer with strong network and access to the medical imaging industry in China," said Dr. A.F. Zerrouk, Chairman, President, and CEO of Zecotek Photonics Inc. "Recent changes to the regulatory landscape in China, regarding medical equipment imports, has caused OEMs to manufacture medical scanning devices domestically. This initial contract is a starting point and we look forward to building an even more significant business with EBO to capture a significant portion of the PET medical scanner market in mainland China."EBO is the largest crystal array producer and supplier in China. Their arrays are used in the very fast growing domestic PET medical imaging market. Zecotek will be supplying elements of LFS to EBO as the customer. In order to meet the growing demand, Zecotek is working on the gradual expansion of its manufacturing base and capabilities, however it will be using its present facility to start the present agreement, while fulfilling, as a priority, existing orders from Zecotek's OEM partner, as well as other current accounts.Run-away medical costs from 2010 to 2014 has caused China to take measures to modify the regulatory controls covering medical equipment in its public and private hospitals. The Chinese government uses incentives to encourage domestic hospitals to use Chinese-made medical devices as it looks to stimulate the local market and reduce soaring healthcare costs.China's medical device market has been growing and is now ranked second largest in the world. The significant growth in the medical device market is due to both an increase in discretionary income and the world's largest aging population. The annual growth of the medical device market has been 20 percent for the past six years and is expected to continue at this pace for the next five years. With the increase in the number of OEMs manufacturing PET scanning devices, Zecotek's management team is focused on becoming a leading supplier of the key components in this market.About Shanghai EBO Co.Founded in 2007 and headquartered in Shanghai, EBO has more than 120 employees and 4,000 square meters of manufacturing space. Shanghai EBO fabricates and supplies crystal arrays to an extensive customer base which includes: Neusoft Medical Systems, Samsung Medical, Topgrade Healthcare, FMI Medical Systems, IHEP of CAS, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and many domestic and foreign universities and research institutions. EBO has the highest standard processing production line and offers shaped crystal customization and crystal array assembly to end users.About ZecotekZecotek Photonics Inc (TSX VENTURE: ZMS) (FRANKFURT: W1I) (OTC PINK: ZMSPF) is a photonics technology company developing high-performance scintillation crystals, photo detectors, positron emission tomography scanning technologies, 3D auto-stereoscopic displays, 3D metal printing, and lasers for applications in medical, high-tech and industrial sectors.

The 2 Worst Artificial Intelligence Stocks of 2016The Daily Cardinal: University of Wisconsin - MadisonJanuary 2, 2017 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 869 wordsBodyImage source: Getty Images.2016 was a year in which several major tech trends truly took shape. Areas like virtual reality, self-driving cars, and artificial intelligence matured from seemingly distant concepts into tangible products that will eventually upend the ways people live and work.Amid all of this excitement, shares of artificial intelligence companies likeApple,Microsoft, andFacebook each outperformed theNasdaq Composite benchmark in 2016. Not all AI stocks performed as swimmingly, though. Names likeBaidu (NASDAQ: BIDU) andSalesforce.com (NYSE: CRM) each handily underperformed the broad market indices last year.BIDU data by YCharts.So, what drove the subpar performances at Baidu and Salesforce.com? And more importantly, what does this mean for each of these artificial intelligence stocks heading in 2017?2016 has been an evolutionary year for Chinese search leader Baidu, one that should ultimately leave the company in a stronger position to grow profits over the long term. Baidu is in the midst of conforming to new, tougher standards for its search results that the Chinese government mandated earlier this year after the death of a Chinese student sparked a national uproar surrounding shady online advertising practices among pseudo-healthcare companies. This cleaning up of its results means Baidu has had to curtail or cut ties with some former advertising customers, which has crimped sales and profit growth in recent quarters. For example, Baidu's adjusted operating profit fell 12.5% year over year in its most recent quarter. However, making its search results more trustworthy should ultimately benefit Baidu, which remains far and away the most dominant search engine in China.Beyond the headwinds in its core business depressing results today, Baidu remains squarely focused on dominating the future of the Chinese technology market. The company has moved aggressively into the market for online services, including online restaurant delivery, maps, online video, online travel booking, and more.The company is also emerging as a leader in developing artificial intelligence software in China and is quickly developing real products and applications around this next wave of technology. Among the many examples are Baidu's AI-powered chatbots that help doctors more effectively diagnose diseases, software to help banks prevent fraud more effectively, and learning algorithms that enable self-driving cars to navigate streets more safely. Helping invent the future involves significant near-term investments from Baidu, and the exact payoff for such efforts isn't certain. However, between the long-term growth potential of its lucrative search business and the chance to dominate several important areas of the future of technology, Baidu's overall outlooks remains quite favorable indeed.Salesforce.com's appearance on this list likely has more to do with its heady valuation than any actual issues with its business, which has performed quite nicely over the course of 2016. The company has met or beaten analyst estimates in each of the past four quarters. Its sales are expected to grow more than 20% in its current year and next year. Moreover, Salesforce.com CFO Mark Hawkins has stated his goal of maintaining annual sales growth of at least 20% for years to come, though the overall market for customer relationship management software is expected to grow 14% annually through 2020, according to Gartner. If it maintains its stated growth clip, Salesforce.com will hit CEO Marc Benioff's goal of doubling its revenue some time between 2021 and 2022. Though certainly commendable, there's a fair case to be made that Salesforce.com's stock has gotten ahead of even its CEO's ambitious goals. The company trades at a lofty 53 times next year's estimated earnings per share, more than double theS&P 500's lofty 25 times its current earnings. This can be the headache with investing in growth stocks. Though Salesforce.com helped pioneer cloud-based CRM software and has grown like a weed throughout its history, investor enthusiasm can push its shares to undue heights at times, which can lead to subsequent lulls in its stock price, as I believe 2016 represented for Salesforce.com shares.10 stocks we like better than Salesforce.comWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Rising tensions surrounding North Korea's nuclear programMichigan Tech Lode: Michigan Tech UniversityMarch 25, 2017 SaturdayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 641 wordsByline: Johnathan JaehnigBodyContinuing development of North Korea's nuclear program has prompted the U.S. deployment of high-tech defensive technologyon the boarder between South Korea and North Korea. While the Chinese government has expressed their opposition to thismove, they have also said that they will try to help America to keep the situation in North Korea from escalating further.- Photo courtesy of FlickrAs North Korea has continued to test and develop its nuclear program, as well as the rockets that could deliver a nuclear weapon even further, America has begun the deployment of defensive technologies in South Korea.Pieces of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system arrived in South Korea early this month, according to CNN, following a missile test by North Korea. The deployment of THAAD, which was announced in July, has largely been opposed by the Chinese, who say that the presence of the technology in the area undermines their own defense interests.While THAAD, which works by detecting incoming rockets via radar and shooting them down with smaller rockets, could prevent a small number of rockets fired south over the border from reaching their target, the system could be ineffective against a large number of rockets fired nearly simultaneously. The system would also be unable to protect the country from missiles fired from the sea that surrounds it on three sides. The continually eroding political stability in Asia, including nuclear tests by North Korea despite mounting sanctions, as well as the deployment of THAAD, were regular topics of conversation for U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who visited South Korea, China and Japan in the past week two weeks, according to NPR.Early events in Tillerson's visit caused concern as he stated the United States would not rule out a pre-emptive strike on North Korea. His later visit to China offered some reassurance, as the major power in the area expressed dedication to working with the United States on controlling North Korea to prevent such an event. North Korea has shown no such dedication, releasing a propaganda video over the weekend that depicted the destruction of U.S. targets, according to the New York Post.Despite increasing funding for the military while cutting funding in other areas, the Trump administration has failed to fill a number of other state and defense positions, according to the New York Times.While most of the top level cabinet positions that proved controversial early in Trump's presidency have since been approved by Congress, there are over 500 administrative and managerial positions that are still empty. Trump has defended the vacancy of key positions by saying that it is part of his plan to streamline the federal government. Critics have pointed out that this may set a record for transition lag, while members of Trump's staff have said that the positions are taking so long to fill because previous presidents arbitrarily gave important positions to people who helped their campaigns and Trump is being more careful with the process.In addition to conflicting with Trump's explanation, this explanation is also inconsistent with allegations that many of the positions that Trump has filled so far are people who have contributed to his campaign. Examples include the appointment of Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner to a senior advisor position. The filling of other key cabinet positions have been delayed or undone by staff members stepping down or being disqualified during the approval process. Examples include would-be Army Secretary Vincent Viola, who was found to have multiple conflicts of interest and Michael Flynn who resigned his position as National Security Advisor last month after it was found that he had communications with Russia despite telling Trump and other federal positions to the contrary.Tags• Internatoinal• NewsLoad-Date: March 25, 2017End of Document

WHITE HOUSE PROPAGANDA, GRAFT: THIS IS NOT NORMALStates News ServiceMarch 17, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 863 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Campaign for Americas Future:Dave JohnsonEarly in this millennium, Mississippi's Trent Lott was the Senate's Majority Leader. Then it was disclosed that he had done something outside the bounds of what most Americans considered normal and acceptable. Lott had spoken favorably about Strom Thurmond's 1948 Presidential candidacy on a platform of racial segregation. So he had to go.Favorable comments about a segregationist were enough to unseat a national leader fifteen years ago. This was considered a major scandal, and a short time after his comments were revealed, Lott was forced to resign his leadership position in the Senate.That is what normal used to mean. That was then, this is now.Breitbart is a news website, which was until recently run by Steve Bannon. It is a far-right outlet that promotes alt-right concepts often involving white nationalism.Bannon often refers to what he calls a Camp of the Saints'-type invasion to describe what he sees as a rising tide of threats to Western civilization. When he says these things, Bannon is referring to a 1973 French novel that describes the takeover of Europe by waves of immigrants that wash ashore like the plague, and reframes everything as the fight to death between races.Steve Bannon, race-baiting propagandist, is now the White House Chief Strategist. Yet this is not a national scandal.In fact, Bannon is not the only alt -right person in the Trump White House. Other Breitbart staffers are also getting jobs in the new administration, as are other far-right figures. It is said that White House alt-right figures removed reference to the genocide of Jewish people in the White House's International Holocaust Remembrance Day statement.This is not normal.President Trump recently accused former president Obama of a massive criminal conspiracy involving abusing presidential power to wiretap Trump's campaign to help Trump's opponent. This is , to say the least, not normal.The White House has begun sending Americans a daily state-propaganda email newsletter called Your 1600 Daily. It is sent unsolicited, in violation of the 2003 CAN-SPAM Act. It comes from an official White House government email address, and is signed by The White House.One day this briefing advertised a meeting with victims of Obamacare. Another asks Americans to Share Your Obamacare Disaster Story With President Trump. Wednesday's makes the claim, Under his leadership, the United States will be the world's great magnet for innovation and job creation.It promotes extremist news outlets like Townhall, and white nationalist outlets like Breitbart.This is just not normal. In other times this, too, would be a major scandal.And then there is the blatant moneymaking. Last week China granted Trump a number of lucrative trademarks, after Trump broke a campaign promise to declare China as a currency manipulator, which would have initiated a process that could lead to tariffs on Chinese-made goods entering the country.This week we learn that the family of Trump's son-in-law and top adviser Jared Kushner will make at least $400 million in a sweetheart deal with a Chinese-government-connected firm.But there are a number of red flags surrounding the transaction, and no way to rule out concerns that this represents just the latest instance of potential conflicts between the Trump administration's obligation to the public and its own financial gain.And that's just a taste of the financial shenanigans going on. For example, despite Trump's pledge to drain the swamp in Washington from the influence of lobbyists, his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, has started a lobbying firm. See if you can guess what he's selling to clients.Fox News commentator Monica Crowley was asked to join the Trump White House, but had to back out after it was disclosed that she had engaged in plagiarism. Now it is reported that she is going to work as a lobbyist for Victor Pinchuk, a Ukrainian billionaire and Putin supporter. She's making big bucks, because she has influence with the Trump White House. That is just a recent example of so many examples of corruption.But wait, there's more. The President of the United States is holding campaign rallies just one, two months into presidency. And he is raising campaign funds from donors. What?Meanwhile the Republicans in Congress, in the thrall of corporate and billionaire cash, assist rather than do itheir Constitutional duty to hold these people accountable.This is like the story of the frog in boiling water. The water is starting to boil, but because the warming happens slowly, the frog gets used to it and doesn't notice it is cooking.What's going on here is not normal. They are so much not normal and happening so fast that we risk becoming desensitized to what normal means.So a reminder: This is not normal. Do not allow yourself to ease into any level of acceptance of this, or a belief that what is happening in our country is part of a pattern or a political pendulum that will swing the other way or a back and forth between parties or think checks and balances are going to save us and our nation.Posted by Dave JohnsonLoad-Date: March 17, 2017End of Document

Fang Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2016 ResultsPR NewswireMarch 31, 2017 Friday 7:40 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3550 wordsDateline: BEIJING, March 31, 2017 BodyFang Holdings Limited (NYSE: SFUN) ("Fang" or "we"), the leading real estate Internet portal in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.Fourth Quarter 2016 HighlightsTotal revenueswere $174.7 million.Operating losswas $8.9 million.Non-GAAP operating losswas $6.4 million.

We did not know in depth of the new markets and new business lines. We were too aggressive in transformations at the same time with all of our business lines," said Vincent Mo, Chairman and CEO of Fang.com. "We are making adjustments to our transformations. We will return to open-platform strategy in which we will support and facilitate businesses of our partners including developers, brokers and agents, property owners and buyers, and other home related companies and professionals."Fourth Quarter 2016 ResultsRevenuesFang reported total revenues of $174.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, a 42% decrease from $300.7 million in the corresponding period of 2015, primarily due to the decline in e-commerce and marketing services. Revenue from e-commerce services was $89.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, a decrease of 48% from $173.9 million in the corresponding period of 2015.

Industrial Lighting - Market Drivers and Forecasts from TechnavioBusiness WireJanuary 10, 2017 Tuesday 6:23 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business EditorsLength: 997 wordsDateline: LONDON BodyTechnavio analysts forecast the            global industrial lighting market to grow at a CAGR of over 2% during the forecast period, according to their latest report.This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170110005881/en/Technavio has published a new report on the global industrial lighting market from 2017-2021. (Graphic: Business Wire)The research study covers the present scenario and growth prospects of the global industrial lighting market for 2017-2021. Lighting systems are used for multiple applications in the residential, architectural, office, and industrial sectors. The report includes the market for finished lighting products that are used for industrial applications only.LFLs and HIDs are the major lighting technologies employed in the industrial segment, as industries mainly require high-intensity bright lights. In comparison to HIDs that are used for industrial lighting applications, LEDs have lower illumination. However, LEDs are more cost-effective in terms of power consumption and have lower heat dissipation when used over extended periods.Request a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=55637Technavio's sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more.Technavio hardware and semiconductor analysts highlight the following three factors that are contributing to the growth of the global industrial lighting market:• Strong government support• Rising need for energy-efficient LED bulbs• Upcoming major events and infrastructure projectsStrong government supportStrong government support is one of the major factors driving the growth in the global industrial lighting market. The Chinese government is looking at reducing power generation from coal plants, expanding the nuclear power generation base, encouraging green technologies in all areas of manufacturing and promoting efficient lighting technologies to reduce power consumption. The government plans to provide subsidies to LED lighting manufacturers to scale up and encourage the production of innovating lighting solutions.Sunil Kumar Singh, a lead lighting analyst at Technavio, says, "The government in the BRIC countries is encouraging the use of LED lights by launching new programs and providing subsidies to manufacturers. China had the largest LED industry in the world and accounted for approximately 30% of the world production, as of 2015."Rising need for energy-efficient LED bulbsUnlike residential customers, who use lights for only a few hours a day, industrial facilities need lighting for almost 24 hours. As the industries are more focused on profits, long life span of LED lighting system leads to low TCO, which helps in the profitability of the industries. These benefits of LEDs make them suitable for industrial customers."High energy costs have been compelling both governments and consumers to reduce their energy consumption and make use of power-saving lighting solutions. LEDs are efficient in terms of lighting and power consumption, as they limit power consumption more effectively than conventional incandescent bulbs," adds Sunil.Upcoming major events and infrastructure projectsLack of infrastructure development is hampering the growth of the Brazilian economy. To overcome this challenge, the government is prioritizing the infrastructure development spending for the forecast period. This is also because of the Olympic Games in 2016, which will support the growing demand for roads, rails, and airports. Another set of projects planned to start by the government from 2018 is estimated at USD 64.1 billion.The Russian lighting market is seeing an explosive growth in the LED market spurred by the government initiatives to increase energy efficiency. The Russian Railway Corporation has planned to retrofit LED lights in all railway stations across Russia. Even the railway wagons are witnessing the installation of LED lights.Top vendors:• GE Lighting• Cree• LG Innotek• Philips• OSRAM• Panasonic• Schneider ElectricBrowse Related Reports:• Global Solar Home Lighting Market 2016-2020• Global General Lighting Market 2016-2020• Global LED Lighting Market for Horticulture Application 2016-2020Become a Technavio Insights member and access all three of these reports for a fraction of their original cost.

4 Scenarios That Give the World Hope in 2017USNEWS.comJanuary 9, 2017 MondayCopyright 2017 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Best Countries; Vol.; No.Length: 1783 wordsByline: The ConversationHighlight: From the U.S. presidential election to the Syrian civil war, 2016 was an important year for human history.BodyBy Nicolas Tenzer The year 2017 opens on a world laid to waste. Some areas are littered with mass graves. For future historians, 2016 will be seen as a turning point in human history, one of those times when the world teeters on a precipice. Despite the cataclysmic risks of the Cold War, times have not been as dangerous as these since 1945. Freedom and the rule of law are under threat. Now, more than ever, we need principled leaders with an understanding of history. Donald Trump will take office on January 20. His election tips us into the unknown and ushers in a new political era. It comes at a time when            the ultimate aim of Vladimir Putin's            Russia -- our biggest, multifaceted threat -- is to upend the world order. SEE: [2016 By the Numbers]Trump's election also accelerates the downward spiral of democracies, crumbling under the weight of their own demons. Meanwhile, on the international stage, a new reality is taking shape: war is called peace, a bloody victory is a step towards reconciliation, and a terrorist regime is a legitimate power. In this context, the basic principles of democratic life in both Europe and the U.S. -- truth, fact-based reality, justice and the rule of law -- are being gradually            eroded with the help of a foreign power. While it may seem necessary to extrapolate the trends observed over the course of 2016 (and this doesn't take long), the most important thing is to understand what might steer us toward a more secure world order, where respect for the rule of law and for international bodies are granted their proper place. We could go for a somber scenario but there are reasons for hope as well. 1. A new equilibriumAs 2017 begins, Russia is dominating the world order. Throughout 2016, Moscow appeared to set the international relations agenda. First of all in Syria, by imposing a ceasefire designed to lead to a peace agreement(after it had ravaged the country indirectly, then directly). In the Ukraine,            Russian forces are once again on the offensive in Donbas. In Europe, Moscow's ideas are gaining ground and recent            elections have seen the success of several pro-Russian candidates. In Turkey, Moscow managed to bring about the reversal of an alliance. In the United States, it contributed to            the election of its preferred president. And, at the United Nations, it has            consistently hindered the Security Council. But this trend can be reversed in 2017. Upcoming elections in Europe -- particularly in France, maybe            Germany and, outside the EU, Serbia -- could see the defeat of candidates who            are soft on Russia. Russian            cyber-attacks and            pervasive propaganda could have the unintended effect of turning international            opinion against Moscow. New cyberattacks in the United States that would            affect the lives of U.S. citizens could also render Trump's pro-Russian position untenable. 2. China as a moderating influenceIn the South China Sea, Beijing -- which tends to behave rationally and seek long-term consensus -- may decide that the best response to a more aggressive America is moderation. Trump's intention to bury the Trans-Pacific Partnership could            compel China to bolster            its agreements with countries in the region and attempt to appease them in order to dissuade them from turning to the United States or seek closer cooperation with Moscow. While it has been hesitant to take up a fully active role on the international stage, the Chinese government may attempt to assert itself within international organizations, especially the UN, where it has largely let other countries take the lead. Concern in the region regarding this new era in American politics, along with rising doubts about the U.S.'s role as a peacekeeper, provide Beijing with an excellent opportunity. In addition, China still has commercial and financial means (            although more limited) to put pressure on the United States, and a Trump administration may well come to realize that it is not in America's best interest to create lasting conflict with China. All things considered, China is in a unique position to act. 3. Europe resistsEuropean powers may choose to find strength in their union. Brought together by the need to combat those who threaten fundamental European values, Paris, Berlin, Rome and the Benelux countries could launch new initiatives to bring about real European cooperation. Beyond a French-German initiative to reinforce European security, the EU could come together to fight            Russian disinformation aiming to undermine their values. Implementing measures that would go beyond the strictly technical and be backed up by increased resources, leaders would feel the need to better communicate with the general public on the relationship between principles, policies and the current geopolitical threat. In this scenario, Europe would adopt a firmer stance towards countries such as Hungary and            Poland, which are currently set on an illiberal course. In this context, Europe would also maintain, and regularly renew, sanctions against Russia. The European council would appoint a leading candidate to preside over its affairs. Over the course of 2017, several concrete steps would at last be taken towards reinforcing European security, in direct cooperation with NATO, setting aside            questions about the future of the organization. 4. Respite in the Middle EastIn the Middle East, increased tensions between Turkey and Iran regarding Syria, pressure from Europe for the removal of Bashar al-Assad, and renewed concern about Tehran's regional influence the U.S. would lead European countries and the coalition of states fighting the Islamic State in Iraq to regain some measure of control and bring about a political transition in Damascus. This of course would rely on removing Assad from power and installing a transitional government. In the meantime, the U.S. and Europe, witnessing the lack of serious anti-terror action on the part of Russia, would agree to step up the fight against Islamic State, by taking back Raqqa, the so-called capital of Islamic terrorism. This would be a strong symbolic victory. At the same time, the liberation of Mosul and increased pressure from the United States and Europe for a more stable government in Iraq could provide the region with relative stability. Finally, angered by Russian indulgence towards Iran, Ankara could reaffirm its commitment to NATO and water down its repressive internal politics. As for Iran, under pressure from both Europe and the U.S. to withdraw forces from Syria and Iraq, abandoned by Hamas in Palestine and seeking the preservation of its nuclear agreement, it would finally agree to the removal of Assad in exchange for guarantees concerning the representation and protection of the Alawite minority. From resilience to resistanceThese four scenarios are not leaps of faith, nor are they baseless utopias. Their aim is to outline a path to action. For now, the world's democracies have held strong and firm in the face of terrorist attacks -- this is resilience. But some are now preparing for resistance and even            dissidence. If we want any of these scenarios to become a reality, even in part, we must understand the four points below: First of all, internal and external issues are more linked than ever. The fight for the rule of law, human rights, democracy, truth, justice and freedom within nation states is tied to that same combat internationally. This must now be understood, which explains why the way we intend to deal with Russia is so fundamentally important. Next, we need to be guided by historical precedent, while keeping in mind what is unique to each era. It is clear that dark times are once again upon us, and we can see some common patterns emerging, at least from our own subjective perspectives, with what Stefan Zweig described as "The World of Yesterday." Hannah Arendt also wrote about the way in which totalitarian regimes use lies and subvert the concepts of true and false, of            good and evil. Total destruction was used as a military tactic in Aleppo and, on this front, it has rightly been compared to Grozny. However, current modes of information and disinformation are different; the threat to free thought and freedom may be greater than anticipated. The disconnect between the flagrant abominations being committed practically live-to-air and the lack of response also has devastating consequences for our democracies, their credibility and for            common sense. This situation must be examined carefully. We must neither underestimate nor overestimate France's role in world affairs, and we must understand the consequences of a possible change in our country's position. Recently, in New York, the chief economist of a large ratings agency confirmed my fears: he and some of his colleagues believe that France is the main risk factor in Europe in 2017, greater than Brexit and the uncertain situation in Italy. Should France turns toward Russia, two potential dangers may manifest: Europe could withdraw from any intervention in the Ukraine -- despite the fact that the Maidan revolution was fought in the name of European values -- since Germany may no longer be able to defend its stance alone. For the same reason, Europe would also step back from Middle Eastern affairs. This would mean a lasting weakening of Europe's position, because Paris would no longer be willing to support the European project alongside Berlin. This would of course lead to an undermining of the power of the UN Security Council. Finally, the United States -- and all other Western countries -- must face up to the issue of institutional resilience. My recent conversations in Washington revealed this to be the major unknown, and theories varied widely. The role of Congress in moderating the Trump presidency will be the first test of American institutional strength. Both in Europe (especially in the United Kingdom, following the Brexit vote) and across the Atlantic, this question should not be left to parliaments, but to political parties, civil society and the intellectual sphere. Should these institutions find themselves unable to take a stand and act according to global interests and basic values, there is no reason why 2017 should not continue in the same vein as 2016, and the consequences may be irreversible. This article was written by Nicolas Tenzer, chargé d'enseignement international public affairs at Sciences Po -- USPC, for The Conversation on Jan. 6, 2017.

Pill presses for counterfeit drugs seized in record numbersCNN WireMarch 18, 2017 Saturday 1:00 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 845 wordsByline: By Sara Ganim, CNNDateline: (CNN) Body (CNN) --  Machines used to make counterfeit pills are reaching the US border in record numbers.US Customs and Border Protection is seizing pill presses at a rate 19 times higher than in 2011. That's the year the synthetic drug fentanyl exploded in the US drug market, according to the American Association of Poison Control Centers.While the Justice Department's Drug Enforcement Administration deals with a national problem of synthetic fentanyl overdoses, these machines are playing a critical role in getting deadly counterfeit drugs onto American streets."To the naked eye, you can't tell the difference," said John Martin, special agent in charge of the DEA's San Francisco division. "If you have counterfeit pills, you can't make them without pill presses."Counterfeit pills marketed as oxycodone or Xanax but made with fentanyl can be deadly. Fentanyl is 25 to 50 times stronger than heroin and up to 100 times more potent than morphine.The painkiller was once found only in pharmacies but is now manufactured in China in synthetic form and widely available on the American black market. Pill presses -- which can easily be bought online -- allow someone to take powder and press it into a pill that looks legitimate. "People have died from ingesting what they think is a legitimate painkiller, (but really) it's a counterfeit pill that contains fentanyl," Martin said.Across the country, authorities have seen this play out.The death of pop icon Prince may turn out to be one of the most famous cases of counterfeit pills. Police reportedly found mislabeled pills laced with fentanyl in his home, and the drug was found in his system. And with the machines easily available, the demand high and the setup easier than ever, it means the potential profits are huge.Forty-three percent of America's goods from outside the country arrive at the Port of Long Beach, California, according to US Customs and Border Protection. Authorities hold questionable pill press machines while they investigate whether they are coming into the country legally. Most come from China. That's where much of the illegal fentanyl is manufactured, as well. Clandestine Chinese labs manufacture a synthetic version of fentanyl that is easily bought on the dark Web. Mexican drug cartels later began to buy it and resell it across the border.Pill press machines themselves are not illegal, as long as they are properly registered with the DEA before they are shipped. But many of them are not.These devices vary in size from giant industrial electric ones, bigger than refrigerators, to plastic tabletop machines. Some can generate 170,000 pills per minute. CNN got exclusive access to the warehouse where they are kept."With all the overdoses we're seeing, the increase in overdoses in the last couple years, I think these types of interceptions are extremely important," said Cheryl Davies, assistant port director at Los Angeles International Airport. "They have a lot of impact on our communities."Finding the pill presses is difficult. Every 7.8 seconds, a new container is processed at the port. By checking manifests for key words and electronically scanning suspicious containers, customs agents have been able to find and seize dozens of illegally imported presses. Since 2013, there have been more than 80 seized.When they find one that is not properly registered, they alert law enforcement.In 2015, Customs alerted the DEA about one such pill press that arrived from China. The DEA got a warrant to place a GPS tracker inside the shipment and traced it to Gary Resnik, a 32-year-old man. When they searched Resnik's home, agents found six pill presses and nearly 30 pounds of acetyl-fentanyl. The DEA alleges that Resnik and three other men were importing the synthetic opiate, making their own pills and selling them in bulk. Authorities later charged Resnik and others with federal narcotics and money laundering in the Los Angeles area.Martin explained that pill presses have made it easier for drug dealers to make millions of dollars out of their homes, without being affiliated with any kind of big drug cartel.It's cheap and easy to order wholesale fentanyl powder and a pill press online. For $5,000 to $6,000, Martin said, someone could potentially make $10 million worth of fake pills."A kilogram of fentanyl wholesale is about $3,500 to $5,000. The pill press, let's say you buy it for about $1,000 and the die for $100, that's not a huge investment. You get the binding material ... on the dark net, and you can start making these pills," he said. "So there's huge profit to be made on these counterfeit pills."The acting DEA administrator, Chuck Rosenberg, went to China in January to meet with officials about keeping synthetic fentanyl and pill presses from being shipped illegally over to the US. Since then, the Chinese government has banned six variations of synthetic fentanyl, but it continues to make up a large portion of the seizures of synthetic drugs recorded by the DEA.TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

CONTRARIAN THOUGHTS ON RUSSIA AND THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONStates News ServiceJanuary 10, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 2814 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: STANFORD, Calif. BodyThe following information was released by the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace:By Jack Goldsmith"We assess Moscow will apply lessons learned from its campaign aimed at the U.S. presidential election to future influence efforts in the United States," says the U.S. intelligence community in the most important sentence in its dismayingly evidence-free report on Russian activities in the presidential election. But how is the United States going to check these future influence efforts?Simplifying a great deal, when a nation is vulnerable to a foreign threat it has three courses of action to improve its situation: (1) It can raise its defenses; (2) it can credibly threaten greater consequences for the attacker, thereby deterring the attacker from action; or (3) it can cut a deal in which it pledges to forego certain actions in exchange for relief from the threat by the adversary. I think the U.S. government focuses too much on (1) and (2) and not enough on (3).The United States is not close to raising its defenses adequately and likely will not in the foreseeable future. Offense has too great an advantage over defense. We have too many soft targets and are constantly surprised when new ones are attached or exploited. (The government was stupefied by the OPM hack, and the Sony hack, and the DNC hack, among many others.) And we lack the consensus needed to take the controversial steps that would truly raise our cyber defenses.As is evident in the Obama administration's failure to respond to earlier Russian penetration of networks in the White House, Pentagon, and State Department, and in its relatively tepid response to the highly destabilizing DNC hack, deterrence is simply not going to work in this context. The United States has the most powerful military in the world, including the greatest capacities in offensive cyber. But it cannot use these tools to credibly commit to retaliate powerfully against harmful cyber operations, especially ones that fall below the "use of force" or "armed attack" thresholds. Attribution, especially credible attribution in public, is a very large challenge. And the United States significant digital dependencies mean that it loses in escalation in cyber because, as President Obama explained, "our economy is more digitalized and it is more vulnerable, partly because we are a wealthier nation and we are more wired than some of these other countries and we have a more opened society and we are engaged in less control or censorships of over what happens on the internet." It's also clear that the vaunted "name and shame" strategy simply doesn't work in high-stakes contexts. "The idea that somehow public shaming is going to be effective, I think doesn't read the thought process in Russia very well," Obama noted. You don't have to take my word that deterrence isn't going to get the job done; as DNI James Clapper said last week: "We currently cannot put a lot of stock, at least in my mind, in cyber deterrence. ... It is ... very hard to create the substance and psychology of deterrence, in my view."That leaves (3), cutting a deal. I'm not talking about squishy cyber "norms." There is a lot of happy talk about cyber norms, but this talk is almost always about how the United States can force adversaries to agree to the rules of the road that it likes best. I am talking about an agreement of mutual restraint: the United States agrees to restrain itself in its activities in foreign networks in exchange for restraint from our adversaries in our networks. As I wrote six years ago:U.S. cybersecurity policymakers are in the habit of thinking too much about those who attack us and too little about our attacks on others. Creating norms to curb cyberattacks is difficult enough because the attackers' identities are hard to ascertain. But another large hurdle is the federal government's refusal to acknowledge more fully its many offensive cyber activities, or to propose which such activities it might clamp down on in exchange for reciprocal concessions by our adversaries.I have expressed skepticism about treaties as a solution to disorder in the cyber realm, and some of the basis for that skepticism, including attribution difficulties, applies to any form of agreement in this context. But I am increasingly of the view that the only way that the United States can get relief from damaging foreign cyberoperations is to significantly restrain its own cyberactivities abroad.The first step to understanding here, I think, is to try to put oneself in the skin of the adversary, to understand how it sees the world and why it acts the way it does. The United States is angry because of the consequential Russian intervention in the election. But it is important to understand that the United States is widely perceived by Russia to intervene in Russian domestic affairs in ways that are just as offensive and threatening, at least to the leadership in Russia, and just as violative of Russian sovereignty.For example: Putin attributes the embarrassing and destabilizing protests that began in Russia after the December 2011 legislative election to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's charges of voter fraud in the election and the "signal" her State Department sent to opposition leaders in Russia. He also claimed that the United States was responsible for the Panama Papers, which he described as and "attempt to destabilize the internal situation" in Russia. NATO's enlargement to many former Soviet states, especially to the Baltic States in 2004, when Putin was President of Russia, was not an intervention in Russia's domestic affairs per se, but it was an embarrassing and threatening intrusion into Russia's sphere of influence. So too was the extension of missile defense systems to eastern Europe.But perhaps nothing is as threatening as the pledges and activities associated with the U.S. "Internet Freedom" initiative, which (among other things) involves funding and technical support to empower citizens in authoritarian states to circumvent censorship and promote speech there. Russia views this initiative as "a U.S. strategy to intervene in [its] domestic politics through cyber means," as David Fidler notes. To get a sense of the extent to which the Russian (and Chinese) governments are threatened by the core elements of the U.S. Internet Freedom initiative, and (relatedly) of the social media and related tools of the U.S. internet technology industries, consider four of the six "main threats in the field of international information security" listed in the 2015 Russia-PRC Cyber pact (a poor translation, but the gist comes through):The Parties believe that the main threats to international information security are the use of information and communication technologies:1) to carry out acts of aggression aimed at the violation of the sovereignty, security, territorial integrity of States and a threat to international peace, security and strategic stability;2) for the application of economic and other damage, including through the provision of a destructive impact on the objects of the information infrastructure; ...5) to interfere in the internal affairs of States, violations of public order, incitement of ethnic, racial and religious hatred, propaganda of racist and xenophobic ideas and theories that give rise to hatred and discrimination, incitement to violence and instability, as well as to destabilize the internal political and socio-economic situation, violation of government;6) for the dissemination of information harmful to the socio-political and socioeconomic systems, spiritual, moral and cultural environment of other States.In short, China and Russia, among our most potent adversaries, see efforts to weaken their control over their networks as a direct threat to their core sovereign interests. They view it in the same way that we view the intervention in our election.This latter point is surprising to many. A casual consumer of the news in the United States would think that the United States is the main victim in the confrontations going on in the cyber realm. It is indeed a victim. But the United States is also widely perceived around the world as the greatest threat in the cyber realm. It has, as President Obama bragged last Fall, greater offensive cyber capabilities than any other nation. And it is perceived abroad to use these capacities aggressively. Stuxnet, now widely attributed to the United States, is one example. The Snowden revelations were an even bigger deal. They provided clear, extensive, concrete evidence about the numerous impressive (and, to many, shocking) ways that the United States penetrates and collects information in foreign networks. And of course the United States isn't taking all of the information stolen from foreign networks and putting it in a box. It uses the fruits of its espionage and theft to bolster every element of its foreign and defense policy, and its national and economic security.It's also worth noting, in this context, the many episodes in which the United States has intervened in foreign elections. I summarized some of the evidence in posts last summer. A study by Dov Levin found that during the Cold War, the United States intervened to influence foreign elections over twice as often (69% to 31%) as the Soviet Union. In many of these cases the United States "weaponized information" to sway the election. U.S. electoral intervention continued after the Cold War. A prominent example is its support of the populist Boris Yeltsin in the 1996 Russian presidential election. "[W]e've got to go all the way in helping in every other respect" besides a nominating speech, Bill Clinton told Russia advisor Strobe Talbott, who further explained in his memoir that Clinton visited Moscow in April 1996 "for no other purpose than to give Yeltsin a pre-election boost." The Clinton administration gave Yeltsin other forms of political support, and ensured that the IMF gave Russia a $10 billion loan in what the New York Times described as a "major election-year boost for" Yeltsin. Other post-Cold War examples include the U.S. financing of "Syrian political opposition groups and related projects, including a satellite TV channel that beams anti-government programming into the country" (another example of "weaponizing information"); similar activities in the 2000 Yugoslav election, which Levin concludes was "decisive" in defeating Milosevic; and (according to David Ignatius) the aborted U.S. covert action in the Fall of 2004 to influence elections in Iraq.In response to this history, I hear many people say some version of: "But the United States has never doxed another country covertly in the middle of a democratic election." We don't actually know that, but we do know this: The United States has covertly stolen information from foreign political parties, it has weaponized information, and it has influenced foreign elections. Perhaps the United States has not done these three things together, at least on the scale of the Russia operation. But the precise contours of U.S. action abroad do not define lawful or appropriate behavior, such that our adversaries feel compelled to do to us only what we do to them. The main point is that the United States is widely seen to engage in activities in other countries, including Russia, that are analogous to the DNC hack and that are viewed to threaten core sovereign interests abroad.I should be clear, in a probably futile effort deflect charges of Russophilia (or worse), that I am not making a normative judgment here. Obviously there are huge differences in substance between (i) intervening in a foreign nation to disrupt democratic processes and (ii) intervening in a foreign nation to promote democracy and free speech. My normative preferences, for what they are worth, are for the United States to exploit its offensive advantages in cyber to collect whatever information serves our national interests, to use this information in ways that serve our interests, and to promote those interests further by spreading the U.S. conception of freedom of speech and thought to other nations.The question is whether these are realistic goals. I think they are not, given the clear costs that the United States is suffering and will continue to suffer in the cyber realm. I don't think the United States can continue unabated with all of its aggressive cyber actions abroadintelligence collection, cyber attacks, information operations, and especially operations that undermine control abroadif it wants relief from the cyber operations that are proving to be so damaging to U.S. society. Rather, I think the only hope it has to gain relief from these devastating cyber actionsor, at a minimum, a hope worth exploringis to give our adversaries relief from our cyber actions that they perceive to be devastating. I am not talking about a treaty. But I am talking about an explicit understanding with major cyber adversaries, akin to understandings about the rules of espionage during the Cold War, that the United States will not engage in certain specific disruptive actions in exchange for desirable restraint by adversaries in U.S. networks.Cooperation in the cyber realm will not be easy, even on a bilateral basis. There are many hurdles, some of which I outline here in the context of treaties. Attribution will always be a problem. It might not be possible to agree on the precise elements of mutual restraint. And it is possible that a spiraling tit for tat is the only compelling logic here, and that the United States will lose overall due to its digital vulnerabilities. I don't minimize the hurdles. I only want to suggest that the option of mutual restraint should be explored.I don't think that U.S. intelligence collection capabilities per se are at stake. What our authoritarian adversaries really care aboutwhere they are vulnerable in ways analogous to U.S. vulnerabilities in the recent electionare U.S. efforts to use its cyber and related capabilities in ways that are deemed disruptive to their domestic orders, i.e. the very thing the United States is up in arms about now. The most plausible item the United States could offer up in exchange for reciprocal restraint would be the U.S. Internet freedom initiative writ large, including efforts by the United States and U.S. firms to promote certain forms of speech abroad, and to enable circumvention of foreign tools of digital control. It would be a huge cost to the United States to tamp down on those activities, which have been central to its foreign policy during the last two administrations, and which in some ways define traditional U.S. foreign policy. But the costs on the other side are very high as well, and the possibility of some forms of mutual restraint should at least be explored in a serious way.One response to this argument that I hear in conversation is some version of: "The United States should be able to have its cake and eat it too." On this view, the United States is the strongest nation in the world militarily and economically, and should not have to give up any of its cyber and related capabilities in exchange for relief from adversary cyber and related actions. We have to get tougher, act more aggressively, and the like. I am surprised by this reaction because in other contextsmost notably, nuclear weaponsthe United States perceived a clear advantage from giving up offensive capabilities in exchange for the threat reduction of reciprocal concessions. But in any event, the "tough guy" line of thinking is belied by events of the last five years or so, which has made clear that problems of attribution, escalation, and digital vulnerability mean that no matter how powerful we are at the moment, we cannot in fact have our cake and eat it too in this context.There are other hurdles to examining what the United States might give up in exchange for relief from the most damaging adversary cyberoperations. Congress and most of the press and the American people are focused primarily on the wounds the United States has suffered and what it should do offensively in response. Our soon-to-be new President possibly benefited from the Russian intervention and in any event appears to have no interest in examining its causes or effects. Worries about the new president and his commitments, and the politics that surround those worries, are further serious hurdles.And yet I very much hope that the congressional or Executive branch or independent body that studies this problem will try to look deeply in the mirror to see how the United States' own actions abroad have invited and perpetuate the pain we suffered in this election, and will at least consider how we might possibly adjust our foreign policy, in the ways outlined above, in order to get relief from the very serious threat the nation faces.Load-Date: January 11, 2017End of Document

Donald Trump, environmentalist?CNN WireJanuary 26, 2017 Thursday 1:32 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1793 wordsByline: By John D. Sutter, CNNDateline: (CNN) BodyEditor's note: John D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN Opinion who focuses on climate change and social justice. Follow him on Snapchat, Twitter and Facebook or subscribe to his email newsletter.  (CNN) --  President Donald Trump campaigned on the promise of gutting US environmental regulations. On week one of his presidency, it's clear he plans to follow through. Among the moves Trump made by Wednesday evening: The new administration pushed forward the controversial Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines, promoted a return to the dirty fossil-fuel era with a proposed "America First Energy Plan," removed references to climate change from the White House website, proposed massive cuts to climate change programs, and instituted an "unprecedented" media blackout at the Environmental Protection Agency.Is this the work of America's new environmentalist in chief? That's apparently how the President sees it."I'm a very big person when it comes to the environment," Trump told business leaders on Monday. "I've received awards on the environment."To better understand the first claim, I called up a few environmentalists. "You have to laugh," said Tim Donaghy, a senior researcher at Greenpeace USA. "I guess you laugh or you cry." "It's shocking. It's appalling," said Bob Deans, director of strategic engagement at the Natural Resources Defense Council, or NRDC. "We heard him say in front of campaign rallies that climate change is a hoax. It's not a hoax. It's the essential environmental challenge of our time, and it's a threat to our children's future.""Good! I'm glad he is (saying he's an environmentalist), and I look forward to some positive changes," said Jim Brainard, the Republican mayor of Carmel, Indiana, who has worked to curb his city's carbon pollution.He added, "I say that somewhat sarcastically." The environmental movement seems less interested in what Trump is saying than what he's doing. To that end, here are five ways Trump might actually earn the title of 2017 environmentalist. 1. Lead the global transition away from fossil fuelsThere's some inflexible math behind climate change, and one of the most important numbers to know is this: zero. To avoid the most catastrophic effects of global warming -- super droughts, drowned coastal cities, climate refugees, mass extinction in the natural world and stronger storms -- world leaders, as part of the Paris Climate agreement, agreed to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions to zero. And they said we'd do it this century. That basically means no fossil fuels, and drastic changes to the way we use land -- far less tropical deforestation, for instance -- as well as possible technological efforts to pull carbon out of the atmosphere. A zero-carbon energy policy looks nothing like what Trump has proposed. "We must take advantage of the estimated $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil and natural gas reserves, especially those on federal lands that the American people own," the White House's "America First Energy Plan" reads, citing a figure some academics say mischaracterizes the value of the reserves. "The Trump administration is also committed to clean coal technology, and to reviving America's coal industry. ..." Oil, gas and coal are, of course, fossil fuels, with coal being the dirtiest of them. And the world can't burn much more of those if we want to have any reasonable hope of meeting the terms of the Paris Agreement. Only 5% of US coal reserves can be burned by 2050 if we hope to meet that goal, according to an analysis published in 2015 in the journal Nature. (That figure assumes we don't develop technology to capture and store carbon pollution on a large scale. Even if we do, only 8% of US coal can be burned, meaning almost all of it stays in the ground.)"If Trump wants to be an environmentalist, he'd need to say no to dirty fossil fuel projects like Dakota Access and Keystone XL and drive forward a clean energy revolution in this country and around the world," said Jamie Henn, co-founder of the climate advocacy group 350.org. 2. Harness the real job-creator: clean energyTrump is all about jobs. But by focusing attention on bringing back fossil fuel jobs, he's missing an opportunity to create more numerous and lasting jobs in the clean energy sector, according to environmentalists. Strikingly, there are more US jobs in solar energy alone than in either oil-and-gas extraction or coal mining, according to a 2016 report from the International Renewable Energy Agency, or IRENA. "Jobs in the solar industry grew 12 times as fast as overall job creation in the US economy," the report says. The country's 209,000 solar industry jobs in 2015 outnumber those in oil and gas extraction -- 187,200 -- and coal mining -- 67,929. The group estimates renewable energy industries employed 769,000 in the United States in 2015. Comparing jobs numbers across industries can be somewhat difficult. There are farther-reaching estimates for the total number of clean-energy or "green" jobs in the United States, for instance. But it's clear to environmentalists that clean-energy researchers, wind farm technicians and solar panel manufacturers will outlast fossil fuel jobs."If jobs and energy independence are really what this administration cares about, wind, solar and other renewable energy resources are the future," said Doug Hayes, staff attorney for the Sierra Club.3. Take some pointers from -- China? The world's two biggest annual climate polluters -- the United States and China -- pushed forward the Paris Agreement on climate. But as the United States seems interested in "anchoring our future in the dirty fuels of the past," said Deans, from the NRDC, China is emerging as the political and technological leader on climate change. "The world has looked to the United States for climate and energy leadership," Deans said. "If we're going to go backward" in the United States, then "that leadership is going to come from, likely, China."Climate and energy news has looked quite different in China in recent weeks than in the United States. China has canceled the construction of more than 100 planned coal-fired power plants. The country plans to introduce a nationwide carbon market this year -- which is the sort of policy tool that, along with carbon taxes, many economists see as a holy grail for climate regulation. And China announced it will invest about $360 billion on renewable energy projects by 2020. "Today, we are facing climate change, and we know this is caused by our use of energy," Nur Bekri, China's energy minister, said this month, according to The New York Times. "That is why the Chinese government attaches great importance to the development of clean energy.""The Paris Agreement is a hard-won achievement which is in keeping with the underlying trend of global development," China President Xi Jinping, said in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. "All signatories should stick to it instead of walking away from it as this is a responsibility we must assume for future generations."Trump has threatened to pull the United States out of that process. Even if he doesn't, some environmentalists fear he will work to undermine the Paris Agreement's goal of a carbon neutral world. "Withdrawing the US from the Paris Agreement would be bad for the environment," said Sam Adams, US director of the World Resources Institute, a nonprofit that focuses on policy and research. "There would be collateral costs to the United States standing against the world. ... Other nations, like China, have just in the last days been stepping up -- announcing new investments in their own domestic climate action and clean energy sectors."4. Recognize the costs of coal and carbon Trump is a business guy, but environmentalists -- and environmental economists -- say he fails to understand the expensive consequences of burning fossil fuels and allowing climate change to run amok. (For the record: 97% of climate scientists agree the world is warming and humans are to blame because of pollution. Humanity's role in climate change is not up for scientific debate, despite what Trump and some of his Cabinet picks say.)There are two points environmentalists have been making here: First is that coal, in particular, is a dirty, deadly fuel. The Clean Air Task force, a nonprofit dedicated to improving air quality, estimated in 2010 that pollution from coal power plants contributes to 13,200 premature deaths, 9,700 hospitalizations and more than 20,000 heart attacks in the United States per year. The World Health Organization says outdoor air pollution is linked to 3 million deaths per year worldwide. Coal, along with gasoline and other fossil fuel pollution, contribute significantly.Second is that the costs of doing nothing about climate change are significant."Within the next 15 years, higher sea levels combined with storm surge will likely increase the average annual cost of coastal storms along the Eastern Seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico by $2 billion to $3.5 billion," found a 2014 report from the Risky Business Project, led by Michael Bloomberg, Henry Paulson and Tom Steyer. "Adding in potential changes in hurricane activity, the likely increase in average annual losses grows to up to $7.3 billion, bringing the total annual price tag for hurricanes and other coastal storms to $35 billion."5. Make US infrastructure climate-friendlyFinally, both US political parties are talking about infrastructure. But what does that infrastructure look like? It matters to environmentalists, who want to see infrastructure spending include energy-saving projects like public transportation, bus routes, bike lanes, building weatherization and updates to the smart electricity grid to support renewable energy development. What we build now has consequences for years, if not decades, into the future. And environmentalists want to see the United States position itself to use less dirty fossil fuel energy, to boost its efficiency and to create clean-energy jobs. "For more than a century -- back to Teddy Roosevelt -- the idea of leaving our children a livable world has been a bipartisan goal," said Deans, from NRDC. "It's an American value. It's only recently, since 2010, I would say, that we have seen one party doing everything it can to unwind generations of bipartisan progress." "What Donald Trump could do," he added, "would be to build on that legacy of bipartisan stewardship and not try to tear it apart."Environmentalists aren't holding their breath for for that to happen.They're planning ways to push back.Including an April 29 march on Washington organized by the People's Climate Movement. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

VICE MINISTER LI MEETS BULGARIAN DEPUTY MINISTERSStates News ServiceJanuary 10, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 538 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China:Vice Minister Li Meng of the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology met with Ivan Dimov, Deputy Minister of the Bulgarian Ministry of Education and Science and Lyuben Petrov, Deputy Minister of Economy in Sofia, the Capital of Bulgaria on November 24th, 2016. Both sides exchanged views and reached consensus on deepening cooperation in scientific and technological innovation.When meeting Deputy Minister Dimov, Li briefed on the Chinas Innovation-driven development strategy, especially the development of the innovation system and practices to drive economic growth in China with science and technology. He said that since the Chinese and Bulgarian governments signed an agreement on scientific and technological cooperation in 1955, the two sides have engaged in close exchanges in agriculture, ICT and medical science. With further implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative, China and Bulgaria have new opportunities of further cooperation. Li suggested that the two sides should further strengthen top-level design, expand people-to-people exchanges and pragmatic project cooperation, actively develop long-term cooperation platforms, so as to push forward bilateral cooperation. Deputy Minister Dimov fully agreed and said that while the European Union is Bulgarias main partner for international cooperation in science and technology at present, the Bulgarian side nevertheless directs great attention to the development of science and technology in China and is eager to expand exchanges and cooperation with the Chinese side, especially in the fields of aerospace, climate change and big data.When meeting Deputy Minister Petrov, Vice Minister Li Meng said that Bulgaria is Chinas traditional partner of science and technology cooperation in Central and Eastern Europe. Given specific needs in both countries, the two sides should expand their cooperation to innovation. He introduced Chinas innovation-driven development strategy and corresponding measures to facilitate innovative development. Li suggested that the two sides should support youth innovation and entrepreneurship, promote technological cooperation between enterprises and establish industrial cooperation platforms, and work together to push forward the transfer and translation of RandD results to serve economic development in both countries. Deputy Minister Petrov agreed. He said that the meeting was the first vice ministerial-level meeting between the Bulgarian Ministry of Economy and the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology, and thus his Ministry highlighted its importance. He noted that the Bulgarian side is willing to work with the Chinese side and expand bilateral cooperation in scientific and technological innovation so as to boost investment and trade volume. Geographically speaking, Bulgaria is in a strategic position connecting with Europe and enjoys fast economic growth and advantages of human resources. He hoped that the two sides could expand their cooperation in innovation and entrepreneurship and that the Bulgarian side welcomes Chinese high-tech companies and their investment in Bulgaria.Load-Date: January 15, 2017End of Document

What Will The New Year Bring For The Casino Industry?Benzinga.comJanuary 3, 2017 Tuesday 7:22 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Accretive Capital LLC d/b/a Benzinga All Rights ReservedLength: 549 wordsByline: Wayne DugganBodyThe year-end gaming revenue numbers from the Macau, China, and Las Vegas markets indicate that the gaming industry finished the year strong in the two largest and most critical markets in the world for investors. However, now that 2017 is officially here, gaming investors are wondering whether that 2016 momentum will spill over into the New Year.The U.S. MarketFor Las Vegas-focused stocks such as Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE: BYD), Caesars Entertainment Corp (NASDAQ: CZR) and Red Rock Resorts Inc (NASDAQ: RRR), the key issue in 2017 will be whether or not the U.S. economy remains on track under President-elect Donald Trump. Vegas  slow-but-steady recovery since the financial crisis has mostly mirrored the slow-but-steady recovery in the U.S. economy under President Barack Obama. Trump has pledged to be a superstar for U.S. business by rewarding companies with domestic focus and dramatically slashing corporate tax rates. If he can accomplish those goals while maintaining solid U.S. GDP numbers, there s no reason to think 2017 won t be a good year for U.S. casino investors.The Macau MarketThe Macau market is much more of a wildcard for investors, with huge upside and a long list of risks. Most analysts seem to think that the Macau industry is a long-term opportunity for players MGM Resorts International (NYSE: MGM), Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE: LVS), Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ: WYNN) and Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd (ADR) (NASDAQ: MPEL). We view the Macau gaming industry as a secular growth story led by the accelerating paradigm shift from VIP to Mass driven by supply and infrastructure improvement,  Bernstein analyst Vitaly Umansky said earlier this month.Land and Buildings pointed out that only about 1.5 percent of China s population currently visits Macau compared to a 10 percent U.S. penetration rate for Las Vegas. Those numbers suggest a major long-term growth opportunity in Macau.The least predictable element of the Macau story is the Chinese government. The government s 2014 corruption crackdown in Macau was the underlying cause of the economy s two-year recession that finally ended in Q4. However, the government offered yet another reminder of its role in Macau in December when it cut the limits on single ATM card transactions in Macau by 50 percent.A New FrontierFinally, the biggest 2017 news story when it comes to the gaming industry may be which companies make a move in Japan and how big of a bet they will place on the massive new gaming market there. Japan finally legalized casino gambling in December, opening the door for international operators to capitalize on a potentially $30 billion opening. It will likely be years before any Japan resorts open, but the major players will certainly not want to waste any time getting up and running as soon as possible. Investors should look for definitive Japan plans from all or most of the major Macau players sometime in early 2017.Disclosure: The author is long MPEL.Latest Ratings for MPELDateFirmActionFromToDec 2016Aegis CapitalInitiates Coverage OnBuyNov 2016Credit SuisseUpgradesNeutralOutperformSep 2016Deutsche BankUpgradesHoldBuyView More Analyst Ratings for MPEL           View the Latest Analyst Ratings© 2017 Benzinga.com.

There Is One Thing the Davos Elite Should Really Worry AboutRealMoneyJanuary 13, 2017 Friday 9:00 AM EDTCopyright 2017 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 627 wordsByline: Antonia OpritaHighlight: The way businesses will respond to intensifying political pressure from populist voices stands to shape the future.BodyNext week, the best and the brightest in the business world will converge on the Swiss mountain resort of Davos for the annual World Economic Forum. The event is now more than 40 years old -- four decades of promoting globalization and open markets.This year, it certainly will feel different for the 3,000 participants. The business world, usually relaxed about political events in Western democracies, is increasingly under threat from populist voices. And the future of businesses will depend on their ability to resist this pressure.For the moment, it doesn't look like they are doing such a good job. Just think about Apple's   to remove a New York Times app from its app store in China, saying that it breached local regulations, but without specifying what those regulations are. (Apple is part of Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS charitable trust.)The New York Times, the websites of which the Chinese government started blocking in 2012 after the publisher ran some articles exposing the wealth of the family of then-Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, has asked Apple to reconsider its decision and reinstate the app.In another example, at the beginning of the year a tweet by President-Elect Donald Trump telling General Motors to produce cars in the U.S. or face a big border tax was followed by an announcement from rival Ford that it would not go ahead with plans to open a plant in Mexico. (Ford is part of the            Dividend Stock Advisor portfolio.)It looks like the announcement had been planned before Trump's tweet, but the fact that Mark Fields, Ford president and CEO, said the company's decision was partly motivated by a "vote of confidence" in Trump's policies highlights the influence a tough political stance can have.Over in Europe, consider Deloitte's decision to punish itself by refraining from bidding for public contracts for half a year to obtain the government's forgiveness for a report where it criticized its approach to Brexit. The report said 30,000 more civil servants would need to be hired to cope with the complexity of the negotiations and that there were "divisions" in the government over the Brexit strategy.In emerging Europe, Hungary for years has been increasingly hostile to some businesses, starting with bank-bashing after the financial crisis. Most recently, a senior member of the Fidesz party of increasingly autocratic Prime Minister Viktor Orban said nonprofit organizations sponsored by billionaire hedge fund manager George Soros should be "swept out of the country." In 2014, Orban proudly declared he wanted to turn Hungary into an "  ".These are just a few of the most prominent examples. In emerging markets and increasingly in the developed economies as well, companies and investors are coming under increased political pressure. More and more, it looks like they must take political sides, sometimes perhaps against their will.Their capacity to deal with this rising pressure could make the difference between the survival of democracy in the world and a global descent into fragmented, oppressive and high-handed regimes with arbitrary rules.Short-term interest might dictate that businesses yield to pressure. After all, shareholders want to see estimate-beating earnings each quarter, and these cannot be achieved by standing up to demands by big governments, which in retaliation might shun your company to favor a rival.But over the long term, yielding to political pressure would be a disaster. Companies and investors that for the sake of short-term gains facilitate the rise of autocratic regimes will find themselves deprived of their wealth. After all, in a dictatorship nobody makes money, apart from the dictator's own clique. Perhaps that is something that those gathering in Davos should discuss.Load-Date: January 14, 2017End of Document

ENERGY POLICY: Trump admin is urged to help struggling nuclear giantGreenwireMarch 27, 2017 MondayCopyright 2017 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLCSection: Top Stories; Vol. 10; No. 9Length: 725 wordsBodyKristi Swartz and Hannah Northey, E&E reportersA former U.S. Navy commander is calling on the Trump administration to quickly intervene in the pending bankruptcy of nuclear giant Westinghouse Electric Co. LLC in the name of national security. Kirk Lippold, whose vessel was bombed by terrorists in the Middle East, called on Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a letter today to urge the Japanese government to prop up Toshiba Corp. and its Westinghouse subsidiary, which is building two nuclear projects in the United States. A crumbling Toshiba has significant implications for U.S.-Japanese relations, Lippold wrote. What's more, the United States should not let Westinghouse and its proprietary nuclear reactor technology be sold to countries that do not have the same economic and security goals as the United States, he said. Lippold specifically mentioned China, saying such a scenario would pose "significant risks" to the United States. "The prospect of Westinghouse intellectual property falling into the hands of the Chinese government should give significant pause to the U.S. government, which must make every effort to prevent such a scenario," Lippold wrote. Toshiba revealed it must take at least a $6.3 billion write-down because of its nuclear construction business. The Japanese-based conglomerate has made it clear it can only strengthen itself financially if it sells a majority stake in Westinghouse or if the company files for bankruptcy. Toshiba Corp wants its U.S. nuclear unit to file for Chapter 11 protection from creditors as early as tomorrow, according to an article in Reuters, citing a source with direct knowledge of the matter. Toshiba said it is not appropriate to comment at this time. "Whether or not Westinghouse files for Chapter 11 [bankruptcy] is ultimately a decision for its board, and must take into account the various interests of all of its stakeholders, including Toshiba and its creditors," Toshiba said in a prepared statement.Multiple media reports signal that Westinghouse's board could meet as early as tomorrow. Toshiba's annual shareholders meeting is scheduled for Thursday. Westinghouse is the main contractor building reactors for Southern Co. in Georgia and Scana Corp. in South Carolina. The companies would be the main creditors in a Westinghouse Chapter 11 filing. Officials from Southern's Georgia Power Co. and Scana's South Carolina Electric & Gas Co. say they continue to monitor the situation and are prepared for any outcome. Lippold said Tillerson should consider that the United States' modern nuclear industry is at a pivotal point. Finishing the reactors "in a timely manner" is critical for the nation's energy security and independence, he said. "The company should be held to a higher standard due to the nature of the business it operates," Lippold said. Lippold was commander of the USS Cole when it was bombed by al-Qaida terrorists in Yemen in 2000, killing 17 U.S. sailors. He has warned House and Senate leaders about security risks associated with oil exports and petroleum reserves (E&E News PM, Dec. 22, 2015). Lippold's letter arrives as the Trump administration's position on nuclear continues to firm. The White House has voiced its support for the industry and in its fiscal 2018 budget blueprint proposed providing $120 million for the stalled Yucca Mountain nuclear waste project in Nevada. Nuclear power is also slated to be featured centrally in an executive order President Trump is expected to sign tomorrow to scrap the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan. The order, according to Bloomberg, is slated to include language that would call on federal agencies to identify any actions that could burden the production or use of domestic energy resources, including nuclear power. The agencies would then be required to suspend, revise or rescind the policies unless they are legally mandated, are necessary for the public interest or promote development, according to Bloomberg. But the White House has also signaled its intention to curb federal programs the industry currently relies upon, namely the Department of Energy's loan guarantee program. The program, which would see its demise under Trump's budget proposal, has supported new construction in Georgia and could be critical for small modular reactor construction in Idaho (E&E Daily, March 24).Load-Date: April 24, 2017End of Document

Surgical Navigation Software Market - Drivers and Forecast by TechnavioBusiness WireMarch 17, 2017 Friday 5:03 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business EditorsLength: 971 wordsDateline: LONDON BodyTechnavio analysts forecast the            global surgical navigation software market to grow at a CAGR of over 7% during the forecast period, according to their latest report.This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170317005349/en/Technavio has published a new report on the global surgical navigation software market from 2017-2021. (Graphic: Business Wire)The research study covers the present scenario and growth prospects of the global surgical navigation software market for 2017-2021. Technavio presents a detailed picture of the market by way of study, synthesis, and summation of data from multiple sources. The analysts have presented the various facets of the market with a particular focus on identifying the key industry influencers.The surgical navigation software has been technologically upgraded many times. Technological advances and highly specialized features of the software allow surgeons to perform surgeries with high precision. With technological advances, vendors are anticipated to produce more advanced, risk-free surgical navigation software that supports computer-assisted MIS. This will boost the global surgical navigation software market.Request a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=57085Technavio's sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more.Technavio ICT analysts highlight the following three factors that are contributing to the growth of the global surgical navigation software market:Increased investments on ambulatory surgery centersMany surgeons have started practicing surgeries using the surgical navigation systems, especially for spinal, ENT, and orthopedic disorders. This trend is expected to continue during the forecast period and many complicated surgeries will be converted to MIS with the help of these surgical navigation systems. These factors have driven the market growth for the surgical navigation software.Ishmeet Kaur, a lead enterprise application research analyst at Technavio, says, "Insurance companies provide high reimbursements for outpatient settings compared with hospital stays. This will also encourage surgeons to adopt computer-assisted navigation surgeries for the treatment of many disorders in an outpatient facility."Fall of the hospital conglomerateBefore 2010, large hospitals developed research machines, while medium-sized hospitals merged to form conglomerates, and smaller hospitals struggled through various economic consequences. Large centers had advanced research infrastructure for capital-intensive surgical procedures. Since 2010, with the emergence of MIS practices, physicians and surgeons are gradually moving to start their own specialty practices and surgical centers by buying small hospitals, getting rid of unprofitable emergency rooms, and focusing on high skill and efficient procedures."Many hospitals have bi-weekly newsletters, interactive websites for patients, and media departments. Some advertise their use of MIS technologies, ranging from robotic surgery to surgical navigation systems, and seek to be the early adopters of new procedures. This will drive the market growth of surgical navigation software," adds Ishmeet.Increased government support for surgical navigation systemsThe governments of many regions, such as the US and China, support the adoption of surgical navigation systems and it has increased since 2012. As of 2016, there were more than 2,000 surgical robots and navigation systems in the US. FDA has requested surgeons to get used to the new computer and robotic-assisted surgeries by accepting the fact that they can no longer physically touch the operation site under the new procedure paradigm. The Chinese government is also encouraging every province to install at least one of these machines.Top vendors:• Brainlab• Medtronic• StrykerBrowse Related Reports:• Global Surgical Microscope Market 2017-2021• Global Surgical Navigation Systems Market 2016-2020• Global Surgical Power Tools Market 2016-2020Become a Technavio Insights member and access all three of these reports for a fraction of their original cost.

IFR-Survey: Deployment of Robots Soars 70 Percent in AsiaBusiness WireFebruary 1, 2017 Wednesday 7:17 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business Editors; Technology Writers; Manufacturing WritersLength: 410 wordsDateline: FRANKFURT, Germany BodyAsian industry's uptake of industrial robots is accelerating: in just five years its operational stock rose 70 percent to 887,400 units,(2010-2015). In 2015 alone, annual sales of robots jumped 19 percentto 160,600 units, setting a new record for the fourth consecutive year. These are results of the World Robotics Report 2016, published by the International Federation of Robotics (IFR).China is the biggest market for industrial robots in the world and takes 43 percent of all sales to Asia including Australia and New Zealand. It is followed by the Republic of Korea, with a share of 24 percent of regional sales, and Japan with 22 percent. That means 89 percent of robots sold in Asia and Australia went to these three countries in 2015.China will remain the main driver of growth in the region and will expand its dominance.By 2019, almost 40 percent of the global supply will be installed in China. Continued growth in robot installations is predicted for all major Asian robot markets.Electronics industry overtakes automotive sectorThe main driver of the latest growth in Asia was the electrical and electronics industry. Sales for this segment jumped 41 percent in 2015 to 56,200 units. This compares to 54,500 units in the automotive industry which is just a 4 percent rise. Within only a five year period, shipments of industrial robots to the electrical and electronics industry have more than doubled.The manufacturing industry - still by far the number one by volume - recorded an annual growth of 25 percent to 149,500 units in 2015.With regards to robotics density, the current leader is South Korea, with 531robot units per 10,000 employees, followed by Singapore (398 units) and Japan (305 units). These Asian countries rank in the top 10 most advanced industries. Worldwide, the average robot density is 69 robot units per 10,000 employees."China will continue to be a strong future market for the robotics industry. Part of this trend is driven by the Chinese government´s 2025 initiative to support automation. The country aims to become a leader in automation globally," says Joe Gemma, President of the International Federation of Robotics.Video statement: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPk1o8jMOBQAbout IFRThe International Federation of Robotics: www.ifr.orgView source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170131006522/en/CONTACT: econNEWSnetworkCarsten Heer, +49 (0) 40 822 44 284redaktion@econ-news.dehttp://www.businesswire.comLoad-Date: February 2, 2017End of Document

Workers refuse to rage against the machine; Some employees embrace automation, and keep their jobsUSA TODAYFebruary 6, 2017 MondayFA CHASE EDITIONCopyright 2017 Gannett Company, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1ALength: 2208 wordsByline: Nathan Bomey, @NathanBomey, USA TODAYBodyThe patter of  machinery fills the air inside wire-basket manufacturer Marlin Steel's bustling factory in a rugged industrial section of this city.Maxi Cifarelli, 25, of Baltimore, peers through safety goggles at a flat screen, her left knee bent and heel resting on her chair.Two years after earning a fine-arts degree from Towson University with a specialty in interdisciplinary object design, she now spends her work days working with a personality-free machine with a name to match: a computer numerical control, or CNC, router.With automation poised to sweep through the economy, some fear that it will kill more jobs than it creates.But Cifarelli's experience is the opposite. She befriended automation instead of fighting it, and she has a job because of it."I haven't named it," she says, peering over at the robotic machinery. "I should name it."Cifarelli is one of 33 employees at Marlin Steel, which has undergone a transformation. Employees used to make wire baskets by hand. Now automation has taken over. High-tech machines do most of the work -- and the plant needs workers willing to adapt their skills to survive in a rapidly changing economy.Automation has allowed Marlin Steel to thrive, but across the country, workers feel threatened. Donald Trump catapulted into the White House by giving voice to those fears and promising to save American factories and jobs by rewriting trade deals, taxing imports and cutting regulations.Futurists have warned for years that automation will take your job. Now it's happening, albeit in pockets, at manufacturers, warehouses and even some labor-intensive white-collar professions.As the political debate rages over how to inject fresh energy into the American economy with Trump taking office, automation presents perhaps the greatest threat to the American economy.But it may also reflect its greatest opportunity if workers take the Cifarelli route and embrace robotics, artificial intelligence and automation. Either way, it's poised to accelerate -- and if not here, then in foreign countries that will reap the benefits while the U.S. economy suffers a competitive disadvantage.About 49% of worker activities can be turned over to some sort of machine or robot, increasingly helped along by artificial-intelligence software, according to consultancy McKinsey.About 58% of CEOs plan to cut jobs over the next five years because of robotics, while 16% say they plan to hire more people because of robotics, according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers survey.As artificial-intelligence programs proliferate, automation won't be confined to the factory floor. Positions that involve a substantial amount of predictable work, such as data processing, could succumb to automated software and artificial intelligence.McKinsey counted more than 70  professions in which at least 90% of activities can be automated,  from mail clerks to ophthalmic lab technicians, tire-repairers, butchers, food preparers and bakers.But many Americans don't think they need to adapt: 80% of them say their job definitely or probably will exist in its current form in 50 years, according to the Pew Research Center."We often think about automation as applying to front-line, low-wage, low-skill activities and jobs -- and what we've discovered is there are some activities that are high-wage, high-skill that are actually very susceptible to automation," says Michael Chui, a McKinsey Global Institute partner in San Francisco who studies automation.  "Almost every job in the economy has a significant percentage of activities that can be automated."The professional service robot industry expects to sell a third more units from 2016 through 2019 -- 333,200 in all -- than it sold in the past 17 years, says the International Federation of Robotics. They could be used in place of professionals, whether it's medicine, agriculture, hospitality or even the supermarket down the street.Consider:Restaurant workers. In fast-food, San Francisco-based Momentum Machines already makes a hamburger-flipping robot. Several chains are gradually introducing self-ordering stations.Shelf stockers. In stores, San Francisco-based Bossa Nova Robotics has developed a robot that is checking shelf inventory in a test at Lowe's, the home-improvement chain.Journalists. Automated Insights has created a software suite called WordSmith that writes thousands of automated stories every month, including Minor League Baseball game accounts and earnings reports for the Associated Press, basketball game recaps for Yahoo! Sports and financial content for dozens of other clients.Bookkeepers. Accountants -- perceived as having steady 9-to-5 jobs with an average salary of $67,190 in 2015, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- are poised for a total makeover. About one in five people in the finance and insurance sector primarily perform data processing -- and about 85% of that work can be automated, McKinsey estimates."The basic gist of it is the more certainty your job entails, the more likely is to be automated out," says Mary (Missy) Cummings, a Duke University professor and director of the Humans and Autonomy Lab.In other words, the more predictable your daily routine is, the more likely your job is to go away.It's already happening. Walmart announced plans in September to cut 7,000 bookkeeping and store accounting positions as it automates cash management and centralizes the process at its headquarters.In accounting, nimble firms will transition their focus to advising clients based on insights gleaned from automated data. Audits may go from an annual process to a continuous action. Software will increasingly handle the "high-volume, routine, non-judgmental" activities in real time, says Bill Brennan, audit transformation leader for PricewaterhouseCoopers.PwC is now hiring employees for its auditing business with backgrounds in science, technology and engineering."We need those individuals to help us as we get into data analysis, analytics, data security, cloud computing. The future employee is going to have a combination of those skills," Brennan says.Cifarelli knows. At Marlin Steel, her college-level education pays off in production work. Pecking periodically at a computer mouse, she delivers detailed instructions, programming the machine to carve small canyons in wood to hold wire that is later welded together with automated equipment to make precision wire baskets, accurate to within 2/1000ths of an inch.She has bonded with her CNC, which she has come to think of as a robot companion."I need the robot to ensure consistency," Cifarelli says. "Over the past year, I've become really accustomed to the sounds and the movements of it. I can really predict what's gonna happen. We're kind of a team."For Marlin Steel, the problem was straightforward: Automate or die. In the early 2000s, factory workers at the 48-year-old company were forming the big metal baskets typically seen in bagel shops by hand-bending wire at a rate of 300 bends per hour in a grueling manual process for producing for wire baskets that typically hold bagels."They all had huge right arms," Marlin Steel CEO and owner Drew Greenblatt says.When emerging overseas competitors swooped in and undercut the company on labor costs, producing baskets for less than $6 each to Marlin's $12, sales cratered."Our entire business model blew up and we were hemorrhaging," Greenblatt says. "China was exporting baskets into Manhattan for cheaper than I could buy the steel."To fight back, the company purchased robotic wire-forming machines and other automated equipment to manufacture precision wire baskets and other metal products for customers that required a higher-quality product, such as Boeing, General Motors, Harley-Davidson and Disney.Because of automation, Marlin Steel nearly doubled its workforce over the past decade to 33 employees and boosted pay from minimum wage when Greenblatt acquired the company to at least $15 an hour today, with some employees making more than $30."It's only viable because my employees are like on steroids," Greenblatt says. "All of a sudden they're super-productive, and it's because we've given them the tools -- it's robotics and automation. Thank God for robots. If it wasn't for robots, these guys would be unemployed."Foreign competitionMarlin Steel may have been ahead of its time.Industrial robots have hit an inflection point -- powered by cost reductions and technological improvements in visioning, sensing and gripping -- and are poised to accelerate. Although they perform only 10% of tasks in manufacturing today, they will perform 25% by 2025, according to a study by Boston Consulting Group.In one tangible sign of increased automation, those technological improvements have ushered in the dawn of the "collaborative robot," unleashing automation from protective cages and placing the machinery right next to humans, with sensors protecting the worker and ensuring efficiency. Barclays analysts estimate that global sales of  "cobots" will balloon from 4,100 units and $120 million in 2015 to 701,000 and $12 billion in 2025.And it's happening globally. China, for example, is not wasting any time. Amid all the political consternation over  suspected currency manipulation and global trade advantages, China is expected to double its installation of industrial robots from 75,000 in 2015 to 150,000 in 2018, nearly four times the rate of North America, according to the International Federation of Robotics.Trump has  pledged to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., even suggesting that Apple's iPhone could be made here and exhorting Apple CEO Tim Cook to do so. But that might not be possible without massive automation to make it cost-effective to manufacture in the U.S.Apple's iPhone manufacturer, Foxconn, in fact, has already begun automating certain work that was  done before by hand. A Chinese government official told a Hong Kong newspaper in May that Foxconn had replaced 60,000 workers with robots at one factory there.As automation advances, globalization will enter a new chapter in which low-cost labor becomes increasingly irrelevant. Unlike humans, robots don't get paid an hourly wage.So it's not much more expensive to operate a machine in a developed economy than it is in the developing world."The fastest growing robotics user in the world is China because they understand that they want a lot of this manufacturing based on low-cost labor, but that's not the whole game," says Jeff Burnstein, president of the Association for Advancing Automation. "The game now more than ever is quality, speed and flexibility -- and low-cost labor alone is not gonna do it."Automation is a double-edged sword, though. Take the example of family-owned Ramsey, Minn.-based injection molder Dynamic Group.The company recently boosted its production by 400% after installing robotic arms made by Universal Robots.Automation bolstered the company's capability to produce lower-volume, highly complex products that would otherwise not be profitable because the company could not afford to hire workers to craft and manufacture devices with limited commercial appeal."It's really hard to be able to be competitive nation- and worldwide coming from this market and having to do that type of labor," says Joe McGillivray, CEO of Dynamic Group, whose father co-founded the company in 1977. "We're able to do more work, which will allow us to make more money and pay you better."Still, the downsides of automation are impossible to ignore. As advanced manufacturing companies adopt more automation, many workers won't be needed.McGillivray said that by installing robots, Dynamic Group expects to reduce its reliance on temporary workers. In the past, the company had occasionally hired up to 20 temp workers to aid its permanent staff of 106 workers."We would instead be using robots as our flex labor instead of people as our flex labor," he says.Artificial intelligenceIf automation evokes imagery of robots replacing humans, then its close relative, artificial intelligence, conjures fears of computers taking dominion over humans.But those fears, while perhaps not unfounded in the distant future, fail to reflect AI's emerging role as an assistant to people in the workplace.At Boston-based start-up Lola, two executives who were almost single-handedly responsible for replacing travel agents with computers -- that is, one of automation's most obvious examples of displacement -- are reviving the travel agent through artificial intelligence.The 50-person company has developed an AI-based system -- which basically just means groups of software algorithms -- to aid human travel agents in making recommendations to travelers, booking accommodations and addressing itinerary hiccups.The AI can crawl through a user's email inbox, for example, to identify travel preferences and scheduling quirks. Those insights are translated into intelligence that the travel agents use to improve their customer's experience.For Lola Chairman Barney Harford, former CEO of travel booking site Orbitz and former executive at Expedia, it's a sharp turn from his previous life ushering in the age of do-it-yourself travel."We are bringing humans back into the picture." Graphic photo Jasper Colt, USA TODAYLoad-Date: February 6, 2017End of Document

3 Reasons Apple Is a Better Dividend Stock Than QualcommThe Daily Cardinal: University of Wisconsin - MadisonMarch 27, 2017 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 831 wordsBody"asset-content" data-asset-uuid="2e55623b-936d-51e2-a132-6a9d1373c6d6">One of the great strengths of dividend investing is its simplicity. Simply pick a basket of shares from the best dividend-paying companies in the world and let time do the rest.However, successfully executing this strategy requires more than just finding and buying high-yielding stocks. Case in point: Semiconductor giantQualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) currently yields an impressive 3.6% -- well above theS&P 500's 1.9% yield -- but tech giantApple (NASDAQ: AAPL), with its 1.6% yield, is easily the better dividend stock to own today. Here are three reasons why.1. Apple's cash hoardApple has a war chest of cash roughly the size of the Chilean economy -- $246 billion and growing. This massive cash pile lets the Mac maker continue to fund its massive capital-return program, while still leaving plenty of room to invest in strategic growth initiatives.About $230 billion of Apple's cash and investments are held in overseas accounts so the company can avoid paying stringent repatriation taxes. Instead, Apple borrows against its cash hoard at low interest rates to fund the bulk of its capital return. This strategy could change in light of the corporate tax reform taking shape on Capitol Hill, but even if it doesn't, Apple could continue to grow its dividend payments using its current tactic for years into the future.That may not be the case for Qualcomm. More on that in a moment.Image source: Getty Images.2. Apple's continued earnings growthApple's current capital return potential alone makes it a better dividend stock. When considering the earnings bonanza Apple is likely to experience from the coming iPhone 8, the outlook for continued dividend growth only strengthens.Numbers from research analysts atBank of Montreal indicate that Apple's total iPhone installed base of 715 million consists of 487 million new iPhones and 228 million used ones. According to the bank's analysis, an impressive 31% of those new iPhones, around 151 million, will be two years old or more at Apple's typical iPhone launch date in mid-September. That calculation implies that Apple's installed iPhone base is primed for another sales "super cycle," in which a large number of iPhone owners upgrade to a new form factor. Apple hasn't meaningfully updated the phone's look since the iPhone 6 in 2014, and with rumors of a complete overhaul for the 10th-anniversary edition,  it seems safe to expect a dramatic earnings surge for Apple, which will, in turn, provide Apple more dry powder that it can deploy in the form of even more dividends and stock buybacks.3. Qualcomm's legal woesFinally, while the future appears bright for Apple, the same can't be said for Qualcomm. After successfully (and expensively) navigating its legal headaches over patent payment collections in China, Qualcomm was recently hit by a wave of lawsuits that place further strain on the chipmaker's profit-center segment.Late last year, the South Korean government fined Qualcomm $853 million on largely the same antitrust grounds the Chinese government used to penalize Qualcomm $975 million in early 2015.  The U.S. Department of Justice filed a similar antitrust suit against the chipmaker in January. Then Apple sued Qualcomm for $1 billion on the same day the DOJ suit was made public. If all that weren't enough, the company also faces an ongoing probe from the EU that could result in additional fines. Qualcomm has said it plans to defend itself in each case, but the sheer weight of this legal tsunami calls into question whether Qualcomm's patent licensing business will need to dramatically overhaul its financial structure. Having to do so would be most damaging to Qualcomm, which receives roughly two-thirds of its pre-tax profits from its patent licensing segment.Keep up with money news, sent to your inboxSign Up!

Counterfeiters, hackers cost US up to $600 billion a yearAssociated Press InternationalFebruary 27, 2017 Monday 5:03 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 239 wordsByline: By PAUL WISEMAN, AP Economics WriterDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - Counterfeit goods, software piracy and the theft of trade secrets cost the American economy as much as $600 billion a year, a private watchdog says.In a report out Monday, the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property says the annual losses range from about $225 billion to $600 billion. The theft of trade secrets alone costs the United States between $180 billion and $540 billion annually. Counterfeit goods cost the United States $29 billion to $41 billion annual; pirated software costs an additional $18 billion a year.The findings echo those of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which in 2015 pegged the annual cost of economic espionage by computer hacking at $400 billion.The commission labels China the world's No. 1 culprit. Including Hong Kong, China accounts for 87 percent of counterfeit goods seized entering the United States. The report says the Chinese government encourages intellectual property theft.The commission is led by former Republican presidential candidate and Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, who also served as U.S. ambassador to China, and Adm. Dennis Blair, a former director of U.S. national intelligence."The vast, illicit transfer of American innovation is one of the most significant economic issues impacting U.S. competitiveness that the nation has not fully addressed," Huntsman said. "It looks to be, must be, a top priority of the new administration."Load-Date: February 28, 2017End of Document

Strong Growth Predicted for Asia Data Center Market; BroadGroup's Datacloud Asia, Singapore, 23rd February 2017 debates enterprise infrastructure opportunities in the regionBusiness WireFebruary 19, 2017 Sunday 11:00 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business Editors; Technology EditorsLength: 709 wordsDateline: LONDON & SINGAPORE BodyBroadGroup, the international event company suggests in new research that the market in Asia continues to expand with growth in capacity and power availability across all countries over the next three years, included in the study. In countries such as Malaysia, growth could be as high as 36%. Outsourcing to third party data centers by companies local to the region is also expected to be sustained. The firm also points to Industry estimates which suggest that around 70 hyperscale data centers are planned for deployment in Asia over the next 3 years."2017 will herald large-scale Internet of Things deployments, and the need for new edge computing strategies," commented Philip Low, chairman of BroadGroup. "Asia has the opportunity to build on increased IT deployment by local and international enterprises making it incredibly timely to bring the first ever Datacloud event here to debate the drivers and challenges now afforded in the region."Omer M. Wilson, Senior Director of Marketing, APAC at Digital Realty Data Centres added: "The Asia Pacific region is at the forefront of the digital economy. Many of the markets here are mobile-first which require companies to have a robust IT infrastructure in order to cope with the substantial consumer demand. Naturally, the need for data centres is surging. We see a significant opportunity for colocation to close the gap and meet this demand, especially in locations such as China, Hong Kong, Singapore and India where it is critical for them to have effective and efficient ways of running large data centre operations. We expect Asia to continue registering high growth in the colocation market as companies from across the region (and also those entering from other parts of the world) look to agile and flexible data centre solutions that can help them scale up and enable their digital transformations."Commenting on the China opportunity, Wing-Dar Ker, President of Shanghai Blue Cloud Technologies Co., Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of 21Vianet Group, Inc said: "Internet companies in China are investing billions into their own cloud businesses in coming years, seeking to take advantage of a market with 680 million internet users. Cloud computing is a strategic priority for the Chinese government, which has piloted cloud schemes in a number of cities, will only drive the growth of data centers further."Continued Ker, "The average growth rate of data centers in the next two years is expected to be 35% or above and market demand for cloud computing and internet services combined with a willingness to invest will drive infrastructure build-up in the next few years."On provision for the continuing momentum of the Asia data center market, Charles Lee, Founder and CEO of OneAsia commented: "This large wave of growth will definitely request a substantial amount of connectivity for service providers as well as promote network virtualization and software defined networks. The demand for interconnecting or peering between service providers will increase. In view of this, OneAsia is also expanding its data center and connectivity footprints in the Greater Shanghai Area.""As the Cloud revolution continues and innovation becomes even more rapid and breath-taking, there will be a rising tide in data center requirements, especially in the emerging markets. Networked data centers and cloud orchestrators will be the big winners in this revolution," concluded Bill Barney, CEO Reliance Communications and Global Cloud Xchange.( http://www.datacloudasia.com/ ) - Datacloud is the foremost networking and business deal making forum brand for data center and cloud players, their customers, investors and suppliers and offers unique networking opportunities in addition to many facilitated 1-2-1 meetings taking place throughout the event.The event taking place at the Capella Hotel, Sentosa Island in Singapore is also host to a new annual Awards for Asia in an evening ceremony that will be compered by a well-known television personality.
