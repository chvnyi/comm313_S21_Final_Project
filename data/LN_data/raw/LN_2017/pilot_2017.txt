Global Eagle Receives vSTC for Airconnect Global Satellite Connectivity System on Boeing 737NG Aircraft in China; Chinese Government provides GEE with first approval on Boeing 737NG platform in China; Gives GEE access to over 40% of passenger aircraft operated by China-based airlinesGlobeNewswireMarch 1, 2017 Wednesday 5:00 AM PTCopyright 2017 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: PRODUCT / SERVICES ANNOUNCEMENTLength: 1037 wordsBodyLOS ANGELES, March  01, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global Eagle Entertainment Inc. (GEE) (Nasdaq:ENT) ("GEE," "Global Eagle" or the "Company"), a worldwide provider of end-to-end connectivity and media to the airline, maritime and remote mobility markets, today announced that it received a vendor Supplemental Type Certificate (vSTC) from the Civil Aviation Administration of China ("CAAC") to install GEE's Airconnect Global Satellite Connectivity System on Boeing 737 Next Generation ("B737NG") aircraft in China. The Airconnect product is GEE's satellite-based broadband internet connectivity system.GEE is the first major aircraft satellite connectivity service provider to receive CAAC approval on the Boeing 737 platform, representing a critical milestone for aviation connectivity development in China. GEE has pursued a long-term growth program in China, including the following: establishment of a Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise (WFOE) and GEE's China Technology Center; local engineering and software development teams; innovative and new revenue generating services that meet local regulations; partnerships with Chinese media and advertising firms; and establishment of multiple teleports with leading Chinese telecommunications partners.The B737 is the backbone of Chinese air networks, with over 1,000 Chinese-registered B737 in service and an additional 500 on order. Today, the B737 accounts for more than 40 percent of all passenger aircraft operated by airlines based in China. In 2016, GEE received CAAC approval for Boeing 777 installations and commenced an inflight connectivity and entertainment commercial trial under license from the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. With this new CAAC-approved 737NG vSTC, GEE is able to expand to fleet operations with all Chinese B777 and B737NG operators.  CAAC approval also facilitates installations of GEE's Airconnect product on HNA Group's Hainan Airlines and Yangtze Airlines as part of GEE's joint venture with Beijing Shareco, once that JV launches."Approval of Airconnect for installation on B737NG's represents a critical milestone for GEE's expansion in the rapidly growing China market," said Joshua Marks, Executive Vice President of Aviation at GEE. "B737NGs are the most popular aircraft operated by Chinese passenger airlines. With the approval of our Airconnect satellite-based connectivity system, GEE is well-positioned to accelerate access to its high quality in-flight connectivity across the Chinese market by supporting the 737 in both retrofit and linefit configurations.""We are thrilled about the new opportunities for GEE to work closely with our Chinese partners to provide passengers with superior IFEC solutions," said Jeff Leddy, Chief Executive Officer of GEE. "GEE is also pursuing vSTC authority for Airbus 320s, which account for an additional 30% of the Chinese commercial aviation market. These CAAC approvals enable us to act quickly in the Chinese market and accelerate our product deployments in the region."GEE's Airconnect system transforms the flying experience with broadband connectivity, available live streaming of Chinese-language television stations, video-on-demand with Hollywood and Chinese content, games, advertiser-sponsored content, destination guides and moving maps. GEE's Airconnect product is the first in China to offer full-cabin television streaming and joint advertising.About Global Eagle Entertainment (GEE) Global Eagle Entertainment Inc.

In the next section, we give a country-level analysis of national supercomputing strategies and programs, for the U.S., China, and other significant countries. In the closing section we give our analysis, conclusions, and recommendations.While the U.S. still leads by far in the most straightforward market share metrics of production (vendors, supply-side) and consumption (buyers, demand-side), industry indicators show the U.S. is falling behind in the leading edge of advancement. Chinese leadership has apparently recognized the relationship between HPC and economic growth and has set forth on a program to drive the country into a leadership position.The best response to this new challenge is to continue if not increase national support for HPC at all levels. National supercomputing efforts are essential to motivating investment at the high end. From that point, U.S. companies excel at seizing opportunities to drive markets forward. Against these strengths, the top limitations to Exascale deployments are software and skills. If we do build a system, how will we use it? A key feature of the Exascale Computing Program is its emphasis on co- design, finding end-user stakeholders to collaborate on the design of next-generation supercomputing technologies, bolstered by government funding. We recommend:- National initiatives in low-level software tools and programming models, together with stakeholders in industry and academia. - Government-funded partnerships between industry and academia. - Ongoing pursuit of next-generation technologies.Regardless of these recommendations, the HPC market will continue, powering new innovations and ideas around the world. Supercomputers today are close to a million times more powerful now than they were 20 years ago. In another 20 years, they could be a million times more powerful still. The leaders in supercomputing will be the ones that do not rest on their achievements, but rather continue to chase the next challenge over each new horizon.STATE OF THE HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING INDUSTRYHigh performance computing (HPC) is the use of computational servers and supercomputers, together with their attendant storage, networking, and software components, for the modeling and simulation of complex phenomena. As such, HPC is a critical segment of the information technology (IT) sector, powering innovation and scientific discovery in a wide range of disciplines across industry, public-sector research, and national defense. From clusters of a few servers to the world`s largest supercomputers, HPC enables the exploration of new frontiers in science and engineering, by complementing or even replacing physical testing and experimentation that otherwise may be expensive, time consuming, or even impossible.The Importance of HPCFor centuries, scientific method has been based on the two pillars of theory and experimentation. Today there are many who call out computational modeling and simulation as a third fundamental pillar of science, as more discoveries are made possible by HPC. As such, HPC is linked inextricably to scientific research, yes, but also to industries such as manufacturing, oil exploration, pharmaceuticals, chemical engineering, and finance, as well as to national defense, homeland security, and cybersecurity.HPC in ResearchThe largest supercomputers in the world are concentrated in government and academic research centers, addressing ``grand challenge problems`` such as predicting the path of a hurricane, modeling the spread of cancer in the body, or simulating the neural pathways of a human brain. But it is not only in these world-renowned supercomputing centers that discovery takes place. Researchers at almost any center of higher learning will leverage HPC in some dimension, be it astrophysics, biochemistry, geology, or archeology, whether on their own lab systems or by accessing resources available via public cloud computing.HPC in IndustryAlthough the public perception of supercomputing is predominantly linked to public-sector research, more than half of HPC spending worldwide comes from commercial organizations. Scientific innovation begets advancements in engineering and technology, and industrial organizations seek competitive advantage from investment in computing. Some of the top industries that leverage HPC are:- Manufacturing: Digital product simulation allows manufacturing companies to design, test, and modify virtual products in a computer environment without the time and expense of building and testing physical prototypes. At a large scale, this applies to car manufacturers conducting virtual crash tests of automobiles and airplane manufacturers modeling the aerodynamics and noise of wind over a wing. At a smaller scale, increasing numbers of consumer products manufacturers are deploying HPC for any number of household products-for example, designing a bottle such that it uses less plastic yet is still less likely to break if dropped from table height.- Energy: Oil and gas exploration companies use HPC to model the earth`s crust from seismic readings. Doing so lets them find the underground, prehistoric lakes and riverbeds they can extract oil from today. As oil and gas are extracted, the companies continue to run simulations to maximize yield. HPC has even helped oil companies return to fields they had previously abandoned, armed with new technology and new information. Oil companies tend to use some of the largest, most powerful supercomputers in the commercial sector.- Pharmaceuticals: Drug discovery is an expensive R&D proposition. For every 100 targets, pharma companies hope one will prove viable to come to market. HPC helps those companies ``fail faster,`` eliminating losing designs earlier in the process, so that more time and effort is spent on the most promising candidates. It was HPC that enabled the burgeoning field of genomics, and HPC has applications across computational chemistry, molecular modeling, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD), bioengineering, and biostatistics.- Chemical engineering: Countless new products and innovations begin with the introduction of new plastics and polymers. Chemical engineering companies use HPC in their manufacturing process, for example, by using modeling to optimize their mix tanks for improved yield. In the future, HPC may be increasingly used in the design of these chemicals as well, similar to how HPC is used in other industries.- Electronics design: As semiconductor designs continue to shrink, it becomes perpetually more costly and difficult to design and test them. Semiconductor companies use HPC for electronic design automation (EDA) of their chips, reducing costs and improving yields.- Finance: HPC has revolutionized how the finance industry works. Banks use large HPC clusters for econometric simulations, running new products through millions of potential worldwide economic situations before selling them to the public. In addition to risk management, financial services companies deploy HPC for high- frequency trading, pricing, and a wide range of analytics applications, such as fraud detection. In all, finance is one of the largest consumers of HPC technology in industry (just behind manufacturing, if large product manufacturing and consumer product manufacturing are combined), and also one of the fastest growing.HPC in DefenseWith how intrinsic HPC is to the advancement of scientific research and industry, it is no surprise that HPC is also critical to national security. For starters, advancements in industry and research can have direct translation to military efforts, for example, in the manufacture of a new helicopter or the availability of an ultra-local weather forecast supporting an operation. Many supercomputing endeavors may be classified when it comes to military and defense issues, but there nevertheless several categories of applications we can be sure of:- Combat simulations: One of the most straightforward ways in which supercomputing is deployed for national defense is in combat simulations, ranging from ``person-in-the-loop`` models like flight and tank simulators to large-scale wargames. (The 1983 movie WarGames was based on exactly this concept.)- Nuclear stockpile stewardship: HPC allows the maintenance of a nuclear stockpile without the need for nuclear testing. Nuclear explosions can be simulated using supercomputing technologies.- Defense and response simulations: In addition to simulating combat, HPC can be used to simulate defensive responses to possible attacks, modeling for example, how to respond to an attack on the electrical grid or the release of a chemical agent in a metropolitan area. (Theoretically, these simulations could also be used offensively, not just defensively.)- Intelligence and security: HPC is used in the gathering and analysis of data streams that can provide evidence of planned attacks or point toward an enemy`s weaknesses. Information analysis can also be used to make borders safer, including linking the analytics with emerging advancements such as facial recognition.- Cybersecurity and cyberattack: Cybersecurity is an issue that affects companies and private citizens, but at the government level, it is a matter of national security. HPC is now being used in some cases to model defensive responses to cyberattacks. That said, this is an instance in which HPC is used offensively more frequently than defensively, and at larger scale. Supercomputing can be used to break passwords, to hack into systems, and to analyze any information that is acquired.What Is an HPC System?: Eras of InnovationLike in the industries fueled by HPC, there is a rapid pace of change in HPC itself. The very nature of HPC is that there is always a harder problem to solve. Simulations take on grander scale and more realism. Models get built with higher fidelity and more degrees of freedom. Until one day we reach the end of science and declare there is nothing left to be discovered or invented, there will be a need for a more powerful computer to enable insight and innovation.When we examine the HPC industry, we consider what constitutes HPC at the low end of the market. At a minimum, we consider scientific and engineering tasks that can be run in parallel over at least two ``nodes``: otherwise independent elements that are being used in concert to address the task. Technical computing extends down to applications that can be run on individual PCs or workstations, but we consider this to be below the threshold of the HPC market.As the HPC market has grown and spread, the systems themselves have gone through transformations in architecture. The ongoing evolution in how an HPC system is built has continually changed the dynamics of the industry in terms of who has access to HPC systems, how difficult they are to use, and how much they cost.While innovation in HPC is continuous, a long-view history of the industry can segment development into distinct eras:- Specialized design (technologically contained / architecturally distinct): Originally, supercomputers were relatively self- contained devices. A single technology vendor would design all the pertinent hardware and software components to build a scalable system, including processing units, networks, and operating systems. These designs were inherently custom to each specific vendor, and there were only a few companies that made them, such as CDC, Cray, IBM, and NEC. Over time, enterprise computing engendered an evolution in which server technology- using RISC processors and variations of the UNIX operating system, from companies such as IBM, HP, Sun Microsystems, Silicon Graphics, and Digital Equipment Corp.-could be scaled up for HPC. These components and operating environments were more familiar to more users, but the systems were still unique to their specific vendors.- Commodity clusters (technologically disaggregated / architecturally identical): In the 1990s, some HPC users- including major supercomputing centers-began constructing HPC systems as ``clusters`` of lower-cost, industry-standard servers, connected over an Ethernet network. This allowed users to build systems to any size while getting components from any vendor using x86-architecture processors from Intel or AMD, running versions of the open-source Linux operating system. (Linux is still the dominant operating system for HPC.) However, because the clusters were in fact comprised of distinct components, existing software modules had to be rewritten for the new architecture. Many people argued that the cluster model was less efficient and harder to program for, but after 10 years, clusters had become the dominant paradigm for building HPC systems. Over time, many enhancements became available (such as 64-bit processors, blade form factors, or faster networks), but the cluster architecture and its accompanying software model remained.- Specialized elements (technologically disaggregated / architecturally distinct): Today we are seeing the HPC industry in the early stages of another architecture transitioni, the seeds of which were sown about 10 years ago, in a pair of parallel developments. For one, microprocessor speeds (measured in GigaHertz, GHz) plateaued, and microprocessor companies like Intel and AMD focused instead on putting multiple processing ``cores`` onto a single chip. For systems that serve multiple applications, each of which only requires a fraction of a core (as in a typical PC environment), this makes little difference, but for an HPC application that already must span multiple processors, the change required a new level of optimization in software. Simultaneously, other processing options began to come to the fore, including increasing interest in various types of ``accelerators,`` additional processing elements that can be added to a system in order to boost the performance of certain functions. The biggest push in acceleration came from NVIDIA, a gaming company that found a market for its graphics processing unit (GPU) products in accelerating HPC applications.With these and multiple other developments, there are now myriad options for building HPC systems out of specialized processing elements. And while this sounds promising in terms of providing options, it also presents a tremendous challenge in determining (a) which architectural components will best suit a given problem and (b) how to rewrite software in order to run most efficiently. Furthermore, applications have varying requirements. As a result, 88% of HPC users now say they expect to support multiple architectures over the next few years, attempting to align application workloads to the elements that best suit them.ii This is important in that we are now at another crossroads in the HPC industry, at which HPC-using organizations must revisit how software components must be built to take advantage of new technology developments, against a backdrop of uncertainty as to which technologies will win out in the market. As we move into the new generation of supercomputing, there could be significant change in where leadership in the industry comes from.Measuring SupercomputingThe most common metric of supercomputing performance is ``flops,`` short for floating-point operations per second.iii (In computer parlance, a floating-point operation is one with an arbitrary number of decimal places, such as ``2.4 x 1.624 = 3.8976``; this is in contrast to integer-only operations.) As with other computer terms like ``bytes,`` flops are usually expressed with a numerical prefix: ``100 Megaflops`` means 100 million calculations per second.Of course, the HPC industry is well beyond Megaflops. At the uppermost echelon of supercomputing, we have also transcended Gigaflops (billions of calculations per second) and Teraflops (trillions), into the range of Petaflops (quadrillions, or millions of billions). Currently, the top supercomputer in the world, measured by theoretical peak performance, is the Sunway TaihuLightiv at the National Supercomputing Center in Wuxi, China, with a peak of 125 Petaflops-a mere factor of eight short of the next prefix marker, Exaflops (quintillions, which can be thought of as billion-billions or million-million-millions). In the previous paragraph, ``theoretical peak`` is worthy of emphasis, because actual delivered performance will fall somewhere short of this mark, depending on the software application and its programming. For this reason, it is common to look at benchmarked supercomputing performance for specific applications.The TOP500 List vThe semi-annual TOP500 list is a ranking of the top 500 supercomputers in the world according to the LINPACK benchmarkvi, a straightforward exercise of solving a dense matrix of equations. On this benchmark, the Sunway TaihuLight is still top, with a delivered performance of 93 Petaflops, or about 74% of its theoretical peak. The second-ranked system is also in China, the Tienhe-2 (or ``Milky Way 2``) system at the National Supercomputer Center in Guangzhou, with a delivered LINPACK benchmark performance of 34 Petaflops, against a theoretical peak of 55 Petaflops (62% efficient).The next three systems on the current list (published November 2016) are all in the U.S., at labs run by the Department of Energy: ``Titan`` at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 18 Petaflops LINPACK, 27 Petaflops theoretical peak (65% efficient); ``Sequoia`` at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, 17 Petaflops LINPACK, 20 Petaflops theoretical peak (85% efficient); and ``Cori`` at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, 14 Petaflops LINPACK, 28 Petaflops peak (50% efficient).The next five systems in the current ranking include two in Japan, one in Switzerland, and two more in the U.S. The rest of the top 25 also include systems in the U.K., Italy, Germany, Saudi Arabia, and France. Among the rest of the top 100, there are systems in South Korea, Poland, Russia, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, Australia, and the Netherlands.The TOP500 list is frequently used as a proxy for the state of the HPC market, but this has several drawbacks. First, a system need not be represented on the TOP500 list. Because running the LINPACK benchmark itself requires the dedication of time, expertise, and resources, inclusion on the list is usually driven by a desire to be recognized. Many commercial organizations decline to participate in TOP500 ranking. (The top-ranked commercial system on the current list is at #16, a 5 Petaflops (LINPACK) system owned by Total Exploration Production, an oil exploration company in France.) Even in the public sector, there are several systems not listed; perhaps most notable among these is the Blue Waters supercomputer at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois, which may in fact be the most powerful supercomputer at an academic site in the U.S.Participation in TOP500 is also often driven by a campaign of inclusion, particularly by system vendors who wish to claim a strong position for marketing benefits. Not only may vendors encourage their customers to participate, but the submission rules also allow systems to be included by proxy: If the LINPACK benchmark is run and verified on one system, then it can be assumed to run at least as well on any system of the same configuration with at least as many processing elements. Some of these submissions` locations are identified only generally by industry, such as ``Government`` or ``Automotive.`` This is more common in the lower tiers of the list, where the systems are not as distinctive.In 2016, the proportion of systems on the TOP500 list based in China suddenly expanded. This does not mean that China suddenly discovered supercomputing, but rather, that (in a sense) China suddenly discovered the TOP500 list, and that there was a somewhat nationalistic desire for its systems to be counted. The TOP500 list is also often criticized because the LINPACK benchmark used for the ranking is not representative of general mixed supercomputing workloads. In fact, it is a relatively straightforward benchmark. To use an athletic metaphor, it measures sprints, not decathlons, and it certainly does not extend to also include crossword puzzles and a talent contest. As such, the benchmark taxes the computing elements of a system far more than others, such as the memory, the network, the data storage, or (quite pointedly) the programmability.One might own a supercomputer that in its time excels at LINPACK and little else. These are often derided as ``stunt`` machines, good for PR value but not for science. However, it is important to acknowledge that we have heard this debate before. When clustered architectures became the new supercomputing paradigm, there was little software available to run on them, and programmability was viewed as a major hurdle. The first machine to achieve a Teraflop on LINPACK was the ASCI Red cluster, first installed in 1996 at Sandia National Laboratories, as part of the Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative (ASCI) under the DOE`s National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). Although ASCI Red did run its intended applications in nuclear stockpile stewardship quite well, it became a touchstone of debate in the supercomputing community, in that it was not at the time viewed to be a ``general purpose`` system for scientific discovery. In the years that followed, clusters came to dominate on LINPACK and the TOP500 list, but it took years of effort to get many scientific applications to use clusters efficiently. For some applications, non-clustered (single system) supercomputers are still preferred today.A final criticism of the TOP500 list is that it is not representative of the HPC market as a whole, which is far broader than 500 (mostly public-sector) systems at the top end of the market. A thorough industry analysis looks quite different than an analysis of the TOP500 list, in many segmentations.Nevertheless, the TOP500 list is a useful tool, and the best one available for ranking individual supercomputing systems at the top of the market. It provides a starting point with interesting data, and it helps to prod investment. But careful, thoughtful, thorough analysis of the supercomputing market must go beyond the TOP500 list and the LINPACK benchmark.Current HPC Market DynamicsIn 2016, the total worldwide HPC industry was a $30.1 billion marketvii, including all product and services categories, such as servers, storage, software, networking, services, and even HPC conducted over public cloud resources. This figure does not include internally budgeted items, such as power consumption or personnel costs, which can also be considered as part of a total HPC budget for an organization.Of this $30.1 billion, the largest component is servers, which include all types of HPC systems. At $11.1 billion in revenue, servers comprise 37% of the HPC market. The next largest components are software ($5.8 billion, 19.4%) and storage ($5.2 billion, 17.3%). Although networking appears as a relatively small component ($2.5 billion, 8.2%), it is important to realize that system networking is most often included with an HPC cluster, and therefore is absorbed into the cost of servers.Figure 1: Total Worldwide HPC Market, 2010-2020, ($000)viii 2010- 2015 actuals, 2016-2020 Forecast HPC in the CloudCloud computing ($774 million in 2016, 2.6%) is a small portion of the HPC market. Here we refer to money spent by HPC end users to run their applications on a public cloud resource (such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, or SoftLayer). We are not counting the entire infrastructure owned by cloud service providers as part of HPC; for a discussion of that market, see ``The Hyperscale Market,`` below.The utility computing model-renting infrastructure and paying for it on an as-used basis-has been part of the HPC market for decades, but always as a very small component. Cloud computing has made this easier, and many organizations are choosing to outsource large portions of their enterprise infrastructures to cloud providers. Indeed, beginning in 2014, we began to see an uptick in the usage of cloud for HPC, and we project a high growth rate throughout our forecast period.However, cloud will continue to be a small part of the total HPC market. Cloud computing makes the most economic sense for those who need to fully utilize a resource for a short amount of time, much like renting a car or taking a taxi. Those who need to use the resource all the time often find it more economical to buy it than to rent it.Within HPC, public cloud resources are most often used by academic researchers, who may be able to utilize cloud in burst for their projects or dissertations. In industry, the most significant usage currently comes from pharmaceutical companies, some of whom are reducing their internal HPC footprints and using cloud resources for occasional peak workloads.Public cloud resources do make HPC more accessible to a wider community. However, the vast majority of serious HPC users will continue to own on-premise systems.Sunway TaihuLight and Other ``In-House`` SystemsAs noted above, the Sunway TaihuLight system is currently the most powerful supercomputer in the world, according all available public metrics. Despite this fact, it is difficult to include in HPC industry models by revenue, because the system was built, not bought.The Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer at Wuxi is the product of a Chinese national initiative to build a supercomputer from emerging domestic technologies. Little information is publicly available, but a total budget of $300 million was announced. If we took that figure as a portion of the 2016 HPC market, it would represent 1% of total spending. However, this would be misleading. Most of this money was spent on manpower to design technologies. The personnel costs of system vendors aren`t considered to be market spending, and this is also the case for this system at Wuxi. Only a minority of the $300 million was spent on components from established technology vendors. (For example, some silicon parts were purchased from networking company Mellanox, but the National Supercomputer Center says it designed its own system network based on these parts.) The true retail value of this system is therefore unknown and is not part of the revenue reporting.At a smaller scale, any organization might build an ``in-house`` system. To the extent that components (such as servers or networking gear) are bought from established vendors, this revenue is accounted for in the market model. But if an HPC system is truly invented or assembled from materials lying about, there is no revenue to be tracked.HPC Market SegmentationsAs described above, HPC systems range from small clusters of only a few nodes to the world`s largest supercomputers, with use cases spanning industry, academia, and government worldwide. Here are most of the most pertinent top-level market segmentations.Although the world`s two most powerful supercomputers are in China, and China also has more systems on the TOP500 list than any other country, there is in fact five times more HPC usage (by revenue) in the U.S. Even if we added $1 billion (all in one year) to the Chinese HPC market to represent an arbitrary high value for Sunway TaihuLight, the overall picture would not be much different.The reason for this is twofold. First, China has done a remarkable job at a national level of painting a picture of a stronger market, versus no such organized effort in the U.S. to make the market seem larger. Second, and more importantly, the U.S. has a much more robust breadth of HPC usage across multiple industries. Compared to the U.S., China is still a relatively poor country, and there is less penetration of HPC through multiple markets.That said, it does leave the opportunity for ongoing strong growth in HPC in China. Furthermore, China`s investments in new supercomputing architectures, using domestic technologies, should not be discounted, particularly in light of the architectural shift now in play in the HPC industry.Key Technology Component VendorsAs discussed above, HPC environments tend to be technologically disaggregated. That is, the key components of an environment often come from multiple different sources. The following are some of the key vendors from across the HPC landscape.- Servers:Worldwide, the overall market share leader in HPC server revenue is Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). HPE recently acquired SGI, a onetime big name in HPC that still retained a small but loyal following and some unique technology. Dell EMC is not far behind HPE in market share. IBM used to be the biggest vendor, until it sold off its Intel-based server lines to Lenovo. IBM still retains some share with its systems based on IBM POWER processors. Cray (which specializes in the high-end supercomputer segment) and Penguin Computing are also noteworthy U.S.-based vendors. While Lenovo is based in China, it is a worldwide brand and now a tier-one vendor for HPC servers. Although it sells predominantly in China, Inspur also has significant share. Huawei has recently emerged as an up-and-coming brand. Supermicro sells some systems under its own brand, and many more through OEM partnerships. Atos/Bull is also a serious supercomputing provider based in France, as is Fujitsu in Japan.- Processing elements: Intel is the giant among the processor vendors. Over 90% of the HPC market is built on Intel-based servers. IBM retains some share with its POWER processors, and AMD is still a competitor as well. However, other elements besides the main microprocessor are now at play, with various types of accelerators and co-processors. The most significant of these are graphics processing units (GPUs) from NVIDIA. Another category of co-processors is field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Here Intel is also a player, thanks to its acquisition of Altera. Xilinx is the most notable competitor. Another alternative that has become a touchpoint of research is ARM processors, the comparatively lightweight, lower-power processing components common to mobile devices such as iPhones and iPads. Companies such as Cavium, Qualcomm, and AppliedMicro have come out with commercial, 64-bit ARM varieties, and several supercomputing initiatives have been based on the concept. ARM offers open licensing, allowing multiple vendors and research centers to design around the processors. Fujitsu has announced its intentions to use ARM processors in its ``Post-K`` Exascale systemsxii, and China has its own efforts to design 64-bit ARM processors domestically. ARM Holdings, a U.K.-based company, was acquired by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank in 2016. Many other companies provide unique solutions. To reduce the reliance on outside technology, the Chinese government has invested in the development of its own domestic processing technologies.- Networking: Over the past ten years, the dominant high-end system interconnect option has been a technology called InfiniBand, which is now offered almost exclusively by Mellanox, a high-performance networking specialist with dual headquarters in the U.S. and Israel. Intel has the ability to sell InfiniBand (based on its previous technology acquisition from QLogic), but Intel primarily is pushing its own high-end interconnect, OmniPath, which is relatively new to the market. Though it has no intentional HPC strategy, Cisco sells enough Ethernet solutions to be counted among the market leaders. Some of the supercomputing vendors, such as Cray, Bull, and Fujitsu, also have their own custom networking elements to support their large systems.- Storage: Storage in HPC has no dominant vendor. Dell EMC has the greatest share, followed by NetApp. Other significant players include Seagate, Hitachi Data Systems, HPE, and IBM, along with HPC niche specialists DDN and Panasas. It is worth mentioning that while this testimony focuses primarily on computational elements, for many applications and workloads, the configuration of high-performance storage for scalable data management can be the more significant investment.The Hyperscale MarketNot included in these HPC market models are the ``hyperscale`` infrastructures at large internet application and cloud providers. This includes companies such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, AT&T, Apple, eBay, Baidu, Tencent, and Alibaba. These companies do operate at scale, and they do consume a certain amount of high-performance technologies.Beginning in 2007, Intersect360 Research maintained ``ultrascale internet`` as a segment of the HPC market. But by 2014, it was evident that what became better known as ``hyperscale`` had grown and evolved into its own segment, with distinct dynamics from the HPC market. We define hyperscale as arbitrarily scalable, web- facing application infrastructures that are distinct from general enterprise IT. In the top tier of the market, there are eight companies that spend over $1 billion per year on hyperscale infrastructure. There are dozens that spend at least $100 million per year, and hundreds more that spend over $1 million. In all, the hyperscale market represented $35 billion of the enterprise IT market in 2016, concentrated into the high-end providers. This is separate from the $30 billion HPC market.The hyperscale market is significant to this discussion for several reasons. First, it provides a second, high-growth IT segment for the consumption of high-performance components. This is a powerful attractant for technology providers. Selling to just one of these top-tier hyperscale companies can mean tremendous success. Second, techniques and technologies from the hyperscale market can migrate into HPC, whether they are innovations in hardware, in software, or in the facilities management challenges of operating large systems at scale. And third, the hyperscale market has been the epicenter of development for the rapidly developing field of artificial intelligence (AI), fueled by new capabilities in the domain of ``machine learning.`` (See section on Artificial Intelligence in ``Looking Forward,`` below.)Despite all these similarities, there are key criteria that make hyperscale different from HPC. The most important has to do with function. In serving up internet applications (whether in search, social media, content streaming, retail, or any other hyperscale domain), hyperscale infrastructures are designed to handle large numbers of small jobs. By contrast, HPC infrastructures are designed to handle comparatively small numbers of larger jobs. As such, most hyperscale infrastructures would be poor fits for HPC workloads. The difference is subtly implied in the names: In hyperscale, the greater emphasis is on scale; in High Performance Computing, the greater emphasis is on performance.Big Data and AnalyticsAnother key proximity area to HPC has been the field of big data and analytics. Big data created a new category of enterprise IT applications that has some of the same characteristics of HPC applications. Analytics seeks out answers in data, with metrics like time to insight that measure the effectiveness of big data programs. As such, metrics of performance become important criteria in evaluating technologies for big data. Surveys in 2012 and 2013 confirmed that ``I/O performance,`` the ability to move data into and out of a system, was the greatest ``satisfaction gap`` in technologies for big data-the area with the greatest unmet need relative to satisfaction with existing solutions.However, big data has not proved to be a major boon for the HPC market. Although many organizations launched big data initiatives, for most organizations, their spending patterns did not change much. Companies began with the data, the storage, the servers, the networks, and the personnel they already had, and they did the best they could. (They may have invested in new software, but this was often inexpensive or even free. Services spending did get a small boost.)The most significant technology that did emerge from IT`s big data awakening was flash storage, or solid state disks (SSDs). These devices offer faster I/O performance than traditional spinning hard drives, albeit at usually a higher cost per byte of storage. Many organizations inside and outside HPC now incorporate SSDs as part of their total storage hierarchy.Analytics is a category of application that can be run on any system, whether or not it is HPC. ``Analytics`` is also a very broad term that can be stretched to cover many types of computing. Some HPC systems run big data workloads, but not all big data workloads are HPC.The Race to ExascaleAs mentioned above, there is an insatiable need for ever more powerful HPC systems to solve increasingly complex scientific problems. The TOP500 list provides a measuring stick for achievement, as new deployments leapfrog over their predecessors in how many flops they deliver. This pursuit takes on extra significance as we approach the thousand-fold increases that usher in a new prefix era.In 1996 ASCI Red (discussed above in the section, ``The TOP500 list``), was the first supercomputer to achieve 1 Teraflop of performance, perceived as a great victory for the cluster experiment. Twelve years later in 2008, the Roadrunner system, operated by NNSA at Los Alamos National Laboratory, achieved the milestone a thousand-fold greater, becoming the first system to deliver 1 Petaflop of performance.We are approaching the time when the first Exascale system will be deployed. Exa- is the next prefix on the list; 1 Exaflop = 1,000 Petaflops. An Exaflop is one quintillion calculations per second; that`s one billion-billion, or one million-million- million, or if you prefer, 1018 or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000. If those speeds seem absurd, rest assured that there are applications that will demand them, not only in scientific research, but in industry as well.The following is an excerpt from a 2014 report by the U.S. Council on Competitiveness, generated by Intersect360 Research, on the benefits of supercomputing for U.S. industry.xv The first key finding of this report was that ``U.S. industry representatives are confident that their organizations could consume up to 1,000-fold increases in computing capability and capacity in a relatively short amount of time.``There is tremendous optimism across industry that increases in capacity would be consumed. Looking at their most demanding HPC applications today, 68% of respondents felt they could utilize a 10x increase in performance over the next five years. Perhaps more surprisingly, 57% of respondents -more than half - say they could make use of a 100x improvement in performance over five years, and 37% - more than one-third - still agreed when the threshold was increased to 1,000x. This finding is supported by the qualitative interviews, as follows:There are two Holy Grails at exascale that I am just dying for. One of them is computational steering, taking the engineer, the scientist, the doctor, the accountant, putting them in the chair, give them the joystick, basically running through the application and continuously optimizing to whatever state they want to be at. The other Holy Grail is being able to do digital holography, where I can truly create virtual objects, which is the ultimate VR [virtual reality]. . . . To me, that unlocks human creativity, and we have another Renaissance period, a scientific Renaissance. [Interview 12, Consulting services for industrial supercomputing adoption]I don`t think anybody can exactly articulate the extent to which it`s going to change how we do product development, but it could be radical. It could take our development time to less than half, perhaps, if you don`t halve to build prototypes and have systems in the field and do all of the testing virtually. Who knows? [Interview 3, Large product manufacturing]In a research mode, we can evaluate a [single] design, but to put it into full production and try to evaluate the [entire] product line, it`s impossible at that level. We can impact things at a research level - to try to understand the benefit, can we go in this direction - but to really have a broad impact on the whole product group, it`s prohibitive. We`re going to need somewhere between 10x and 100x in order to achieve that. [Interview 7, Large product manufacturing]One leader from the financial industry did provide a detailed roadmap of what his organization could do with each new level of application scalability:There`s a whole hierarchy that happens in every product in finance. When people start trading a product, the first thing they need is a price. They need to be able to compute an arbitrage-free price based on other securities. . . . That involves having a model that you can calibrate to the market and price the security. That`s one level of computation. If it`s a complicated model, it can take significant computing power to do it.Now, the next level up, once you can do that, you want to say, how is the price going to change if the market changes? Now you have to perturb all the market input models, and there could be five or 10 or 20 or 30, and re-compute, so now you`re talking about increasing the level of computation you need by an order of magnitude.And then once you can do that, there`s two other directions it goes. Now I want to analyze the strategy that`s involving the security, so I want to pull historical data and try running out the strategy using this model every day over the last five years. So now you have a huge amount of computation to run each of these tests, another couple orders of magnitude. And then once you`re trading these successfully you have a portfolio of them that you need to analyze how the whole portfolios going to behave, so it`s another several orders of magnitude.As the computing gets faster it makes more things possible. . . . Once your computing catches up and you can do it on an interactive basis, you can respond to market changes, and it opens up a whole new world. When you have to do your portfolio analytics overnight, then it`s a different world than when you can do them in real time, interactively, where I can say, `Oh, the market moved suddenly. How does that impact my entire portfolio? Can I track my VaR [value at risk] as themarket moves?` That`s an innovation that could have a major impact on the markets. [Interview 2: Financial services]Exa-scale vs. Exa-flopsWhile the pursuit of greater levels of performance has been undiminished, one subtle detail has changed. In the industry vernacular, it is common to discuss Exascale, not just Exaflops. The word Exascale does not have a specific meaning, but its usage is born from the discussion of the usefulness of a supercomputer. What good is an Exaflop if it cannot be attained by any real scientific application? In that vein, Exascale can be thought of to mean ``having real applications that run at an Exaflop.`` (In practice, however, many people do not make a distinction, and once any Exaflop supercomputer is built, it is likely that many will proclaim, ``Exascale has arrived!``)If it seems inevitable that such a system will be built, and soon, there are nevertheless dramatic challenges to be overcome. Some of the most significant are:- Power consumption: The Sunway TaihuLight system consumes over 15 Megawatts of power for its 93 Petaflops of LINPACK performance. That ratio of 6 Teraflops per Kilowatt is already second-best among the top ten supercomputers in the ranking. (The best in the top ten is the eighth-ranked Piz Daint system at the Swiss National Computing Center, CSCS, which delivers 9.8 Petaflops for 1.3 Megawatts, a ratio of 7.5 Teraflops per Kilowatt.) Even at 10 Teraflops per Kilowatt, an Exaflop system would require a power budget of 100 Megawatts. The U.S. Exascale Computing Project sets a goal of delivering an Exaflop system with a power budget of 20 Megawatts, a ratio of 50 Teraflops per Kilowatt.- Reliability: The more components you add to a system, the greater the odds that one of them will fail. The Sunway Taihulight system contains over 10 million processor cores. If only one in a million fails on a given day, there are 10 failures per day, and that does not take into consideration failures in memory, data storage, or networking. An Exascale system may have an order of magnitude more components than that. Systems of this scale will need to handle individual component failures gracefully, without significantly degrading the system as a whole.- Programming: Considering the underlying hardware changes at play, as well as the increasing diversity and specialization of technologies, this may be the greatest challenge of all. Basic algorithms and programming models need to be revisited for this level of scale, and what works best on one type of supercomputer may not work efficiently (or at all) on another.Who Will Get There First, and When?The Chinese have a substantial edge right now at the zenith of the supercomputing market, and a funded plan to drive to Exascale. There is a good chance that China will deploy an Exascale system (built ``in-house``) by the end of 2019. Japan previously had an Exascale plan on a similar timeframe, but recent delays mean Japan likely won`t achieve Exascale until 2020 or 2021 (likely to be built by Fujitsu). The U.S. had initially planned to deploy its first two Exascale systems in 2022 to 2023, about three years after the Chinese, with one system based on Intel architecture, and another by IBM with NVIDIA GPUs. In November 2016, the U.S. Exascale Computing Project ratified a strategy to introduce an additional ``novel architecture`` sooner, by the end of 2021, a full year or more ahead of the originally planned systems.xvi xvii In that timeframe, the U.S. would deploy closer to China and Japan. France and Russia could also field Exascale systems in a similar timeframe.Looking ForwardLooking ahead, there are some technologies and applications that have the potential to provide a discontinuous advancement in the way that HPC is done.Machine Learning / Artificial IntelligenceHyperscale companies are using ``machine learning`` techniques to make significant advancements in artificial intelligence. Deep learning involves two steps: training and inference. In the training step, massive amounts of data are used to analyze patterns. For example, there may be millions of photos that are tagged to indicate ``cat,`` and millions more similarly tagged, ``not a cat.`` The training algorithm sifts through the data to determine the essential elements of a picture that correspond to cat or not a cat. When confronted with a new picture, the inference algorithm can then come up with the likelihood that there is a cat in the photo, without human intervention.Based on advancements in machine learning, artificial intelligence is making great leaps forward for consumers and businesses, in applications such as natural speech recognition and autonomous driving. Within the past few years, machines have beaten human experts at games including Jeopardy!, Go, and poker.Today machine learning and AI are predominant in the domain of hyperscale, not HPC, though there are many similarities. The leading researchers in AI are the dominant hyperscale companies, with one notable addition: IBM, which has invested heavily in its Watson technology for ``cognitive computing.`` Several major supercomputing sites are working on AI, and Japan has announced two publicly funded supercomputing projects with AI focuses.AI has the potential to touch almost any industry, and there are some it may revolutionize. Some of the possibilities are:- Medicine: This is the most ``marketable`` of AI advancements, as there is a popular demand for technology that can improve and extend people`s lives. AI can be used to look across wide databases of symptoms and patient histories to arrive at more accurate diagnoses, especially for rare conditions, and to design personalized courses of treatment. AI can also monitor symptoms to alert medical personnel to important changes in patients` conditions.- Finance: Although less popular than medicine as an avenue for AI, finance is a hotbed of machine learning, as financial services organizations have troves of data that can be used to optimize pricing and investments. Any financial mechanism-whether it is a credit card, a mortgage, or an insurance policy-has a price, often in the form of an interest rate. Rather than dividing customers broadly into risk categories (known as ``tranches``), financial institutions can use machine learning to analyze the individual risk of any consumer, business, or investment, as it changes over time in response to changing inputs. AI can also be used to optimize fraud detection (in credit card transactions, insurance claims, etc.) and to anticipate future changes in market conditions.- Retail: Recommendation engines are already important tools in retail. Most of us have seen messages on our screens with suggestions, ``Since you recently bought (or downloaded, or browsed for) X, you might also be interested in Y.`` AI can do this more intelligently, across multiple platforms, with a wider array of data, fast enough to include recommendations and special offers at the moment of sale. AI can also be used to analyze and predict sales trends, enabling better inventory management. In the case of food, this can also reduce spoilage.- Defense: Many of the advancements made in AI in research and industry have applications in defense. Most notably, AI can directly improve the analytics of vast amount of intelligence data, which can better enable insights both offensively (where and when to go after a target) and defensively (detecting terrorist activity and predicting attacks). Autonomous drones, robots, and vehicles have obvious strategic military benefits. And AI capabilities could extend to both cybersecurity and cyberattack strategies, whether planning or preventing assaults based on hacking.Quantum ComputingQuantum computing represents a potential discontinuous advancement in the way supercomputers could be built. In the current model, all computing is based on ``bits``-switches that can be off or on, which translate to the 0s and 1s that are the foundation of computation and logic. Eight bits form a byte, which gathered together form the Gigabytes, Terabytes, Petabytes, and Exabytes of information coursing through supercomputers.Quantum computers are built on subatomic quantum particles, which have the unusual and important characteristic of ``superposition``-they can be in more than one state at the same time. These quantum bits, or ``qubits`` (pronounced ``cubits``) can be equal to 0 or 1, or both 0 and 1, or any probabilistic combination of 0 and 1. A quantum computer can therefore explore a vastly greater solution space, based on fewer inputs.The potential of quantum computing has been touted for many years, including recognition at the national level. Beginning in 2002, the High Productivity Computing Systems (HPCS) initiative under the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) recognized the need for advancements in supercomputing that would ``fill the high-end computing technology and capability gap`` until the future promise of quantum computing.There are formidable challenges to building a quantum computer, well beyond mere expertise in quantum dynamics. The quantum particles need to be isolated, held in place, controlled, and measured, free from cosmic interference. To achieve this in a research setting is daunting; to do it commercially is harder still.In 2007, D-Wave announced the first commercial quantum computer. It is uses ``quantum annealing`` techniques, which some have criticized as not fulfilling the full promise of a supercomputer based on ``quantum entanglement.`` In short, the quantum annealing technology is most useful for exploring independent paths in a solution space, as each qubit seeks a low-energy point. (Imagine dropping marbles over an uneven surface. Each marble will roll to a local low point. The more marbles you drop, the greater the chances that at least one of them will find a path that rolls to the lowest point on the entire surface. This point is the ``optimal solution`` for the space.) D-Wave has sold a few systems, including to Google and NASA Ames Research Center, who are collaborating on the technology. The current D-Wave systems scale up to 2,000 qubits.In March 2017 (less than two weeks before this testimony date), IBM announced the commercial availability of a ``universal quantum computer,`` which utilizes ``pairwise quantum entanglement,`` meaning any two qubits can be linked to each other`s states. According to IBM, a system of n qubits is therefore capable of fully exploring a solution space with 2n possibilities. Its current system of 5 qubits can therefore be programmed to look at 32 (25) possibilities in a space. If that seems small, consider that IBM also says it will have systems with up to 50 qubits ``within a few years,`` which would be on pace to exceed current supercomputing capabilities for some categories of problems, if the technology works and it can be programmed.Even in the most aggressive case, quantum computing will not displace conventional computing in the current planning horizon. At best it will provide a way to solve problem types that are not well-suited to current computing architectures. The first areas for quantum computing will be applications that take relatively few inputs, explore a large possible set of solutions, and provide few outputs. Playing chess is a metaphor for this type of application, but there are potential real-world scientific applications in materials science, biotechnology, and possibly also encryption (or decryption, as quantum computing might excel at factoring large numbers).HPC INVESTMENT IN THE U.S., CHINA, AND REST OF WORLDThroughout most of the history of supercomputing, the U.S. has been the dominant leader. Most of the vendors of key technologies have been U.S. companies, and U.S. national labs have been at the forefront of supercomputing research. Throughout industry and academia, the U.S. dominates in HPC usage. However, access to HPC technologies is no longer rarified. Anyone with the budget (including capital budget, facilities, and human expertise) can build a supercomputer, from component technologies that are readily available. In the past, the U.S. was able to limit access to supercomputers through export controls. Today, individual technologies can be controlled, but there are alternatives available.The Chinese program to build its national supercomputing efforts comes at a time when the model of how to build supercomputers is changing. With a paradigm shift, it is possible for one region to leapfrog ahead of another, even when it has been behind. As a metaphor, consider the revolution with mobile communications. A nation with limited telephone landline infrastructure could suddenly bound ahead in mobile with a well-timed investment. Such is the potential with supercomputing today. If Exascale systems look different from current systems, particularly in how they are programmed, then it is possible to essentially ``come from behind`` with timely investment. This section looks at the current supercomputing policy, strategy, and investment in the U.S., China, and the rest of the world.Supercomputing in the United StatesAt a national level, current investment in new supercomputing technologies flows predominantly through DOE, including the DOE Office of Science and the NNSA. DOE national labs have been a focal point for supercomputing for decades, and that focus continues through the U.S. Exascale Computing Project. A current collaboration known as CORAL (Collaboration of Oak Ridge, Argonne, and Livermore) is pursuing three ``pre-Exascale`` systems, using two different approaches. The supercomputers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) are based on IBM POWER technology and accelerated with NVIDIA GPUsxix, while the deployment at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) uses Intel technology, with Cray as a system integration partner.xx All three systems are planned to deliver over 100 Petaflops of performance, with target power budgets of 10 Megawatts.These deployments highlight the competitive rift that has formed between the U.S. supercomputing vendors, which are now in two predominant camps. Intel is at the nexus of one camp, with system integration partners that will build scalable systems on Intel technologies, including its processing elements (both CPUs and FPGAs), interconnects (OmniPath and Ethernet), and accompanying software elements. The other camp is centered on IBM, which has its own systems and processors, and partners with other natural competitors to Intel in areas like accelerators (NVIDIA GPUs) and networking (Mellanox InfiniBand). Most technology vendors will feel pulled toward one camp or the other.Current Program InvestmentsIn the pursuit of Exascale technologies, the DOE Office of Science has synthesized the Exascale Computing Project (ECP). (The ECP supersedes the previous Exascale Initiative, also under the Office of Science, which included ``Design Forward`` and ``Fast Forward`` grants for companies designing next-generation technologies that could enable Exascale computing.)xxi As noted above, the U.S. had planned to field its first two Exaflop systems in 2022 to 2023, based on the CORAL ``pre-Exascale`` architectures, approximately three years behind China. A newly ratified plan would deliver an Exaflop system in 2021, based on a ``novel architecture,`` presumably different from the two CORAL architectures already planned. (ARM architecture is a strong possibility, which would be similar to Japan`s plan, in roughly the same timeframe.)The ECP has stressed Exascale over Exaflops, with focus areas in hardware technology, software technology, application development, and Exascale systemsxxii. For the CORAL systems and their follow-ons, the rationale has been that if the U.S. is not going to reach an Exaflop first, then it will at least do it better, with more efficient, general-purpose systems serving a wider range of scientific applications. While this argument is not without merit, it has also been subject to debate, ceding a multi-year head start to other countries, which would not hold still in the interim.The new novel-architecture plan brings the U.S. timeline closer to China and Japan, but questions arise as to whether any Exascale considerations are being sacrificed with the new machine. A new architecture will have less software readiness than an established one, and it is being introduced a year sooner. Our analysis is that the added deliverable will reduce pressure for the U.S. to deliver an Exaflop sooner, while still allowing the CORAL successors to move forward.Additional national funding for HPC in the U.S. flows through the Department of Defense (DoD), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) under the U.S. Dept. of Commerce, NASA, and the National Institute of Health (NIH).The DoD HPC efforts, through the DoD HPC Modernization Program, are consolidated primarily into four major DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs): U.S. Army Research Laboratory, U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, and the Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Previously two additional DSRCs received funding-the Maui HPC Center (MHPCC) in Hawaii and the Arctic Region Supercomputing Center (ARSC) in Alaska-but these were dissolved in 2015.NSF and NIH grants fund HPC at academic sites. Some of the largest and most significant academic supercomputing labs in the U.S. are the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois, the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) at the University of Texas, and the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, which is a joint collaboration between Carnegie-Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.Changes in funding can of course happen at any time, particularly with shifts in power between political parties in Congress or in the White House, or in response to changes in national or global economic conditions. That said, supercomputing programs have often enjoyed bipartisan support in the U.S., due to the multi- purpose links to scientific research, to industrial advancement, and to national security.Foreign Vendors in the U.S.The U.S. supercomputing efforts are not reliant to any significant extent on technology from vendors based outside the U.S. A complete, best-of-breed supercomputer can be built exclusively from technology from U.S.-based vendors, with multiple options. That said, the major vendors are all multi- national companies. Intel, IBM, HPE, and Dell EMC (among others) all have major operations in China. Processing elements are often fabricated in China.At the system level, foreign-based companies like Lenovo and Huawei have trouble competing for U.S. government-funded supercomputing acquisitions. However, they compete on more even footing for commercial HPC business.Supercomputing in ChinaAs established above, China has undergone a surge in supercomputing investment in recent years, to the forefront of achievement worldwide. China currently hosts the two most powerful supercomputers in the world by LINPACK (TOP500) performance, and the Sunway TaihuLight is five times more powerful than the most powerful supercomputers in the U.S. Put another way, the top two supercomputers in the U.S. combined achieve only roughly the same performance as the second-most powerful system in China.The Chinese market is notoriously difficult to penetrate-even to monitor it, let alone to sell into it. It is neither a free-press nor free-speech society, and we are often left to make inferences from what we can observe. It is possible that China has other classified supercomputers that are not known to the TOP500 list or to the world at large. (For that matter, this is possible in the U.S. or other countries too.) But in the case of the Chinese market, we believe it is more likely that the supercomputers we know about are also serving government interests. A supercomputer that is configured and advertised to serve weather and climate modeling, for example, might also serve nuclear simulations. Intersect360 Research assumes that these Chinese national supercomputing centers serve both defense and scientific research purposes.Current Program InvestmentsThe Chinese supercomputing programs are neither as well- communicated nor as well-known as their U.S. counterparts. The Chinese government usually works on 10-year cycles. We initially questioned whether the current Politburo would support supercomputing to the extent of the previous one, which funded the original Tienhe (``Milky Way``) supercomputer and its follow- on, Tienhe-2, which was installed after the changeover in power. Our assessment is that the level of investment has been at least stable, and may be increasing. Under its current administration, China seems determined to be the world leader in supercomputing technologies.As part of this strategy, China is intentionally decreasing its reliance on imported technologies. The Tienhe supercomputer used Intel processors, integrated by Inspur. (Within China this was viewed as a Chinese system; outside China it was viewed more as an Intel system integrated in China.) Recently the U.S. government blocked certain processing technologies from export to Chinese supercomputing labs, due to the revelation that they were indeed conducting nuclear simulations.xxiii These export restrictions included the Intel processors slated for Chinese supercomputing upgrades.This action by the U.S. government may have had unintended consequences. The planned upgrades were certainly delayed, but in the interim, the Chinese government increased its focus on domestic microprocessor technologies, including the Sunway processor. It is difficult to say for certain whether the TaihuLight system would be more powerful or more efficient using Intel processor technology, but what is certain is that the Chinese initiatives can no longer be thwarted by U.S. export control.The area in which China may lag the furthest behind other countries is networking. As noted above, the Sunway TaihuLight system incorporated networking chips purchased from Mellanox. Although the official statement is that the Chinese developed a unique network based on those chips, we assume that the technology is effectively InfiniBand, or something very much like it, and that the Chinese government could not have built an efficient, high-performance system interconnect without these chips, at least not in a similar timeframe.The most important distinction of the Sunway TaihuLight may be that it was built, not bought. That is to say, the supercomputing centers themselves designed the components and integrated them. It is not clear to what extent the resulting systems might eventually be commercialized for sale inside or outside China. This presents an interesting ramification to consider:When private U.S. companies design supercomputing systems or technologies, they seek to sell them in as broad a market as possible, inside or outside the U.S. Many other countries thereby benefit from the investment. But China is a relatively closed economy, and if the Chinese government designs a supercomputer that is better than any other, even if only for selected purposes, then it is not certain that technology will ever be available to anyone else.One final point about the Chinese supercomputing strategy is that over time is has leaned more toward centralization than decentralization. Rather than pursuing a strategy that would put HPC resources into individual companies and researchers, we find it likelier that the Chinese government would create programs of access to centralized resources.Foreign Vendors in ChinaU.S.-based technology vendors perceive China as a market with tremendous growth potential, and many have invested in strong Chinese presences to capitalize on it. The competitive dynamic mirrors that in the U.S. Companies like IBM, HPE, and Dell EMC can compete for corporate business, but they have little access to government bids versus system vendors based in China. Inspur is the market share leader for HPC systems deployed in China.Notable Supercomputing Strategies in Other CountriesThe U.S. and China are not the only two superpowers in supercomputing. This section provides a brief analysis of some other considerations at national levels.JapanNot long ago, Japan (not China) was the dominant supercomputing force in Asia, and Japan is still among the world leaders today. From 2002 to 2004, Japan`s ``Earth Simulator,`` a multi-agency supercomputer built by NEC and designed specifically for global climate and ocean modeling, was recognized as the most powerful supercomputer in the world. More recently, the ``K`` supercomputer, built by Fujitsu at the RIKEN Advanced Institute for Computational Science, was the world`s fastest supercomputer in 2012, and the first supercomputer to top 10 Petaflops on LINPACK. The K computer is still the seventh-fastest in the world in the current ranking.Today Japan is charting its path toward Exascale computing with a ``Post-K`` architecture from Fujitsu. Previous Fujitsu supercomputers have been based on SPARC processors, a variety of RISC 64-bit processors pioneered and promoted by Sun Microsystems. Moving forward, the Post-K systems will be based on ARM processors, which can be viewed as native Japanese technology since SoftBank`s acquisition of ARM Holdings in 2016. Fujitsu is also noteworthy in that it continues to pursue its own custom interconnect technology, called ``Tofu,`` rather than relying on Mellanox InfiniBand, Intel OmniPath, or another networking technology.Japan at one point announced plans to deploy an Exascale system in 2019. Recent delays make 2020 or 2021 a more likely target. At this pace, Japan will likely be the second country with a supercomputing lab at an Exaflop, after China.FranceAmong European countries, France is most notable for having a native supercomputing vendor, Bull (now a brand within Atos), that is capable of fielding an Exascale system in the next few years. The likeliest customer would be CEA, the French national atomic energy commission, though Bull could as easily sell its systems in other European countries. At one point, public statements implied that such a system might be deployed as early as 2020.The Bull architecture leverages processing elements from Intel, but like Fujitsu in Japan with its Tofu interconnect (and Cray in the U.S., with its Aries interconnect), Bull is pursuing its own system networking technologies, called BXI (for Bull eXtreme Interconnect).RussiaRussia is worthy of special inclusion specifically because it has a native vendor, RSC Technologies, that has stated it would be capable of fielding an Exascale system in a timeframe similar to other national initiatives, if it had a customer. The likeliest buyer would be Moscow State University, which currently hosts the most powerful supercomputer in Russia, but we know of no confirmed, funded plan or timeframe. The RSC architecture uses Intel processors and no custom interconnect. Within Russia, RSC competes with T-Platforms, which previously dominated the Russian supercomputing market, but which was set back greatly by a temporary U.S. ban on its use of American-influenced technologies.CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONSSupercomputing is vital not only to scientific research, which benefits the world, but also to the U.S. economy, in areas such as manufacturing, energy, pharmaceuticals, and finance, as well as to national security interests. For most of the history of the HPC market, the U.S. has not only been dominant in both the usage and the production of supercomputing technologies, but also it has had the ability to selectively limit the export of supercomputing capabilities to other countries if desired.As supercomputing architectures are evolving and specializing, new paradigms need to be developed along with them. Exascale systems will require different programming, different management, and different stewardship than their predecessors. The hyperscale market will influence this path, as will the attendant rise of artificial intelligence. In short, the rules of the game are changing.The U.S. should not underestimate the capability or potential of Chinese supercomputing initiatives. If the systems are built, many brilliant scientists will go to work to find innovative ways to use them for scientific research, which in turn begets advancement in other areas. Furthermore, the U.S. administration should see that attempts to limit Chinese development through export regulation have been counterproductive; the immediate result was to boost China`s own domestic technologies.While the U.S. still leads by far in the most straightforward market share metrics of production (vendors, supply-side) and consumption (buyers, demand-side), industry indicators show the U.S. is falling behind in the leading edge of advancement, and simultaneously losing the ability to rein in other countries via export control. Chinese leadership has apparently recognized the relationship between HPC and economic growth and has set forth on a program to drive the country into a leadership position. The best response to this new challenge is to continue if not increase national support for HPC at all levels.The great strength of the U.S. is its economy and the strength of its private sector. National supercomputing efforts are essential to motivating investment at the high end. From that point, U.S. companies excel at seizing opportunities to drive markets forward.Against these strengths, the top limitations to Exascale deployments are software and skills. If we do build a system, how will we use it? A key feature of the ECP is its emphasis on co- design, finding end-user stakeholders to collaborate on the design of next-generation supercomputing technologies, bolstered by government funding.Beyond the continuance of ECP, we offer the following recommendations:- National initiatives in low-level software tools and programming models, together with stakeholders in industry and academia.While individual applications must be tailored to specific architectures and may be of interest to a limited audience, there is some software functionality that would be of broader benefit. This includes programming models-the methodologies with which application engineers get their ideas to scale on large machines-and work on common tools and algorithms, such as math libraries, which benefit multiple applications. This type of work is not flashy-it is hard to get the public excited about linear algebra implementations-but the downstream benefit to multiple domains is a major payoff.- Government-funded partnerships between industry and academia. The skills gap is a significant problem across the HPC industry. There is a scarcity of engineers, and much of the talent is more attracted to work in hyperscale industries. If more HPC skills were introduced in academic science and engineering programs, government programs could connect the students with organizations in need of their skills. Coursework could be designed such that the student is working on actual models as part of their course of study, at no cost to the participating company or organization. By the time the students join the workforce, they have learned valuable skills, become knowledgeable in a potential hirer`s products or process, and provided a valuable service, even if they choose to do something else. For participating organizations, they get access to HPC skills (albeit entry-level ones) with little to no cost or risk, and access to a pre-trained employee if they choose to hire.- Ongoing pursuit of next-generation technologies. As noted throughout this statement, supercomputing is an industry of change. Beyond the leading vendors mentioned at various points, there are countless startups in pursuit of game-changing ideas, one of which might turn the industry on its head in five, ten, or 20 years.Regardless of these recommendations, the HPC market will continue, powering new innovations and ideas around the world. Supercomputers today are close to a million times more powerful now than they were 20 years ago. In another 20 years, they could be a million times more powerful still. The leaders in supercomputing will be the ones that do not rest on their achievements, but rather continue to chase the next challenge over each new horizon.Load-Date: March 16, 2017End of Document

China enlists an unlikely ally in battling pollution: public activists; The Chinese government is cautiously embracing public activism - through social media and the release of real-time pollution data - as it moves to address the environmental toll of three decades of intense economic growth.The Christian Science MonitorMarch 17, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights ReservedSection: WorldLength: 1483 wordsByline: Michael Holtz Staff writerBodyDuan Shumin is still getting used to her new surroundings on the outskirts of this city in Shandong province, some 200 miles south of Beijing. Factories that make everything from asphalt to xylitol, a sweetener used in gum, line the roads leading to the apartment she moved to last July. On a recent afternoon, the air is thick with the scent of petroleum and burnt plastic."This is an average day," Ms. Duan says while stopped at an intersection in her black SUV. She has rolled down the windows to make her point. "When the smell is really bad it makes me feel like I'm going to vomit."Fed up with what she considers half-hearted efforts to curb industrial emissions - the source of the smell - Duan has taken to Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, to report on polluting factories. Every day she or a friend posts a photograph of a different location in the city along with current air pollution levels. She uses a mobile app to look up real-time emission data from surrounding factories and writes public messages to notify environmental-protection officials of violators. She has also created a discussion group on WeChat, the Chinese mobile-messaging service, to recruit other local residents to her cause."Public awareness is growing and the government can't stand the pressure," Duan says. "It has to do something about it."Surprisingly, China is not only tolerating such grassroots activism - it is cautiously embracing it as it moves to address the environmental toll of three decades of intense economic growth. While the ruling Communist Party has long restricted political expression and participation in the interest of social stability, it has come to realize that going after polluters is easier with a public empowered by social media tools and access to real-time emissions data.Alex Wang, an assistant professor at the UCLA School of Law who specializes in Chinese environmental law, writes in a soon-to-be published study that the overlapping interests of citizens and the nation's leaders have "enabled the seemingly paradoxical flowering of disclosure law in China." That has led the government to demand that more than 15,000 factories and plants release hourly emissions data - a requirement, Professor Wang writes, "seen nowhere else in the world.""Chinese officials see information disclosure as useful," he says in an email. "It encourages citizens to assist in environmental enforcement. Armed with information about factory emissions, they can now target bad actors and place pressure on them to reform."Environmental protection officials have forced hundreds of factories to reduce their emissions in response to public complaints raised on social media over the last three years, according to the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE), a Beijing-based nongovernmental organization.Blue skies ahead? Official data show an improvement in China's air quality since Premier Li Keqiang declared a "war on pollution" in 2014. The country's coal consumption, a major source of carbon dioxide emissions, dropped in 2016 for a third year in a row. Meanwhile, the use of renewable energy sources has steadily increased.But as the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter, China has a long way to go if it hopes to hit pollution reduction targets this year that the government set in 2013. They include a 25-percent reduction in the density of fine particulate matter known as PM2.5 in Beijing and the surrounding region from 2012 levels.In a speech earlier this month in Beijing, Premier Li pledged that the government would step up its efforts to "make our skies blue again." His list of smog-busting measures includes plans to upgrade coal-fired power plants to achieve low emissions, encourage the use of clean-energy cars, and hold "fully accountable" officials who fail to enforce environmental laws and regulations.What most caught the attention of Ma Jun, one of China's most prominent environmentalists and the director of IPE, was Li's promise to place "all key sources of industrial pollution" under 24-hour online monitoring. In the absence of a robust legal system, Mr. Ma says the disclosure of emissions data is the best way to improve enforcement of environmental protection laws. It can be especially helpful in putting public pressure on local governments that have strong economic and political ties to polluting companies."It's a mechanism to help differentiate between good and bad factories and to promote those that want to do better," says Ma. "I do think this is the biggest opportunity to get blue skies back more quickly."Li's pledge was short on specifics. It follows a rule issued by China's Ministry of Environmental Protection in 2013 that requires all provinces to create online platforms for disclosing factory emissions data. The establishment of that rule was an important milestone for Ma, whose ultimate goal is to "make every smokestack transparent." In June 2014, his institute launched a mobile phone app called "Blue Sky" to make the newly released emissions data easily accessible."If you sit on a high building in any city," Ma says, "you should be able to use your cellphone to tell whether every factory you see is in compliance or not. That's not impossible. It's a real possibility."The "Blue Sky" app allows users to track real-time emissions from more than 12,000 factories and plants across China and write complaints to local environmental protection bureaus (EPBs) on Weibo. It has been downloaded more than 3 million times and averages about 20,000 daily users.So far, more than 650 companies have addressed reports about excessive emissions filed by app users. More than half of the responses have come from Shandong, one of China's most polluted and industrialized regions.Shandong was quick to embrace the practice after a groundwater pollution scandal in 2013 sparked widespread public outrage. Since then the provincial EPB has ordered more than 2,000 enterprises to release hourly data about their water and air emissions. It has also created an official Weibo account for public outreach and required every city, town, and county-level office to do the same."We are fully using the public power to fight a people's war for environmental protection," an EPB spokesperson said in an emailed statement.IPE says 100 facilities in Shandong have worked to reduce their emissions in response to complaints shared through the "Blue Sky" app. One of the biggest success stories came in 2014, when the EPB responded to complaints about a polluting steel factory in the provincial capital of Jinan by forcing it to shut down two production lines.Shandong's openness to public participation is partially what led Duan to join a network of about 200 volunteers that monitor factories across the province. On a recent Sunday morning, she met with five others at a sparsely furnished apartment in Dezhou to discuss their plans for this year.Guo Yongqi, the founder of an environmental group called Green Qilu, led the meeting. He told the volunteers that he wanted them to use the "Blue Sky" app to report on 10 new factories every month and to collect more on-the-ground evidence. He even bought a drone so they can take aerial shots of polluting factories. While Duan and some of the other volunteers were dismayed by the government's slow response to their complaints, Mr. Guo encouraged them to stay vigilant."What we're doing is telling the EPB that this is something you should look and not ignore," he says the next day, as he recounts the meeting. "If there's pollution, you need to explain the reasons for it and the measures you are going to take to fix it."Guo says authorities haven't tried to suppress or censor him despite the sensitivity of his work. Still, Wang warns that Beijing keeps a close eye on grassroots environmental activism for fear of it leading to social unrest. The government's challenge is to balance its need for public support in regulating polluting industries with its compulsion to clamp down on any sort of activism that could undermine its legitimacy.A reminder of that came in December, when police broke up a small group of people wearing masks at an anti-pollution demonstration in the southwestern city of Chengdu. Then, in February, police in the northern city of Daqing cracked down on protesters opposed to the construction of an aluminum plant."Participation and transparency act as a safety valve, releasing pent up social pressure that builds up when citizens are left in the dark with no channels of recourse," Wang says. "Officials likely have faith in their ability to prevent citizens from straying beyond acceptable political limits."But what if the government ignores or fails to respond to their concerns? The question then becomes how far they're willing to push, or, as Wang write, "How high are the costs of playing along?"Xie Yujuan contributed reporting.  Graphic Duan Shumin uses Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, to draw attention to polluting factories near her apartment in Dezhou, China.

China confirms that, in practice, trade secrets misappropriation may be committed by individuals, including employees, who may not be directly involved in the manufacture or sale of goods and services. China plans to bolster other elements of its trade secrets regime, including with respect to the availability of evidence preservation orders and damages based on market value, consistent with other developments in intellectual property law in China, as well as the issuance of a judicial interpretation on preliminary injunctions and other matters. Both sides confirm that, in those cases in which a judicial or administrative enforcement authority requests the submission of confidential information in conjunction with a trade secret enforcement matter, such requests will be narrowly tailored to avoid putting at risk sensitive business information and will be subject to appropriate protective orders to control additional disclosure and ensure that information is not further misappropriated and that any decision that is made publicly available in conjunction with a trade secret enforcement matter will have all confidential information appropriately redacted. The United States and China confirm that trade secret investigations are conducted in a prudent and cautious manner.HIGH-LEVEL COMMITMENT TO PRIORITIZE ENFORCEMENT AGAINST ONLINE IPR COUNTERFEITING AND PIRACYThe United States and China fully recognize the significance that enforcing against infringement and counterfeiting online has in protecting intellectual property rights and consumers, and fostering a fair competitive market.The two sides will strengthen cooperation with right holders and e-commerce platforms to actively and jointly promote the training of US and Chinese small and medium-sized enterprises by e-commerce platforms on protecting intellectual property rights, to help them to use these platforms to foster international trade. Both sides will explore the use of big data and other new information technologies to enhance the capability for combating infringement and counterfeiting online.China will actively promote e-commerce-related legislation, strengthen the supervision over network infringement and counterfeiting. In order to address suspected instances of online criminal piracy and trademark counterfeiting in the United States affecting Chinese right holders, the Joint Liaison Group (JLG) IP Criminal Enforcement Working Group point of contact in the U.S. Beijing Embassy will receive such referrals from China's administrative agencies.BAD FAITH TRADEMARKSAffirming their long-standing cooperation on administrative and judicial trademark issues, the United States and China agree that trademarks obtained and asserted in bad faith hinder legitimate commerce, mislead consumers, and deter investment in building global brands. The United States appreciates the positive efforts China has made under the new Trademark Law. Building upon this, China will take further efforts to combat bad faith trademark filings. Moreover, the United States and China will continue to prioritize the issue of bad faith trademark filings, and both sides will strengthen exchanges and communication through bilateral and multilateral channels.SPORTS BROADCAST COPYRIGHT PROTECTIONThe United States and China will continue to implement the consensus reached by the China - US Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT) in 2015 on sports broadcasts. To facilitate the implementation of the commitments, the United States and China confirm that broadcasts of sporting events, including when transmitted over the Internet, should be protected under their respective laws and regulations. China is committed to further study the feasibility of protecting the broadcasts of sporting events under its Copyright Law. China understands the view of the United States that other forms of protection (the Tort law, the Unfair Competition Law, etc.) provide insufficient protection or legal certainty to facilitate license agreements or the investments made in obtaining the rights to broadcast live sporting events. The United States welcomes further clarification on the circumstances under which copyright is available for live sports broadcasts from the Chinese judiciary at the earliest possible time. The United States and China further agree to deepen their technical discussions on copyright protection for sports broadcasts, including by convening a program on the subject in 2017.CHINA-U.S. IPR COOPERATIONBoth parties are to continue to develop the leading coordinating role of the U.S.-China JCCT IPR Working Group, to resolve IPR-related issues of concern to both parties, and to strengthen their cooperation which forms an underlying basis of their intellectual property relationship.Both China and the United States commend the U.S. IPR Judicial Study Tour held in April 2016 under the U.S.-China IPR Cooperative Framework Agreement ("CFA"). Both the United States and China attach great attention to the realization of relevant projects under the CFA, and intend to carry out IPR cooperation and exchange projects. Both sides will discuss launching a possible new Cooperative Framework Agreement and new cooperative programs, subject to budget availability, after completion and evaluation of remaining programs under the current CFA.China's Ministry of Commerce (MofCOM) and U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) will continue cooperative programs on a range of IP-related topics.In order to demonstrate a commitment to fostering cooperation between governments and rights holders, combatting IPR infringement, and promoting innovation and creativity, both countries are to conduct numerous substantive exchanges and programs on important IPR issues in the year ahead. Highlights of this work are as follows:* A technology licensing program co-sponsored by the Ministry of Commerce;* A program on protection of live sports broadcasts with the National Copyright Administration, and relevant agencies;* A program to exchange information on China's legal protections for product and service designs, and U.S. trade dress protections;* Programs on criminal enforcement of trade secrets and counterfeit pharmaceuticals;* A joint conference in 2017 to share experiences on recent trends in technologies, business models, and international legal developments and to discuss possible ways that criminal law, legislation, and enforcement on IPR may be effectively utilized and adapted to address current and emerging IPR challenges; and* A workshop on Judicial IPR Protection in China in 2017.STRENGTHENING IPR PROTECTION AT TRADE SHOWSBoth China and the United States affirm the importance and challenges of intellectual property rights protection at trade shows. The United States recognizes China's efforts to work with trade show organizers to establish intellectual property rights service stations at trade shows to help resolve disputes regarding IPR infringement involving Chinese enterprises, help Chinese enterprises better understand the U.S. systems for protecting and enforcing IP rights as they apply at trade shows, and promote trade in legitimate IP-intensive products and services. The United States supports the goals of this effort and commits to maintain communication and information exchange with China regarding intellectual property rights protection at trade shows.STANDARDS AND IPRChina and the United States recognize that standards setting can promote innovation, competition and consumer welfare. They also reaffirm that IPR protection and enforcement is critical to promote innovation, including when companies voluntarily agree to incorporate patents protecting technologies into a standard. Both sides recognize that specific concerns may exist relating to the licensing of standard essential patents that are subject to licensing commitments and that such commitments may be valuable in promoting both the development and implementation of technical standards. China and the United States further agreed that patent issues related to standards raise complex issues that require standard setting organizations to take into account the appropriate balance among the interests of patentees, standard users and the public when developing and adopting their rules on patent issues. China and the United States commit to continue engaging in discussion of these issues.SPECIAL 301 REPORTThe United States confirms its commitment to objectively, fairly, and in good faith evaluate the efforts made by foreign governments, including the Chinese Government, for protecting and enforcing intellectual property rights in the Special 301 Report. The United States welcomes reforms and actions designed to strengthen China's intellectual property rights protection, and commits to highlight positive actions on IP protection and enforcement undertaken by the Chinese Government in the 2017 Special 301 Report.NOTORIOUS MARKETS LISTThe United States reiterates its commitment to objectively, fairly and in good faith evaluate and recognize the efforts made by and results achieved by foreign entities, including Chinese entities, with respect to intellectual property protection and enforcement in the Notorious Markets List, as appropriate. China recognizes that the United States has further enhanced the transparency of the process by doubling the length of the rebuttal period for interested stakeholders in 2016.Commercial Law Working GroupLEGAL EXCHANGEThe 20th U.S.-China Legal Exchange was held in Alexandria, Virginia and Palo Alto, California in February and March 2016. In a dynamic and fruitful discussion, legal experts from both sides addressed two topics of key concern to both sides: developments in China's intellectual property rights (IPR) laws, and e-commerce and IPR. China and the United States agreed to convene the 21st Legal Exchange in Beijing and Shanghai in December 2016 on bankruptcy law topics, to deepen understanding of our respective bankruptcy systems and share ideas on bankruptcy law reform.Medical Devices and Pharmaceuticals Working GroupMEDICAL DEVICES AND PHARMACEUTICALS* Policies of the Chinese government in promoting development and application of domestically produced medical devices, are to encourage domestic industrial development, and will not discriminate against or exclude overseas brands or products manufactured overseas. Relevant policies and measures of the central government departments are intended to strengthen advocacy; to establish cooperative platforms for government, industry, academic, research and medical institutions; to improve the quality and standard of domestic medical devices; and shall not be linked to procurement practices. In accordance with relevant laws and regulations, China commits to strengthen oversight on government procurement of medical devices and to treat overseas brands and products manufactured overseas in a transparent, fair and equitable manner, and both sides stand ready to further communicate with parties concerned.* China has issued two batches of Class II Medical Device Clinical Trial Exemption Catalogues and Class III Medical Device Clinical Trial Exemption Catalogues. China will continue to develop and work on the drafting and adjustment of the Medical Device Clinical Trial Exemption Catalogues. During the development process, China will listen to opinions from industry and relevant stakeholders.* The Chinese side encourages clinical-value-oriented innovative drugs to be registered and marketed in China, and will further improve related policies, regulations and technical requirements to improve the drug registration review and approval process, to allow drug registration applicants, after approval, to conduct clinical trials within and outside of the territory in parallel, and to allow overseas drug manufacturers to supplement the certificate of pharmaceutical product (CPP) when applying for drug marketing license.PHARMACEUTICAL REGULATORY EVALUATION AND APPROVALChina and the United States support pharmaceutical regulatory policies that foster global innovation and protect public health. As for the implementation of drug pricing commitments, China affirms that drug registration review and approval shall not be linked to pricing commitments and shall not require specific pricing information.COMPANY VERIFICATIONThe Chinese side while working on case review, sometimes cannot obtain timely information that accurately reflects changes that happened with foreign registrant's registration and due to this lack of accurate information case review is delayed. Therefore, both sides hope to establish a communication channel, and U.S. government will provide appropriate assistance with the verification of relevant information about a foreign registrant according to CFDA's requests, and timely respond to CFDA. Agreement on this work has been reached in the Medical Device Subgroup, and it will begin after both sides clarify the contact point and contact method.DOWN CLASSIFICATIONSince April 2015, China has amended the Medical Device Classification Rules, formed the Medical Devices Classification Technical Committee, organized and carried out the work to fully amend the Medical Device Classification Catalogue, and has suggested the reclassification of products such as allergy reagents, IVDs used for flow cytometry reagents and immunohistochemistry. China's work on adjusting medical device classification referenced the commonly recognized and risks based principles, and combined with China's regulatory reality, appropriately downgraded device classes. The revised catalogue will be released after seeking further public comments and research as well as making improvements accordingly.UNIQUE DEVICE IDENTIFICATION (UDI)* China highly values international UDI research and development and implementation experience. During the drafting of China's identification number regulations and implementing plans, China will fully consider the U.S. proposal to rely on international standards and harmonize with globally accredited UDI issuing agencies, and China will offer a phased-in and risk-based implementation approach, with an initial implementation period for phase I to be no less than 2 years from issuance of the final rule, and exempting all devices manufactured or labeled prior to the rule's effective date.* Based on China's current situation, the Chinese side will study international experience, to further complete the building plan of China's UDI and traceability system and establish medical device identification number regulations.

DO CHINESE STUDENTS THREATEN FREE SPEECH AT UNIVERSITIES ABROAD?States News ServiceFebruary 17, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 1565 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: DHARAMSALA, India BodyThe following information was released by the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD):Nationalistic PRC student groups abroad are becoming increasingly vocal when it comes to academic institutions inviting critics of the CCP. Whether they succeed in eroding the West's traditions of freedom of expression will be contingent on how universities respond.Imagine a group of foreign students at, say, Fudan University in Shanghai or Peking University in Beijing organizing a campaign to prevent a former Chinese official or academic known for his pro-regime views on Tibet or Xinjiang or Taiwan from giving a lecture at the university. Worse, a foreign embassy in Beijing or consulate in Shanghai were in contact with the group of students and compelled them to threaten the university because foreign officials had "serious concerns" about the event and the ideology of the invited speaker.It's not difficult to imagine what the consequences would be for those students in China, and that is why the scenario above is, under the prevailing circumstances, unimaginable.When it comes to foreign students, however, the Chinese government and Chinese students themselves do not think along the lines of academic reciprocity. Over the years, several incidents have been reported in which students from the People's Republic of China (PRC) abroad intimidated and threatened students from territories claimed by China. On some occasions, the threats against students who were being bullied by Chinese students were such that school administrators had to involve themselves and take remedial action.In a few cases Chinese groups, instigated by or liaising with Chinese officials in the country in question, have also organized campaigns to prevent an academic institution from inviting certain speakers who are deemed "unacceptable" by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).Durham and Anastasia LinThe most recent example occurred at Durham University in the U.K., where the PRC Embassy in London was reportedly in contact with a student debating society at the university to raise concerns about Anastasia Lin, a former Miss World Canada and a fierce critic of the CCP. An embassy official is said to have told the student group that inviting Lin could "harm" relations between China and the UK.Chinese students at Durham, who are said to have first informed the PRC Embassy, also filed a complaint with the student organization, which is run independently from the university, and said that inviting Lin, a Falun Gong practitioner, was in "violation of the belief and feelings of Chinese students."In an e-mailed letter, a representative of the Durham University Chinese Students and Scholars Association said Lin "has been banned by the Chinese government for her human rights advocacy." The Chinese government regards the Falun Gong as a dangerous sect.The China-born and CCP critic Anastasia Lin (Anastasia Lin Facebook page)."Our members find both the topic and the guest they invited a violation of the belief and feelings of Chinese students," said the letter, which was also sent to university officials. "Anastasia Lin has been banned by the Chinese government and she is obviously not an appropriate person to be invited to debate in a topic like this, which put China in a position to be discriminated."Meanwhile, the embassy official said the Chinese students were "not comfortable about Lin because she's not friendly to the Chinese government."Tom Harwood, president of the Durham Union debating society, said the group had received several complaints from PRC students at Durham, including a few who likened Lin to an Islamic State terrorist.Despite efforts by Chinese students to block access to the venue, the debate went on as planned, and Lin was able to participate.UCSD and the Dalai LamaAcross the Atlantic in San Diego, Chinese students protested against the University of California, San Diego's (UCSD) announcing on Feb. 2 that it would invite the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama to give a keynote speech at a commencement ceremony in June. The reaction reportedly came mere hours after the notice, and here again the Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA) is said to have alerted the PRC Consulate. The organization denies it has any ties to the Chinese government."If the university insists on acting unilaterally and inviting the Dalai Lama to give a speech at the graduation ceremony, our association vows to take further measures to firmly resist the university's unreasonable behavior," the CSSA warned, adding that the invitation of a man who seeks to "divide the motherland" had "deeply hurt the feelings of Chinese students and scholars."Writing in the UCSD Guardian newspaper, Chinese student Wang Ruixuan argued that, "The main reason why many Chinese students are upset is that our university shows little consideration about cultural respect, as he is a politically sensitive person in China."Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama meets former U.S. president Obama in this undated photo.On social media, some Chinese students wrote that the invitation went against "diversity" and "political correctness," while others contended it was "hypocritical" to invite an "oppressive" figure like the Dalai Lama, Quartz reported. Forgetting that they are foreign guests in the country, many also seemed to argue that their protests were comparable to those targeting President Donald Trump across the United States.In an odd equating of culture and politics, the CCP-run People's Daily wrote on Feb. 16 that "Many Chinese students feel their culture should be respected too, even if many Americans are biased against China."The CSSA reportedly does not intend to ask the UCSD chancellor to disinvite the Dalai Lama but will request that the chancellor "send out statements that clarify the content of Dalai Lama's speech," "make sure his speech has nothing to do with politics," and "stop using words like 'spiritual leader' or 'exile'" to describe the Dalai Lama. In other words, they are asking the university to censor the Dalai Lama.UO and Taiwan's Andrew YangIn 2015, the Chinese embassy in Canada reportedly mobilized protesters against a talk at the University of Ottawa (UO) by Andrew Yang, a former minister of national defense and adviser to president Ma Ying-jeou at the time. The university was bombarded by e-mails and phone calls "at all levels of the UO administration," according to a source at the university. Chinese officials ostensibly feared that Yang's talk, which focused on the 70th anniversary of Japan's defeat in World War II, was a veiled attempt to promote the Republic of China, Taiwan's official name.Though we cannot conclude from those isolated incidents that the tens of thousands of PRC students abroad agree with this type of activism in foreign lands, there nevertheless are worrying indications that such behavior is becoming more frequent, at least among those whose exposure to Western liberal democracy hasn't, as had been hoped, subdued their nationalistic fervor and attachment to the PRC's territorial claims. As long as the more moderate Chinese students abroad do not intervene on the side of free speech, the more radical among them will continue to give the entire body of students a reputation for bullying and excess.According to the Hong Kong based Initium, rumors have also been circulating among Chinese students abroad that the PRC might refuse to recognize degrees obtained from universities that have invited the Dalai Lama. The rumors emerged after the PRC's Ministry of Education allegedly removed the University of Calgary from its list of recommended universities after it awarded the Dalai Lama an honorary doctorate of law in 2009. Although there is no sign that a policy to that effect has been implemented by China's MOE, the rumors could nevertheless trigger self-preservation reflexes among Chinese students who do not know any better and thereby compel them to take action whenever guests who are deemed unpalatable by Chinese authorities are invited to their universities.It's one thing for Chinese students to express their views, however loudly, at various forums in the West (and this should be encouraged and protected). It's another one altogether when they take action, often in cooperation with their government, to silence or exclude people who have different opinions.'Conditioning' the WestAlthough academic institutions in the West have so far refused to cave in to this kind of pressure and restated their commitment to free expression, the long-term impact on universities abroad could eventually be felt in the form of avoidance. If, as seems to be increasingly the case, universities face a storm of protests every time they invite "controversial" figures who are known critics of the CCP and the PRC's territorial ambitions, they could over time decide that such invitations are not worth all the trouble and self-censor by choosing to invite individuals who are silent on China or palatable to the CCP and its young ambassadors abroad.By dint of repetition, nationalistic Chinese students could accomplish what the PRC's diplomatic missions have done at the political level: condition Western authorities to adopt a policy of risk-avoidance on issues that are regarded as "controversial" by the CCP Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, human rights ... and Taiwan.Load-Date: February 19, 2017End of Document

New Report: The Battle for China's Spirit: Religious Revival, Repression, and Resistance Under Xi JinpingTargeted News ServiceFebruary 28, 2017 Tuesday 5:29 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 930 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyFreedom House issued the following news release:The Chinese government's controls over religion have intensified under Xi Jinping, seeping into new areas of daily life and triggering growing resistance from believers, according to the report The Battle for China's Spirit, released today by Freedom House."Many spiritual activities practiced freely around the world--from fasting during Ramadan to praying with one's children or performing Falun Gong meditation exercises--are restricted and can be harshly punished in China," said Sarah Cook, a senior research analyst at Freedom House and the report's author. "The scale and severity of controls over religion, and the trajectory of both growing persecution and pushback, are affecting Chinese society and politics far beyond the realm of religious policy alone."The Battle for China's Spirit examines the evolution of the Communist Party's policies of religious control and citizens' responses to them since November 2012, in the first comprehensive analysis of its kind. It focuses on seven major religious groups that together account for over 350 million believers: Chinese Buddhism, Taoism, Catholicism, Protestantism, Islam, Tibetan Buddhism, and Falun Gong."The party's rigid constraints render it impossible for state-sanctioned institutions to meet the growing demand for religion in Chinese society," Cook said. "The result is an enormous black market, forcing many believers--from Taoists and Protestants to Tibetan Buddhists--to operate outside the law and to view the regime as unreasonable, unjust, or illegitimate."Religious controls have taken different forms for different localities, ethnicities, and denominations. In many parts of China, ordinary believers do not necessarily feel constrained in their ability to practice their faith. Others face bureaucratic obstacles, mandatory political "reeducation," or economic exploitation.But authorities also regularly deploy harsh penalties, long prison terms, and deadly violence against certain communities. At least 100 million people--nearly one-third of estimated believers in China--belong to religious groups facing "high" or "very high" levels of persecution.Under Xi, many persecutory policies have expanded and evolved. A more restrictive legal environment has been put in place. Repression has expanded to target more state-registered congregations and leaders. And the government has adapted religious controls to a new technological landscape, increasing electronic surveillance at places of worship and imprisoning believers for sharing content on social media platforms or using tools to circumvent internet censorship."Despite tightening controls, millions of religious believers defy official restrictions in daily life. Indeed, the survival of groups and beliefs that the party has invested tremendous resources to crush represents a remarkable failure of the government's repression," Cook said. "It reflects the party's difficulty in confronting citizens who are willing to make sacrifices for higher principles. From this perspective, it would appear that in the long-term battle for China's spirit, an unreformed Communist Party will ultimately lose."Key findings by religious community* Chinese Buddhism and Taoism: President Xi and other officials portray Chinese Buddhism and Taoism as increasingly important for realizing the party's political goals at home and abroad, including building regime legitimacy on the basis of traditional Chinese culture. Despite such support and an environment of relatively low persecution, economic exploitation of temples for tourism purposes has emerged as a key point of contention among the state, clergy, and lay believers.* Christianity: Since early 2014, local authorities have intensified efforts to stem the spread of Christianity amid official rhetoric about the threat of "Western" values and the need to "Sinicize" religions. Persecution of Protestants--at both unofficial and state-sanctioned churches--has especially increased, while warming relations between Beijing and the Vatican has led some Catholics to be optimistic about the faith's future trajectory in China.* Islam: Chinese government treatment of Muslims differs significantly across ethnic and geographic lines, but both Hui and Uighur Muslims have experienced increased restrictions and Islamophobia since November 2012. Controls on religion have deepened and expanded in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region in particular, including regarding religious dress, children's education, and forced selling of alcohol.* Tibetan Buddhism: The Chinese authorities impose severe constraints on the religious practice of Tibetan Buddhists, most notably veneration of the exiled Dalai Lama. New measures imposed since November 2012 include punishing assistance to self-immolators, canceling previously permitted festivals, increasing restrictions on private religious practice, and more proactively manipulating Tibetan Buddhist doctrine and selection of religious leaders.* Falun Gong: Falun Gong practitioners continue to be subject to widespread and severe human rights violations. Freedom House independently verified 933 cases of Falun Gong adherents sentenced to prison terms of up to 12 years since January 2013. Nevertheless, the purge of key party officials as part of Xi's anticorruption campaign and Falun Gong outreach to local police have led to reduced repression in some locales.View the report online here: https://freedomhouse.org/report/china-religious-freedom.Copyright Targeted News Services11Y-Dash-5791172 11Y-DashLoad-Date: March 1, 2017End of Document

REMARKS BY CHINESE AMBASSADOR TO GHANA H.E. MDM. SUN BAOHONG AT THE HANDING-OVER CEREMONY OF THE ICT CLASSROOM AT LADY JULIA ICT KNOWLEDGE COMMUNITY CENTER FROM CHINESE EMBASSY IN GHANAStates News ServiceFebruary 21, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 1301 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:His Majesty Bantamehene, representing His Majesty Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, King of Ashanti,Respected Traditional Leaders of the Community,His Excellency Ambassador Kojo Amoo-Gotffried, President of Ghana China Association of Friendship,Ladies and Gentlemen, Teachers and Students,Good afternoon!This is the sixth time for me to come to Kumasi. The city is known as the Garden City of West Africa. Each time I set foot upon this piece of land, my heart will be full of reverence. The city witnessed the history of Ashanti people fighting against the British colonists, and the Golden Age of rapid development of industry and commerce in Ghana. Ancient civilization and modern civilization merge and mingle here, emitting brilliant light and attracting countless tourists and investors.Today we are going to witness the inauguration of the ICT classroom aided by the Chinese Embassy in Ghana. With the rapid development of global Internet technology, IT industry has become an important driving force for economic development and social progress. "Internet+" has become the key word for global economic growth and every country wants to grab these new opportunities. China's great politician Mr. Deng Xiaoping once said, "Computer literacy should be popularized at kids' age." In the past three years, the Chinese Embassy has been committed to improving Ghana's ICT infrastructure and helping Ghanaian students master IT to be better prepared for the Age of Big Data. So far, the Embassy has built eight ICT classrooms in seven regions in Ghana, and thousands of students benefit herein.The ICT classroom is named China-Ghana Friendship ICT Classroom to commemorate the deep ties between our two countries that have walked through 57 years hand in hand. Former President of Ghana H.E. Mr. Kufuor, cast the vote 45 years ago to support China's restoration of legitimate seat in the United Nations when he was the Deputy Foreign Minister of the country, He has made outstanding contribution to development of our relations.I cannot enumerate all the achievements we have scored in our bilateral cooperation. China and Ghana enjoy frequent high-level exchanges. As early as 10 years ago, His Majesty King of Ashanti paid a goodwill visit to China. Last year, H.E. Mr. YU Zhengsheng, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference visited Ghana successfully. Vice presidential candidate of the New Patriotic Party H.E. Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia visited China successfully. China-Ghana cooperation on economy and trade has kept good momentum and yielded bountiful results. In 2016, China-Ghana trade volume hit 5.9 billion US dollars, maintaining the 6th place among all African countries. China's direct investment and newly-signed contracts in Ghana also rank in the forefront of African countries. China handed over the Cape Coast Sports Stadium and Kotokuraba Modern Market Project to the Ghanaian side. Other major projects such as the Phase II of Gas Infrastructure Development Project, Sunon Asogli Zero Discharge 700MW Coal Plant and China-aided 1,000-borehole project, are progressing steadily. The people-to-people exchanges are also laudable. Last year, a total of 518 Ghanaian students received various kinds of scholarship to study in China and made the number of Ghanaian students in China close to 5,000, ranking first among all African countries for the past four years. More than 1,000 Ghanaian professionals took part in vocational training programs in China, and this number ranked first in the world. The second Confucius Institute in Ghana was successfully unveiled at the University of Cape Coast, and the China National Youth Football Team and the Jiangxi Culture Exchange Group visited Ghana and made a great sensation across the country.Kumasi is one of the best points to observe the flourishing development of China-Ghana relations. We have both Kumasi Youth Centre, a Chinese government grant project and Wynca Sunshine Company, a Chinese enterprise committed to establishing a hundred-year-lasting brand and advocating "Invested by China and Made in Ghana". Local business men and women of Ashanti travel to China on a daily basis to purchase all kinds of goods and by introducing in Chinese machinery and expertise, Prefos became the first street lamp factory in Ghana, Rattray Park became the most popular entertaining place. In 2015 and 2016, KATH hosted two Chinese cadio-vascular expert teams. Chinese experts performed surgeries free of charge and saved dozens of peoples' lives. Last year, due to the help of Wenzhou Chamber of Commerce in Ghana, Kumasi and Wenzhou City of China officially concluded sister-city relations and became the sixth sister-city (sister region) between China and Ghana. Chinese enterprises make new investment to set up cement, auto-parts, plastic re-processing and other manufacturing plants in Kumasi, supporting Ghana's endeavors of economic restructuring and industrial construction. Kumasi embraces more and more potential Chinese investors. Last year, delegation of Wenzhou Municipal Party's Committee and business delegation of Henan and the China National Textile and Apparel Council visited Kumasi. During their stay, they held dialogues with governmental officials and business elites and explored the investment opportunities. I believe more good news are on the way.Ladies and Gentlemen,Last year, I had the great honor of visiting the pride of Ashanti people, former Secretary-General of the United Nations Mr. Kofi Annan. Mr. Annan is very dedicated to the economic and social development of developing countries after retirement, especially his own hometown. During our meeting, Mr. Annan pointed out that China's development experience is worth learning.After reform and opening-up for 39 years, China is now the world's second largest economy, largest trading nation in goods, largest holder of foreign exchange reserves, third largest outbound investor, largest tourist market and third largest overseas students host country. China has made remarkable achievements in the development of mankind, not by copying the development model of other countries, but by sticking to a path of development that conforms to its own national conditions; not by war of aggression or colonial plunder, but by people's hardworking and wisdom. The Chinese nation has an open mind, adheres to interaction on an equal footing and mutual learning as well as absorbing all good things from different cultures, and seeking an inclusive development. The Chinese nation has an unyielding backbone, adheres to peaceful development and good neighborliness, and strives for national rejuvenation. The Chinese nation has a fearless heart, adheres to reform, innovation and interconnected development, and realizes win-win cooperation for common benefit. China's development is an opportunity for the world. China is willing to share its developing dividends with all parties, build a community of common destiny for all mankind, and work together for common prosperity.Ladies and Gentlemen,Ghana's new government has made solemn pledges to Ghanaian people to actively implement concrete measures to achieve national industrialization and economic restructuring. This is a promising era for young people in Ghana to display their talents. "I advise you all not to cherish the gold threaded clothes, but to cherish the golden ages when you are young." I hope that all students here can set a lofty goal and study for the rejuvenation of Ghana; seize the day, seize the moment, make full use of this ICT classroom, forge all-round skills and make due contribution to the national construction in the future!Thank you!Load-Date: March 2, 2017End of Document

CHINA'S LATEST ONSLAUGHT ON THE INTERNETStates News ServiceMarch 31, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 404 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Sophie RichardsonChina Director SophieHRWChinese "netizens" are known for nimbly "scaling the Great Firewall" to get around government barriers that prevent them from accessing certain information abroad. Their interests are surprisingly diverse: Some look for news critical of the Chinese government or seek independent information about air quality issues, some have business links abroad or need the latest scientific research, while others want to post attacks on the Facebook page of the elected leader of Taiwan.But soon this might all be history. This week the government of Chongqing, a city of about 50 million in southwest China, made public a regulation that bans unauthorized use of internet circumvention tools in the city. While the rules came into effect in last July, details were only released this week. Anyone from individuals to companies who skirts China's system of internet filters will be ordered to disconnect and receive a warning. Those who make a profit while using circumvention tools will be fined.The regulation is one of many recent steps by the Chinese government in its attempt to impose total control over access to information. In January 2017, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued regulations that require all providers of circumvention tools in China to be pre-approved by the ministry, which effectively puts most of the country's providers of virtual private networks or VPNs, a widely used kind of circumvention software in violation of the law.The Chongqing regulation is unprecedented as it places a blanket ban on the use of VPNs and other circumvention methods used to connect to the global internet. Previous regulatory efforts to rein in the use of such tools have focused on providers and left individual users alone.It is unclear whether other local governments will soon follow suit, but the ban has already had a chilling effect among VPN users across the nation many netizens posted frightened or crying emojis to express their displeasure.Chinese leaders, from President Xi Jinping on down, talk incessantly about cooperation and exchanges between peoples and governments. If the Chinese government truly wants that, it should at least allow its people to have access to the uncensored global internet where they can easily communicate with each other and people from the rest of the world.Load-Date: March 31, 2017End of Document

Banning Pinterest is a move used to preserve the economic viability of Chinese home industries, according to the Mercator Institute for Chinese Studies.According to the same source, similar measures have been used before in order to preserve Chinese internet-based companies.The Chinese government hopes that blocking access to Pinterest will lead China's 731 million internet users to use domestic sites instead of foreign competitors like Pinterest, CNN reported.The ban coincides with this year's meeting of China's annual National People's Congress, which is a meeting of top legislators in China to discuss the domestic economic and political course of the country for the upcoming year, according to CNN.According to the same source, this meeting is often heavily scrutinized because it determines the movement of the world's second largest economy, CNN reported.The same source reported that China is able to curtail the internet for their people because of the "Great Firewall," a powerful device that allows the Chinese government to manipulate the internet in their mainland.The Chinese government uses this firewall to filter out specific keywords that represent certain Chinese ideals that the government might not agree with, such as Tibetan Independence and Tiananmen Square Massacre, CNN reported.The internet in China is streamed through three servers located in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, according to the Mercator Institute for Chinese Studies.Related• China• nation and world• PinterestLoad-Date: March 26, 2017End of Document

Cypress Semiconductor's Largest Individual Stockholder, T.J. Rodgers, Nominates Two Highly Qualified Candidates for Board of Directors; Nominees J. Daniel McCranie and Camillo Martino Will Help Board Eliminate Ethical and Corporate Governance Violations and Restore Compliance with Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics; Cypress's Purported Changes to Strengthen Corporate Governance are Just An Attempt to Prevent Even Extraordinarily Qualified New Directors from Joining the Board; Rodgers Sues Cypress Board to Obtain Books and Records Relating to Executive Chairman Ray Bingham's Irreconcilable Conflicts of Interest; Bingham's Entanglement with Chinese Government-Backed Private Equity Firm that Competes with Cypress Presents Tangible Current Risk to Cypress Stock ValueBusiness WireFebruary 17, 2017 Friday 5:27 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business Editors; High-Tech EditorsLength: 2223 wordsDateline: SAN JOSE, Calif. BodyT.J. Rodgers, founder and former CEO, President and Director of Cypress Semiconductor Corp. (NASDAQ: CY) ("Cypress" or "the Company") and the Company's largest individual stockholder, announced today that he has nominated two highly qualified candidates to serve on Cypress's Board of Directors in the election of directors at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Rodgers owns or controls voting of 8,625,619 shares of Cypress common stock, more than four times as much as all Cypress directors and executive officers combined."Cypress Semiconductor faces serious conflicts of interest and ethical deficiencies," said Rodgers. "Rather than address these, the Cypress Board has chosen to announce what they purport to be changes to strengthen corporate governance but which are in fact simply an attempt to prevent even extraordinarily qualified new directors from joining the Board. I deliberately chose to nominate for the Board two highly qualified industry veterans, because this isn't about T.J. Rodgers but about focusing the attention of all Cypress stockholders on these serious issues. The nominees I've proposed, Dan McCranie and Camillo Martino, both of whom are semiconductor experts, will better serve the Board than conflicted Executive Chairman Ray Bingham and Lead Director Eric Benhamou, who I believe has repeatedly failed to acknowledge or correct the conflicts of interest situation.""Dan and Camillo have a background in Board leadership and deep knowledge of the semiconductor industry. I believe these qualities will enable them to enhance the effectiveness of the Board and support Cypress management in capitalizing on the opportunities to increase stockholder value during this challenging period for semiconductor companies."In light of his concerns about the conflicts and role of the Executive Chairman, Rodgers delivered a demand pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law for copies of Cypress's books and records relating to transactions that appear, on their face, to be breaches of the Board's fiduciary duties. In response to Cypress's refusal to supply the books and records, Rodgers has filed a lawsuit to compel production of these materials (see "About the Lawsuit" below).Ray Bingham's Irreconcilable Conflicts of InterestThe Company's Executive Chairman, Ray Bingham, simultaneously serves as one of two Founding Partners of Canyon Bridge Capital Partners, a self-described private equity buyout group funded and backed by the government of the People's Republic of China. Cypress and Canyon Bridge compete head-to-head to acquire semiconductor companies in a time of rapid consolidation in the semiconductor industry.• Cypress has acquired more than thirty semiconductor companies since its inception in 1982 and acquisitions continue to be a major business strategy of Cypress.• Canyon Bridge's pending $1.3 billion acquisition of U.S. programmable logic maker Lattice Semiconductor, a company Cypress has attempted to acquire on two previous occasions, clearly demonstrates that Canyon Bridge competes directly with Cypress.• As Cypress's Executive Chairman, Ray Bingham has intimate knowledge of the Company's M&A strategy and Rodgers believes that Bingham can use that knowledge to benefit Canyon Bridge to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders.Bingham did not reveal his involvement with Canyon Bridge to the Board when Lattice approached Cypress as a potential "white knight" alternative to a transaction with Canyon Bridge. Rodgers believes that the Board, including lead director Benhamou, failed to take appropriate action when it learned about Bingham's leadership position as one of the top two executives at Canyon Bridge, failed to take action when approached by Rodgers about this conflict of interest and failed again to address this issue by rejecting Rodgers' demand for books and records relating to these matters.Rodgers added, "The Board's failure to take decisive action upon discovery of the conflict directly violates the Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which sets forth crystal-clear policies on conflicts of interest - seven of which have been violated by Bingham's involvement with Canyon Bridge. Approved by the Board, Cypress's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is the cornerstone of the hard-earned, pristine ethical reputation that Cypress has earned with its employees, customers and stockholders for over 35 years. I believe that Bingham, Benhamou and the Board have failed to live up to this code, and that Bingham's divided loyalties have put the entire Company's reputation for ethical integrity at risk."Ray Bingham's Excessive Compensation as Executive ChairmanRodgers continued, "One of the Company's Core Values is, 'We do not tolerate waste.' In direct violation of that principle, the Board continues to support the excessive and unnecessary compensation of Bingham as Executive Chairman, which I believe is a failure to act in the best interest of stockholders."Bingham is eligible to receive nearly $900,000 combined in yearly salary and bonus, more than double the aggregate yearly estimated combined cash compensation of the Company's five outside directors. In addition, Bingham has received or will receive equity grants worth $4.5 million, more than four times the yearly estimated combined equity awards granted to the Company's five outside directors. The Executive Chairman position was created as a temporary, short-term position to mentor the Company's new CEO. At this point, Rodgers believes that the time spent on mentoring has been minimal, that position should be eliminated given its cost versus its benefit and that Bingham should receive normal directors' compensation.About the Director NomineesJ. Daniel McCranie is currently Chairman at ON Semiconductor Corp. and previously served as Non-Executive Chairman at Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. He has served on the Board of Directors at Mentor Graphics Corp. since 2012. He served on the Board of Directors of Cypress Semiconductor Corp. from 2005 through 2014. McCranie was previously employed as Executive Vice President-Sales & Applications by Cypress Semiconductor Corp., President & Chief Executive Officer by Virage Logic Corp., Vice President-Sales & Marketing by Cypress Semiconductor Corp., and Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer by SEEQ Technology, Inc.Camillo Martino has served as a member of the Board of Directors of MagnaChip Semiconductor Corp. since August 2016. Martino has served as a member of the Board of Directors of VVDN Technologies, a private company, since March 2016 and as Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of SAI Technology, Inc., a private company and leading supplier of Secure Cloud Open Stack technology solutions for various vertical markets, since April 2015. Previously, he served as director and CEO of Silicon Image, Inc.; COO at SAI Technology Inc.; and President, CEO and Director of Cornice Inc. He also served as Executive Vice President and COO of DSP chipmaker Zoran Corporation. His career began at National Semiconductor Corporation, where he held multiple positions over a nearly 14-year tenure at the company.About the LawsuitOn January 19 2017, Rodgers served Cypress with a demand for books, records and stocklist materials (the "Section 220 Demand") pursuant to 8 Del. C. § 220 ("Section 220"). The Section 220 Demand requested inspection of documents and information related to i) Bingham's affiliation with Canyon Bridge, ii) the Company and/or Canyon Bridge's potential acquisition of Lattice, (iii) the Board and management's compliance with the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and (iv) the Company's list of stockholders and information regarding the 2017 annual meeting. The purpose of the Section 220 Demand was primarily to investigate breaches of fiduciary duty by Bingham and the Board, identify what steps, if any, the Board has taken to remedy these breaches, and determine if, and what, additional steps need to be taken to protect the Company from harm associated with these breaches.On January 26, 2017 - and in violation of Section 220 - Cypress refused to produce books and records in response to the Section 220 Demand. Faced with continued Cypress Board intransigence, Rodgers filed a lawsuit on January 27, 2017 to compel production of these materials. The case is captioned Rodgers v. Cypress Semiconductor Corp., C.A. No. 2017-0070, in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware.Prior to initiating the lawsuit and nominating directors, Rodgers sent multiple letters to the Cypress Board in an effort to engage in a private conversation about resolving these issues in Cypress's best interest. However, the Board ignored the letters, rejected the Section 220 Demand, and has taken no action to address the concerns Rodgers has raised.Rodgers then tried to resolve these issues privately with the Cypress Board and reach a settlement that would avert the need to make his concerns public. After perfunctory interviews of the two nominees, however, the Cypress Board responded only with a hasty "settlement proposal" that failed to address the two main issues raised in the lawsuit directly, either with a proposed process for addressing those issues in the future or with a proposed structure that enable those issues to be addressed.Rodgers concluded, "Cypress is a company that was built to last for the long term through a commitment on the part of every employee to 'do what is right for Cypress,' one of our Core Values. I believe the current Board has failed to honor that commitment. As a concerned stockholder and a believer in both the Core Values and the Cypress Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, I've nominated two highly qualified directors to put Cypress back on the right track."Additional Information and Where to Find ItT.J. Rodgers is the co-founder of the Company. Rodgers, J. Daniel McCranie and Camillo Martino are participants in the solicitation of proxies from stockholders in connection with the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") of the Company.

China protests South Korea's antimissile system - with consumer boycotts; South Korean goods have a huge market in neighboring China. But those exports are now a weapon for Beijing in times of conflict.The Christian Science MonitorMarch 4, 2017 SaturdayCopyright 2017 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights ReservedSection: WorldLength: 715 wordsByline: Mengqi Sun StaffBodySouth Korean products, from cars to pop stars, have a huge market in neighboring country China. But China is increasingly using its consumer buying power as a foreign policy weapon.A series of boycotts by Chinese consumers gained momentum this week as a kind of protest against South Korea's adoption of a US-built missile defense system.  While South Korea is not the first country targeted by Chinese consumers (Japanese and US companies have also been boycotted), the latest effort suggests a growing willingness by the Chinese government to use consumer purchasing power as a means of sanctioning other countries.On Friday, Beijing denied any knowledge of such sanctions and continued to condemn Seoul's decision to deploy the US-built Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense program (THAAD). China says THAAD threatens its security, as the radar reaches into Chinese territory, thus theoretically enabling Washington and Seoul to monitor Chinese flights and missile launches."There are absolutely no anti-THAAD campaigns in China, still less violent campaigns," said Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang on Friday, reported the Associated Press. "Instead of chasing shadows that don't exist, we hope the South Korean side will heed the voice of the people and take concrete actions to avoid causing further damage to bilateral relations."But several government-controlled Chinese media have called for coordinated voluntary boycotts against South Korea's imports, especially the retail chain Lotte for its involvement in THAAD, The Christian Science Monitor reported on Wednesday. The Seoul-headquartered Lotte Group operates 99 large discount chain stores, 13 small supermarkets, and five department stores in China."The land swap the board of the unlisted Lotte Group approved on Monday trades part of a golf course with land from the government. The golf course, owned by Lotte, is in the Seongju region, southeast of Seoul, and is also the military's preferred site for the THAAD system. In exchange for the land, the government agreed to give Lotte military property."The objection quickly escalated this week, as several Chinese retailers pulled Lotte products from their shelves while protests broke out outside Lotte stores in China. On Thursday, a Lotte affiliate, Lotte Duty Free, said its website had also been the target of a suspected Chinese cyberattack.The diplomatic tensions have also spread to tourism. South Korea has been a popular destination for Chinese tourists in recent years. Approximately eight million Chinese citizens visited South Korea last year, accounting for nearly half of the country's total visitors.South Korea's state-run tourist agency said on Friday that Beijing has urged its travel agencies to stop selling group trips to South Korea. At least one travel company, Tuniu, has already complied, citing its objection to the deployment of THAAD in a statement on Friday, according to CNN.Korean cultural exports popular with Chinese audiences are also being swept up in this political dispute, as China blocked videos of South Korean music and TV dramas on several streaming services this past weekend, Billboard reported on Tuesday.This is not the first time that Chinese consumers have expressed their anger and disapproval on international issues. In 2012, amid an ongoing territorial dispute over the Senkaku Islands, also known as the Diaoyu Islands, Chinese consumers targeted Japanese cars. To protest the UN ruling in favor of the Philippines in a territorial dispute in the South China Sea last July, products associated with the United States, including the fast-food franchise KFC and iPhones, were the subject of boycotts, as the Monitor noted.Some see the latest boycotts as a sign that China, the world's second largest economy, may use this tool more freely in the future. "What's happening to Korean companies now is a pretty good playbook for what might happen to US firms over the next year," Andrew Gilholm, director of analysis for China and North Asia at Control Risks told Reuters. "Rather than the big dramatic trade war ... it's probably more likely to be manifested as regulatory harassment of companies - one of the lower intensity tools for China."This report includes material from the Associated Press and Reuters.Load-Date: March 4, 2017End of Document

Senior China government adviser criticizes web censorshipAssociated Press InternationalMarch 4, 2017 Saturday 7:15 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 423 wordsDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - A senior Chinese government adviser has warned that the country's internet censorship is hampering scientific research and economic development, in a rare public criticism of a sensitive policy that the government has vigorously defended.Slow access to overseas academic websites have forced domestic researchers to buy software to circumvent China's site-blocking firewall, or even travel overseas to conduct research, Luo Fuhe, vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, told reporters in Beijing.

Selkirk College Formalizes Cooperation with Leader in Chinese Ski Resort IndustryTargeted News ServiceMarch 8, 2017 Wednesday 11:47 PM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 581 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: CASTLEGAR, British Columbia BodySelkirk College issued the following news release:Selkirk College has formalized its relationship with AXIS Leisure Management Ltd, a leader in China's on-the-verge ski resort industry, strengthening its role as a player in the vast opportunity existing in the changing country.This Memorandum of Understanding confirms ongoing cooperation between Selkirk College Ski Resort Operations & Management (SROAM) Program and Axis, a Beijing group specializing in leisure resort project development from concept to completion founded by Justin Downes, a leader in the Canadian industry who is now working on developing the ski industry in China."It's very encouraging to have a formal agreement signed with Axis and Selkirk College," says Bob Falle, School Chair of Hospitality & Tourism. "Networking with Justin has been valuable for us as we make connections in the up-and-coming Chinese ski industry. It's the fastest growing mountain resort industry in the world and the resorts are in need of training and ski industry expertise. We want to share what we know with the Chinese ski industry."Winter sports are emerging in China - rapidly - but they are still at the beginning stages of development. Selkirk College is collaborating with mountain resort industry to provide expertise and cooperate on programs and projects while securing opportunities for SROAM students, faculty and alumni. Falle's first contact was made with Downes seven years ago and that year alumnus Doug Sharpe became the first student to start his lasting career in the mountain resort industry in China.The number of ski resorts in China is growing exponentially from 50 in 2000 to 298 in 2010 and 568 in 2015 according to China Ski Industry White Book, a comprehensive data report published by Chinese industry.China's increasingly wealthy middle class is interested in winter sports such as skiing and with that comes vacationing in destination resorts featuring fine food, spa treatments and novelties like virtual reality ski simulators. Leisure time is new to people of China."The previous generation worked six days a week and they didn't have a concept of what leisure time was," says Falle. "The north parts of China experience winter yet only now are people exploring winter sports like hockey or skiing."Last October, Falle travelled to China for the first ever World Winter Sports Expo in Beijing put on by the Chinese government. He went with Selkirk College's Pat Bidart, Instructional Dean of Hospitality & Tourism. Downes encouraged his Canadian colleagues to set up booth at the expo assuring it was a must-attend event."The Chinese government has set a goal of getting 300 million more people involved in winter sports in the next five years leading up to the 2022 Winter Olympic Games being held in Beijing and nearby Zhangjiakou," says Bidart. "While we were at the World Snow Sports Expo, we met with ski resort companies to find out what training they need. We also met with the Tourism Institute of Beijing Union University to explore offering our ski resort program at their ultra-modern state-of-the-art institute."This would be a boon for Selkirk College providing opportunities for both faculty and students, explains Bidart who worked in China, among other countries, establishing post-secondary programs in agriculture and business prior to joining Selkirk."It's very exciting for us to be part of what's happening there," she says.Copyright Targeted News Services11A-Kumar-5798817 11A-KumarLoad-Date: March 9, 2017End of Document

Platts China Oil Analytics: China Apparent Oil Demand in December Rose 2.3%; Full-Year Apparent Demand Increased 1.3% to 11.35 million b/dPR NewswireFebruary 13, 2017 Monday 1:00 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1207 wordsDateline: SINGAPORE, Feb. 13, 2017 BodyChina's apparent* oil demand in December 2016 rose 2.3% year over year to 11.69 million barrels per day (b/d), according to an analysis of Chinese government data by S&P Global Platts, the leading independent provider of information and benchmark prices for the commodities and energy markets.Refinery throughput in December last year averaged 11.31 million b/d, data from China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed January 20. This was up 3.6% year over year to a new record high, as refinery maintenance tapered off and production picked up in preparation for higher demand in the first quarter of 2017.Platts China Oil Analytics, an S&P Global Platts on-line analysis platform for supply/demand and trade data, has adjusted runs for December upwards to 11.63 million b/d based on data on independent refinery run rates.China's imports of key oil products - fuel oil, gasoil, jet fuel, gasoline, naphtha and liquid petroleum gas (LPG) -- averaged 1.0 million b/d in December, data from China's General Administration of Customs showed. Exports rose to 972,000 b/d from November's 851,000 b/d. This means net imports during December averaged 62,000 b/d, slumping 88% from the same month in 2015.When using official government data for calculations, China's apparent oil demand in 2016 averaged 11.11 million b/d in 2016, declining 0.8%. However Platts China Oil Analytics believes refinery processing volumes last year averaged 11.08 million b/d - versus 10.83 million b/d reported by the NBS. Last year's increase followed significantly higher runs by independent refiners, which received beginning late 2015 the right to import crude oil. These refiners, mainly in eastern Shandong, raised utilization rates to an average 54% last year, up from approximately 40% in 2015. Thus, this group likely saw overall runs increase by more than 500,000 b/d in 2016.With the adjustment in refinery runs, apparent oil demand for the year therefore trended higher than if calculated using government data, at 11.35 million b/d."This represented a 1.3% increase in 2016,"saidSong Yen Ling, senior analyst with Platts China Oil Analytics."That said, the pace of growth fell in 2016 from 6.6% in 2015, when oil demand had been boosted by a crude oil price drop to levels just over $50/b."Platts China Oil Analytics, adjusting for higher production in gasoline and gasoil than was reported by China's government, estimates that gasoline apparent demand in December averaged 2.87 million b/d. This marks a 6.9% increase from a year ago, while gasoil apparent demand fell 2.4% over the same period to an average 3.51 million b/d. Gasoil demand took a hit on lower winter temperatures that hampered industrial activity, as well as transport disruptions due to both colder conditions in north China and severe smog in parts of the country, the latter of which prompted some local governments to institute curbs on transport activity.Fuel oil apparent demand in December continued to decline on a year-over-year basis, dropping 22.4% to 783,000 b/d on dampened buying from independent refiners.Platts China Oil Analytics estimates that 2016 gasoline apparent demand expanded by 7.8% and gasoil apparent demand declined by 0.6%, further reflections of the Chinese economy's move toward more consumption-focused growth.In the first quarter of 2017, demand remained muted until after the Lunar New Year holidays. Gasoil sales picked up in early February in preparation for the spring planting season, while gasoline demand remained steady supported by increased travel during the holiday season. Refineries are expected to reduce their runs slightly as a number of maintenance programs have already been scheduled, particularly from March going into the second quarter.MONTHLY CHINA OIL DATA IN '000 B/DDec '16Dec '15% ChgNov '16Oct '16Sep '16Aug '16Net crude imports8,5227,7879.47,8586,7397,9737,715Crude production3,9664,260-6.93,9313,7943,9043,889Apparent demand11,69111,4242.311,89811,24911,15710,851Sources: China's General Administration of Customs, National Bureau of Statistics, S&P Global PlattsMonth-to-month demand in China is generally viewed to be subjected to short-term anomalies which are of interest and important to note, but often fail to reveal the country's underlying demand trends. Year-to-year comparisons are viewed by the marketplace to be more indicative of the country's energy profile.*S&P Global Platts calculates China's apparent or implied oil demand on the basis of crude throughput volumes at the domestic refineries and net oil product imports. S&P Global Platts also takes into account undeclared revisions in NBS historical data.The government releases data on imports, exports, domestic crude production and refinery throughput data, but does not give official data on the country's actual oil consumption figure and oil stockpiles. Official statistics on oil storage are released intermittently.In view of some significant shifts in Chinese consumption and trade patterns in recent years, S&P Global Platts has revised its methodology starting July 2015 to include production and net imports of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), as well as imports of petroleum bitumen blend, a popular imported feedstock for China's teapot refineries.S&P Global Platts has also refined its calculation of exports of jet fuel and fuel oil to exclude international marine bunker sales and aviation fuel delivered to international flights. This also impacts net imports, and hence apparent demand calculations.  All historical figures used for comparison have also been calculated using the new methodology to ensure consistency.S&P Global Platts aims to release its monthly calculation of China's apparent demand between the 18th and 26th of every month via press release and via its website.

Music Business Regains Confidence In the Chinese Market; Japan-based Entertainment Management Company and Music Producer Avex Group Joins Hands with China-based NetEase Cloud MusicPR NewswireMarch 2, 2017 Thursday 9:00 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1353 wordsDateline: HANGZHOU, China, March 2, 2017 BodyChinese digital music platforms are gaining more and more attention from music entertainment firms in other countries. On February 27th, leading Chinese digital music platform NetEase Cloud Music and Japan's biggest music entertainment firm Avex Group Holdings Inc. announced the signing of an agreement forming a strategic partnership that grants the Chinese platform an exclusive license in mainland China to the copyright of all the songs in the Japanese firm's massive portfolio. Many of Japan's leading artists can be found in the portfolio including Ayumi Hamasaki, Every Little Thing, Koda Kumi, Ai Otsuka, AAA and the Wagakki Band. The entire music collection in the portfolio is already available on the NetEase Cloud Music platform for any Chinese user who would like to give some of the tunes a listen.Chinese music industry insiders said that after years of talks between the two countries' many firms involved in the music trade going nowhere, this "breakthrough" agreement between NetEase and Avex could mark the beginning of a new era for the sector and a harbinger for similar agreements, not only with other Japanese entertainment firms, but also with owners of large music portfolios in other countries, creating an environment where music, whether from Japan or elsewhere, enjoys the same legal protections in China as it does in the rest of the developed world.Interest in music from other cultures, especially from Japan, grows in China.NetEase Cloud Music CEO Zhu Yiwen, in his presentation accompanying the announcement, explained that the Chinese market has developed an active interest in and is witnessing a rapidly increasing demand for Japanese music. According to usage data from the music platform, there has been, what he termed, an explosive increase in the number of times that Japanese songs have been listened to, especially songs associated with Japanese animation, comics and games (ACG), with the number of music streams from Japan increasing 80% over the previous year, while ACG-related music saw its streams soar a whopping 280%. The same data also reflects a rapidly growing interest in Western music, with streams of songs by North American and European acts jumping 75% year-on-year.The same data shows that it is mainly the youth segment, especially fans born after 1990, expressing the growing interest in Japanese and Western music, indicating a major shift in the kind of music that can be expected to be consumed in China looking forward.Before NetEase Cloud Music and Avex announced their partnership, none of the music platforms in China had anything amounting to a sizeable Japanese album collection with proper copyright protections, limiting access for Chinese audiophiles who were developing an interest in the music. The growing interest created a need for a legal platform with a healthy inventory through which the music could be enjoyed.Western music was also receiving more and more notice as a result of the efforts on behalf of global players, among them Universal Music Group and Warner Music, to create an audience for the genre. Yet, based on demand from Chinese audiophiles, there is still huge room for growth. According to a survey conducted by NetEase, 77% of the users of the platform expressed a preference for Western music, even going as far as displaying a like for it over homegrown talent.The findings created a win-win opportunity for NetEase Cloud Music and Avex GroupThe rapidly growing market for Japanese music and the lack of a legal framework for consumption provided a perfect opportunity from which the partnership between NetEase and Avex was born.Released in April 2013, NetEase Cloud Music, the on-demand music-streaming service of Chinese internet technology giant NetEase, Inc., has enjoyed rapid growth coupled with a good reputation in the mainland Chinese market, while becoming one of the leading channels through which Chinese music lovers discover and enjoy new music. By July, 2016, the platform boasted a fan base of 200 million users. Backed by a sophisticated and highly customizable recommendation system, an inventory with tens of millions of songs, the full music catalogs from more than a thousand of China's leading acts, coupled with massive song lists in addition to commentary from Chinese music critics with the largest followings, NetEase Cloud Music has become one of the top music social platforms in China.Avex Group, the holding company for a group of entertainment-related subsidiaries based in Japan, is the largest of its kind in in the country as well as one of the biggest independent record companies worldwide. Avex has dominated the market in terms of record sales in Japan for years and manages many of the country's leading acts, including Ayumi Hamasaki, Every Little Thing, Koda Kumi, Ai Otsuka, AAA and the Wagakki Band.The exclusive distribution rights for mainland China that NetEase gains as a result of the cooperation assures the Chinese platform access to Japan's biggest music database, and, beyond the fact that it makes NetEase one of the platforms with China's largest song inventories, creates an environment that is expected to accelerate the interest in Japanese music among Chinese audiophiles. To Avex's benefit, the partnership, in large measure, smooths the way for entry into the Chinese market for its artists and their music. With a further deepening of the cooperation expected in due course, Avex and NetEase Cloud Music foresee the co-hosting of offline events including concerts and fan meet-ups with Japanese acts, creating even more opportunities for the acts to broaden their fan base in the Chinese market. As for music fans in China, by creating a legal framework through which a massive inventory of the music can be consumed, the cooperation further satisfies the increasing demand for Japanese music.Chinese Government policies create the necessary legal framework for the importation of copyrighted musicOver the past several years, the rise of internet platforms put the majority of China's traditional record labels out of business. The ease at which music could be sampled, streamed and downloaded from the internet, via downloadable apps and on video platforms proved no match for the physical media -- vinyl, cassettes, even MP3 players -- through which music had traditionally been consumed. This disruption of the market coupled with a lack of understanding about the importance of copyright among Chinese audiences led to an environment where piracy became rampant. The Japanese record companies were keenly aware of the market situation in China, and, until this deal was struck, simply refused to consider any kind of collaboration with Chinese music platforms.Since July 2015, China has put in place mechanisms creating stricter supervision over digital music copyright, creating an environment where music backed by such copyright could develop a market. As the room for pirated music keeps narrowing, Japanese music with proper protections, under the aegis of Avex Group, supported by government policies and the newly-signed cooperation with the NetEase Cloud Music platform, will, for the first time, have its biggest opportunity for expansion in the market. The deal between the two entities will create access to the broadest range of fans across China. Music from Japan can be expected to become a part of what audiophiles across the country sample, listen to and fall in love with on a day-to-day basis.This change in environment, and the deal between the two players, sends the right signals to the global music entertainment industry and opens the door for them to engage with the Chinese music market that they had so long ignored. Especially for companies who seldom cooperate with mainland China on digital music, the partnership of Avex Group from Japan and Chinese music platform NetEase Cloud Music provides an excellent model for future deals.To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/music-business-regains-confidence-in-the-chinese-market-300413872.htmlSOURCE NetEase Cloud MusicCONTACT: Luoan Chen, +86-571-8985-3872, hzchenluoan@corp.netease.comLoad-Date: March 3, 2017End of Document

Platts China Oil Analytics: China Apparent Oil Demand Rose 4% Year over Year in NovemberPR NewswireJanuary 12, 2017 Thursday 12:00 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1151 wordsDateline: SINGAPORE, Jan. 12, 2017 BodyChina's apparent* oil demand in November 2016 hit the second highest level on record to 11.44 million barrels per day (b/d), according to an analysis of Chinese government data by S&P Global Platts, the leading independent provider of information and benchmark prices for the commodities and energy markets. This was 4.1% higher than the same month in 2015.Refinery throughput in November 2016 averaged 11.18 million b/d, data from China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed December 12. This was up 3.9% year over year and 0.8% higher than in October, likely due to an uptick in runs toward the end of the year, as well as fewer refineries shut for maintenance.China's imports of key oil products rose to a six-month high of 1.1 million b/d, driven by higher light distillate inflows, data from the General Administration of Customs showed. Exports were stable month on month at 851,000 b/d, bringing net imports during November to around 250,000 b/d. This was in contrast to October, when China turned a marginal net exporter of oil products.Overall apparent oil demand over January to November averaged 11.07 million b/d, a 0.9% contraction year on year, although the pace of decline slowed from January to October, which recorded a 1.4% contraction.Calculations of apparent oil demand using official data sources however, may not be fully accurate given that some refinery output is not captured by the NBS.Platts China Oil Analytics, an S&P Global Platts on-line platform for supply/demand and trade data,estimates that China's refinery runs in November were 11.54 million b/d, which means apparent demand for the month likely averaged 11.83 million b/d, representing a 7.8% increase year on year.Adjusting for higher production in gasoline and gasoil than was reported by the government, Platts China Oil Analytics estimates that gasoline apparent demand in November averaged 2.9 million b/d, a 1% increase year on year, while gasoil apparent demand rose 6.2% over the same period to 3.72 million b/d. Fuel oil apparent demand rebounded month on month to 687,000 b/d, rising 7.2% from October on improved bunker demand although buying from independent refiners remained weak.Moving into early 2017, refiners are expected to ramp up throughput operations to prepare for the Lunar New Year holidays."Gasoline and jet fuel demand for the transport sector are likely to rise significantly prior to the start of the holidays as people across the country travel home to celebrate the new year, which falls on January 28," saidSong Yen Ling, senior analyst with Platts China Oil Analytics. "Following that, gasoil demand is expected to pick up with the restart of industrial activity as well as the spring farming season in south China."Despite the pick-up in demand, refiners may maintain the level of oil product exports seen at the end of 2016 because of an expected uptick in refinery runs. Gasoline exports likely averaged 265,000 b/d in the fourth quarter of 2016 while gasoil outflows likely averaged 360,000 b/d.Platts China Oil Analytics expects gasoline outflows to average around 275,000 b/d in the first quarter of 2017 as domestic inventories are at relatively high levels currently, although gasoil exports may ease to 300,000 b/d as refiners have reported holding lower-than-normal stocks and may reserve supplies for the domestic market.MONTHLY CHINA OIL DATA IN '000 B/DNov '16Nov '15% ChgOct '16Sep '16Aug '16Jul '16Net crude imports7,8586,60119.06,7397,9737,7157,287Crude production3,9314,316-8.93,7943,9043,8893,964Apparent demand11,43610,9814.111,12110,85210,75410,559Sources: China's General Administration of Customs, National Bureau of Statistics, S&P Global PlattsMonth-to-month demand in China is generally viewed to be subjected to short-term anomalies which are of interest and important to note, but often fail to reveal the country's underlying demand trends.

HONG KONG MEDIA LOSE INDEPENDENT STANCE AFTER BAD YEAR FOR PRESS FREEDOM IN CHINAStates News ServiceJanuary 20, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 817 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Hong Kong's media last year "gave up its last defenses," making editorial independence in the city a thing of the past, an international press freedom group has said in an annual report.Media outlets in the former British colony, which was promised the maintenance of its traditional rights and freedoms for 50 years after the 1997 handover to China, "utterly gave up" on any stance independent of the ruling Chinese Communist Party, the International Federation of Journalists said on Friday."Not only did it end up as the Mainland's official mouthpiece, but it also took the initiative to patch together lies for the [Chinese] authorities," the report said.The report comes after a U.S. congressional body said Hong Kong has seen continual erosion of the freedoms and autonomy it was promised by Beijing under the terms of the handover treaty."As a result, it is no longer the Fourth Estate, safeguarding justice, but a propaganda tool of the authorities," the IFJ report said, citing "special interviews" granted with detained Hong Kong booksellers held in custody by Chinese police for selling banned political books to mail-order customers across the internal border in mainland China.Slamming the Hong Kong media for running "confessions" from the booksellers and detained legal assistant Zhao Wei, the group said it was clear who was behind their "access.""The interviews were tightly controlled and the journalists did not report on the detainees' whereabouts or physical condition," it said."The outlets' willingness to act as propaganda mouthpieces showed they had surrendered their responsibility to report honestly and defend the public's right to know."China tightens grip on mediaIn mainland China, the government issued a slew of new regulations aimed at tightening controls over foreign-owned media and publishing services, making government approval for content a condition of access to the Chinese market."Foreign companies and joint ventures are forbidden to publish information online that would "harm national unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity, disclose state secrets, endanger social morality or national cultural tradition," the group said.Meanwhile, the limited diversity that was once on offer in China's media industry was drastically curtailed during 2016, after President Xi Jinping visited top media institutions, calling on all media to work on behalf of the ruling Chinese Communist Party."The authorities took over, suspended or shut down several prestigious mainland media outlets that had provided a special "space" for discussion of sensitive topics, including liberalization and reform," the IFJ report said."Through a combination of online controls and offline police actions, they also stifled discussion online and silenced a group of opinion-leading bloggers known as Big Vs," it said.Beijing also appeared more willing than in previous years to take action against foreign journalists if they reported on sensitive topics.Ursula Gauthier, Beijing correspondent for French news magazine L'Obs, was forced to leave China after being accused of "offending" the Chinese people after she suggested that repressive policies in Xinjiang may be linked to a string of violent attacks in recent years.'Very worrying 2016'IFJ Asia-Pacific spokeswoman Serenade Woo said 2016 was a "very worrying" year for journalism in China."One [Causeway Bay bookseller] was actually kidnapped by Chinese agents operating in Hong Kong," Woo said.She also hit out at Hong Kong media outlets for collaborating with Chinese officials."We believe that cooperation with the Chinese authorities is a serious betrayal of professional conduct and erodes confidence in the power of the media to carry out independent monitoring," she said.Meanwhile, Mabel Au, director of Amnesty International Hong Kong, said the Hong Kong government had become much less transparent, excluding online media from traditional press briefings."It is most unfortunate that the Hong Kong government does not accredit some Hong Kong media for government briefings, and doesn't notify them," Au said."The Hong Kong government is lagging behind ... This constitutes an obstacle to freedom of the press," she said.According to Bruce Lui, senior journalism lecturer at Hong Kong's Baptist University, controls on the media by the Chinese government are likely to get still tighter."The entire [Chinese] internet is now under government control," Lui said. "The space for freedom of expression has narrowed significantly.""Where we used to see comments on social events or news on social media or news sites, things have gotten much quieter online," he said."Many of the more outspoken people have been silenced."Reported by Lee Lai for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Ding Wenqi for the Mandarin Service.

Chinese grab for U.S. money transfer giant sets off alarmsPolitico.comMarch 31, 2017 Friday 7:50 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1491 wordsByline: bbender@politico.com,  (Bryan Bender)Highlight: The purchase by Ant Financial, which is partially owned by the Chinese government, poses a test for the Treasury Department oversight body.BodyA Chinese company's plans to acquire U.S. money transfer giant MoneyGram is raising fears that the communist government in Beijing could gain sensitive intelligence on Americans' personal and financial information - including data on thousands of government employees and military personnel. The purchase by Ant Financial, which is partially owned by the Chinese government, also poses a test for the 42-year-old Treasury Department oversight body that has been asked to review the deal to determine any security risks. Lawmakers, national security experts and veterans of the review process say the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States is ill-designed to assess all the national security implications of international mergers in the age of information - including the often-blurry picture of who actually controls foreign firms or who has access to an international company's sensitive data. Moreover, they say, it is severely understaffed to handle the rising number of complicated cases and lacks the authority to address evolving threats in telecommunications, media, agriculture and other industries.In the case of Ant Financial's proposed acquisition of MoneyGram, critics say, the fallout could include exposing personal data on millions of Americans.CFIUS is expected to complete its review during the next several months."If the transaction is approved, China would gain direct access to a significant amount of transactional data in MoneyGram's network," warns Rep. Robert Pittenger, a North Carolina Republican who serves on the Financial Services Committee and is vice chair of the Task Force on Terrorist Financing. "The data would include names, bank account numbers, as well as the location of MoneyGram customers." Like other CFIUS critics, Pittenger wants a more rigorous review process to ensure such deals do not make the U.S. more vulnerable to foreign espionage, blackmail or cyberattacks. Dozens of MoneyGram locations lie inside or within a few miles of some of the largest U.S. military installations, including Fort Bragg, N.C., where soldiers, their families and defense contractors commonly use the company's money transfer services. MoneyGram also has locations in about 200 countries. Pittenger told POLITICO he is concerned that the Chinese government could "leverage this personal information to harass dissidents, journalists and human rights activists who dare challenge the Chinese Communist Party."Personal data can also fuel a variety of cyberattacks, helping hackers trick these targets into giving up login credentials to sensitive accounts.The $880 million deal, announced in January, was described by Ant as "a significant milestone." The combination of the two firms, it said, "will provide greater access, security and simplicity for people around the world to remit funds." The company insists that while Chinese government-owned enterprises, including state-run pension funds, are among Ant Financial's shareholders - making more than 14 percent of the company's ownership - it remains a privately run business. "They are non-controlling stakes, don't participate in management and don't have access to things like consumer data," said Reze Wong, a company spokesman. Others intimately familiar with the company's operations also reject the argument that China's leaders could gain access to data held by MoneyGram, which is headquartered in Dallas, Texas."You don't really understand China if you think that it has government involvement," said one source with direct knowledge who agreed to speak on the condition he not be identified by name. He said Ant "operates like any other private-sector company in the world," in which shareholders are involved in business operations "only at the macro level."Moreover, advocates of the acquisition insist that any personal data now maintained on MoneyGram's computer servers in the U.S. will remain so under the deal and will be subject to U.S. regulations."We would continue to operate as a stand-alone company" and "customer information will continue to be encrypted and stored on our IT systems in Minneapolis in accordance with all applicable data protection requirements," MoneyGram said in a statement to POLITICO. But pressure is building for CFIUS, which is made up of representatives of a variety of federal agencies, to give the case special attention.Among the loudest voices is Euronet, a Kansas City electronic payment firm that has made a counteroffer to acquire MoneyGram. In a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin this week, the company's CEO, Michael Brown, said that the amount of personal information that MoneyGram requires of its customers raises a series of national security questions, including whether that private data should be controlled by a Chinese company.That information can include Social Security numbers, dates of birth, employer data, the source of any transfer, the reason for it, the recipient of the funds and the customer's relationship with them.Similar details are also required for the beneficiary of any funds transferred through MoneyGram. "The company that purchases MoneyGram will acquire sensitive information and must be in a position to safeguard and keep it secure. It must also ensure it is never misused," Brown wrote. Ant pushes back against those claims. "Ant Financial volunteered and sought the CFIUS review of our proposed combination with MoneyGram and is steadfast in our commitment to protecting data of U.S. consumer," the company said in a statement in response to Brown's letter. Euronet has also enlisted The Cohen Group, a D.C. consulting firm run by former Secretary of Defense and Republican Sen. William Cohen, to help make the case that the Ant deal would threaten national security - in the hopes of winning what amounts to a bidding war.The Treasury Department, for its part, declined to address questions about the case. "We can't comment on or even acknowledge CFIUS filings," said an agency spokesman. A major question for many remains who actually controls Ant?The ownership "is difficult to discern," said a former U.S. government official familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity, "especially given that Ant's ownership appears to include a significant Chinese government component."The official points out that Ant now offers its customers credit scoring services and says it is unclear whether that information is ever shared with any Chinese government entity - and whether MoneyGram would also offer such services if acquired by Ant."This acquisition runs the risk of providing Ant Financial - and through that likely the Chinese government - access to personally identifiable information and personal financial data on millions of Americans," said another former senior U.S. official with experience in such reviews."That is a privacy concern, but it is also a national security concern," he added, citing recent allegations of Chinese government efforts to obtain sensitive information on U.S. citizens, such as the hacking of the Office of Personnel Management, which exposed the personnel files of over 20 million federal workers."The Chinese have a track record of trying to obtain personally identifiable information on lots of Americans," the former official said. "For what purpose? You could figure out who could be vulnerable to being targeted for intelligence gathering purposes or who has done things that might make them vulnerable to coercion or blackmail."But settling such questions poses a real challenge for the inter-agency committee that has just begun reviewing the proposed MoneyGram deal. "The number of cases there are record setting," said another former official who participated in recent CFIUS reviews. "They are really stretched right now. The CFIUS cases are also more complex, involving a range of industries to include security-related software, telecommunications and other more traditional American companies such as railroads.These transactions, the former official said, are "much more complicated, in part because a lot of them are Chinese."The Government Accountability Office, the oversight arm of Congress, is in the midst of a study to determine whether CFIUS needs more authority and resources to assess the national security implications of such deals. GAO is also looking at whether other agencies such as the FBI should be given a formal role in the review process, and whether cases involving Russia or China should get special attention. Pittenger, the North Carolina congressman who requested GAO review the obscure CFIUS process, is working to ensure that, at a minimum, the MoneyGram case gets that extra attention."Our national security, especially in the Pacific, is rooted in our ability to hold the Chinese government accountable," he told POLITICO, "as well as opposing policies which provide China any knowledge of the personal financial activities of American citizens."Load-Date: April 3, 2017End of Document

China: Suspension of Feminist Social Media Another Example of 'Zero Tolerance'Targeted News ServiceFebruary 24, 2017 Friday 8:34 PM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 619 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyPEN America issued the following statement on the suspension of a feminist group's social media accounts:The suspension of a feminist group's social media accounts underscores China's "zero tolerance" policy for free speech and human rights, said PEN America in a statement today."On February 20, 2017, the Weibo account "Feminist Voices" was suspended for 30 days. "Feminist Voices" is a media project of the Beijing-based NGO Media Monitor for Women Network, which works to promote gender equality and advocates on gender-based issues within the country. The organizers of "Feminist Voices" transferred their information to another Weibo account, "Fairness for Women," but that account was shut down the next day. Weibo is a Chinese social media platform that is roughly equivalent to Twitter, with 297 million monthly active users."The suspension is believed to be the result of a Feminist Voices post discussing the planned "women's strike" in Washington D.C., on March 8 (International Woman's Day). Feminist Voices had posted an article about the women's strike on February 14. The post was censored, and their account was suspended suspended days later. In informing Feminist Voices of the suspension, social media company Sina, which operates Weibo, sent a notice saying that the group's posted content "violates national laws and regulations," without further explanation. Women's rights advocates responding to the suspension have reportedly said that the order to suspend Feminist Voices' account came from the Cyberspace Administration, a government regulatory body."Chinese authorities maintain a strict system of censorship over all online speech and information. Under Chinese laws and regulations, social media companies are expected to censor their users' posts or face harsh punishments themselves, including the shutdown of their company. Censorship guidelines include "refraining from producing, posting or disseminating pernicious information that may jeopardize state security and disrupt social stability..." or "spread superstition and obscenity."The suspension of a feminist group's social media account is inherently troubling. What is even more troubling is the likelihood that Feminist Voices was suspended for discussing the women's strike in Washington D.C. If this was indeed the reason, it demonstrates that the Chinese government sees even expressions of international solidarity with demonstrations elsewhere in the world as potentially threatening," said James Tager, PEN America's Free Expression Programs Manager. "PEN America calls upon the Chinese government to recognize the right of all its citizens to speak out in solidarity with others around the world, without fear that their words will be censored."PEN America, the literary and free expression advocacy organization, has long been engaged on advocacy against censorship in China, and for the rights of individual Chinese writers who have been imprisoned for their free expression. PEN America's recent work on China includes its October 2016 report "Darkened Screen," on Chinese governmental restrictions on foreign media. On January 24, 2017, PEN America re-examined the 2015 case of "The Feminist Five", the detention of five Chinese feminist activists and the resulting domestic and international outcry."PEN America stands at the intersection of literature and human rights to protect open expression in the United States and worldwide. We champion the freedom to write, recognizing the power of the word to transform the world. Our mission is to unite writers and their allies to celebrate creative expression and defend the liberties that make it possible."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-5787694 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: February 25, 2017End of Document

'Look, a Bird!' Trolling by DistractionAtlantic OnlineJanuary 27, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1251 wordsByline: Kaveh WaddellBodyIn April 2014, an attack at the main railway station in Urumqi, a city in the northwest Chinese province of Xinjiang, killed three people and injured dozens more. The incident-an explosion followed by a knife attack-came at the end of President Xi Jinping's first visit to the restive region since he took office, during which he had promised to ramp up the government's response to terrorism.Immediately after, the Chinese government's online-censorship apparatus sprung into action. Searches for "Urumqi blast" were blocked on Baidu, the country's largest search engine, and            on Sina Weibo, a Twitter-like social network that's very popular in China. Meanwhile, paid government trolls flooded Sina Weibo and various other Chinese social networks with more than 3,000 posts, in a coordinated burst of activity.But, curiously, the posts had nothing to do with what had just happened in Urumqi. They didn't start contentious debates, or push back against political arguments. Instead, they waxed poetic about China's good governance, economic opportunities for Chinese people, and the "           mass line."They were distractions. Rather than engage with chatter around the attack in Xinjiang, or try to tamp down political expression, the posts seemed to be designed to derail the conversation. Other big events-riots in another part of Xinjiang province in July 2013, for example, or a pair of important political meetings in February 2014-were met with similar spikes in government-sponsored social-media activity.The coordinated volleys of posts are described in            a research paper that will be published this year in the American Political Science Review, in which three scholars-Harvard's Gary King, Stanford's Jennifer Pan, and Margaret Roberts at UC San Diego-analyzed tens of thousands of posts written by China's official social-media trolls.The fact that the government coordinates friendly social-media posts isn't new: The people behind them are known colloquially as the "50 Cent Party," for the rumored sum they're paid for each post. (They're not actually members of a political party.) But by studying a large archive of emails leaked from one of the internet propaganda offices in Ganzhou-a city located in China's southeastern Jiangxi province-the researchers were able to piece together details about how the operation works, and make some inferences about the campaign's motivations.Before setting out to research the 50 Cent Party, the scholars largely subscribed to the conventional wisdom among academics and journalists: that ordinary citizens were enlisted to debate with rabble rousers, and take a hard pro-government stance. Instead, they found very few instances of 50 Cent posts engaging in a back-and-forth, and a large volume of innocuous "cheerleading" posts that simply express goodwill about the government and its policies. Criticism on social media is largely tolerated, they found, but as soon as the risk of mobilization and collective action begins to loom, the government jumps in to disrupt the conversation.Throughout the project, the researchers enjoyed unusual access to the inner workings of the Chinese government. The emails leaked from the Zhanggong propaganda office, for example, included the text of more than 43,000 50 Cent posts, sent from commenters proving that they'd completed their assignments, and messages from the propaganda office to higher-level offices.The commenters themselves, it turned out, were nearly all identifiable as government workers. (There's no evidence, the researchers said, that the government used bots to amplify its message.) They worked in various offices and bureaus, and didn't appear to be paid at all for the posts. It may be that they were simply expected to post coordinated messages as part of their government jobs.In emails from the propaganda office, commenters were instructed to "promote unity and stability through positive publicity," and to "actively guide public opinion during emergency events"-where "emergency events" refer to events that might stoke collective action.Based on what they found in the leaked archive, the researchers extrapolated the scale of the propaganda operation to the rest of China, estimating that the loosely-defined 50 Cent Party posts a total of 448 million messages on social media every year. "If these estimates are correct, a large proportion of government web site comments, and about one of every 178 social media posts on commercial sites, are fabricated by the government," the researchers wrote.To check their assumptions, the research team did something unusual: They reached out directly to social-media users they suspected of being 50 Cent party members. To make sure they'd developed a good model of telling 50 Cent posts from organic posts, they simply asked, kindly and in in Chinese, "I saw your comment, it's really inspiring, I want to ask, do you have any public opinion guidance management, or online commenting experience?"When they asked people they knew to be in the 50 Cent Party (because their information had turned up in the email leak) 57 percent admitted to being a part of a government operation. When they asked suspected 50 Cent members, 59 percent confirmed their status. Since the difference between the proportions was not statistically significant, the researchers concluded that they were accurately able to guess which posts belonged to 50 Cent commenters.Even more unexpectedly, the researchers got semi-official confirmation that their findings were largely correct from the Chinese government itself. After an early draft of the research attracted media attention last May, the Global Times, a newspaper with strong ties to the government, published an editorial about it. The piece, which was written only in Chinese, defended the practices that the study uncovered: "Chinese society is generally in agreement regarding the necessity of 'public opinion guidance,'" it read. (A quick study of social-media responses didn't support the editorial's conclusion: While only 15 percent of comments on the newspaper's website were critical of "public opinion guidance," 63 percent of comments on Weibo were disapproving.)The piece also didn't dispute any of the material points in the research, nor did it seek to discredit the contents of the leaked email archive. "For all practical purposes, the editorial constitutes the answer to a simple sample survey question," the researchers wrote. "That is, instead of asking [50 Cent Party] members about their status as we [did earlier], we (inadvertently) asked the Chinese government whether they agreed with our results, and they effectively concurred."The distraction tactics that China's troll army favors could just as easily be deployed elsewhere. Debating detractors directly, or censoring them outright can backfire-political scientists have found that more repression is sometimes correlated with increased mobilization-but derailing the conversation or diluting the intensity of collective criticism can be a sneaky way to defuse it."The activity and especially the scale we discovered in China was surprising and even shocking to us (and others), but the general strategy is not unique. You can find aspects of it on smaller scales from elected officials, corporation heads, citizens, and numerous others," wrote Gary King, one of the researchers behind the study, in an email. "Usually it is not the official policy of a government."Read            'Look, a Bird!' Trolling by Distraction on theatlantic.comLoad-Date: January 29, 2017End of Document

Zecotek Provides Update to LFS Crystal MOU with Chinese PET OEMMarketwiredMarch 21, 2017 Tuesday 12:15 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Marketwire, L.P. All Rights ReservedLength: 901 wordsDateline: SINGAPORE; Mar 21, 2017BodyZecotek Photonics Inc. (TSX VENTURE: ZMS) (FRANKFURT: W1I) (OTC PINK: ZMSPF), a developer of leading-edge photonics technologies for industrial, healthcare and scientific markets, is pleased to provide an update to the memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Chinese medical OEM to purchase LFS scintillation crystals for a new line of medical scanners as previously announced on March 23, 2016. The MOU called for Zecotek's wholly owned subsidiary Zecotek Imaging Systems to supply LFS crystal elements to the Chinese OEM for up to 200 positron emission tomography (PET) medical scanners over the next 5 years, for clinics and hospitals across China. Due to the changing medical scanner landscape in China, the proposed agreement now calls for the Chinese OEM to purchase LFS crystal based arrays through the Shanghai EBO Optoelectronics Company (EBO)."With the recent announcement that the EBO Opto-electronics will now use Zecotek's patented LFS scintillation crystals exclusively for PET scanner crystal arrays, the Chinese OEM requested a change to the MOU whereby they can purchase the LFS directly from EBO, based on the Zecotek-EBO arrangement," said Dr. A.F. Zerrouk, Chairman, President, and CEO of Zecotek Photonics Inc. "We have agreed to work through EBO because the change does not significantly affect the returns to Zecotek for the sales of LFS crystals contemplated in the MOU. Zecotek will continue to supply LFS crystals for up to 200 PET medical scanning units to be built by the OEM over the next five years. The delay in the execution of the MOU, was due to design configuration modifications to use arrays rather than single elements as well as other adjustments necessary to meet new stringent government regulations. The Chinese OEM has resumed its purchase of LFS crystals in array forms through EBO. Zecotek is working with EBO to develop a schedule to meet the OEM's production plan. We will provide a more quantitative update related to the MOU in the near future. We will continue to work with EBO and other PET OEMs to continue the growth in the sales of our patented LFS scintillation crystals in China."EBO Opto-electronics is the largest crystal array producer and supplier in China, and their arrays are used by many of the top OEMs in the growing domestic PET medical imaging market. Recent changes to the regulatory landscape in China has caused OEMs to invest in both management and technology necessary to manufacture medical scanning devices domestically. With the Chinese government using incentives to encourage domestic hospitals to use Chinese-made medical devices to control soaring healthcare costs, domestic OEMS are now producing and installing high quality medical devices across China and they are now competing on a global basis.About Shanghai EBO Optoelectronics Co.

FACT SHEET: THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S RECORD ON THE TRADE ENFORCEMENTStates News ServiceJanuary 12, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 6220 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the White House:WTO Case Announced by USTR Builds on Strong Trade Enforcement RecordFrom day one, President Obama and his Administration have vigorously worked to build a far more capable trade enforcement system. The result has been a strong record of enforcement victories that are helping to level the playing field for American workers and businesses. The Administration has enlisted all relevant agencies and used all the tools at its disposal to identify, monitor, enforce, and resolve the full range of international trade issues, so that American workers, farmers, and businesses receive the benefits they are due under our trade and investment agreements and to prevent American jobs from being threatened by unfair trading practices.Aggressively Pursuing and Winning Cases at the World Trade Organization: Today, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) is launching a new trade enforcement action against China at the World Trade Organization (WTO) targeting China's unfair subsidies for its aluminum industry. This is the 25th WTO challenge of this Administration and the 16th against China alone. The United States has brought more WTO challenges over the last eight years than any other country. And we've won every single one of these challenges that has been decided.Levying Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duty Penalties on Foreign Industries and Trading Partners at the Highest Rate in 14 Years, Particularly Important to the Steel Industry: The Department of Commerce, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are enforcing 370 trade remedy orders that address dumped goods or unfairly subsidized imports and level the playing field for American workers and businesses.In each of the last two years, Commerce initiated the largest number of new investigations in 14 years. The Administration worked with Congress to secure new legislative authorities that provide a substantial upgrade in our government's trade enforcement capabilities. Commerce has conducted investigations and made final determinations on important cases brought by the American steel industry, finding dumping margins as high as 620 percent on certain products from China.Pursuing Diplomatic Engagement to Uphold Labor Rights, Protect the Environment, and Ensure Intellectual Property Rights Are Enforced: The United States has undertaken initiatives with our free trade agreement partners to strengthen workers' rights in Bahrain, Bangladesh, Burma, Colombia, Honduras, Jordan, Panama, and others. We have pressed our trading partners to effectively implement environmental provisions in our free trade agreements to protect the environment and prevent illegal logging. Trade and Investment Framework Agreements between the United States and more than 50 trading partners and regions around the world have facilitated discussions on enhancing intellectual property rights (IPR) protection and enforcement. We also direct international initiatives to broaden awareness of IPR's important role in addressing international concerns, such as counterfeit medicines and internet piracy, so countries will investigate and prosecute cases of IPR violations.Combating Excess Capacity in Industrial Sectors: The United States led an international coalition to bring together more than thirty countries including both G-20 members and as well as major steel-producing countries that are not in the G-20 to form a new Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity. The Global Forum, co-chaired by the United States, will address market distorting practices that negatively impact trade and the steel industry and workers around the world. Furthermore, we successfully secured significant new commitments from China, including a commitment that it will take further steps beyond its announced plans to progressively reduce its excess capacity, close loss-making "zombie enterprises," and ensure that central government plans and policies do not target the net expansion of capacity in its steel industry.Building Stronger Enforcement Authorities and Coordination: President Obama worked with Congress to pass and sign into law two new pieces of legislation, the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act (also referred to as "Customs" legislation) and the American Trade Enforcement Effectiveness Act (also referred to as the "Level the Playing Field Act"), each of which strengthened our tools for ensuring that our trading partners and foreign industries are competing fairly and following our trade laws. With these new authorities, Commerce, CBP, and ICE have been able to apply consequences for recalcitrant importers that persist in violating our domestic trade laws, increase on-site verification of imports, and further investigate claims of evasions of import taxes.The Administration's Continued Commitment to EnforcementUSTR Enforcement ActionsEnforcement at the WTOSince the start of his Administration, President Obama has made enforcement of our trade rights a top priority. To that end, since 2009, the United States has filed 25 enforcement actions at the WTO, more than any other WTO Member over that period. And the United States has won every single one of those challenges decided thus far, including seven against China alone. Export figures confirm that these enforcement victories are worth billions of dollars for American farmers and ranchers; manufacturers of high-tech steel, aircraft, and automobiles; solar energy exporters; cutting edge service providers; and many others. To ensure the greatest economic benefits for American workers and exporters, the Administration continues to use our trade enforcement actions to emphasize opening large, strategic markets to which we can export a diverse array of Made-in-America products and services. Recent examples include:Indonesia agricultural import barriers victory: In December 2016, a WTO panel sided with the United States on all claims regarding Indonesia's restrictive import barriers for horticultural products, animals, and animal products. The United States successfully challenged 18 Indonesian measures because they restricted or prohibited the importation of fruits, vegetables, and meat products. Elimination of these restrictions could mean hundreds of millions of dollars in increased U.S. agriculture exports to Indonesia every year.China administration of agricultural TRQs: In December 2016, USTR launched a WTO action against China targeting its administration of tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) for rice, wheat, and corn. China's TRQs permit set volumes of rice, wheat, and corn to enter China at a low duty rate. However, China's administration of these TRQs is not transparent, predictable, or fair, and China's TRQ administration restricts imports. This challenge will ensure China lives up to its WTO commitments to provide meaningful market access to U.S. grain exports.China discriminatory aircraft tax exemptions: In October 2016, USTR announced that the United States had confirmed China's ending of discriminatory tax exemptions that had benefited certain aircraft produced in China. This announcement followed USTR's December 2015 launch of a WTO action against these discriminatory measures that covered a wide range of domestically produced aircraft, including general aviation and regional and business jets. Through this action, the United States challenged China's breaches of fundamental WTO rules of non-discrimination and transparency in this strategically important sector.India solar localization victory: In September 2016, the WTO Appellate Body agreed with a previous panel report finding that India's "localization" rules discriminate against U.S. solar cells and modules by requiring use of Indian products. American solar exports to India dropped 90 percent after the prohibited requirements took effect, and this victory will eliminate discrimination against American solar exports in a roughly $1 billion market.European aircraft subsidies victory: In September 2016, a WTO compliance panel issued a report finding that the European Union, France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom continue to breach WTO rules through subsidies the WTO previously found to have caused adverse effects to the United States. The compliance panel also found that these European governments further breached WTO rules by granting more than $4 billion in new subsidized financing for the A350 XWB which was causing tens of billions of dollars in additional adverse effects to U.S. industry.China agricultural government support: In September 2016, USTR launched a new WTO enforcement action against China's excessive support for farmers. In 2015, the level of support provided by China through its "market price support" programs for rice, wheat, and corn was nearly $100 billion in excess of China's WTO commitments. By setting prices for rice, wheat, and corn well above market levels, China encourages overproduction by its farmers, disadvantaging U.S. farmers seeking export opportunities in China.China raw materials restrictions: In July 2016, USTR initiated a dispute at the WTO against China's export duties and quotas on various forms of nine different raw materials. These raw materials are key inputs into a variety of Made-in-America products from a range of sectors, including aerospace, automotive, electronics, chemicals, and more.China demonstration bases agreement: In April 2016, following a challenge by the United States at the WTO, China agreed to dismantle its prohibited export subsidies under the "Demonstration Bases-Common Service Platform" program. The agreement represented a win for American workers employed in seven diverse export sectors, including agriculture, textiles, and medical products, who will benefit from a more level playing field on which to compete.China poultry compliance challenge: In May 2016, the United States challenged China at the WTO following China's failure to bring its AD/CVD orders against imports of U.S. chicken broiler products into compliance with WTO rules. The United States challenged the Chinese-imposed duties on behalf of American poultry producers and the hundreds of thousands of people employed in the poultry industry. The United States remains firmly committed to ensuring that China lives up to its WTO obligations, and that American farmers and workers can compete and win on a level playing field in the global economy.China high-tech steel duties: In July 2015, the United States prevailed in a WTO challenge to China's compliance actions following WTO findings in 2012 that China's duties on high-tech steel were inconsistent with WTO rules. Those WTO-inconsistent duties contributed to over $250 million in annual export losses for American steel exporters. The U.S. compliance challenge was the first time any WTO member had initiated a WTO proceeding to challenge a claim by China that it had complied with adverse WTO findings. China terminated the illegal duties following the USTR challenge.India agricultural bans: In June 2015, the WTO sided with the United States in a dispute challenging India's ban on U.S. agricultural products such as poultry meat, eggs, and live pigs, agreeing that India's measures represented unscientific and discriminatory restrictions. The decision affirmed that countries' avian influenza restrictions must be grounded in science, such as by taking into account the limited geographic impact from outbreaks, and not be simply a disguise for protectionism.Argentina import licensing restrictions: In January 2015, the United States won a trade enforcement victory against Argentina that involved its widespread restrictions on the importation of a range of U.S. goods. The restrictions by Argentina affected billions of dollars in U.S. exports, including energy products, electronics and machinery, aero-space and parts, pharmaceuticals, precious instruments and medical devices, miscellaneous chemicals, motor vehicles, vehicle parts, and agricultural products.China SUV / automobile duties: In June 2014, the WTO found that China breached WTO rules by imposing unjustified extra duties on American cars and sport utility vehicles. In 2013, an estimated $5.1 billion of U.S. auto exports were covered by those duties. China terminated the illegal duties following the USTR challenge.Other Enforcement Actions. In addition to these successes at the WTO, we have taken a wide range of additional enforcement action to protect the environment, ensure the protection of intellectual property, and protect labor rights so that American workers compete on a level playing field.Peru timber verification: In February 2016, the United States made the first timber verification request under the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA). In August 2016, the United States issued a statement reviewing the overall findings of the government of Peru's verification report and identified additional areas of progress for Peru. The request serves as an important assessment tool to help ensure that Peruvian forestry laws are enforced throughout the supply chain, and that timber imported into the United States is legally harvested and exported.South Africa agriculture export settlement: The United States and South Africa negotiated the removal of long-standing barriers to U.S. agricultural products entering South Africa. The removal of these unfair barriers ensured American poultry, pork, and beef farmers access to an important market, while providing South African consumers with an opportunity to buy and enjoy high-quality American agricultural products.Honduras IPR enforcement: In March 2016, the United States announced Honduras' commitment to undertake a series of actions to strengthen the protection and enforcement of intellectual property in Honduras. The new commitment followed USTR's Out-of-Cycle Review of intellectual property protection in Honduras under the Special 301 report, and will benefit American agriculture, creative industries, telecommunications, textiles and apparel, and other U.S. exports.Colombia labor steps: USTR and the Department of Labor worked with the government of Colombia on a Presidential Decree, issued in April 2016, to help inspectors investigate and apply potentially very significant fines to employers that use abusive forms of subcontracting to violate labor rights. With robust enforcement, this decree could have a significant impact on the ground for workers and address a main concern related to protection of workers' rights in Colombia.NTE report: In March 2016, USTR released the National Trade Estimate on Foreign Trade Barriers (NTE) report, which represents a key component in the Administration's unprecedented trade enforcement efforts. The report serves as a guide to trade barriers being imposed across the globe, and the work President Obama has done to build a more capable enforcement system that utilizes resources from agencies across the government.Special 301 report: In April 2016, the Obama Administration unveiled its 2016 Special 301 Report, which provides an overview on the global state of intellectual property rights and enforcement, and lists the most significant challenges facing American intellectual property creators and holders.Commerce AD/CVD Actions and Trade Agreements ComplianceCommerce, CBP, and ICE are currently enforcing 370 antidumping (AD) / countervailing duty (CVD) orders that address dumped goods or unfairly subsidized imports. Of these orders, 184 involve imports of steel and steel-related products, representing nearly half of all orders currently in effect. AD/CVD orders are an effective tool for providing relief to U.S. companies and workers injured by unfair trade practices and allowing American companies to compete on a fairer and more level playing field. This year, Commerce has conducted investigations and made final determinations on important cases brought by the American steel industry, including on cold-rolled, hot-rolled, and corrosion-resistant steel products, finding dumping margins as high as 620 percent on certain products from China. Following affirmative determinations of material injury by the U.S. International Trade Commission, Commerce puts into place AD/CVD orders. The results of these AD/CVD investigations and orders are already having a positive impact on American workers. Recent examples include:Non-Oriented Electrical Steel. In October 2014, Commerce issued final affirmative AD determination orders with regard to non-oriented electrical steel from China, Germany, Japan, Korea, Sweden, and Taiwan and final affirmative CVD determination orders with regard to non-oriented electrical steel from China and Taiwan. Final CVD rates are as high as 158 percent for imports from China and AD rates are as high as 407 percent for imports from China.Corrosion-Resistant Steel. In July 2016, Commerce issued AD and CVD orders on corrosion-resistant steel imports from China, India, Italy, and Korea, as well as an AD order on corrosion-resistant steel products from Taiwan. AD duties as high as 210 percent and CV duties as high as 241 percent were calculated for imports from China.Cold-Rolled Steel. In July 2016, Commerce issued AD and CVD orders on cold-rolled steel from China, as well as an AD order on cold-rolled steel from Japan. In September 2016, Commerce issued further AD and CVD orders on cold-rolled steel from Brazil, India, and South Korea, as well as an AD order on cold-rolled steel from the United Kingdom. Commerce imposed final AD duties as high as 265 percent for China and final CV duties as high as 265 percent for China.Hot-Rolled Steel. In October 2016, Commerce issued AD and CVD orders with regard to hot-rolled steel from Brazil and South Korea, and AD orders with regard to hot-rolled steel from Australia, Japan, the Netherlands, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. AD duties are as high as 33 percent for imports from the United Kingdom and final CV duties are as high as 57 percent for imports from Korea.Cut-To-Length Plate. In November 2016, Commerce issued final affirmative AD determinations with regard to cut-to-length plate from Brazil, South Africa, and Turkey. AD duties were as high as 94 percent for imports from South Africa. Commerce is in the process of conducting additional investigations with regard to cut-to-length plate. In September 2016, Commerce issued an affirmative preliminary CVD determination with regard to cut-to-length plate from China with preliminary CVD duties of 210 percent for all imports from China. In November 2016, Commerce issued preliminary affirmative AD determinations with regard to cut-to-length plate from Austria, Belgium, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, with AD duties as high as 131 percent for imports from Italy. Commerce is scheduled to issue its pending final determinations by the end of March 2017.Commerce also administers a variety of programs and has offices to monitor trade agreement operation, and identify and address foreign government non-compliance with trade agreement obligations. Commerce operates the Trade Agreements Compliance Program, which deals with non-tariff barriers that affect U.S. businesses operating abroad; monitors foreign AD/CVD actions against U.S. firms, advocating on their behalf to preserve fair access to key markets; and tracks and advocates against foreign government subsidy practices that distort trade and unbalance the playing field for U.S. companies. In 2016, Commerce successfully resolved more than 30 foreign non-tariff barrier trade compliance cases with a total combined value of more than $14 billion in exports safeguarded. Commerce's advocacy efforts also helped bring about the successful termination of 26 foreign trade remedy proceedings in 2016, affecting approximately $373 million in U.S. exports.Given the importance of these matters, Commerce is establishing an Advisory Council on Trade Enforcement and Compliance (ACTEC) to directly advise the Secretary of Commerce on laws and government policies that deal with trade enforcement; identify and recommend programs, policies, and actions to help Commerce in its efforts to ensure that U.S. trading partners comply with their trade agreement commitments; and recommend ways that Commerce's trade enforcement and compliance policies and programs can better support a strong trade and manufacturing agenda and enhance the commercial competitiveness of the United States.Stepping up U.S. Customs and Border Protection Efforts on SteelCBP has worked alongside partners across the U.S. government to ensure that our trade laws are strictly enforced. CBP personnel work tirelessly at the 328 ports of entry and throughout the world to prevent shipments of unfairly traded goods from entering U.S. commerce, including steel that is being dumped on our markets or is unfairly subsidized and products that infringe upon U.S. intellectual property rights. In doing so, CBP defends the U.S. economy from unfair competition and the theft of American innovation and protects people who live and work in the United States from health and public safety risks posed by counterfeit goods. CBP continues to collaborate with stakeholders to ensure they have all the information they need to lawfully import and export their goods.CBP recently identified approximately $7 million in AD/CVD discrepancies on Chinese steel plate shipments, and raised continuous bond amounts for three steel importers.Additionally, CBP's Operation Flatline recovered over $800,000 in AD/CVD duties on imports of corrosion-resistant, flat-rolled steel products from China.CBP's Trade Enforcement Task Force has collected over $1.5 million in unpaid AD/CVD duties on steel imports.CBP has implemented a targeted approach to increase reviews of steel imports, which will provide a measure of the risk presented by steel imports, and identify targets for further enforcement.CBP is requiring "live entry" for certain high-risk steel imports, meaning that all entry documents and duties are required to be provided before cargo is released by CBP into U.S. commerce.CBP is partnering with the steel industry to deliver seminars for CBP, other U.S. government trade personnel (including Commerce and ICE), and customs brokers to provide participants with knowledge of industry operations and enhance understanding of how AD/CVD enforcement can best be implemented in the current trade environment. In Fiscal Year 2016, CBP and the U.S. steel industry conducted Steel Seminars in Laredo, Texas; New Orleans, Louisiana; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Long Beach, California; and most recently, in Detroit, Michigan. These seminars are scheduled to resume in early 2017 in Chicago, Illinois; Houston, Texas; Mobile, Alabama; Newark, New Jersey; and Seattle, Washington.CBP's Base Metals Center of Excellence and Expertise for trade enforcement, which is specifically focused on the steel sector, is now fully operational, where CBP's industry experts work together to focus on outreach, targeting, and enforcement of steel imports.CBP Laboratories and Scientific Services is directing funds to its network of laboratories, where CBP's forensic and scientific arm uses state-of-the-art techniques to identify AD/CVD evasion.Building International Pressure to Address Excess CapacityWe have made clear to our trading partners in particular, China that excess capacity in the steel, aluminum, and other industrial sectors is harmful to American manufacturers and an unsustainable drag on the global economy and that all major steel-producing nations must be committed to working together to eliminate policies that contribute to excess capacity, particularly in the steel industry.Over two years, we have engaged through bilateral mechanisms such as the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT) and the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue (SandED) to press China to address industrial excess capacity. In February 2015, China publicly announced plans to reduce steelmaking capacity by 100 to 150 million metric tons over five years. At the SandED meeting in June 2016, excess capacity was a key economic priority, and we successfully secured significant new commitments from China, including a commitment that it will take further steps beyond its announced plans to progressively reduce its excess capacity, close loss-making "zombie enterprises," and ensure that central government plans and policies do not target the net expansion of capacity in its steel industry.We have built a robust coalition of like-minded trading partners who share our concerns regarding excess capacity and are committed to addressing this issue. At the end of May 2016, G-7 Leaders committed to quickly take steps to address global excess capacity across industrial sectors, especially steel. And on June 29, 2016, North American Leaders announced broad customs cooperation to ensure robust trade enforcement at our borders, including increased information sharing on high-risk shipments.On September 4-5, 2016, these steps contributed to President Obama's successful efforts to secure a commitment from the Leaders of the G-20, which also represents the world's largest steel producers, to establish a Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity. The Global Forum is designed to help lead to a reduction in global excess steel capacity and production through the identification of market-distorting policies that sustain excess capacity, actions to make net reductions in capacity, and monitoring and accountability mechanisms. In addition, at their summit meeting on September 5, 2016, President Obama and Chinese President Xi recognized that excess capacity was a global issue requiring collective responses, and committed to enhance cooperation and communication on the issue. In addition, China committed to take effective steps to address the challenges so as to enhance market function and encourage adjustments. China further committed to implement changes to its bankruptcy practice to facilitate market exit of failing firms and further improving its bankruptcy administrator systems to address excess capacity.Consistent and concerted international engagement over 2016 yielded these milestones:Launch of the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity, December 16: More than thirty G-20 and other steel-producing countries put the Global Forum into action by approving Terms of Reference, and convening the first Forum meeting in Berlin, Germany. The United States, China, and Germany were selected as co-chairs of the Forum for 2017. The Forum will report the relevant G-20 ministers in 2017 and annually thereafter. The Forum's establishment demonstrates a commitment to identify and resolve market-distorting practices that sustain excess capacity, creating a negative impact on trade, the steel industry, and workers around the world.Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade, November 23: The United States and China committed to exchange information and work together to address global aluminum excess capacity. The United States and China also agreed to hold a U.S.-China Steel Dialogue in 2017.WTO Subsidies Committee, October: The United States with the European Union, Japan, Korea, and Mexico co-sponsored a paper on the problem of subsidies and overcapacity in certain sectors (e.g., steel and aluminum) and submitted it for consideration by the WTO Subsidies Committee. The submission proposed that the Subsidies Committee examine the extent to which subsidies contribute to overcapacity and how such subsidies could be further disciplined.U.S.-Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit, September 8: ASEAN countries recognized excess capacity as a global problem and welcomed the formation of the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity envisioned by the G-20 and pledged to actively support its work.OECD Steel Committee Meeting, September 8: The United States actively participated in an exchange of information regarding regional and global steel market developments and steelmaking capacity developments, to carry out a work program that increases transparency of steelmaking capacity data.G-20 Leaders Meeting, September 4-5: Leaders committed to take effective steps to address the challenges of excess capacity in steel and other industries so as to enhance market function and encourage adjustment. Leaders also called for increased information sharing and cooperation through the formation of a Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity, to be facilitated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) with the active participation of G-20 members and interested OECD members. This Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity would report on progress to the relevant G-20 ministers in 2017.U.S.-China Leaders Meeting, September 3: President Obama met with Chinese President Xi to emphasize U.S. concerns regarding excess capacity in steel, aluminum, and other industries. Both leaders recognized that excess capacity is a global issue which requires collective responses and committed to enhance cooperation and communication on the issue. In addition, China committed to take effective steps to address the challenges so as to enhance market function and encourage adjustments. China further committed to implement bankruptcy laws and further improve its bankruptcy administrator systems to address excess capacity.G-20 Trade Ministers Meeting, July 9-10 and G-20 Finance Ministers Meeting, July 23-24: Trade and Finance Ministers committed to enhanced communication, cooperation, and effective steps to address the challenges surrounding excess capacity, including participation in the OECD Steel Committee.North American Leaders Summit, June 29: The United States, Canada, and Mexico announced efforts to address government policies that distort the steel and aluminum sectors and contribute to excess capacity and announced that our customs agencies would work together to ensure robust trade enforcement at our borders, including increased information sharing on high-risk shipments of steel and other industrial goods.U.S. China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, June 6-7: The United States secured China's commitment to, among other things, strictly contain steel capacity expansion, reduce net steel capacity, eliminate outdated steel capacity, and dispose of "zombie enterprises" through restructuring, bankruptcy, and liquidation, as appropriate.OECD Ministerial Council Meeting, June 1-2: The United States and partners issued statements recognizing the negative impact on trade of global excess capacity in sectors such as steel and shipbuilding, and stressed the need to avoid market-distorting measures and to enhance well-functioning markets.G-7 Leaders Meeting, May 26-27: G-7 Leaders committed to quickly take steps to address global excess capacity across industrial sectors, especially steel.Joint Committee on Commerce and Trade Steel Dialogue with China, May 11-12: U.S. senior officials, with full participation of steel industry representatives and the United Steelworkers, held a dialogue with senior Chinese government and industry officials to emphasize America's serious concerns about excess capacity and injurious trade.Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) High-Level Meeting on Excess Capacity and Structural Adjustment in the Steel Sector, April 18-19: The United States, Canada, the European Union, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Turkey, and others joined together to call for specific steps to address steel excess capacity and to urge the formation of a Global Forum facilitated by the OECD.North American Steel Trade Committee, March 31 April 1: The United States, Canada, and Mexico agreed on the need for all major steel-producing countries to make strong and immediate commitments to address the problem of global excess steelmaking capacity.Commerce and USTR organized a public hearing on April 12-13, 2016 to solicit a range of views about excess capacity to inform U.S. engagement with its trading partners, to identify solutions to address the steel crisis, and to hear the concerns of our steelworkers and industry. The request for public comment generated 100 submissions and 43 requests to testify. Among those testifying were twelve Members of Congress, the President of the United Steelworkers, a range of company CEOs and COOs, and five steelworkers' associations. Secretary Pritzker and Ambassador Froman each attended sessions with representatives from CBP, Treasury, Labor, and State.In August 2016, Commerce announced the release of a series of reports detailing current steel trade flows involving the top importing and exporting countries. The enhanced global steel trade monitor reports provide U.S. business with updated market intelligence about global steel trade flows.Bolstering Trade Enforcement ToolsOn February 24, 2016, President Obama signed the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (Customs bill). Coupled with the American Trade Enforcement Effectiveness Act (Level the Playing Field Act), signed by President Obama on June 29, 2015, the Customs bill strengthens our tools for ensuring that our trading partners and foreign industries are competing fairly and following our trade laws. Relevant agencies across the U.S. government have followed through by fully implementing the authorities in ways that have produced results.Implementation of the Customs bill:Commerce now requires foreign exporters who claim to be "new shippers" to post actual estimated duties rather than bonds during the pendency of reviews to determine the validity of their new shipper claims, and has increased its scrutiny of exporters claiming to be "new shippers" in AD/CVD proceedings.Commerce has also increased the number of on-site verifications of the information provided by these so-called "new shippers," and has found many of the sales reported by these exporters to not be genuine. As a result, imports from many of these exporters are subject to higher AD/CVD rates.On August 22, 2016, CBP published an interim final rule in the Federal Register, effective immediately, implementing additional procedures for investigating claims of evasion of AD/CVD orders pursuant to Title IV of the Act, commonly referred to as the Enforce and Protect Act of 2015, or EAPA. This strengthens CBP's enforcement efforts by establishing an additional method for submitting and investigating allegations of AD/CVD evasion against U.S. importers.CBP established an interagency Trade Enforcement Task Force that enables CBP to leverage new enforcement authorities and harness the agency's trade enforcement expertise as a focal point for coordination with other government agency partners, including Commerce, Department of Justice, and ICE.CBP established an Enforce Act team to operationalize the new mandatory AD/CVD evasion investigative procedures. This includes internal operating procedures, updating CBP's e-Allegations website, and drafting regulations.CBP has issued four withhold release orders which hold shipments in port for shipment of goods made with prohibitive forms of forced labor and conducted various outreach events on implementation with various stakeholder groups including trade industry associations, foreign embassies, and non-governmental organizations.ICE has held over 30 information sessions on trade investigations relating to forced labor allegations to audiences such as trade industry associations, foreign embassies, and non-governmental organizations. In addition, ICE has held five media interviews on this same subject, all of which resulted in media postings in both print and online media.In 2016, the Small Business Administration integrated requirements in the law into the administration of the State Trade Expansion Program and issued matching-grant awards pursuant to the terms in the legislation.CBP AD/CVD Enforcement:In FY 2016, $14 billion of imported goods were subject to AD/CVD, and CBP collected $1.5 billion in AD/CVD cash deposits, which has increased over 25 percent since FY 2015, and by almost 200 percent since FY 2014.CBP levied monetary penalties totaling over $30.6 million on importers for fraud, gross negligence, and negligence for AD/CVD violations under 19 U.S.C. 1592.CBP and ICE seized shipments with a domestic value of more than $5.3 million for violations of AD/CVD.Implementation of Level the Playing Field Act:Application of Level the Playing Field is already strengthening enforcement of the AD/CVD laws by ensuring consequences for non-cooperating parties, mandating the collection of cost of production data, and providing a firm legal basis for rejecting input values that are dumped or subsidized.The President's FY 2017 budget requests:$606 million for CBP trade administration activities and 3,816 full time staff to implement this work.$84 million for the Commerce Enforcement and Compliance Program, a $4.5 million increase over the 2016 enacted level. This includes 347 full-time staff.Annualizes the 38 additional positions funded by Congress in FY 2016 a 10 percent increase in Commerce's enforcement staffing to address the urgent need for additional staffing caused by the sustained and significant increase in AD/CVD cases.Load-Date: January 12, 2017End of Document

FACT SHEET: THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S RECORD ON THE TRADE ENFORCEMENTCQ Federal Department and Agency Documents REGULATORY INTELLIGENCE DATAJanuary 12, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 Congressional Quarterly, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Length: 6217 wordsBodyAGENCY: DEPARTMENT OF THE US WHITE HOUSESIC-MAJOR-GROUP: 09 - General ClassificationCONTACT: 202-456-7100From day one, President Obama and his Administration have vigorously worked to build a far more capable trade enforcement system. The result has been a strong record of enforcement victories that are helping to level the playing field for American workers and businesses. The Administration has enlisted all relevant agencies and used all the tools at its disposal to identify, monitor, enforce, and resolve the full range of international trade issues, so that American workers, farmers, and businesses receive the benefits they are due under our trade and investment agreements and to prevent American jobs from being threatened by unfair trading practices.Aggressively Pursuing - and Winning - Cases at the World Trade Organization: Today, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) is launching a new trade enforcement action against China at the World Trade Organization (WTO) targeting China's unfair subsidies for its aluminum industry. This is the 25th WTO challenge of this Administration and the 16th against China alone. The United States has brought more WTO challenges over the last eight years than any other country. And we've won every single one of these challenges that has been decided. Levying Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duty Penalties on Foreign Industries and Trading Partners at the Highest Rate in 14 Years, Particularly Important to the Steel Industry: The Department of Commerce, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are enforcing 370 trade remedy orders that address dumped goods or unfairly subsidized imports and level the playing field for American workers and businesses. In each of the last two years, Commerce initiated the largest number of new investigations in 14 years. The Administration worked with Congress to secure new legislative authorities that provide a substantial upgrade in our government's trade enforcement capabilities. Commerce has conducted investigations and made final determinations on important cases brought by the American steel industry, finding dumping margins as high as 620 percent on certain products from China. Pursuing Diplomatic Engagement to Uphold Labor Rights, Protect the Environment, and Ensure Intellectual Property Rights Are Enforced: The United States has undertaken initiatives with our free trade agreement partners to strengthen workers' rights in Bahrain, Bangladesh, Burma, Colombia, Honduras, Jordan, Panama, and others. We have pressed our trading partners to effectively implement environmental provisions in our free trade agreements to protect the environment and prevent illegal logging. Trade and Investment Framework Agreements between the United States and more than 50 trading partners and regions around the world have facilitated discussions on enhancing intellectual property rights (IPR) protection and enforcement. We also direct international initiatives to broaden awareness of IPR's important role in addressing international concerns, such as counterfeit medicines and internet piracy, so countries will investigate and prosecute cases of IPR violations. Combating Excess Capacity in Industrial Sectors: The United States led an international coalition to bring together more than thirty countries - including both G-20 members and as well as major steel-producing countries that are not in the G-20 - to form a new Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity. The Global Forum, co-chaired by the United States, will address market distorting practices that negatively impact trade and the steel industry and workers around the world. Furthermore, we successfully secured significant new commitments from China, including a commitment that it will take further steps beyond its announced plans to progressively reduce its excess capacity, close loss-making "zombie enterprises," and ensure that central government plans and policies do not target the net expansion of capacity in its steel industry. Building Stronger Enforcement Authorities and Coordination: President Obama worked with Congress to pass and sign into law two new pieces of legislation, the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act (also referred to as "Customs" legislation) and the American Trade Enforcement Effectiveness Act (also referred to as the "Level the Playing Field Act"), each of which strengthened our tools for ensuring that our trading partners and foreign industries are competing fairly and following our trade laws. With these new authorities, Commerce, CBP, and ICE have been able to apply consequences for recalcitrant importers that persist in violating our domestic trade laws, increase on-site verification of imports, and further investigate claims of evasions of import taxes.The Administration's Continued Commitment to EnforcementUSTR Enforcement ActionsEnforcement at the WTOSince the start of his Administration, President Obama has made enforcement of our trade rights a top priority. To that end, since 2009, the United States has filed 25 enforcement actions at the WTO, more than any other WTO Member over that period. And the United States has won every single one of those challenges decided thus far, including seven against China alone. Export figures confirm that these enforcement victories are worth billions of dollars for American farmers and ranchers; manufacturers of high-tech steel, aircraft, and automobiles; solar energy exporters; cutting edge service providers; and many others. To ensure the greatest economic benefits for American workers and exporters, the Administration continues to use our trade enforcement actions to emphasize opening large, strategic markets to which we can export a diverse array of Made-in-America products and services. Recent examples include:Indonesia agricultural import barriers victory: In December 2016, a WTO panel sided with the United States on all claims regarding Indonesia's restrictive import barriers for horticultural products, animals, and animal products. The United States successfully challenged 18 Indonesian measures because they restricted or prohibited the importation of fruits, vegetables, and meat products. Elimination of these restrictions could mean hundreds of millions of dollars in increased U.S. agriculture exports to Indonesia every year. China administration of agricultural TRQs: In December 2016, USTR launched a WTO action against China targeting its administration of tariff- rate quotas (TRQs) for rice, wheat, and corn. China's TRQs permit set volumes of rice, wheat, and corn to enter China at a low duty rate. However, China's administration of these TRQs is not transparent, predictable, or fair, and China's TRQ administration restricts imports. This challenge will ensure China lives up to its WTO commitments to provide meaningful market access to U.S. grain exports. China discriminatory aircraft tax exemptions: In October 2016, USTR announced that the United States had confirmed China's ending of discriminatory tax exemptions that had benefited certain aircraft produced in China. This announcement followed USTR's December 2015 launch of a WTO action against these discriminatory measures that covered a wide range of domestically produced aircraft, including general aviation and regional and business jets. Through this action, the United States challenged China's breaches of fundamental WTO rules of non-discrimination and transparency in this strategically important sector. India solar localization victory: In September 2016, the WTO Appellate Body agreed with a previous panel report finding that India's "localization" rules discriminate against U.S. solar cells and modules by requiring use of Indian products. American solar exports to India dropped 90 percent after the prohibited requirements took effect, and this victory will eliminate discrimination against American solar exports in a roughly $1 billion market. European aircraft subsidies victory: In September 2016, a WTO compliance panel issued a report finding that the European Union, France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom continue to breach WTO rules through subsidies the WTO previously found to have caused adverse effects to the United States. The compliance panel also found that these European governments further breached WTO rules by granting more than $4 billion in new subsidized financing for the A350 XWB which was causing tens of billions of dollars in additional adverse effects to U.S. industry. China agricultural government support: In September 2016, USTR launched a new WTO enforcement action against China's excessive support for farmers. In 2015, the level of support provided by China through its "market price support" programs for rice, wheat, and corn was nearly $100 billion in excess of China's WTO commitments. By setting prices for rice, wheat, and corn well above market levels, China encourages overproduction by its farmers, disadvantaging U.S. farmers seeking export opportunities in China. China raw materials restrictions: In July 2016, USTR initiated a dispute at the WTO against China's export duties and quotas on various forms of nine different raw materials. These raw materials are key inputs into a variety of Made-in-America products from a range of sectors, including aerospace, automotive, electronics, chemicals, and more. China demonstration bases agreement: In April 2016, following a challenge by the United States at the WTO, China agreed to dismantle its prohibited export subsidies under the "Demonstration Bases-Common Service Platform" program. The agreement represented a win for American workers employed in seven diverse export sectors, including agriculture, textiles, and medical products, who will benefit from a more level playing field on which to compete. China poultry compliance challenge: In May 2016, the United States challenged China at the WTO following China's failure to bring its AD/CVD orders against imports of U.S. chicken broiler products into compliance with WTO rules. The United States challenged the Chinese-imposed duties on behalf of American poultry producers and the hundreds of thousands of people employed in the poultry industry. The United States remains firmly committed to ensuring that China lives up to its WTO obligations, and that American farmers and workers can compete and win on a level playing field in the global economy. China high-tech steel duties: In July 2015, the United States prevailed in a WTO challenge to China's compliance actions following WTO findings in 2012 that China's duties on high-tech steel were inconsistent with WTO rules. Those WTO-inconsistent duties contributed to over $250 million in annual export losses for American steel exporters. The U.S. compliance challenge was the first time any WTO member had initiated a WTO proceeding to challenge a claim by China that it had complied with adverse WTO findings. China terminated the illegal duties following the USTR challenge. India agricultural bans: In June 2015, the WTO sided with the United States in a dispute challenging India's ban on U.S. agricultural products such as poultry meat, eggs, and live pigs, agreeing that India's measures represented unscientific and discriminatory restrictions. The decision affirmed that countries' avian influenza restrictions must be grounded in science, such as by taking into account the limited geographic impact from outbreaks, and not be simply a disguise for protectionism. Argentina import licensing restrictions: In January 2015, the United States won a trade enforcement victory against Argentina that involved its widespread restrictions on the importation of a range of U.S. goods. The restrictions by Argentina affected billions of dollars in U.S. exports, including energy products, electronics and machinery, aero-space and parts, pharmaceuticals, precious instruments and medical devices, miscellaneous chemicals, motor vehicles, vehicle parts, and agricultural products. China SUV / automobile duties: In June 2014, the WTO found that China breached WTO rules by imposing unjustified extra duties on American cars and sport utility vehicles. In 2013, an estimated $5.1 billion of U.S. auto exports were covered by those duties. China terminated the illegal duties following the USTR challenge.Other Enforcement Actions. In addition to these successes at the WTO, we have taken a wide range of additional enforcement action to protect the environment, ensure the protection of intellectual property, and protect labor rights so that American workers compete on a level playing field.Peru timber verification: In February 2016, the United States made the first timber verification request under the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA). In August 2016, the United States issued a statement reviewing the overall findings of the government of Peru's verification report and identified additional areas of progress for Peru. The request serves as an important assessment tool to help ensure that Peruvian forestry laws are enforced throughout the supply chain, and that timber imported into the United States is legally harvested and exported. South Africa agriculture export settlement: The United States and South Africa negotiated the removal of long-standing barriers to U.S. agricultural products entering South Africa. The removal of these unfair barriers ensured American poultry, pork, and beef farmers access to an important market, while providing South African consumers with an opportunity to buy and enjoy high-quality American agricultural products. Honduras IPR enforcement: In March 2016, the United States announced Honduras' commitment to undertake a series of actions to strengthen the protection and enforcement of intellectual property in Honduras. The new commitment followed USTR's Out-of-Cycle Review of intellectual property protection in Honduras under the Special 301 report, and will benefit American agriculture, creative industries, telecommunications, textiles and apparel, and other U.S. exports. Colombia labor steps: USTR and the Department of Labor worked with the government of Colombia on a Presidential Decree, issued in April 2016, to help inspectors investigate and apply potentially very significant fines to employers that use abusive forms of subcontracting to violate labor rights. With robust enforcement, this decree could have a significant impact on the ground for workers and address a main concern related to protection of workers' rights in Colombia. NTE report: In March 2016, USTR released the National Trade Estimate on Foreign Trade Barriers (NTE) report, which represents a key component in the Administration's unprecedented trade enforcement efforts. The report serves as a guide to trade barriers being imposed across the globe, and the work President Obama has done to build a more capable enforcement system that utilizes resources from agencies across the government. Special 301 report: In April 2016, the Obama Administration unveiled its 2016 Special 301 Report, which provides an overview on the global state of intellectual property rights and enforcement, and lists the most significant challenges facing American intellectual property creators and holders.Commerce AD/CVD Actions and Trade Agreements ComplianceCommerce, CBP, and ICE are currently enforcing 370 antidumping (AD) / countervailing duty (CVD) orders that address dumped goods or unfairly subsidized imports. Of these orders, 184 involve imports of steel and steel-related products, representing nearly half of all orders currently in effect. AD/CVD orders are an effective tool for providing relief to U.S. companies and workers injured by unfair trade practices and allowing American companies to compete on a fairer and more level playing field. This year, Commerce has conducted investigations and made final determinations on important cases brought by the American steel industry, including on cold-rolled, hot-rolled, and corrosion-resistant steel products, finding dumping margins as high as 620 percent on certain products from China. Following affirmative determinations of material injury by the U.S. International Trade Commission, Commerce puts into place AD/CVD orders. The results of these AD/CVD investigations and orders are already having a positive impact on American workers. Recent examples include:Non-Oriented Electrical Steel. In October 2014, Commerce issued final affirmative AD determination orders with regard to non-oriented electrical steel from China, Germany, Japan, Korea, Sweden, and Taiwan and final affirmative CVD determination orders with regard to non-oriented electrical steel from China and Taiwan. Final CVD rates are as high as 158 percent for imports from China and AD rates are as high as 407 percent for imports from China. Corrosion-Resistant Steel. In July 2016, Commerce issued AD and CVD orders on corrosion-resistant steel imports from China, India, Italy, and Korea, as well as an AD order on corrosion-resistant steel products from Taiwan. AD duties as high as 210 percent and CV duties as high as 241 percent were calculated for imports from China. Cold-Rolled Steel. In July 2016, Commerce issued AD and CVD orders on cold-rolled steel from China, as well as an AD order on cold-rolled steel from Japan. In September 2016, Commerce issued further AD and CVD orders on cold-rolled steel from Brazil, India, and South Korea, as well as an AD order on cold-rolled steel from the United Kingdom. Commerce imposed final AD duties as high as 265 percent for China and final CV duties as high as 265 percent for China. Hot-Rolled Steel. In October 2016, Commerce issued AD and CVD orders with regard to hot-rolled steel from Brazil and South Korea, and AD orders with regard to hot-rolled steel from Australia, Japan, the Netherlands, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. AD duties are as high as 33 percent for imports from the United Kingdom and final CV duties are as high as 57 percent for imports from Korea. Cut-To-Length Plate. In November 2016, Commerce issued final affirmative AD determinations with regard to cut-to-length plate from Brazil, South Africa, and Turkey. AD duties were as high as 94 percent for imports from South Africa. Commerce is in the process of conducting additional investigations with regard to cut-to-length plate. In September 2016, Commerce issued an affirmative preliminary CVD determination with regard to cut-to-length plate from China with preliminary CVD duties of 210 percent for all imports from China. In November 2016, Commerce issued preliminary affirmative AD determinations with regard to cut-to-length plate from Austria, Belgium, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, with AD duties as high as 131 percent for imports from Italy. Commerce is scheduled to issue its pending final determinations by the end of March 2017.Commerce also administers a variety of programs and has offices to monitor trade agreement operation, and identify and address foreign government non- compliance with trade agreement obligations. Commerce operates the Trade Agreements Compliance Program, which deals with non-tariff barriers that affect U.S. businesses operating abroad; monitors foreign AD/CVD actions against U.S. firms, advocating on their behalf to preserve fair access to key markets; and tracks and advocates against foreign government subsidy practices that distort trade and unbalance the playing field for U.S. companies. In 2016, Commerce successfully resolved more than 30 foreign non-tariff barrier trade compliance cases with a total combined value of more than $14 billion in exports safeguarded. Commerce's advocacy efforts also helped bring about the successful termination of 26 foreign trade remedy proceedings in 2016, affecting approximately $373 million in U.S. exports.Given the importance of these matters, Commerce is establishing an Advisory Council on Trade Enforcement and Compliance (ACTEC) to directly advise the Secretary of Commerce on laws and government policies that deal with trade enforcement; identify and recommend programs, policies, and actions to help Commerce in its efforts to ensure that U.S. trading partners comply with their trade agreement commitments; and recommend ways that Commerce's trade enforcement and compliance policies and programs can better support a strong trade and manufacturing agenda and enhance the commercial competitiveness of the United States.Stepping up U.S. Customs and Border Protection Efforts on SteelCBP has worked alongside partners across the U.S. government to ensure that our trade laws are strictly enforced. CBP personnel work tirelessly at the 328 ports of entry and throughout the world to prevent shipments of unfairly traded goods from entering U.S. commerce, including steel that is being dumped on our markets or is unfairly subsidized and products that infringe upon U.S. intellectual property rights. In doing so, CBP defends the U.S. economy from unfair competition and the theft of American innovation and protects people who live and work in the United States from health and public safety risks posed by counterfeit goods. CBP continues to collaborate with stakeholders to ensure they have all the information they need to lawfully import and export their goods.CBP recently identified approximately $7 million in AD/CVD discrepancies on Chinese steel plate shipments, and raised continuous bond amounts for three steel importers. Additionally, CBP's Operation Flatline recovered over $800,000 in AD/CVD duties on imports of corrosion-resistant, flat-rolled steel products from China. CBP's Trade Enforcement Task Force has collected over $1.5 million in unpaid AD/CVD duties on steel imports. CBP has implemented a targeted approach to increase reviews of steel imports, which will provide a measure of the risk presented by steel imports, and identify targets for further enforcement. CBP is requiring "live entry" for certain high-risk steel imports, meaning that all entry documents and duties are required to be provided before cargo is released by CBP into U.S. commerce. CBP is partnering with the steel industry to deliver seminars for CBP, other U.S. government trade personnel (including Commerce and ICE), and customs brokers to provide participants with knowledge of industry operations and enhance understanding of how AD/CVD enforcement can best be implemented in the current trade environment. In Fiscal Year 2016, CBP and the U.S. steel industry conducted Steel Seminars in Laredo, Texas; New Orleans, Louisiana; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Long Beach, California; and most recently, in Detroit, Michigan. These seminars are scheduled to resume in early 2017 in Chicago, Illinois; Houston, Texas; Mobile, Alabama; Newark, New Jersey; and Seattle, Washington. CBP's Base Metals Center of Excellence and Expertise for trade enforcement, which is specifically focused on the steel sector, is now fully operational, where CBP's industry experts work together to focus on outreach, targeting, and enforcement of steel imports. CBP Laboratories and Scientific Services is directing funds to its network of laboratories, where CBP's forensic and scientific arm uses state- of-the-art techniques to identify AD/CVD evasion.Building International Pressure to Address Excess CapacityWe have made clear to our trading partners - in particular, China - that excess capacity in the steel, aluminum, and other industrial sectors is harmful to American manufacturers and an unsustainable drag on the global economy and that all major steel-producing nations must be committed to working together to eliminate policies that contribute to excess capacity, particularly in the steel industry.Over two years, we have engaged through bilateral mechanisms such as the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT) and the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED) to press China to address industrial excess capacity. In February 2015, China publicly announced plans to reduce steelmaking capacity by 100 to 150 million metric tons over five years. At the S&ED meeting in June 2016, excess capacity was a key economic priority, and we successfully secured significant new commitments from China, including a commitment that it will take further steps beyond its announced plans to progressively reduce its excess capacity, close loss-making "zombie enterprises," and ensure that central government plans and policies do not target the net expansion of capacity in its steel industry.We have built a robust coalition of like-minded trading partners who share our concerns regarding excess capacity and are committed to addressing this issue. At the end of May 2016, G-7 Leaders committed to quickly take steps to address global excess capacity across industrial sectors, especially steel. And on June 29, 2016, North American Leaders announced broad customs cooperation to ensure robust trade enforcement at our borders, including increased information sharing on high-risk shipments.On September 4-5, 2016, these steps contributed to President Obama's successful efforts to secure a commitment from the Leaders of the G-20, which also represents the world's largest steel producers, to establish a Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity. The Global Forum is designed to help lead to a reduction in global excess steel capacity and production through the identification of market-distorting policies that sustain excess capacity, actions to make net reductions in capacity, and monitoring and accountability mechanisms. In addition, at their summit meeting on September 5, 2016, President Obama and Chinese President Xi recognized that excess capacity was a global issue requiring collective responses, and committed to enhance cooperation and communication on the issue. In addition, China committed to take effective steps to address the challenges so as to enhance market function and encourage adjustments. China further committed to implement changes to its bankruptcy practice to facilitate market exit of failing firms and further improving its bankruptcy administrator systems to address excess capacity.Consistent and concerted international engagement over 2016 yielded these milestones:Launch of the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity, December 16: More than thirty G-20 and other steel-producing countries put the Global Forum into action by approving Terms of Reference, and convening the first Forum meeting in Berlin, Germany. The United States, China, and Germany were selected as co-chairs of the Forum for 2017. The Forum will report the relevant G-20 ministers in 2017 and annually thereafter. The Forum's establishment demonstrates a commitment to identify and resolve market- distorting practices that sustain excess capacity, creating a negative impact on trade, the steel industry, and workers around the world. Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade, November 23: The United States and China committed to exchange information and work together to address global aluminum excess capacity. The United States and China also agreed to hold a U.S.-China Steel Dialogue in 2017. WTO Subsidies Committee, October: The United States with the European Union, Japan, Korea, and Mexico co-sponsored a paper on the problem of subsidies and overcapacity in certain sectors (e.g., steel and aluminum) and submitted it for consideration by the WTO Subsidies Committee. The submission proposed that the Subsidies Committee examine the extent to which subsidies contribute to overcapacity and how such subsidies could be further disciplined. U.S.-Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit, September 8: ASEAN countries recognized excess capacity as a global problem and welcomed the formation of the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity envisioned by the G-20 and pledged to actively support its work. OECD Steel Committee Meeting, September 8: The United States actively participated in an exchange of information regarding regional and global steel market developments and steelmaking capacity developments, to carry out a work program that increases transparency of steelmaking capacity data. G-20 Leaders Meeting, September 4-5: Leaders committed to take effective steps to address the challenges of excess capacity in steel and other industries so as to enhance market function and encourage adjustment. Leaders also called for increased information sharing and cooperation through the formation of a Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity, to be facilitated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) with the active participation of G-20 members and interested OECD members. This Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity would report on progress to the relevant G-20 ministers in 2017. U.S.-China Leaders Meeting, September 3: President Obama met with Chinese President Xi to emphasize U.S. concerns regarding excess capacity in steel, aluminum, and other industries. Both leaders recognized that excess capacity is a global issue which requires collective responses and committed to enhance cooperation and communication on the issue. In addition, China committed to take effective steps to address the challenges so as to enhance market function and encourage adjustments. China further committed to implement bankruptcy laws and further improve its bankruptcy administrator systems to address excess capacity. G-20 Trade Ministers Meeting, July 9-10 and G-20 Finance Ministers Meeting, July 23-24: Trade and Finance Ministers committed to enhanced communication, cooperation, and effective steps to address the challenges surrounding excess capacity, including participation in the OECD Steel Committee. North American Leaders Summit, June 29: The United States, Canada, and Mexico announced efforts to address government policies that distort the steel and aluminum sectors and contribute to excess capacity and announced that our customs agencies would work together to ensure robust trade enforcement at our borders, including increased information sharing on high- risk shipments of steel and other industrial goods. U.S. China Strategic & Economic Dialogue, June 6-7: The United States secured China's commitment to, among other things, strictly contain steel capacity expansion, reduce net steel capacity, eliminate outdated steel capacity, and dispose of "zombie enterprises" through restructuring, bankruptcy, and liquidation, as appropriate. OECD Ministerial Council Meeting, June 1-2: The United States and partners issued statements recognizing the negative impact on trade of global excess capacity in sectors such as steel and shipbuilding, and stressed the need to avoid market-distorting measures and to enhance well- functioning markets. G-7 Leaders Meeting, May 26-27: G-7 Leaders committed to quickly take steps to address global excess capacity across industrial sectors, especially steel. Joint Committee on Commerce and Trade Steel Dialogue with China, May 11- 12: U.S. senior officials, with full participation of steel industry representatives and the United Steelworkers, held a dialogue with senior Chinese government and industry officials to emphasize America's serious concerns about excess capacity and injurious trade. Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) High-Level Meeting on Excess Capacity and Structural Adjustment in the Steel Sector, April 18-19: The United States, Canada, the European Union, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Turkey, and others joined together to call for specific steps to address steel excess capacity and to urge the formation of a Global Forum facilitated by the OECD. North American Steel Trade Committee, March 31 - April 1: The United States, Canada, and Mexico agreed on the need for all major steel-producing countries to make strong and immediate commitments to address the problem of global excess steelmaking capacity.Commerce and USTR organized a public hearing on April 12-13, 2016 to solicit a range of views about excess capacity to inform U.S. engagement with its trading partners, to identify solutions to address the steel crisis, and to hear the concerns of our steelworkers and industry. The request for public comment generated 100 submissions and 43 requests to testify. Among those testifying were twelve Members of Congress, the President of the United Steelworkers, a range of company CEOs and COOs, and five steelworkers' associations. Secretary Pritzker and Ambassador Froman each attended sessions with representatives from CBP, Treasury, Labor, and State.In August 2016, Commerce announced the release of a series of reports detailing current steel trade flows involving the top importing and exporting countries. The enhanced global steel trade monitor reports provide U.S. business with updated market intelligence about global steel trade flows.Bolstering Trade Enforcement ToolsOn February 24, 2016, President Obama signed the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (Customs bill). Coupled with the American Trade Enforcement Effectiveness Act (Level the Playing Field Act), signed by President Obama on June 29, 2015, the Customs bill strengthens our tools for ensuring that our trading partners and foreign industries are competing fairly and following our trade laws. Relevant agencies across the U.S. government have followed through by fully implementing the authorities in ways that have produced results.Implementation of the Customs bill: Commerce now requires foreign exporters who claim to be "new shippers" to post actual estimated duties rather than bonds during the pendency of reviews to determine the validity of their new shipper claims, and has increased its scrutiny of exporters claiming to be "new shippers" in AD/CVD proceedings. Commerce has also increased the number of on-site verifications of the information provided by these so-called "new shippers," and has found many of the sales reported by these exporters to not be genuine. As a result, imports from many of these exporters are subject to higher AD/CVD rates. On August 22, 2016, CBP published an interim final rule in the Federal Register, effective immediately, implementing additional procedures for investigating claims of evasion of AD/CVD orders pursuant to Title IV of the Act, commonly referred to as the Enforce and Protect Act of 2015, or EAPA. This strengthens CBP's enforcement efforts by establishing an additional method for submitting and investigating allegations of AD/CVD evasion against U.S. importers. CBP established an interagency Trade Enforcement Task Force that enables CBP to leverage new enforcement authorities and harness the agency's trade enforcement expertise as a focal point for coordination with other government agency partners, including Commerce, Department of Justice, and ICE. CBP established an Enforce Act team to operationalize the new mandatory AD/CVD evasion investigative procedures. This includes internal operating procedures, updating CBP's e-Allegations website, and drafting regulations. CBP has issued four withhold release orders - which hold shipments in port - for shipment of goods made with prohibitive forms of forced labor and conducted various outreach events on implementation with various stakeholder groups including trade industry associations, foreign embassies, and non-governmental organizations. ICE has held over 30 information sessions on trade investigations relating to forced labor allegations to audiences such as trade industry associations, foreign embassies, and non-governmental organizations. In addition, ICE has held five media interviews on this same subject, all of which resulted in media postings in both print and online media. In 2016, the Small Business Administration integrated requirements in the law into the administration of the State Trade Expansion Program and issued matching-grant awards pursuant to the terms in the legislation. CBP AD/CVD Enforcement: In FY 2016, $14 billion of imported goods were subject to AD/CVD, and CBP collected $1.5 billion in AD/CVD cash deposits, which has increased over 25 percent since FY 2015, and by almost 200 percent since FY 2014. CBP levied monetary penalties totaling over $30.6 million on importers for fraud, gross negligence, and negligence for AD/CVD violations under 19 U.S.C. 1592. CBP and ICE seized shipments with a domestic value of more than $5.3 million for violations of AD/CVD. Implementation of Level the Playing Field Act: Application of Level the Playing Field is already strengthening enforcement of the AD/CVD laws by ensuring consequences for non-cooperating parties, mandating the collection of cost of production data, and providing a firm legal basis for rejecting input values that are dumped or subsidized. The President's FY 2017 budget requests: $606 million for CBP trade administration activities and 3,816 full time staff to implement this work. $84 million for the Commerce Enforcement and Compliance Program, a $4.5 million increase over the 2016 enacted level. This includes 347 full- time staff. Annualizes the 38 additional positions funded by Congress in FY 2016 - a 10 percent increase in Commerce's enforcement staffing to address the urgent need for additional staffing caused by the sustained and significant increase in AD/CVD cases.Load-Date: January 12, 2017End of Document

The Obama Administration's Record on the Trade EnforcementTargeted News ServiceJanuary 12, 2017 Thursday 4:33 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 6246 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe White House issued the following fact sheet:From day one, President Obama and his Administration have vigorously worked to build a far more capable trade enforcement system. The result has been a strong record of enforcement victories that are helping to level the playing field for American workers and businesses. The Administration has enlisted all relevant agencies and used all the tools at its disposal to identify, monitor, enforce, and resolve the full range of international trade issues, so that American workers, farmers, and businesses receive the benefits they are due under our trade and investment agreements and to prevent American jobs from being threatened by unfair trading practices.* Aggressively Pursuing - and Winning - Cases at the World Trade Organization: Today, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) is launching a new trade enforcement action against China at the World Trade Organization (WTO) targeting China's unfair subsidies for its aluminum industry. This is the 25th WTO challenge of this Administration and the 16th against China alone. The United States has brought more WTO challenges over the last eight years than any other country. And we've won every single one of these challenges that has been decided.* Levying Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duty Penalties on Foreign Industries and Trading Partners at the Highest Rate in 14 Years, Particularly Important to the Steel Industry: The Department of Commerce, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are enforcing 370 trade remedy orders that address dumped goods or unfairly subsidized imports and level the playing field for American workers and businesses.* In each of the last two years, Commerce initiated the largest number of new investigations in 14 years. The Administration worked with Congress to secure new legislative authorities that provide a substantial upgrade in our government's trade enforcement capabilities. Commerce has conducted investigations and made final determinations on important cases brought by the American steel industry, finding dumping margins as high as 620 percent on certain products from China.* Pursuing Diplomatic Engagement to Uphold Labor Rights, Protect the Environment, and Ensure Intellectual Property Rights Are Enforced: The United States has undertaken initiatives with our free trade agreement partners to strengthen workers' rights in Bahrain, Bangladesh, Burma, Colombia, Honduras, Jordan, Panama, and others. We have pressed our trading partners to effectively implement environmental provisions in our free trade agreements to protect the environment and prevent illegal logging. Trade and Investment Framework Agreements between the United States and more than 50 trading partners and regions around the world have facilitated discussions on enhancing intellectual property rights (IPR) protection and enforcement. We also direct international initiatives to broaden awareness of IPR's important role in addressing international concerns, such as counterfeit medicines and internet piracy, so countries will investigate and prosecute cases of IPR violations.* Combating Excess Capacity in Industrial Sectors: The United States led an international coalition to bring together more than thirty countries - including both G-20 members and as well as major steel-producing countries that are not in the G-20 - to form a new Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity. The Global Forum, co-chaired by the United States, will address market distorting practices that negatively impact trade and the steel industry and workers around the world. Furthermore, we successfully secured significant new commitments from China, including a commitment that it will take further steps beyond its announced plans to progressively reduce its excess capacity, close loss-making "zombie enterprises," and ensure that central government plans and policies do not target the net expansion of capacity in its steel industry.* Building Stronger Enforcement Authorities and Coordination: President Obama worked with Congress to pass and sign into law two new pieces of legislation, the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act (also referred to as "Customs" legislation) and the American Trade Enforcement Effectiveness Act (also referred to as the "Level the Playing Field Act"), each of which strengthened our tools for ensuring that our trading partners and foreign industries are competing fairly and following our trade laws. With these new authorities, Commerce, CBP, and ICE have been able to apply consequences for recalcitrant importers that persist in violating our domestic trade laws, increase on-site verification of imports, and further investigate claims of evasions of import taxes.The Administration's Continued Commitment to EnforcementUSTR Enforcement ActionsEnforcement at the WTOSince the start of his Administration, President Obama has made enforcement of our trade rights a top priority. To that end, since 2009, the United States has filed 25 enforcement actions at the WTO, more than any other WTO Member over that period. And the United States has won every single one of those challenges decided thus far, including seven against China alone. Export figures confirm that these enforcement victories are worth billions of dollars for American farmers and ranchers; manufacturers of high-tech steel, aircraft, and automobiles; solar energy exporters; cutting edge service providers; and many others. To ensure the greatest economic benefits for American workers and exporters, the Administration continues to use our trade enforcement actions to emphasize opening large, strategic markets to which we can export a diverse array of Made-in-America products and services. Recent examples include:* Indonesia agricultural import barriers victory: In December 2016, a WTO panel sided with the United States on all claims regarding Indonesia's restrictive import barriers for horticultural products, animals, and animal products. The United States successfully challenged 18 Indonesian measures because they restricted or prohibited the importation of fruits, vegetables, and meat products. Elimination of these restrictions could mean hundreds of millions of dollars in increased U.S. agriculture exports to Indonesia every year.* China administration of agricultural TRQs: In December 2016, USTR launched a WTO action against China targeting its administration of tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) for rice, wheat, and corn. China's TRQs permit set volumes of rice, wheat, and corn to enter China at a low duty rate. However, China's administration of these TRQs is not transparent, predictable, or fair, and China's TRQ administration restricts imports. This challenge will ensure China lives up to its WTO commitments to provide meaningful market access to U.S. grain exports.* China discriminatory aircraft tax exemptions: In October 2016, USTR announced that the United States had confirmed China's ending of discriminatory tax exemptions that had benefited certain aircraft produced in China. This announcement followed USTR's December 2015 launch of a WTO action against these discriminatory measures that covered a wide range of domestically produced aircraft, including general aviation and regional and business jets. Through this action, the United States challenged China's breaches of fundamental WTO rules of non-discrimination and transparency in this strategically important sector.* India solar localization victory: In September 2016, the WTO Appellate Body agreed with a previous panel report finding that India's "localization" rules discriminate against U.S. solar cells and modules by requiring use of Indian products. American solar exports to India dropped 90 percent after the prohibited requirements took effect, and this victory will eliminate discrimination against American solar exports in a roughly $1 billion market.* European aircraft subsidies victory: In September 2016, a WTO compliance panel issued a report finding that the European Union, France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom continue to breach WTO rules through subsidies the WTO previously found to have caused adverse effects to the United States. The compliance panel also found that these European governments further breached WTO rules by granting more than $4 billion in new subsidized financing for the A350 XWB which was causing tens of billions of dollars in additional adverse effects to U.S. industry.* China agricultural government support: In September 2016, USTR launched a new WTO enforcement action against China's excessive support for farmers. In 2015, the level of support provided by China through its "market price support" programs for rice, wheat, and corn was nearly $100 billion in excess of China's WTO commitments. By setting prices for rice, wheat, and corn well above market levels, China encourages overproduction by its farmers, disadvantaging U.S. farmers seeking export opportunities in China.* China raw materials restrictions: In July 2016, USTR initiated a dispute at the WTO against China's export duties and quotas on various forms of nine different raw materials. These raw materials are key inputs into a variety of Made-in-America products from a range of sectors, including aerospace, automotive, electronics, chemicals, and more.* China demonstration bases agreement: In April 2016, following a challenge by the United States at the WTO, China agreed to dismantle its prohibited export subsidies under the "Demonstration Bases-Common Service Platform" program. The agreement represented a win for American workers employed in seven diverse export sectors, including agriculture, textiles, and medical products, who will benefit from a more level playing field on which to compete.* China poultry compliance challenge: In May 2016, the United States challenged China at the WTO following China's failure to bring its AD/CVD orders against imports of U.S. chicken broiler products into compliance with WTO rules. The United States challenged the Chinese-imposed duties on behalf of American poultry producers and the hundreds of thousands of people employed in the poultry industry. The United States remains firmly committed to ensuring that China lives up to its WTO obligations, and that American farmers and workers can compete and win on a level playing field in the global economy.* China high-tech steel duties: In July 2015, the United States prevailed in a WTO challenge to China's compliance actions following WTO findings in 2012 that China's duties on high-tech steel were inconsistent with WTO rules. Those WTO-inconsistent duties contributed to over $250 million in annual export losses for American steel exporters. The U.S. compliance challenge was the first time any WTO member had initiated a WTO proceeding to challenge a claim by China that it had complied with adverse WTO findings. China terminated the illegal duties following the USTR challenge.* India agricultural bans: In June 2015, the WTO sided with the United States in a dispute challenging India's ban on U.S. agricultural products such as poultry meat, eggs, and live pigs, agreeing that India's measures represented unscientific and discriminatory restrictions. The decision affirmed that countries' avian influenza restrictions must be grounded in science, such as by taking into account the limited geographic impact from outbreaks, and not be simply a disguise for protectionism.* Argentina import licensing restrictions: In January 2015, the United States won a trade enforcement victory against Argentina that involved its widespread restrictions on the importation of a range of U.S. goods. The restrictions by Argentina affected billions of dollars in U.S. exports, including energy products, electronics and machinery, aero-space and parts, pharmaceuticals, precious instruments and medical devices, miscellaneous chemicals, motor vehicles, vehicle parts, and agricultural products.* China SUV / automobile duties: In June 2014, the WTO found that China breached WTO rules by imposing unjustified extra duties on American cars and sport utility vehicles. In 2013, an estimated $5.1 billion of U.S. auto exports were covered by those duties. China terminated the illegal duties following the USTR challenge.Other Enforcement Actions. In addition to these successes at the WTO, we have taken a wide range of additional enforcement action to protect the environment, ensure the protection of intellectual property, and protect labor rights so that American workers compete on a level playing field.* Peru timber verification: In February 2016, the United States made the first timber verification request under the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA). In August 2016, the United States issued a statement reviewing the overall findings of the government of Peru's verification report and identified additional areas of progress for Peru. The request serves as an important assessment tool to help ensure that Peruvian forestry laws are enforced throughout the supply chain, and that timber imported into the United States is legally harvested and exported.* South Africa agriculture export settlement: The United States and South Africa negotiated the removal of long-standing barriers to U.S. agricultural products entering South Africa. The removal of these unfair barriers ensured American poultry, pork, and beef farmers access to an important market, while providing South African consumers with an opportunity to buy and enjoy high-quality American agricultural products.* Honduras IPR enforcement: In March 2016, the United States announced Honduras' commitment to undertake a series of actions to strengthen the protection and enforcement of intellectual property in Honduras. The new commitment followed USTR's Out-of-Cycle Review of intellectual property protection in Honduras under the Special 301 report, and will benefit American agriculture, creative industries, telecommunications, textiles and apparel, and other U.S. exports.* Colombia labor steps: USTR and the Department of Labor worked with the government of Colombia on a Presidential Decree, issued in April 2016, to help inspectors investigate and apply potentially very significant fines to employers that use abusive forms of subcontracting to violate labor rights. With robust enforcement, this decree could have a significant impact on the ground for workers and address a main concern related to protection of workers' rights in Colombia.* NTE report: In March 2016, USTR released the National Trade Estimate on Foreign Trade Barriers (NTE) report, which represents a key component in the Administration's unprecedented trade enforcement efforts. The report serves as a guide to trade barriers being imposed across the globe, and the work President Obama has done to build a more capable enforcement system that utilizes resources from agencies across the government.* Special 301 report: In April 2016, the Obama Administration unveiled its 2016 Special 301 Report, which provides an overview on the global state of intellectual property rights and enforcement, and lists the most significant challenges facing American intellectual property creators and holders.Commerce AD/CVD Actions and Trade Agreements ComplianceCommerce, CBP, and ICE are currently enforcing 370 antidumping (AD) / countervailing duty (CVD) orders that address dumped goods or unfairly subsidized imports. Of these orders, 184 involve imports of steel and steel-related products, representing nearly half of all orders currently in effect. AD/CVD orders are an effective tool for providing relief to U.S. companies and workers injured by unfair trade practices and allowing American companies to compete on a fairer and more level playing field. This year, Commerce has conducted investigations and made final determinations on important cases brought by the American steel industry, including on cold-rolled, hot-rolled, and corrosion-resistant steel products, finding dumping margins as high as 620 percent on certain products from China. Following affirmative determinations of material injury by the U.S. International Trade Commission, Commerce puts into place AD/CVD orders. The results of these AD/CVD investigations and orders are already having a positive impact on American workers. Recent examples include:* Non-Oriented Electrical Steel. In October 2014, Commerce issued final affirmative AD determination orders with regard to non-oriented electrical steel from China, Germany, Japan, Korea, Sweden, and Taiwan and final affirmative CVD determination orders with regard to non-oriented electrical steel from China and Taiwan. Final CVD rates are as high as 158 percent for imports from China and AD rates are as high as 407 percent for imports from China.* Corrosion-Resistant Steel. In July 2016, Commerce issued AD and CVD orders on corrosion-resistant steel imports from China, India, Italy, and Korea, as well as an AD order on corrosion-resistant steel products from Taiwan. AD duties as high as 210 percent and CV duties as high as 241 percent were calculated for imports from China.* Cold-Rolled Steel. In July 2016, Commerce issued AD and CVD orders on cold-rolled steel from China, as well as an AD order on cold-rolled steel from Japan. In September 2016, Commerce issued further AD and CVD orders on cold-rolled steel from Brazil, India, and South Korea, as well as an AD order on cold-rolled steel from the United Kingdom. Commerce imposed final AD duties as high as 265 percent for China and final CV duties as high as 265 percent for China.* Hot-Rolled Steel. In October 2016, Commerce issued AD and CVD orders with regard to hot-rolled steel from Brazil and South Korea, and AD orders with regard to hot-rolled steel from Australia, Japan, the Netherlands, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. AD duties are as high as 33 percent for imports from the United Kingdom and final CV duties are as high as 57 percent for imports from Korea.* Cut-To-Length Plate. In November 2016, Commerce issued final affirmative AD determinations with regard to cut-to-length plate from Brazil, South Africa, and Turkey. AD duties were as high as 94 percent for imports from South Africa. Commerce is in the process of conducting additional investigations with regard to cut-to-length plate. In September 2016, Commerce issued an affirmative preliminary CVD determination with regard to cut-to-length plate from China with preliminary CVD duties of 210 percent for all imports from China. In November 2016, Commerce issued preliminary affirmative AD determinations with regard to cut-to-length plate from Austria, Belgium, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, with AD duties as high as 131 percent for imports from Italy. Commerce is scheduled to issue its pending final determinations by the end of March 2017.Commerce also administers a variety of programs and has offices to monitor trade agreement operation, and identify and address foreign government non-compliance with trade agreement obligations. Commerce operates the Trade Agreements Compliance Program, which deals with non-tariff barriers that affect U.S. businesses operating abroad; monitors foreign AD/CVD actions against U.S. firms, advocating on their behalf to preserve fair access to key markets; and tracks and advocates against foreign government subsidy practices that distort trade and unbalance the playing field for U.S. companies. In 2016, Commerce successfully resolved more than 30 foreign non-tariff barrier trade compliance cases with a total combined value of more than $14 billion in exports safeguarded. Commerce's advocacy efforts also helped bring about the successful termination of 26 foreign trade remedy proceedings in 2016, affecting approximately $373 million in U.S. exports.Given the importance of these matters, Commerce is establishing an Advisory Council on Trade Enforcement and Compliance (ACTEC) to directly advise the Secretary of Commerce on laws and government policies that deal with trade enforcement; identify and recommend programs, policies, and actions to help Commerce in its efforts to ensure that U.S. trading partners comply with their trade agreement commitments; and recommend ways that Commerce's trade enforcement and compliance policies and programs can better support a strong trade and manufacturing agenda and enhance the commercial competitiveness of the United States.Stepping up U.S. Customs and Border Protection Efforts on SteelCBP has worked alongside partners across the U.S. government to ensure that our trade laws are strictly enforced. CBP personnel work tirelessly at the 328 ports of entry and throughout the world to prevent shipments of unfairly traded goods from entering U.S. commerce, including steel that is being dumped on our markets or is unfairly subsidized and products that infringe upon U.S. intellectual property rights. In doing so, CBP defends the U.S. economy from unfair competition and the theft of American innovation and protects people who live and work in the United States from health and public safety risks posed by counterfeit goods. CBP continues to collaborate with stakeholders to ensure they have all the information they need to lawfully import and export their goods.* CBP recently identified approximately $7 million in AD/CVD discrepancies on Chinese steel plate shipments, and raised continuous bond amounts for three steel importers.* Additionally, CBP's Operation Flatline recovered over $800,000 in AD/CVD duties on imports of corrosion-resistant, flat-rolled steel products from China.* CBP's Trade Enforcement Task Force has collected over $1.5 million in unpaid AD/CVD duties on steel imports.* CBP has implemented a targeted approach to increase reviews of steel imports, which will provide a measure of the risk presented by steel imports, and identify targets for further enforcement.* CBP is requiring "live entry" for certain high-risk steel imports, meaning that all entry documents and duties are required to be provided before cargo is released by CBP into U.S. commerce.* CBP is partnering with the steel industry to deliver seminars for CBP, other U.S. government trade personnel (including Commerce and ICE), and customs brokers to provide participants with knowledge of industry operations and enhance understanding of how AD/CVD enforcement can best be implemented in the current trade environment. In Fiscal Year 2016, CBP and the U.S. steel industry conducted Steel Seminars in Laredo, Texas; New Orleans, Louisiana; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Long Beach, California; and most recently, in Detroit, Michigan. These seminars are scheduled to resume in early 2017 in Chicago, Illinois; Houston, Texas; Mobile, Alabama; Newark, New Jersey; and Seattle, Washington.* CBP's Base Metals Center of Excellence and Expertise for trade enforcement, which is specifically focused on the steel sector, is now fully operational, where CBP's industry experts work together to focus on outreach, targeting, and enforcement of steel imports.* CBP Laboratories and Scientific Services is directing funds to its network of laboratories, where CBP's forensic and scientific arm uses state-of-the-art techniques to identify AD/CVD evasion.Building International Pressure to Address Excess CapacityWe have made clear to our trading partners - in particular, China - that excess capacity in the steel, aluminum, and other industrial sectors is harmful to American manufacturers and an unsustainable drag on the global economy and that all major steel-producing nations must be committed to working together to eliminate policies that contribute to excess capacity, particularly in the steel industry.Over two years, we have engaged through bilateral mechanisms such as the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT) and the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED) to press China to address industrial excess capacity. In February 2015, China publicly announced plans to reduce steelmaking capacity by 100 to 150 million metric tons over five years. At the S&ED meeting in June 2016, excess capacity was a key economic priority, and we successfully secured significant new commitments from China, including a commitment that it will take further steps beyond its announced plans to progressively reduce its excess capacity, close loss-making "zombie enterprises," and ensure that central government plans and policies do not target the net expansion of capacity in its steel industry.We have built a robust coalition of like-minded trading partners who share our concerns regarding excess capacity and are committed to addressing this issue. At the end of May 2016, G-7 Leaders committed to quickly take steps to address global excess capacity across industrial sectors, especially steel. And on June 29, 2016, North American Leaders announced broad customs cooperation to ensure robust trade enforcement at our borders, including increased information sharing on high-risk shipments.On September 4-5, 2016, these steps contributed to President Obama's successful efforts to secure a commitment from the Leaders of the G-20, which also represents the world's largest steel producers, to establish a Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity. The Global Forum is designed to help lead to a reduction in global excess steel capacity and production through the identification of market-distorting policies that sustain excess capacity, actions to make net reductions in capacity, and monitoring and accountability mechanisms. In addition, at their summit meeting on September 5, 2016, President Obama and Chinese President Xi recognized that excess capacity was a global issue requiring collective responses, and committed to enhance cooperation and communication on the issue. In addition, China committed to take effective steps to address the challenges so as to enhance market function and encourage adjustments. China further committed to implement changes to its bankruptcy practice to facilitate market exit of failing firms and further improving its bankruptcy administrator systems to address excess capacity.Consistent and concerted international engagement over 2016 yielded these milestones:* Launch of the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity, December 16: More than thirty G-20 and other steel-producing countries put the Global Forum into action by approving Terms of Reference, and convening the first Forum meeting in Berlin, Germany. The United States, China, and Germany were selected as co-chairs of the Forum for 2017. The Forum will report the relevant G-20 ministers in 2017 and annually thereafter. The Forum's establishment demonstrates a commitment to identify and resolve market-distorting practices that sustain excess capacity, creating a negative impact on trade, the steel industry, and workers around the world.* Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade, November 23: The United States and China committed to exchange information and work together to address global aluminum excess capacity. The United States and China also agreed to hold a U.S.-China Steel Dialogue in 2017.* WTO Subsidies Committee, October: The United States with the European Union, Japan, Korea, and Mexico co-sponsored a paper on the problem of subsidies and overcapacity in certain sectors (e.g., steel and aluminum) and submitted it for consideration by the WTO Subsidies Committee. The submission proposed that the Subsidies Committee examine the extent to which subsidies contribute to overcapacity and how such subsidies could be further disciplined.* U.S.-Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit, September 8: ASEAN countries recognized excess capacity as a global problem and welcomed the formation of the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity envisioned by the G-20 and pledged to actively support its work.* OECD Steel Committee Meeting, September 8: The United States actively participated in an exchange of information regarding regional and global steel market developments and steelmaking capacity developments, to carry out a work program that increases transparency of steelmaking capacity data.* G-20 Leaders Meeting, September 4-5: Leaders committed to take effective steps to address the challenges of excess capacity in steel and other industries so as to enhance market function and encourage adjustment. Leaders also called for increased information sharing and cooperation through the formation of a Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity, to be facilitated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) with the active participation of G-20 members and interested OECD members. This Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity would report on progress to the relevant G-20 ministers in 2017.* U.S.-China Leaders Meeting, September 3: President Obama met with Chinese President Xi to emphasize U.S. concerns regarding excess capacity in steel, aluminum, and other industries. Both leaders recognized that excess capacity is a global issue which requires collective responses and committed to enhance cooperation and communication on the issue. In addition, China committed to take effective steps to address the challenges so as to enhance market function and encourage adjustments. China further committed to implement bankruptcy laws and further improve its bankruptcy administrator systems to address excess capacity.* G-20 Trade Ministers Meeting, July 9-10 and G-20 Finance Ministers Meeting, July 23-24: Trade and Finance Ministers committed to enhanced communication, cooperation, and effective steps to address the challenges surrounding excess capacity, including participation in the OECD Steel Committee.* North American Leaders Summit, June 29: The United States, Canada, and Mexico announced efforts to address government policies that distort the steel and aluminum sectors and contribute to excess capacity and announced that our customs agencies would work together to ensure robust trade enforcement at our borders, including increased information sharing on high-risk shipments of steel and other industrial goods.* U.S. China Strategic & Economic Dialogue, June 6-7: The United States secured China's commitment to, among other things, strictly contain steel capacity expansion, reduce net steel capacity, eliminate outdated steel capacity, and dispose of "zombie enterprises" through restructuring, bankruptcy, and liquidation, as appropriate.* OECD Ministerial Council Meeting, June 1-2: The United States and partners issued statements recognizing the negative impact on trade of global excess capacity in sectors such as steel and shipbuilding, and stressed the need to avoid market-distorting measures and to enhance well-functioning markets.* G-7 Leaders Meeting, May 26-27: G-7 Leaders committed to quickly take steps to address global excess capacity across industrial sectors, especially steel.* Joint Committee on Commerce and Trade Steel Dialogue with China, May 11-12: U.S. senior officials, with full participation of steel industry representatives and the United Steelworkers, held a dialogue with senior Chinese government and industry officials to emphasize America's serious concerns about excess capacity and injurious trade.* Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) High-Level Meeting on Excess Capacity and Structural Adjustment in the Steel Sector, April 18-19: The United States, Canada, the European Union, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Turkey, and others joined together to call for specific steps to address steel excess capacity and to urge the formation of a Global Forum facilitated by the OECD.* North American Steel Trade Committee, March 31 - April 1: The United States, Canada, and Mexico agreed on the need for all major steel-producing countries to make strong and immediate commitments to address the problem of global excess steelmaking capacity.Commerce and USTR organized a public hearing on April 12-13, 2016 to solicit a range of views about excess capacity to inform U.S. engagement with its trading partners, to identify solutions to address the steel crisis, and to hear the concerns of our steelworkers and industry. The request for public comment generated 100 submissions and 43 requests to testify. Among those testifying were twelve Members of Congress, the President of the United Steelworkers, a range of company CEOs and COOs, and five steelworkers' associations. Secretary Pritzker and Ambassador Froman each attended sessions with representatives from CBP, Treasury, Labor, and State.In August 2016, Commerce announced the release of a series of reports detailing current steel trade flows involving the top importing and exporting countries. The enhanced global steel trade monitor reports provide U.S. business with updated market intelligence about global steel trade flows.Bolstering Trade Enforcement ToolsOn February 24, 2016, President Obama signed the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (Customs bill). Coupled with the American Trade Enforcement Effectiveness Act (Level the Playing Field Act), signed by President Obama on June 29, 2015, the Customs bill strengthens our tools for ensuring that our trading partners and foreign industries are competing fairly and following our trade laws. Relevant agencies across the U.S. government have followed through by fully implementing the authorities in ways that have produced results.* Implementation of the Customs bill:o Commerce now requires foreign exporters who claim to be "new shippers" to post actual estimated duties rather than bonds during the pendency of reviews to determine the validity of their new shipper claims, and has increased its scrutiny of exporters claiming to be "new shippers" in AD/CVD proceedings.o Commerce has also increased the number of on-site verifications of the information provided by these so-called "new shippers," and has found many of the sales reported by these exporters to not be genuine. As a result, imports from many of these exporters are subject to higher AD/CVD rates.o On August 22, 2016, CBP published an interim final rule in the Federal Register, effective immediately, implementing additional procedures for investigating claims of evasion of AD/CVD orders pursuant to Title IV of the Act, commonly referred to as the Enforce and Protect Act of 2015, or EAPA. This strengthens CBP's enforcement efforts by establishing an additional method for submitting and investigating allegations of AD/CVD evasion against U.S. importers.o CBP established an interagency Trade Enforcement Task Force that enables CBP to leverage new enforcement authorities and harness the agency's trade enforcement expertise as a focal point for coordination with other government agency partners, including Commerce, Department of Justice, and ICE.o CBP established an Enforce Act team to operationalize the new mandatory AD/CVD evasion investigative procedures. This includes internal operating procedures, updating CBP's e-Allegations website, and drafting regulations.o CBP has issued four withhold release orders - which hold shipments in port - for shipment of goods made with prohibitive forms of forced labor and conducted various outreach events on implementation with various stakeholder groups including trade industry associations, foreign embassies, and non-governmental organizations.o ICE has held over 30 information sessions on trade investigations relating to forced labor allegations to audiences such as trade industry associations, foreign embassies, and non-governmental organizations. In addition, ICE has held five media interviews on this same subject, all of which resulted in media postings in both print and online media.o In 2016, the Small Business Administration integrated requirements in the law into the administration of the State Trade Expansion Program and issued matching-grant awards pursuant to the terms in the legislation.* CBP AD/CVD Enforcement:o In FY 2016, $14 billion of imported goods were subject to AD/CVD, and CBP collected $1.5 billion in AD/CVD cash deposits, which has increased over 25 percent since FY 2015, and by almost 200 percent since FY 2014.o CBP levied monetary penalties totaling over $30.6 million on importers for fraud, gross negligence, and negligence for AD/CVD violations under 19 U.S.C. section 1592.o CBP and ICE seized shipments with a domestic value of more than $5.3 million for violations of AD/CVD.* Implementation of Level the Playing Field Act:o Application of Level the Playing Field is already strengthening enforcement of the AD/CVD laws by ensuring consequences for non-cooperating parties, mandating the collection of cost of production data, and providing a firm legal basis for rejecting input values that are dumped or subsidized.* The President's FY 2017 budget requests:o $606 million for CBP trade administration activities and 3,816 full time staff to implement this work.o $84 million for the Commerce Enforcement and Compliance Program, a $4.5 million increase over the 2016 enacted level. This includes 347 full-time staff.o Annualizes the 38 additional positions funded by Congress in FY 2016 - a 10 percent increase in Commerce's enforcement staffing to address the urgent need for additional staffing caused by the sustained and significant increase in AD/CVD cases.Copyright Targeted News Services30FurigayJane-5744915 30FurigayJaneLoad-Date: January 13, 2017End of Document

CITE Successful in Connecting Public to Rising Chinese Firms - A First Man-Robot Co-Hosted Press Conference; Leaders of the China Information Technology Expo (CITE) held a successful press conference on January 6, 2017 and showcased the rising Chinese firms that are dominating the world of artificial intelligence (AI) and other technologies producing a tidal wave of innovation.PR NewswireJanuary 13, 2017 Friday 7:38 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 913 wordsDateline: LAS VEGAS, Jan 13, 2017 BodyNews Summary:The China Information Technology Expo (CITE) 2017 will be held from April 9 to 11, 2017.CITE officials held a successful press conference in Las Vega, Nevada on January 6, 2017.Leaders from CITE showcased the rising Chinese firms that will lead the way in the fields of artificial intelligence, virtual reality and intelligent robots, three themes that will generate the most buzz at this year's exhibitionArtificial Intelligence is the core theme of the Fifth CITE 2017, and a future trend as well. Kai-fu Lee once predicted that in the next 10 years, 90% percentage of occupations like translators, correspondents, assistants, security guards, salesmen, servicemen, etc. will be replaced by robots, partially or completely. Meanwhile, some new types of jobs will emerge. A part of traditional work will be able to proceed with the help of artificial intelligence. The conference CITE just held on Jan 6th, 2017 in Las Vegas (also known as a first man-robot co-hosted press conference), has perfectly explained this. At the conference, they used the intelligent robot to do the translation work, instead of interpreters.Ahead of the fifth annual China Information Technology Expo (CITE) in April 2017, members of the press and media outlets got a chance to meet some of the most promising technology firms coming out of Beijing, Shenzhen, Shanghai and elsewhere across the world's second-largest economy. To say it was a successful event would be an understatement. The unprecedented man-robot co-hosted press conference has taken artificial interpretation to a new era.CITE officials presented the primary themes at this year's exhibition -- virtual reality, artificial intelligence, intelligent robots and intelligent hardware and startup functions -- and the brands that will certainly generate the most domestic and international buzz this spring. FANUC, SIASUN, Foxconn and UBTECH were just some of the companies on hand.Wu Shengwu, deputy director of the electronics department of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, referred to one such leading AI company that will educate the public on this technology."With the theme of 'starting the intelligent age', CITE 2017 will mainly create smart home, intelligent hardware, VR, sensors and IoT, big data, Internet+, intelligent manufacturing and other industrial hot areas in the theme hall," Shengwu said in a statement. "In addition, we have reached an agreement with iFLYTEK, which is a well-known enterprise in China, regarding the setting of the artificial intelligence hall. It will focus on iFLYTEK to comprehensively demonstrate the whole ecological chain of artificial intelligence."Right after the keynote speeches, there was "The awards ceremony of Video China Brand Awards". Video China Brand Awards, the international authorized awards mainly designed for China Consumer Electronics brands during CES, are hosted by China Video Industry Association. Famous China Brands like TCL, Hisense, Skyworth, Changhong, Konka, etc. were given this horned awards. Together with the guests attended, "China Video Industry Association" announced them the awards. And in collaboration with CITE Organizing Committee, China Video Industry Association will organize quite a few onsite activities related to video industry in the coming CITE 2017 in April.During the event, iFLYTEK successfully launched a brand-new product that advances AI.Journalists, columnists and bloggers were able to meet the companies disrupting the tech industry as well as officials from the Chinese government. Although some may have been concerned about any potential language barriers, the bilingual event was assisted by an intelligent robot, which dismantled language roadblocks and ensured everything would run smoothly.CITE has covered a wide variety of tech topics since its inception in 2013. In its first year, CITE focused on mobile phones, 4k televisions and smart homes. By 2016, CITE was honing in on wearable devices, smart medical services and new energy vehicles. This year, CITE will be promoting the rise and integration of AI in the marketplace and in society.The participating tech firms, which also received awards at a ceremony in Las Vegas, will spotlight the growing AI trend and how the concept is changing the world for the better; one microchip, one idea and one robot at a time. In April, those in attendance will be able to garner a first-hand glimpse into automobiles manufactured with AI, businesses embracing automation with the aid of AI and devices equipped with AI that can help everyone from seniors to students, from working professionals to stay-at-home parents.These rising Chinese tech firms, which are the behemoths that will be household names, will show how powerful AI can and will be in our daily lives in the coming years. The fifth annual CITE will educate the public about how the future of AI is not an apocalyptic one, but rather a future of amazement, ingenuity and wealth.The fifth China Information Technology Expo (CITE) will take place from April 9 to April 11, 2017. For more information, see http://www.citexpo.org/en/.Facebook: @citexpochina  Twiiter: @citexpochinaContact: Maggie HeE-mail: maggie@ceac.com.cnTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cite-successful-in-connecting-public-to-rising-chinese-firms---a-first-man-robot-co-hosted-press-conference-300390756.htmlSOURCE CITE (China Information Technology Expo)Load-Date: January 14, 2017End of Document

China is Helping Baidu's AI Efforts, and it Couldn't Come at a Better TimeThe Daily Cardinal: University of Wisconsin - MadisonMarch 27, 2017 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 986 wordsBody"asset-content" data-asset-uuid="9ecdb346-8df5-50aa-b8d3-886688709483">Chinese internet search leaderBaidu, Inc. (NASDAQ: BIDU) has made a name for itself as one of the leaders in artificial intelligence in the world's most populous country. It has made no secret about its excitement regarding the prospects for the technology and has hired some of the foremost experts in the field for high level positions within the company. Now, it is getting the Chinese government seal of approval for its trouble.The government agency in China responsible for planning economic and social strategies will provide an undisclosed amount of funding to Baidu to develop a national laboratory committed to deep learning, a specific discipline of AI. The "lab" will not be a physical structure, but an online network of interconnected researchers sharing data. Baidu will be joined by Tsinghua and Beihang Universities and other academics from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The lab's initial focus will be in the areas of computer vision, biometric identification, and human-computer interaction. AI will transform industry after industry. Image source: Pixabay.AI is the new electricityBaidu's CEO, Robin Li has been outspoken regarding his belief regarding the potential of AI. At the Baidu World Conference in 2016, he stated "gone is the era of PC, and soon will we say goodbye to the era of mobile internet...We believe that coming is the era of artificial intelligence, which to us is the Baidu Brain."The Baidu Brain is an AI-based artificial neural network that sorts through reams of data and can detect patterns. Baidu's chief scientist Andrew Ng was a founding member of the team that developed the Google Brain prior to his tenure at Baidu. He is also an adjunct professor at Stanford University, where he taught AI and has made similar statements concerning his belief that AI will be transformational:I think that AI is a new superpower. AI is the new electricity. Two hundred years ago there was no such thing as electricity. You couldn't talk on phones, there was no electric lighting, you couldn't have a refrigerator. About 100 years ago as we started to build out electricity we saw that transformed not just one industry but industry after industry. We think that AI will similarly transform industry to industry. In that sense it is a superpower. This neural network and others like it have led to far-reaching developments in image recognition, natural language processing, voice recognition, and user profiling. These in turn have led to the development of virtual assistants that reside on most smartphones, smart home speaker systems, advances in medical research, and even tools for cybersecurity.White House issues report on AI. Image source: Pixabay.Governments worldwide waking up to the potential of AIChina isn't the only country considering the future of AI. A White House report issued in late December titled Artificial Intelligence, Automation, and the Economy that sought to determine the "ways that artificial intelligence will transform our economy over the coming years and decades." The initial report, Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence, revealed that the US government was spending $1.2 billion on AI research last year and recommended tripling that amount.Last year, DeepMind, a division ofAlphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google revealed that its AlphaGo AI system defeated South Korea's top ranked player at Go, an ancient Chinese game whose complexity had stymied previous computer attempts to master. South Korea subsequently announced a plan to invest $863 million in AI research over the coming five years. The UK has also announced its intention to invest 20 million pounds in the areas of robotics and AI. Keep up with money news, sent to your inboxSign Up!

Boston Consulting Group estimates that AI will generate between $100 billion and $120 billion in productivity gains by 2025. Just as big tech companies are racing to stake their claim in this transformational science, so are governments afraid of being left behind.The bump from the Chinese government couldn't come at a better time for Baidu -- the company has been struggling to re-energize its slowing growth and has been counting on AI to provide the catalyst. Online marketing, which represents more than 91% of the company's revenue, has fallen 8.2%  and 6.7%  year-over-year respectively, in its two most recent quarters, and the customers base that produces that revenue have fallen 18.6% and 15.9%. In the last year, the company has spent 14% of its total revenue on research and development expenses, and the majority of that has been on AI. The company is banking on AI to reverse course, and now it has some extra backing to do so.10 stocks we like better than BaiduWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Chinese Foreign Minister: No Winner In Conflict Between US, ChinaThe FrontrunnerFebruary 8, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 642 wordsBodyReuters (2/7, Packham) reports Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned Tuesday that there would be no winner in a conflict between China and the United States. "There cannot be conflict between China and the United States, as both sides will lose and both sides cannot afford that," Wang told reporters during a visit to Canberra. Wang's comments, Reuters says, were an attempt to "dampen tension between the two nations that flared" after President Trump's election.Bloomberg Politics (2/7, 201K), meanwhile, reports Ivanka Trump's visit to the Chinese Embassy in Washington last week - which was "lauded in China's press - came after behind-the-scenes meetings" between Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai and Jared Kushner, who "have had an extensive ongoing dialogue that has been positive, according to a White House official." Bloomberg says China is "bypassing more traditional diplomatic channels such as the State Department," instead "looking to open a more direct link to help avoid a trade war or military confrontation."Trump's Tweets About Robart Criticized In China.The New York Times (2/7, Forsythe, Subscription Publication, 13.9M) reports President Trump's public criticism of federal Judge James Robert, who blocked his immigration order, was condemned by Judge He Fan of the Supreme People's Court of China, who published "a scathing blog post about Mr. Trump's reaction." Judge He said Trump "breached the principle of an independent judiciary, and that people who attacked judges were 'public enemies of the law.'"Chinese Foreign-Exchange Reserves Near Six-Year Low.The Wall Street Journal (2/7, Wei, Subscription Publication, 6.37M) reports China's foreign-exchange reserves dropped below $3 trillion in January, the lowest level in almost six years. The People's Bank of China said Tuesday that the world's largest stockpile of foreign currency fell $12.31 billion last month to $2.998 trillion.NYTimes Analysis: Coal Plants May Hamper China's Climate Pledges.The New York Times (2/7, Wong, Subscription Publication, 13.9M) reports that China's coal plants "undermine" the nation's "aim of being a global leader on efforts to limit climate change." Despite such pledges to reduce carbon emissions, "at least four such plants have begun operating in China in the past four years, pushed by local governments and state-owned enterprises in coal-rich regions," and "dozens more have been under consideration."NYTimes A1: China Building Rail Networks Around The World.Profiling a new rail line between in the Horn of Africa, the New York Times (2/7, A1, Jacobs, Subscription Publication, 13.9M) reports on its front page that China, "having constructed one of the world's most extensive and modern rail networks at home," is taking "its prodigious resources and expertise global. Chinese-built subway cars will soon appear in Chicago and Boston, Beijing is building a $5 billion high-speed rail line in Indonesia, and the Chinese government recently christened new rail freight service between London and Beijing." According to the Times, "few places are being reshaped by China's overseas juggernaut like Africa, a continent that has seen relatively little new railroad construction in a century."China's Inclusion At Vatican Organ Trafficking Meeting Causes Ire.The New York Times (2/7, Tatlow, Subscription Publication, 13.9M) reports that a "politely worded but testy debate has flared" over a Vatican conference on human organ trafficking, with "a group of ethicists warning that China will use the participation of its most senior transplant official to convince the world that it has overhauled its organ procurement system." In a letter to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in Rome, 11 ethicists wrote: "We urge the summit to consider the plight of incarcerated prisoners in China who are treated as expendable human organ banks."Load-Date: February 8, 2017End of Document

How semiconductor companies can win in China's new product-development landscapeMcKinsey & CompanyMarch 1, 2017 WednesdayCopyright 2017 McKinsey & Company, Inc All Rights ReservedLength: 4312 wordsByline: McKinsey & CompanyHighlight: Product-design centers in China want to become stronger engines of global innovation. What does this mean for semiconductor suppliers?Body Link to Image China has become an important center of R&D and global product development for many OEMs that semiconductor suppliers serve. With the country's strong economic performance until recently, its local universities graduating millions of engineers, and many OEMs eager to capture growth , China's ascent over the past decade was both predictable and understandable. Hoping to take advantage of China's favorable environment, both Chinese and multinational OEMs have opened new product-design centers or expanded existing facilities throughout the country. The Chinese OEMs have traditionally asked their design centers to specialize in making products for the local market. Similarly, multinational corporations (MNCs) have focused their China-based design centers on customizing global designs for the Chinese market or on developing a narrow portfolio of China-focused products. Neither locally owned centers nor MNC-owned centers have emphasized innovation because most products created for the Chinese market do not include leading-edge technologies, partly to keep costs low.SidebarMcKinsey survey of OEM China design-center heads: MethodologyThroughout 2016, we surveyed about 80 R&D and product-development executives in OEM China design centers. All survey respondents were based in China, with 55 percent working for OEMs headquartered in China and the remainder employed by OEMs headquartered in Europe, North America, and elsewhere in Asia (exhibit). About half-54 percent-worked at companies that developed IT products, and the remainder were in other advanced industries, such as medical devices, industrial products, and automotive. Respondents averaged more than ten years' experience in China. The companies represented in the survey accounted for $1.6 trillion in global revenue and typically had three to five R&D sites in China. This survey follows a similar study that we conducted in 2012, and we compared our results with the previous findings. That will soon change, however. Chinese customers are becoming more discerning and increasingly want innovative products. In addition, the slowdown in the Chinese economy means that design centers must pursue more opportunities in other countries to maintain their momentum. These points were underscored by a survey we recently conducted of about 80 R&D and product-development executives at OEM China design centers.1 (See the sidebar, "McKinsey survey of OEM China design-center heads: Methodology," for more information.) The survey respondents expect OEM China design centers to shift their focus to increasing exports and driving innovation over the next few years, a move that would allow them to capture a much greater share of global product-development activity. If our survey respondents' predictions play out, demand for semiconductors and other components at OEM China design centers could rise from $350 billion in 2016 to $500 billion by 2020. This growth would represent the single largest opportunity for component suppliers globally. This article first reviews findings from the survey, discussing the evolution of OEM China design centers, their aspirations, and the government's role in promoting product development in China. It then focuses on strategic issues that semiconductor companies must consider when attempting to win business in China's thriving product-development landscape. The growth of product development in China Between 2007 and 2015, overall R&D spending in China rose more than fourfold across all companies and industries-the fastest growth among major countries or regions in the world (Exhibit 1). The increase was driven by both OEMs headquartered in China and MNCs with design centers there. Much of the spending was related to system-level, end-product design in IT and advanced industries, the sectors that formed the focus of our survey. R&D spending in China is expected to continue on its upward trajectory through 2020. According to McKinsey research, roughly 15 to 20 percent of OEM product development in IT and advanced industries took place in China in 2016. (This is at an aggregate level; China's share of global product development varies substantially by industry subsegments.) China's share of the global end market for IT and advanced industries is also about 15 to 20 percent. Locally owned centers account for 70 to 80 percent of product-development spending in China, with MNC-owned centers accounting for the remainder. Survey respondents expect their OEM China design centers to increase their share of global product development over the next five years by about ten percentage points. If this growth materializes, China will account for 25 to 30 percent of worldwide product development. This shift would realign the global product-development footprint, with $150 billion to $200 billion in annual product-development spending moving to OEM China design centers. Growth estimates varied somewhat by industry, but all respondents believe that locally owned centers will account for almost all of the increase in product-development spending in China. Despite recent economic challenges in China, growth of the country's end market will continue to outpace the global average and is expected to have an aggregate value of $3.5 trillion by 2020. But even with this above-average growth, China will represent only about 20 to 25 percent of the global end market. This means that China-based product-development activity might grow more rapidly than the Chinese end market. For component suppliers who supply OEM China design centers, the stakes are high. Managers at the location where an end product is designed and developed generally make important "design-in" decisions about its components, including semiconductors. If OEM China design centers gain ten incremental points of product-development share (and associated design-in), they could account for an additional $150 billion in component sales-another substantial realignment of the global footprint. Aspirations of OEM China design centers How can OEM China design centers gain a greater share of the global market and become exporters of product designs? In the view of survey respondents, the path to this goal involves globalization and innovation.Going global. Our survey showed that OEM China design centers, both local and MNC, would like to increase the number of products that can be exported outside China. Respondents from locally owned centers, regardless of industry, realize that this will necessitate a more global outlook. Currently, their initial designs only consider the needs of domestic customers. They then either modify the product for export to the global market or try to sell it internationally without modification. In the future, however, locally owned centers plan to consider input from both Chinese and global customers during the initial design phase, increasing the number of products with international appeal. For MNC-owned centers in advanced industries, the goal of increasing exports is also relatively straightforward, since they already consider the needs of both global and Chinese customers and want to continue this approach. For MNC-owned centers in IT, however, the situation is more complex. Although they now consider the needs of Chinese and global customers during product design, our survey showed that they wanted to more closely emulate the locally owned centers' design model to gain an advantage with local customers. But like all other design centers, they also want to increase the number of products for export. These dueling ambitions could be difficult to achieve.Creating leading-edge product designs. OEM China design centers want to create more leading-edge products that use the latest microprocessor architecture, connectivity technology, or software platforms. At MNC-owned centers, survey respondents hope to increase the percentage of leading-edge designs from 50 percent to 90 percent; respondents at locally owned centers hope to move from 30 percent to 85 percent. This obviously requires the development of better end-to-end capabilities. Can OEM China design centers achieve their aspirations? When we asked survey respondents if they were optimistic about the future of product development in China, 55 percent stated that OEM China design centers were already on par with, or superior to, leading global centers. However, 45 percent felt that they would never achieve best-in-class status. These divergent opinions are unsurprising, since there's evidence in support of both viewpoints.Optimistic view: OEM China design centers will become global innovation leaders. As the global market becomes more important, and as local customers increasingly focus on innovation, OEM China design centers must produce leading-edge products. To achieve that goal, nothing is more important than the presence of talented engineers. Some of our survey findings indicated the OEM China design centers have a wealth of talent, with respondents stating that improved capabilities are the most important driver of increased product-development activity in China (Exhibit 2). Respondents also stated that they'd seen capability improvements across disciplines, especially software architecture, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering. These upgrades have helped OEM China design centers continue to increase productivity despite wage inflation, including average annual increases of more than 10 percent in engineering salaries over the past five years.An opposing view: OEM China design centers will take longer to achieve aspirations, or fail to do so. If we look at our 2012 survey, there's reason to be concerned about the ability of OEM China design centers to achieve global growth with leading-edge products. Back then, most respondents predicted that their design centers would become global leaders. But when we measured progress against these aspirations via our 2016 survey, these objectives were not reached:• MNC-owned centers did not achieve their goal of becoming leading "global centers of excellence." Instead, they became more focused on selling to the China market, possibly because domestic demand was growing so strongly and innovation was not as much of a priority for local customers during that time.• Only 41 percent of products coming out of MNC-owned centers in China were described as "mostly new designs" (rather than lower-cost or derivative designs) in 2016-down from 48 percent in 2012. For locally owned centers, new designs decreased from 54 to 28 percent. This again may reflect an increased focus on the local market, which had not yet shifted its focus to innovation.• Between 2012 and 2016, the share of products created specifically for the global market dropped from 70 percent to about 35 percent at MNC-owned centers and remained at about 30 percent at locally owned centers as domestic demand surged. These findings indicate that OEM China design centers increased their resources, spending, and portfolios rapidly between 2012 and 2016, but they did so by focusing on the China market's overall desire for "value for money," which generally (but not always) involves derivative or lagging-edge designs. Some other findings from the 2016 survey also raise concerns. For instance, only 55 percent of respondents believe that China's current engineering productivity is greater than the global average. Further, one out of five respondents stated that OEM China design centers are now less productive than those in other locations. A few more years of double-digit cost inflation, combined with a lack of corresponding productivity improvements, will make China a high-cost location for design. There are also some concerns about engineering capabilities, despite the obvious gains made in recent years and the optimism expressed by many respondents. For instance, locally owned centers are less likely than MNC-owned centers to employ expatriates, China natives with overseas experience, or engineers who are proficient in English (the global language of product development). All of these factors may interfere with the dual goals of globalization and innovation. The lack of engineers with international experience may become a greater issue, since survey respondents at locally owned centers think that their engineering staff will include a greater percentage of China natives in the future. The impact of new government policies on OEM China design centers Over the past few years, the Chinese government has indicated that greater innovation in manufacturing and product development is a national priority. For instance, the "Made in China 2025" policy, implemented in 2015, aims to upgrade Chinese industry across sectors, with a focus on improving quality and helping local companies achieve a greater role in the global supply chain. Most of our survey respondents-53 percent-believe that new government policies will have a major impact and increase product development in China. For instance, agencies granting government contracts might favor companies that are headquartered in China or whose products contain many components made in China. Our survey also revealed that OEM China design centers believe that the government will provide more incentives, including subsidies, for companies to create products that can be considered Chinese in origin. For locally owned centers, this is not an issue, since their products will be Chinese by default. MNC-owned centers, by contrast, will need to take additional steps in order for their products to be considered Chinese. Many respondents stated that branding and manufacturing strategies, such as forming a partnership with a PRC2-headquartered company, could make a product local in the eyes of government or state-owned entities (SOEs). Others felt that engineering-based approaches, such as using software-source codes from PRC-headquartered companies, would help. Currently, only 25 percent of respondents believe that the inclusion of core components from PRC suppliers will increase the likelihood that a product is classified as Chinese. However, 61 percent stated that the inclusion of components from PRC-headquartered companies will be important within five years-and that has major implications for the semiconductor suppliers that serve OEM China design centers. The $500 billion treasure hunt for semiconductor and component suppliers serving OEM China design centers For component suppliers aiming to win the next generation of OEM designs in IT and advanced industries, the stakes are high. If our respondents are right and China adds ten percentage points to its global share of product development by 2020, OEM China design centers could control $500 billion worth of design-in decisions for critical end-product components, including semiconductors, up from roughly $350 billion in 2016. This growth could represent the single largest opportunity for component suppliers globally in the next five years. To win, component suppliers will have to understand the rapidly changing market. For instance, McKinsey research indicates that locally owned centers now account for about three-quarters of demand for semiconductors and other components in China, largely because they have complete freedom when making purchase decisions. By contrast, 49 percent of survey respondents at MNC-owned centers stated that they had little or no influence over the choice of core components for leading-edge designs, instead following decisions made at their headquarters. That may soon change, however, since two-thirds of MNC respondents believe that their Chinese design teams will have primary or equal control over component selection for their designs by 2020. That means both MNC-owned centers and locally owned centers could represent important opportunities. Shifting customer priorities could also have a major effect on component demand. Our survey indicates that OEM China design centers, both local and MNC, now select core components based on classic considerations such as technical performance, price, and quality (Exhibit 3). The location of a supplier's headquarters is of relatively little importance. This may soon change, however, since many MNCs want to indigenize their supply chains. That means they'd like to include more core components from PRC-headquartered suppliers so that the government and SOEs will consider their products local. In our survey, MNC respondents indicated that the share of core components purchased from PRC-headquartered suppliers could rise from 22 percent today to 32 percent within five years (Exhibit 4). For the total bill of materials, MNC-owned centers could increase sourcing from PRC-headquartered suppliers from 30 percent to 40 percent. If this happens, up to $50 billion of the servable market would shift toward PRC-headquartered suppliers. So, how can MNC and PRC-headquartered semiconductor suppliers succeed in this rapidly changing environment? What strategies will help them grow along with OEM China design centers and ensure that their components are incorporated into new global, leading-edge designs? As in any market, strong execution will be critical to winning. But the size and complexity of the China opportunity may create some additional complications. For instance, component vendors may have difficulty determining which locally owned centers represent the best opportunities, since many are still developing the capabilities needed to compete globally and produce leading-edge products. In addition, the local OEM market is incredibly dynamic, especially in emerging growth sectors, such as electric vehicles, the Internet of Things, and smart devices. In the past year alone, China-based appliance makers, Internet companies, television-content players, and solar-panel manufacturers have all announced plans to become electric-vehicle OEMs. Although many of these players will enter the market with great hype, the hot company one year can be an also-ran the next. Such uncertainty can complicate investment decisions when suppliers are contemplating their options. Strategic considerations for MNC component suppliers It can be difficult for MNC component suppliers to create a coherent China strategy because they often have a fragmented view of opportunities and challenges within the market. Their local country leadership, CEOs, heads of business units, and global function managers may hold different perspectives based on experience and their own priorities. To avoid conflict, MNC component suppliers should invest in building a common and aligned fact base to accelerate decision making, such as information on customers that might represent the best opportunities. They'll also need to address some basic questions, such as how important it is for them to win in China, whether they're poised to succeed, and the extent of the competitive threat from PRC-headquartered component suppliers, many of which are rapidly improving their technological capabilities.Customizing for China. Our survey, as well as discussions with project-development executives, suggest that OEM China design centers-both locally owned and MNC-owned-appreciate suppliers that have a personal touch. In other words, they like to partner with companies that consider how their needs might differ from those of design centers in other locations. Suppliers might gain a particular advantage with OEM China design centers by tailoring their products, pricing, business arrangements, and technical support to the Chinese market. This could involve the following activities:• designing components from the ground up for OEM China design centers, focusing on their desired performance and price points• providing rapid turnaround on pricing and product road-map requests (without long reviews at headquarters)• fulfilling orders through local distributors and system integrators• providing physical and online technical materials in Chinese that target engineers with less global experience These practices are straightforward to implement, but they may differ, in minor and significant ways, from a company's global processes. To implement them successfully, MNC component suppliers will have to shift some authority and road-map control to their local China teams. Empowering teams requires a delicate balance and may be one of the more challenging issues for MNC component suppliers to resolve. If they move too little authority and control, more nimble PRC-headquartered component suppliers will outhustle them for business. If they move too much, they might fragment their engineering function, wasting precious resources.Increasing local investment. MNC component suppliers have to make hard decisions about increasing their "on the ground" investment in China-the amount they spend improving their local operations or forming partnerships with local investors, component suppliers, or other companies. A partnership could involve something as simple as providing technical support, or a more substantial commitment, such as a minority investment. When evaluating their options, MNC component suppliers will need to identify the key buying factors for each of their target customer segments and determine if a greater investment in China would help them fulfill these needs. For instance, MNC-owned centers that conduct most of their business with PRC government entities are more likely to prefer PRC-headquartered suppliers so that their products will be considered "local." In cases like that, MNC component suppliers might not gain any benefits by forming a partnership with a Chinese player. If MNC component vendors do move forward with partnerships, they should remember that OEM China design centers now have the same high expectations for technology, cost, and reliability as their global counterparts. A partner that falls short in any of these areas could thus make it difficult to win business. Whenever MNC component suppliers discuss increasing local investments, all options should be rigorously tested with a war-gaming mentality. For instance, they'll need to consider whether forming a partnership with a Chinese company will help if their other global competitors are doing the same thing.Restructuring for success. No matter what path they choose, winning in China will require MNC component suppliers to make some hard trade-offs and undergo operational restructuring across regions and functions. For instance, they might need to move some decision-making authority out of headquarters to managers within China. To succeed, they'll need just as much support from home-country development teams as the local China team. Since it would be hard for these trade-offs to be driven from the bottom up, the MNC component supplier's senior-management team will need to orchestrate any actions. Strategic considerations for PRC-headquartered suppliers For PRC-headquartered suppliers, many of the most important strategic challenges involve their engineering capabilities. Most of these suppliers now win business from locally owned centers by offering low component costs and rapid time to market. In the future, however, locally owned centers will place more importance on finding partners with strong technological skills that can help them create innovative products for the global market. In our survey, respondents from locally owned centers stated that MNC technology and component suppliers are now their first choice for third-party partnerships, favoring them over other OEMs, Internet companies, and Chinese start-ups. To compete with their global rivals and prepare for long-term success with locally owned centers, PRC-headquartered suppliers will need to begin enhancing their capabilities now. They could take various routes to achieve this goal, ranging from hiring new engineers with the desired technological skills to acquiring leading-edge companies. Improved technological skills will also help PRC-headquartered suppliers win business from MNC-owned centers, which have long focused on obtaining leading-edge components when selecting suppliers. If these centers increase sourcing from PRC-headquartered suppliers, as our survey suggests, new opportunities will open up. As with locally owned centers, those PRC-headquartered suppliers that offer the most innovative products could capture the largest share of new business. Despite tremendous past success, OEM China design centers need to take their game to the next level by developing innovative products that will allow them to compete globally. They will need support from technology partners to achieve this goal, and both PRC-headquartered and MNC semiconductor suppliers are well positioned to provide it. The sheer scale of the opportunity to serve OEM China design centers, combined with the unique requirements of these customers, indicate that semiconductor suppliers cannot follow their traditional approach to the Chinese market. Instead, they must smartly and proactively build a new strategy that allows them to help OEM China design centers-especially the likely winners-meet their aspirations on the global stage. The stakes are huge.About the authorsThierry Chesnais is an associate partner in McKinsey's Hong Kong office, and Christopher Thomas is a partner in the Beijing office. The authors wish to thank Allen Chen, Fan Montgomery, and Tiankai Zhu for their contributions to this article.Footnotes1  In this article, we use the phrase "OEM China design center" to refer to all design centers located in the country, both multinational and local.

CHINA'S RELENTLESS MEDIA EXPANSION CREATES CHALLENGE OF GLOBAL PROPORTIONSStates News ServiceJanuary 8, 2017 SundayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 1633 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: DHARAMSALA, India BodyThe following information was released by the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD):As many Western media organizations battle with decreasing revenues, the Chinese government sees an opportunity to promote its political values abroad. That is done by buying space in foreign newspapers, as well as expanding the global presence of the Chinese state media.Berlingske, one of the world's oldest newspapers, was last Tuesday published together with a 12 page lift-out insert paid for by the Chinese embassy in Denmark. One of the articles in the insert highlighted China as a responsible and peaceful player on the global political stage; yet another article stressed that life has never been better in Tibet, thanks to the Chinese authorities' respect for local culture and religious freedom.Personally I was surprised, but not shocked. Last summer, the Chinese embassy in my native Sweden bought a whole page "ad" in one of our largest newspapers to justify China's territorial claims in the South China Sea, just before the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague ruled that those very claims were invalid and in contradiction to international law.Look beyond Scandinavia and the phenomenon, naturally, proves to be even worse. An insert called "China Watch" is regularly published with leading medias such as the Washington Post, the Telegraph in the UK, Le Figaro in France, and Australia's Fairfax Media. It is paid for by the Chinese government, and edited by China Daily, a state-run newspaper.China Watch is also published online by the above mentioned media companies, and is described on the Telegraph's website as: "Bringing you informative and diverse stories about contemporary China's dynamic development, including the latest news from the Technology, Business, Travel, Culture, Society and Sports sectors."In between the lines, of course, there is no shortage of political articles. When the first edition of China Watch was published in Australia last summer, its eight pages dismissed the Philippines stance in the South China Sea, and emphasized the gains Australia could make from a free-trade agreement suggested by China. (In Australia, China Watch is now published monthly together with the Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, and the Australian Financial Review, all outlets belonging to Farifax Media.)Indeed, there is no lack of Chinese funding for buying pages or inserts in foreign publications. Already in 2009, then president Hu Jintao unveiled a US$7 billion budget to expand the global presence of state medias such as China Daily, Xinhua News Agency, China Central Television Network (CCTV), and the likes during the coming years. (This sum can be compared to the US$289 million that the British government recently granted the BBC to expand its operations over the coming five years.)Overseas PushApart from simply buying space in already established medias, China is also developing its own media organizations for a conscious push overseas. The already mentioned China Daily today hires over 500 reporters, of which 70 are stationed abroad. Apart from its Hong Kong edition, the newspaper also runs a U.S. edition and an African edition, as well as an Asia Weekly and European Weekly edition.Also, China Radio International is broadcasting around 400 hours daily on 38 different languages, but more resources still has been injected in the national newswire Xinhua. Of its over 3,000 employees, about 400 are found in the 170 or so overseas bureaus that the wire is now boosting. Xinhua publishes its material in eight different languages, including Arabic and Portuguese, and already last year reportedly got well over 100,000 paying subscribers abroad, in the form of media companies and various organizations.Since Chinese state media don't necessarily have to make any profit, Xinhua can "outsmart" Western competitors like Reuters and The Associated Press by simply offering lower rates, which in part explains its success in Africa and Latin- and South America.The financial muscles of Xinhua can also be seen by the fact that it has regularly been buying billboard space at Times Square in central New York for commercial and propaganda purposes since 2011. After the Hague ruled against China in the South China Sea last summer, Xinhua for an undisclosed sum ran a video on the Times Square billboard to defend China's territorial ambitions 120 times every day during two weeks.An Internet ad for CGTN invites people to follow the outlet on various social media platforms.And during the recent New Year weekend, China also announced the creation of a brand new media organization named China Global Television Network (CGTN), with the purpose of "rebranding China." Upon its establishment, CGTN received a congratulatory letter from President Xi Jinping, who urged the new broadcaster to "tell China stories well" to the world.The Global Times an English-language daily managed by People's Daily provides an excerpt from the president's letter: "CGTN should tell stories about China well and spread China's voice well; enable the world to see a multidimensional and colorful China; present China as a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development, and an upholder of international order; and make efforts to build a community of common destiny."For good measure, Liu Yunshan, head of the central propaganda department, filled in that CGTN should "highlight new ideas and strategies of state governance with Xi [Jinping] as the core."CGTN is set up by CCTV in a bid to integrate broadcasting with online resources to create a multi-language, multi-platform media group. Hence, CGTN will operate from the state of the art production facilities already established by CCTV in Washington as well as in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi. Since CCTV launched its first 24 hours news channel back in 2000, the expansion has been rapid, and CGTN will now be taking over the responsibility over broadcasting that is being done in six different languages.An Uneven FightWith the phrase "tell stories about China well" in mind, all countries naturally want to do their best to market themselves abroad. But there is no equivalent to China neither in ambition nor in resources. Spendings on media might be outperforming the BBC's budget by far, but it still only represents a fraction of the Chinese government's orchestrated effort to exchange raw cash for soft power.David Shambaugh, professor at George Washington University, estimates that China spends about US$10 billion every year on external propaganda, which also includes soft power initiatives such as culture, sports and educational funding of the Confucius Institutes that have been popping up in hundreds of campuses around the world during recent years. To put things in perspective, Shambaugh compares this with the US$666 million that the American government spent on "public diplomacy" in 2014.Still, when it comes to media policy, the differences are ever more striking. Obviously, many western medias may have their own agendas, but none of them are soaking up billion of dollars in state aid to carry out an outspoken political mission.For all the hundreds of million of dollars the BBC is receiving from the British government, no sane British prime minister would demand the broadcaster to "tell good stories about Britain." On the contrary, a vast share of the funding is utilized to scrutinize the country's establishment.In the U.S., the public media sector is even smaller, its biggest fully state funded actor being Voice of America with an annual budget of just over US$200 million. As with other American soft power vehicles such as Hollywood and Motown, the media sector is privately owned which grants a freedom and creativity that Chinese counterparts can only dream of.For anyone doubting the state of freedom of the Chinese media, it was less than a year ago that president Xi personally paid a visit to the offices of China's three most important party media organizations Xinhua, CCTV, and the People's Daily. When wrapping up the visits with a symposium, the president declared that: "All news media run by the Party must work to speak for the Party's will and its propositions and protect the Party's authority and unity."It is also worth noting how China has been slipping to place 176 out of 180 in Reporter's Without Borders' index over global press freedom, behind countries like Iran, Somalia and Sudan. China was also dubbed "the world's biggest prison for journalists" for several years before just recently being surpassed by Turkey. Still, over 40 Chinese journalists are found behind bars today.Despite this increasing repression, Western media organizations have been reluctant to cancel their deals with China. The Washington Post, for instance, has been publishing China Watch since 2011. Money talks, and in a time of decreasing revenues for media in general and print ads in particular, it might be hard for many to ignore the Chinese checkbook.One notable exception is the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle, which cancelled its negotiations for cooperation with CCTV back in 2015, after its Chinese reporter Gao Yu was paraded on the Chinese broadcasting network before being sentenced to seven years in prison.Taiwan, of course, is also a target of Chinese media, and how to tackle China's propaganda push abroad reminds a tricky question. But given the resources and determination of the Chinese government, fighting back using the same means would be doomed to fail. It would also be a moral failure; the best solution is rather to keep on producing truthful high-class journalism and compete with quality rather than quantity. That, in combination with carefully checking the actual source when reading news about China.Post Views: 311Load-Date: January 9, 2017End of Document

From 'Iron Man' to 'Star Wars,' How Hollywood Cashes in on China's Box OfficeTargeted News ServiceFebruary 15, 2017 Wednesday 6:06 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1090 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. BodyThe University of Virginia issued the following news release:In 1999, Aynne Kokas was an undergraduate student living in a film studio in Beijing that housed not only the studio, but a film academy and student dorms. There, she witnessed some early Sino-U.S. movie collaborations - an experience that eventually led her to become a leading expert in the field of Hollywood's relations with China.Now an assistant professor of media studies at the University of Virginia, Kokas has written a new book, "Hollywood Made in China," an examination of that growing relationship and what it means for media in both countries.On Wednesday, Kokas joined UVA Today on Facebook Live to discuss the inner workings of China's film quota system and how Hollywood is trying to gain entry to the country, whose film market is the second-largest in the world and rapidly gaining on the country in first place, the United States.Q. "The Great Wall," starring Matt Damon, just came out. With a budget of more than $150 million, the film is the largest-ever U.S.-China co-production and the most expensive film ever shot entirely in China. How do films like that get created and brought to market?A. One of the things that's really interesting is the incentive structure. There is currently a 34-film export quota to China. So only 34 foreign films can be exported to the market. This number sometimes shifts, but what this essentially means is that Hollywood studios have a limited number of chances to get their films into the Chinese market.This is important because China's market is the second-largest in the world. It was valued at $6.8 billion last year, and from 2011 to 2015 the market grew at 30 percent per year. Some estimates had China's market overtaking the U.S. in 2017. China's market actually grew a lot more slowly last year, but we are still seeing the possibility that it will catch up within the next five years.Making a co-production [like "The Great Wall"] is actually a way to circumvent that 34-film quota. It gives Hollywood studios or big investors in the U.S. a chance to actually enter the Chinese market beyond the quota. So it's treated like a local film in China and a local film in the U.S.Q. How does Hollywood tailor movies to meet the requirements of China's quota system?A. There is an interesting path through which Hollywood studio films have to walk in order to enter the Chinese market. First of all, they have to be approved by [China's] State Administration of the Press Publication, Radio, Film and Television. They are extremely powerful. Unlike in the U.S., where it is typically the production company or the producer or the director that has final cut approval, in this case, the Chinese regulatory agency has final approval over what can actually be distributed in the Chinese market. So it is a huge shift in the balance of power.We also see some changes in content, so Hollywood studios are taking deliberate action to make their films more appealing for the Chinese market. So a film like "Iron Man 3" cast Chinese actors. We also saw the most recent "Star Wars" film, "Rogue One," also cast major Chinese actors in order to act as a lure for the Chinese market. "Transformers 4" was shot in Hong Kong, and the Chinese minster of defense [character] was the only major competent government official in the entire film. [Director] Michael Bay's next film after "Transformers 4" is actually a near-future dystopia in which China calls in the U.S. treasury debt and takes over the U.S.So there are some interesting ways in which these narratives are starting to shift in such a way that it more favorably or more powerfully portrays the Chinese government.Q. Are there sometimes two versions of a film, one for the United States market and another for China's?A. Absolutely. Some films have historically had 10 or 15 additional minutes. For example, "Iron Man 3" had 10 additional minutes of footage that was shown in the Chinese version that included more of the Chinese actors.However, that model has been relatively ineffective because Chinese "Netizens," or the very active Internet population in China, are kind of offended by that level of pandering. So in some ways it actually negatively affects the box office of the film.Q. How is movie consumption in the United States different from that in China?A. It's a centerpiece of the weekend experience [in China], so people frequently take their families. Movie-going in the U.S. has become slightly less popular than China, especially up through 2016, when it was growing as a social activity for [Chinese] families.The new theaters in China are equivalent to the highest of the high-end movie theaters in the U.S. There are extremely high ticket prices, $20, $25 or $30. There is a lot of digital capacity for IMAX or 3-D because these are really new theaters. China actually has more theatrical capacity, so more seats that people can sit in and watch a movie, than the U.S. does, which is a radical change from seven years ago. They have been increasing their theatrical distribution capacity year-over-year.Q. Can you describe your new book, "Hollywood Made in China?"A. I look at what it means that there is this new age of collaboration between China and Hollywood. We have never seen anything like this before.Typically, when Hollywood studios went abroad, it would be to film something and then get out - this idea of run-away production. Maybe you shoot something in France or maybe you shoot something in Italy or maybe you shoot something in Vietnam or in Canada. But it's really just a way to have a cost benefit and maybe get some local color.But given the regulatory structure of the Chinese film market, it's impossible to do that. So the level of engagement that Hollywood studios have to have with Chinese government entities is extremely high.The part that's even more interesting about this is that this is actually part of several, larger Chinese government policies. One is the "going out policy," which is this idea of enhancing China's profile abroad. The other is this idea of "soft power," or cultural security; essentially using culture as a way to enhance China's global power.The final way is this idea of telling Chinese stories to enhance and improve sympathy for the Chinese government abroad. So, in order to access the Chinese market, a lot of Hollywood studios are actually advancing Chinese policy goals.Contact: Jane Kelly, 434/243-9935, jak4g@virginia.eduCopyright Targeted News Services30TagarumaMar-5780138 30TagarumaMarLoad-Date: February 17, 2017End of Document

They have been increasing their theatrical distribution capacity year-over-year.Q. Can you describe your new book, "Hollywood Made in China?"A. I look at what it means that there is this new age of collaboration between China and Hollywood. We have never seen anything like this before.Typically, when Hollywood studios went abroad, it would be to film something and then get out this idea of run-away production. Maybe you shoot something in France or maybe you shoot something in Italy or maybe you shoot something in Vietnam or in Canada. But it's really just a way to have a cost benefit and maybe get some local color.But given the regulatory structure of the Chinese film market, it's impossible to do that. So the level of engagement that Hollywood studios have to have with Chinese government entities is extremely high.The part that's even more interesting about this is that this is actually part of several, larger Chinese government policies. One is the "going out policy," which is this idea of enhancing China's profile abroad. The other is this idea of "soft power," or cultural security; essentially using culture as a way to enhance China's global power.The final way is this idea of telling Chinese stories to enhance and improve sympathy for the Chinese government abroad. So, in order to access the Chinese market, a lot of Hollywood studios are actually advancing Chinese policy goals.Media ContactJane KellyUniversity News Associate Office of University Communicationsjak4g@virginia.edu (434) 243-9935Load-Date: February 16, 2017End of Document

China's 'unofficial' sanctions rattle South KoreaCNN WireMarch 3, 2017 Friday 1:19 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 491 wordsByline: By Jethro MullenDateline: HONG KONG (CNNMoney) BodyHONG KONG (CNNMoney) --  South Korean businesses were rattled Friday by signs that the deployment of a controversial U.S. missile system in the country could spark a travel boycott by China.The government in Seoul said it believed Chinese authorities had told travel agencies in Beijing to stop selling trips to South Korea, intensifying fears of a trade war between the neighbors. The Chinese government, which is upset about South Korea's decision to host the THAAD missile defense system, denied any knowledge of such an order."Instead of chasing shadows that don't exist, we hope the South Korean side will heed the voice of the people and take concrete actions to avoid causing further damage to bilateral relations," said Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.At least one Chinese travel company, Tuniu, has already stopped sales of South Korean trips with immediate effect. The online travel firm said in a statement Friday that it objected to the THAAD deployment and a decision by the Lotte conglomerate to make land available for the missiles. South Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism said it had learned that Chinese authorities summoned representatives of travel agencies in Beijing on Thursday and instructed them to stop selling South Korean tours from March 15."The instruction was unofficial but China has a tendency not to give official orders for sanctions," said Wang Gi-young, a director at the ministry.It wasn't immediately clear if other Chinese tour operators were joining Tuniu in its boycott.

SUN BAOHONG AT THE HANDOVER CEREMONY OF THE SECURITY CHECK-OUT FACILITIES DONATED BY CHINA TO THE PARLIAMENT OF GHANAStates News ServiceJanuary 5, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 528 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:Rt. Hon. Edward Korbly Doe Adjaho, Speaker of the Republic of Ghana,Hon. Ebo Barton-Odro, Deputy Speaker,Hon. Alan Bagbin, Majority Leader,Hon. Osei Kyei-Mensah Bonsu, Minority Leader,Ladies and gentlemen,Dear friends,Good morning.It is my great pleasure to attend the Handover Ceremony of the Security Check-out Facilities Donated by China to the Parliament of Ghana. The donation of these facilities was announced during the visit of H.E. Mr. Yu Zhengsheng, Chairman of the National Committee of Chinese Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). These facilities include 3 sets of X-Ray Baggage Scanner, 3 sets of Walk Through Metal Detector, 100 sets of Hand Held Metal Detector and 1 set of Human Body Security Detector. With the help of technicians from the China Nuctech Company Limited, these facilities have been put into application and will play an important role in security protection work.H.E. Chairman Yu's visit was crowned with success last April. We thank Rt. Hon. Speaker Adjaho, the Parliament of Ghana, and the Ghanaian people for the warm reception. That visit, which was the first in the past 9 years by a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, wrote a new chapter in China-Ghana friendship.Ghana is the second sub-Saharan African country to establish diplomatic relations with China. Over the past 56 years and through the efforts of several generations, China Ghana traditional friendship and mutual political trust have been consistently enhanced. Our cooperation on economy and trade has kept good momentum and yielded bountiful results. The Cape Coast Sports Stadium and Kotokuraba Market were successfully completed and handed over to the Ghanaian side last year. The project of 1,000 boreholes funded by Chinese government is under construction now and more than 300 boreholes have been completed. The two peoples communicate more frequently nowadays. At present, there are more than 4,600 Ghanaian students studying in China. In 2016, the Chinese government provided more than 1000 training opportunities to Ghana and the second Confucius Institute in Ghana was unveiled at the University of Cape Coast.The Johannesburg Summit of FOCAC of December 2015 drew a magnificent blueprint for the development of China Africa relations. While greeting the new year of 2017 with a lot of hope, China is very ready to work with Ghana to accelerate the implementation of follow-up actions of the Summit. Apart from conducting more grant projects to improve people's livelihood, China will do more to respond to Ghana's appeal for job creation and industrialization. We will focus intensively on cooperation on production capacity, equipment manufacturing and private sector, and explore new areas and new modes for cooperation so as to help Ghana to embark on the road of self-sustained development.Ladies and gentlemen,Rt. Hon. Speaker is my old friend and I am so grateful to him for what he has done to promote friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Ghana.Thank you.Load-Date: January 6, 2017End of Document

Speaker Kecheng Fang Breaks Down Misconceptions of Chinese MediaThe Catalyst: Colorado CollegeMarch 12, 2017 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 616 wordsBodyOn Thursday, March 2, Colorado College hosted Kecheng Fang, a former Chinese political reporter, who spoke about contemporary media in China. Fang is a doctoral candidate at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication, and holds a bachelor's and master's degree in journalism from Peking University in Beijing. Fang worked as a reporter for China's Southern Weekly-the Chinese equivalent of the New York Times-from 2010 to 2013, and his writing has been featured in publications like The New Yorker, The Atlantic, BBC, and Politico.Fang intended to major in math but he changed courses after developing an interest in the way news shapes public opinion. "Reading newspapers that were outspoken and invested in the world changed the direction of my life," said Fang. "I believe they are key to achieving social justice-especially in countries like China where people enjoy less freedom and there is less social justice because the government is not held as accountable." After graduating from university, Fang observed the complex relationship between Chinese media and the government as a reporter for Southern Weekly. His curiosity was not satisfied. Seeking a theoretical framework to help him understand the purpose and influence of media, Fang moved to the U.S. to pursue a PhD in philosophy.Fang's primary focus was to debunk some of the common misconceptions surrounding Chinese media and move beyond the censorship, resistance, and dichotomy often associated with the Chinese government. "People always want to know what it was like working as a journalist in China," said Fang. "They think reporters are rebels and dissidents working against the government. But it's not that simple."Hoping to provide a more "nuanced picture" of Chinese media, Fang addressed three common misconceptions: freedom of the press, the labeling of reporters as dissidents, and the role of the internet in modern-day China. Even though there are no private forms of traditional Chinese media and none of the digital platforms can publish original work or hire their own journalists, Fang maintained that Chinese media has far more freedom than Western media indicates."There is space for diverse opinions and investigative journalism in China," said Fang. It is the method of informing, the types of stories and information deemed appropriate for public consumption that differs from Western media. Reporters resent their portrayal by Western media as dissidents resisting the oppression of their government. Traditional publications are owned by the government to inform the public without violating the trust of those who grant them access. "Access is not everything and does not guarantee good journalism," said Fang. Nevertheless, Fang argued that it is working for and with the Chinese government that enables them to do their jobs.With regards to the internet, many social media sites are blocked within China's borders for the majority of citizens. The Chinese government knows the power held by that platform. While they encourage Chinese social media entrepreneurship within the country, government officials use social media to influence the way the world views China. "Like many politicians in the U.S., social media acts as the Chinese government's direct line to the world," said Fang. "They know how to use it."Hosted by the Mosaic Club and attended primarily by students, Fang's presentation provided a unique look into a world removed from the United States. At the end of his presentation, Fang asked the audience to consider moving beyond the headline angle of censorship and resistance and instead concentrate on the tactical cooperation that is crucial to Chinese media.Load-Date: March 12, 2017End of Document

IN HUMAN RIGHTS SPEECH, RUBIO CALLS FOR RELEASE OF TWO CHINESE POLITICAL PRISONERSStates News ServiceFebruary 7, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 1785 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by Florida Senator Marco Rubio:During a Senate floor speech last night, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) highlighted the plight of two lawyers imprisoned by the Chinese government for their human rights advocacy. Rubios speech was his second in 2017 as part of his #expressionNOToppression initiative, which highlights human rights abuses around the world.Rubio, the Chairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, called on Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to prioritize the release of these two dissidents in his diplomatic engagement with China. Rubio also stated that he would bring up these human rights cases, among others, with Governor Terry Branstad (R-IA) during his Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing to serve as U.S. ambassador to China.Rubios full speech can be watched here, and a downloadable broadcast quality version is available for TV stations here. A full transcript is below.U.S. Senator Marco RubioU.S. Senate FloorWashington, D.C.February 6, 2017https://youtu.be/hyNDevgQLc8Senator Rubio: Mr. President, I know that we are in the middle of an important debate about a topic of our education in our schools. And one of the topics I hope young Americans will learn more about is the state of affairs across the world when it comes to human rights.We are a vibrant society engaged in a heated debate, as we often have throughout our history about items of political matters. If you look here today there are people standing up to speak on different side of an issue. You see the Republican Party today controls the White House, the Senate, and the House. And yet, you have people with the freedom in this country to be able to stand up and oppose that. Weve seen that across the country and demonstrations and then speeches and then all sorts of other protected speech. Were very fortunate, were very blessed, to live in a nation with those freedoms.But thats not the case all over the world. And I wanted to take this opportunity in the midst of all this debate and discussion about an important topic --the nomination before the Senate-- to remind people that despite our differences on these issues we are truly blessed to be able to live in a country where opposing the party in power does not mean you go to jail. As I have been doing for some time now, I wanted to come this evening and highlight yet another example of human rights abuses that are taking place in a very important part of the world.For the past couple of years, my office and I have been highlighting human rights cases through our social media campaign we call it #ExpressionNOTOppression.The goals of this are to raise awareness about these cases and the individuals who are suffering at the hands of these repressive governments. We know through history that some of the oppressed peoplewe may think that these floor speeches matter, we may not think that mentioning here in this forum matters. But it does to them because one of the first things oppressors tell them is that the world has forgotten about you and you dont matter anymore. That is one of the first reasons why we come is to raise awareness and to let them know we know their names and we know their story and we will continue to speak out on their behalf.The second is to show their families and their loved ones that elected officials like me, here in the United States, have not forgotten them because we know that tyrants, as I said, like to tell political prisoners that they are alone in their struggle.And the third is to call for action whether its for the administration to make their causes their priorities too, or to call on these governments to release these individuals.And there is one more reason why I think this effort again, #ExpressionNOTOppression, is important; because as well as all the good work being done here on both sides of the aisle in defense of human rights promotion of democracy and the defense of God-given freedoms like religious freedom, and freedom of the press, and free speech which we celebrate here even in this debate, they have to continue to be a pillar of our foreign policy. And so I hope that these cases we highlight bring that guiding principle to light.Today, I wanted to discuss the cases of two Chinese political prisoners, whose courageous wives I had the opportunity to meet last week when they visited here in Washington, D.C. These women personally requested that I intervene on behalf of their husbands, pressing the Chinese government to immediately and unconditionally release them and in the case of one to account for his whereabouts.But perhaps just importantly, they urged me that I press our own State Department to prioritize these cases diplomatically in the hopes that these families could be reunited in the not-too-distant future. And so I come here to today to urge our now, new Secretary of State, Mr. Tillerson, to prioritize the release of these men in his diplomatic engagement with China.In the coming weeks, I also expect well have a chance to hear from the presidents nominee to be the United States Ambassador to China, Governor Branstad of Iowa. When he comes before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for his confirmation hearing, I will bring up these cases and others, and urge him to make their freedom a priority of his work if confirmed.Jiang Tianyong, is a 45-year old lawyer. He was disbarred by the Chinese government because of his vigorous human rights advocacy, including his representation of blind legal advocate Chen Guangcheng, fellow rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng, Falun Gong practitioners and other human rights cases. Despite the risks of this work, he has been steadfast in his support of the families and of their rights to lawyers and legal advocates caught up in Chinas sweeping nationwide crackdown on the legal community in July 2015, which ensnared roughly 250 lawyers and activists.Jiangs wife indicated, consistent with a spate of recent media stories, that his family and friends lost contact with him in late November of last year. Thats when a Chinese state-controlled newspaper reported he had been detained for a series of trumped up charges.His wife has received no formal confirmation of his precise whereabouts, and to date, he has been denied access to a lawyer of his choosing. Even more troubling is that this is entirely legal under Chinas laws even though it violates all international norms of justice. Under Chinas own laws, authorities may hold him, or anyone, for up to six months without informing his family where he is held and without allowing him to access a lawyer, conditions that the United Nations Committee against Torture has found places detainees at a high risk of torture. Indeed, reports over the past months about four other human rights lawyers provide detailed information about the Chinese authorities use of torture to extract confessions and impose unbearable psychological pressure.All of these realities underscore that China remains a country of rule by law. Congressman Chris Smith of New Jersey and I co-chair the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which found in our 2016 Annual Report that the Chinese Communist Party has continued to reject the notion that the rule of law should supersede the Partys role in guiding the functions of the state As such, lawyers, advocates, dissidents and others often find themselves in the Partys crosshairs, persecuted under the law, rather than protected by it, and they have no recourse for justice.A second Chinese individual I want to highlight today is lawyer Tang Jingling, who has also been disbarred for his rights advocacy. He first gained prominence as a lawyer working on cases related to village compensation, corruption and also by representing activists. In January of last year, he was convicted of inciting subversion of state power thats a charge and sentenced to 5 years in prison. He was first detained in May 2014 on suspicion of picking quarrels and provoking troubles just imagine that: picking quarrels and provoking troubles is a crime in China. This happened by the way during the lead up to the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests when the Chinese government worked desperately to wipe out any discussion or memory of this historically brutal crackdown. In reality, all Tang and other activists did was participate in a nonviolent disobedience movement seeking legal and social reform in China.Following his conviction, Tang eloquently wrote, Inside the grand edifice of the court, we can see stately and ornate furnishings and decorations, and we can see the government employees in dignified attire. But we cannot see the law and we can definitely not see justice.He continues, movingly speaking of the faith that has sustained him in the midst of injustice: The Holy Bible has a passage that reads: Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake. Today, we have been pronounced guilty, thrown in prison, separated from our families, and have endured humiliation and difficultiesand I am far from being able to convince or prove to others how these tribulations could have become my blessings. But Gods will is inevitably difficult to understand. I often pray and ask him to give me more strength, so that I may persevere until the moment of revelation. I dare say, in 2011, while in a secret jail, and now in detention, almost every day I have passed has been calm and fulfilling. I have never lost my direction.The courage and conviction of these men should be an inspiration to us all an inspiration which should propel us to act. And I would add a reminder again about how blessed and fortunate we are to live by the grace of God in a nation where we have the freedom to speak, to object, to state our views without fear of the circumstances and the consequences these brave men now face. The Chinese people yearn for the protection of their most basic human rights, and bravely stand with their fellow marginalized and oppressed countrymen. They are Chinas greatest asset, not its biggest threat, as the government and Communist Party wrongly believes. Any government, any government, which views its own people with such fear and hostility will, as has often been said, find itself on the wrong side of history.And so I hope more of my colleagues in this body, in the House and especially in the administration will join their voices in support of these political prisoners, and all who languish in jails, in prisons and in gulags simply because they want a better life, because they want a say in their future, and have bravely made those aspirations clear.I thank you Mr. President. With that, I yield the floor.Load-Date: February 7, 2017End of Document

21Vianet Blue Cloud Exec Speaks at DataCloud Asia 2017PR NewswireMarch 24, 2017 Friday 10:00 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 968 wordsDateline: BEIJING, March 24, 2017 Body"Cloud computing is a strategic priority for the Chinese government, which has piloted cloud schemes in a few cities, will only drive the growth of data centers further."Wing-Dar Ker, president of 21Vianet Blue Cloud, China's leading cloud services provider, joined a distinguished panel of experts to discuss trends in Asia's cloud computing industry atDataCloud Asia, held in Singapore on Feb. 23. This is the first time the organizers of the event held the conference in Asia.Wing, who leads a team responsible for managing 21Vianet Blue Cloud's partnership with Microsoft's cloud services in China, discussed how cloud computing is a strategic priority for the Chinese government, with onecase study done by the International Trade Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce suggesting the industry could be worth $20 billion by 2020, representing a compound annual growth rate of 40 to 45 percent."Internet companies in China are investing billions into their own cloud businesses in coming years, seeking to take advantage of a market with 680 million Internet users," Wing said. "Cloud computing is a strategic priority for the Chinese government, which has piloted cloud schemes in a few cities, will only drive the growth of data centers further.""With the government viewing cloud with strategic importance alongside the hypergrowth of domestic internet companies, growth momentum in China's cloud sector is assured," Wing said. "The market size of data centers 2015 was $7.6 billion and the average growth rate in the next few years is expected to be 35 percent or above and market demand for cloud computing and internet services combined with a willingness to invest will drive infrastructure build-up in the next few years."While domestic companies are rapidly creating their own cloud services, Wing said there remains plenty of opportunity in the market for foreign players, especially foreign companies that seek local partnerships to help navigate Chinese regulations as well as share market expertise.Bottom line: domestic competition may be advancing, but foreign cloud computing companies still hold the key when it comes to technology.There are risks. Notably, Wing said, is a shifting regulatory landscape as the government continues to assess what it deems to be the best way to regulate the sector. And, as with many other sectors, foreign companies must be aware that just because one product is successful in other markets, that does not guarantee success in China. Technological advances and brand recognition don't always mean success in this highly complex market."There are also perceived security and privacy concerns. Competition is fierce as technology continues to evolve and has not matured," he said. "Entering China without an experienced local partner could be detrimental to operations, let alone market penetration."The executive pointed out that cloud and internet data centers, or IDCs, are increasingly mingled together. In the small-to-medium sized business sector, IDCs are losing out to public cloud IaaS providers."IDCs need to share with public cloud providers in the enterprise areas," Wing said. "IDC customers may not just be end users anymore, but should focus on cloud service providers because cloud service providers may not want the hassle of building, managing and operating data centers."He also discussed 21Vianet Blue Cloud's value proposition in China, noting the company is the best partner to work with in the public and hybrid cloud areas. "Most importantly, we have accumulated IP and knowledge by working closely with the government in areas critical to China cloud compliance and regulations," he said.Last year, 21Vianet Blue Cloud unveiled its new "Cloud Landing in China", or CLIC, program. The initiative is designed to provide global cloud computing firms with one-stop solutions for entering the China market. "We leverage our experience and formulate structured and systematic protocols to make market entry easier," Wing said.Another development in the China market, with the government's "One Belt, One Road" initiative, is the expansion of cloud computing into Southeast Asia and Europe. As both the Chinese government and more Chinese companies expand beyond the country's borders, the demand for cloud services is expected to only increase, offering new market opportunities for global cloud players, Wing said."We are going to follow our customers to wherever they go," he said. "There will be a lot of opportunities for us to leverage the assets and presence of our global partners in these countries."Wing is quickly becoming recognized as a go-to source on China's cloud industry, with invitations to speak at conferences across Asia as well as in the West.

Winning With Shoppers in China; Earning trust in the Chinese e-commerce market could help businesses climb the ladder to success.GlobeNewswireMarch 3, 2017 Friday 9:00 AM PTCopyright 2017 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENTLength: 901 wordsBodyAtlanta, March  03, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The following is an article written by Will Gensburg of UPS.Â With a population of roughly 1.3 billion people, China offers unprecedented growth opportunities for retailers looking to conduct business internationally.China's National Bureau of Statistics reported last month that online retail sales in China grew 26 percent in 2016 to $752 billion. That's more than 40 percent of all online sales around the world.The e-commerce experience in China is on a scale like no other. From shopping on Alibaba's Tmall.com storefronts to the immense participation in mobile commerce, consumers in China have high expectations from retailers when it comes to the online shopping experience.For retailers looking to break into this competitive international market, here are some tips to win with online shoppers in China and succeed in the world's largest e-commerce market.Invest in the mobile shopping experienceAccording to research firm TNS Global, Chinese mobile users spends roughly 30 minutes a day shopping on theirÂ phone. China is also the world's largest smartphone market, accounting for 30 percent of the global market. Retailers should make sure their mobile experience is top-notch and localized for shoppers in China.The mobile checkout experience, in particular, is important. How important is mobile? According to eMarketer, mobile sales are projected to reach nearly $1.5 trillion globally by the end of 2019. China is driving a huge part of that growth, with mobile sales accounting for nearly half of all of China's e-commerce sales.Mobile payment apps, such asÂ WeChat Pay and Alibaba's Alipay, are examples of the types of payment options consumers want. These two payment options use data and analytics to personalize the mobile shopping experience and are nowÂ the two biggest players in the Chinese marketplace.According to the UPS Global Pulse of the Online Shopper„¢ study, 73 percent of online shoppers in China say the most important option when checking out online is having a variety of payment options in addition to a credit card.Understand duties, local taxes and the implications for consumers and your businessAccording to the UPS study, consumers in China rank duties and taxes as their second most important international shopping issue. Miscalculating duties and taxes or simply not making them available early enough in the checkout process can be detrimental to a retailer's success.For online shoppers, not having a clear understanding of the duties and taxes they are responsible for can be a reason for picking one retailer over another.In April 2016, as part of an effort to encourage Chinese citizens to purchase goods domestically rather than internationally, the Chinese government changed the tax rules, making purchasing luxury goods overseas more expensive for import.For retailers, changes to tax rules can cause major roadblocks in their e-commerce strategies.

ON INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY, CHINA MUFFLES WOMEN'S VOICESStates News ServiceMarch 7, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 390 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Maya Wang, China Researcher wang_mayaOn International Women's Day two years ago, the Chinese government demonstrated contempt for women's rights by arbitrarily detaining for over a month a group of avowed feminists who had tried to raise awareness about sexual harassment on public transportation. The case prompted international condemnation of the government's actions, and although the women were eventually released on bail, they had to shutter their organization, Weizhiming, citing "official pressure."ExpandA woman wearing a protective mask makes her way on a heavily polluted day in Beijing, December 26, 2015.2015 ReutersThis year, Sina weibo, a popular social media platform that answers to China's censors, is observing International Women's Day by imposing another form of repression: Starting on February 20, it has suspended for 30 days the account of Women's Voices (ch: n¼sheng), a microblog run by China's most outspoken feminists. According to the group, Sina said their postings had "violated China's relevant laws and regulations," but gave no explanation as to which postings offended the censors, or which laws such content purportedly violated.It is certainly a more subtleand less drastictactic than taking these women into custody, but the intention is unmistakably similar: to silence independent women's voices and replace them with tame ones trumpeting the government's achievements.Chinese authorities deserve credit for strides in improving maternal mortality, raising girls' literacy rates, and, most recently, introducing the country's first law against domestic violence. Yet those same authorities continue to restrict women's reproductive freedoms including dictating how many children they can have and when. Authorities fail to legislate a precise definition of discrimination that would allow women to file a lawsuit, and they label single women older than 27 as "leftovers" and wage publicity campaigns to get them to marry.The Chinese government has a long way to go before it can live up to its boast of being a nation that "implements equal rights as a basic state policy." A genuine commitment to gender equality should begin by the government immediately freeing Women's Voices from censorship, from this International Women's Day onwards.Load-Date: March 8, 2017End of Document

Here he tells the story of his incarceration and expulsion from the People's Republicby Tom Phillips in Chiang MaiA human rights activist, a secret prison and a tale from Xi Jinping's new ChinaMonday 2 January 2017 21.12 ESTShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailView more sharing optionsShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerCloseSome nights Peter Dahlin says he tucks a "big-ass knife" under his bed in case intruders come for him as he dozes; others he cannot sleep at all."They've kidnapped people several times here before," says the 36-year-old Swedish human rights activist, chain-smoking Marlboro cigarettes as he remembers the 23 days he spent in secret detention in China.It has been a year since Dahlin became one of the first foreign victims of President Xi Jinping's war on dissent.On 3 January 2016 Chinese security agents encircled the activist's Beijing home and spirited him and his Chinese girlfriend, Pan Jinling, off to a covert interrogation centre he now calls "The Residence".Months have now passed but the memories of that spell in custody have proved hard to shake. "These facilities are built to break you," the campaigner says during a seven-hour interview at a home in Chiang Mai, a city in northern Thailand where he and Pan have lived since he was deported from China amid one of the most severe crackdowns in decades.The story of Peter Dahlin, told here in unprecedented detail, offers a rare and troubling snapshot of Xi Jinping's China, where an unforgiving offensive against civil society is now unfolding.Facebook Twitter PinterestPeter Dahlin speaks on camera in a still from video released by China Central Television. Photograph: APIn the four years since Xi became China's top leader in November 2012, feminist campaigners, journalists, academics, bloggers, publishers, human rights lawyers and even foreign non-governmental organisation workers such as Dahlin have all been targeted in what experts suspect is a coordinated Communist party push to prevent the development of organised opposition to the regime.The political situation, which some call the most dire since the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, has deteriorated so fast under the current leadership that one scholar claims Xi has built "the perfect dictatorship" an ever-more repressive system that nevertheless avoids major international censure.During his stint behind bars the Swedish activist says he was given a firsthand taste of the harshness with which that battle for control is being waged.For the first time I am not optimistic any more. This is how China will operate for the next 20 yearsPeter DahlinHe claims he was blindfolded and confined to a cell with expressionless guards who refused to engage in conversation but noted down his every move; was for days deprived of access to his embassy, the right to exercise or even to sunlight; was forced to endure exhausting late-night interrogation sessions conducted by hectoring inquisitors determined to paint him as a spy; subjected to a lie-detection machine intended to extract information about his work; and suffered periods of sleep deprivation that he believes were intended to weaken his resolve.Dahlin, who until his detention had run a Beijing-based rights organisation called the Chinese Urgent Action Working Group or China Action, said during the seven years he lived and worked as an activist in China friends and diplomats had always considered him an optimist about the country's future.Those illusions have been shattered by the things he witnessed in the lead-up to his incarceration at The Residence."For the first time I am not optimistic any more," he says. "This is how China will operate for the next 20 years. Now it's a new hard line."The underground activistPeter Dahlin arrived in China from his native Sweden in the summer of 2004, a 23-year-old political science graduate keen for a taste of the world outside a lecture theatre."I was just there to backpack and learn," recalls Dahlin, whose travels took him through Beijing, Shanghai and Xiamen, the south-eastern port where Xi served as vice-mayor in the 1980s.Three years later he returned, throwing himself into human rights work alongside Hou Wenzhou, a Chinese activist he had met online.Dahlin's first project was a report denouncing the existence of an illegal nationwide network of secret detention facilities called "black jails". It identified eight such prisons in Beijing.About the same time Dahlin met Wang Quanzhang, a crusading civil rights lawyer known for his defence of China's downtrodden and outspoken criticism of the government. Together, in 2009, they founded China Action, a non-profit advocacy group dedicated to supporting human rights defenders in the one-party state.Increasingly draconian laws make it effectively impossible for such non-governmental rights organisations to operate legally in mainland China. Instead the pair registered their group as a company in Hong Kong and decided they would strive to operate in the shadows so as to avoid attracting attention."I decided we had a shot at doing something quite special," Dahlin says of the group's creation. The Swedish activist says he was partly driven by "middle-class guilt" but also a conviction that people should be the masters of their own destinies.Even my close friends didn't know about my work ... I always operated with a cover"I've never been particularly political," he says. "I've never paid attention to Tibet and these issues very much. "I just believe in the idea of self-determination."Whether it is Scottish people, the Catalan people, the Tibetan people or even just a village somewhere in China; that the people there should be the ones that have an influence, whether it is by forming an organisation, a labour union, their own media, whatever."Guided by those beliefs, Dahlin set about building China Action into a small but potent force for social change.With grants from institutions that included the European Union, the National Endowment For Democracy and the Norwegian Human Rights Fund it ran training sessions for human rights lawyers and investigative journalists and offered support to young Chinese campaigners traumatised by run-ins with the security services.Just as China Action was ramping up its operations, however, the human rights situation in China took a turn for the worse.The crackdown beginsMany accuse Xi of initiating the current chill but some trace it back to around 2008 when anti-government protests rocked Tibet just as China was preparing to host the Summer Olympics.Deadly riots the following year in China's far west left authorities even more convinced that it was time to step up their controls over society.In Beijing Dahlin sought to fly under the radar, moving into a one-bedroom studio hidden in the alleys around the 13th century Drum Tower and disguising his true line of work with a series of legends.He told some he was the son of a wealthy Swedish businessman who was in China researching the electric bicycle industry; to others he introduced himself as a legal researcher or expat English teacher, "just to see the way the conversation dies"."Even my close friends didn't know about my work," he says. "They knew I did something to do with an NGO and human rights but that is about it. I always operated with a cover."A self-professed history geek, Dahlin adopted the surname Beckenridge an allusion to John C Breckinridge, the vice-president of the Confederate states but he maintained his first name. "Any effective cover story has to have 90% truth and then 10% misleading ... you always keep your first name to avoid mistakes."For a while the subterfuge paid off. Dahlin's visas were renewed by public security authorities, despite the fact that his human rights work was officially illegal, and he sensed that police were happy monitoring the group from afar."We're not a political organisation," he says by way of explanation for why his group was able to keep operating for so long. "We don't deal with democracy issues."Facebook Twitter PinterestPresident Xi Jinping: turned his country into a 'controlocracy'. Photograph: Petr David Josek/APBut by 2013, the year Xi became president, the climate had begun to change. First came a sweeping crackdown on China's already tightly controlled internet; outspoken bloggers were detained and publicly humiliated in an attemp to curb the "wanton defamation" of the Communist party.Next came the obliteration of the New Citizens' Movement, a collective of liberal scholars and activists who had been pushing for moderate social and political change. The group's leader, a respected lawyer called Xu Zhiyong, was jailed for four years. Another prominent member fled into exile in the US.Most dictatorships are very clumsy, raw, inelegant. But this one isn't. They have it sussedStein Ringen, political scientistIt was the start of what many describe as a concerted clampdown on civil society designed to extinguish organised opposition to Beijing at a time when China's fading economic boom threatened to undermine its political legitimacy.Stein Ringen, a political scientist whose new book, The Perfect Dictatorship, examines the dramatic political tightening, said he believed that after a period of "steely and foresightful analysis", China's top leaders had concluded they must tighten their grip over the population now that the era of mega-economic growth was over."There is an absolute determination that the regime will persist and continue. That is number one for everything: the perpetuation of the regime."Ringen, an emeritus professor at Oxford University, said that in just a few years Xi had turned his country into a "controlocracy" where an ingenious mix of hard and soft measures were used to ensure the party's rule went unchallenged."It is so smooth that in some respects it doesn't even look dictatorial," he said. "Most dictatorships are very clumsy, raw, inelegant. But this one isn't. They have it sussed."The arrestAs Xi's crackdown unfolded up and down the country, agents from China's ministry of state security, a mysterious spy agency tasked with snuffing out political threats to the party, began to move against Dahlin's group, trying to recruit his assistant as a mole."We were well aware that from at least 2013 state security and not just police were actively monitoring us," he says.Dahlin began taking extra precautions, memorising the night flights out of Beijing and filling a brown leather satchel with bundles of cash, hard drives, documents, a change of clothes and his passport.In the summer of 2015 the situation deteriorated further still. A sweeping police offensive against Chinese human rights lawyers the so-called 709 crackdown began, sucking in "a very large number" of people directly linked to China Action, including Dahlin's friend and partner Wang, who was seized near the eastern city of Jinan on 3 August.At 9.45pm just hours before he had planned to set off for the airport there was a loud bang on the doorWith those detentions Dahlin sensed the noose was tightening. "Maybe there will be no more China," he remembers thinking.Then on 3 January 2016 the end came. At about 2pm Dahlin realised China Action was under intense scrutiny when a Chinese associate reported being summoned to meet security officials who had grilled him about a Swedish man named Peter.Shortly before 4pm the Swede sat down at his computer and began to type an email to a group of close colleagues with the subject line: "Situation"."There now seems to be an active investigation," he wrote, adding that he planned to flee the country and might not return to China "if things get bad"."Clear all papers, USBs, computers, phones, pads etc," Dahlin instructed his workmates. "These things need to be done ASAP."Dahlin spent the afternoon tying up loose ends: shredding documents, saying goodbye to his girlfriend Pan, and taking care of the couple's cats, Poopi and Dou Gonggong.He booked a seat on a 3am Cathay Pacific Flight to Hong Kong and from there planned to take another flight to Thailand.Facebook Twitter PinterestThe arrest of Peter Dahlin, as described to the Chiang Mai-based Mexican-American artist Nicolas Luna FleckBut at 9.45pm just hours before he had planned to set off for the airport there was a loud bang on the door."Are you Peter Dahlin?" said one of the uniformed agents packing the alleyway outside. "Well, yeah," the activist replied.'The Residence'About 15 miles south of Dahlin's hutong home, not far from Beijing's Nanyuan military airbase, is a drab, four-storey office block used for the interrogation of those deemed enemies of the Chinese state. "Basically, it is a secret prison," says Dahlin.In the early hours of Monday 4 January a convoy of police vehicles pulled up in the ground-floor garage of the U-shaped installation. Blindfolded, the activist was led out of one of the cars, into a lift and then along a corridor into a second-floor interrogation room."You sort of just freeze ... It was sort of expected but still you realise that this could end badly or this could end very badly."Dahlin's first interrogation began about 2am that winter morning, as temperatures outside The Residence plunged to six degrees below zero.Two male inquisitors sat opposite the prisoner, who says he was seated in a hard wooden "tiger chair" with leg shackles that were left splayed out on the floor. Metals bars crisscrossed the room's only window.The initial questioning was less intimidating than the surroundings might have suggested. "It started fairly innocuously. They were just trying to get a sense of me. Who am I? What am I doing in China? Very basic questioning."Dahlin's ties to three persons of interest seemed of particular concern: the human rights lawyer Wang; Xing Qingxian, an activist from south-west China; and Su Changlan, a women's rights campaigner who had been detained months earlier for offering online support to Hong Kong's 2014 pro-democracy protests.Two guards watched over Dahlin 24 hours a day, recording every move or sound he made, but never uttered a wordBut it was a gentle introduction to life in The Residence for the sleep-deprived activist: three hours later, about 5am, the session was terminated and he was led into a rectangular cell across the corridor with beige padded walls and two small windows that were also covered by metal bars. Thick blackout curtains made it impossible to tell the time of day; three fluorescent lamps hung from the ceiling, including one directly above the bed. "Even the toilet seat was suicide-padded," Dahlin recalls.Also inside were two guards, part of a team that remained there and watched over Dahlin 24 hours a day and recorded every move or sound he made in a notebook but never uttered a word."They would often stand up and go and stand and look when you take a piss, you take a shit, you take a shower. It's a bit odd," Dahlin says, adding with a laugh: "Luckily I'm Swedish and Sweden has a rather relaxed idea of nudity."The following days were a blur of interrogations. "They made it clear ... that they had followed me, surveilled me intently for a while and were well aware, they said, of what I had been doing."Dahlin claims his captors demanded a "map" of who his group had been working with and became "very, very angry" after he refused to talk unless he was allowed to see officials from the Swedish embassy.The activist says his interrogators then refused to let him sleep until he offered them detailed information and only relented after he protested to the centre's boss a woman who gave her name as Mrs Zhang that his treatment violated the UN convention against torture, which China ratified in 1988."She was very upset," Dahlin says of her reaction. "And went on about how nicely I'm being treated."Eventually he was allowed to sleep.As the questioning sessions continued, often lasting up to six hours at a time, Dahlin, who correctly suspected that Pan and several colleagues were also being detained in the facility, decided his best option was to avoid incriminating others by painting the officers "a big picture ... with nothing in it".But the interrogators hit back, telling the activist his friends and colleagues were turning against him. "This is your only chance," they said. "They are blaming everything on you. If you don't strike back it is over for you."I was quite prepared that there was going to be six months of this. That was my timeframePeter DahlinDahlin says he held firm, telling his captors China should be proud of its human rights lawyers and flatly rejecting repeated demands for him to surrender information about them or passwords for email accounts and encrypted hard drives that had been seized from his home.As night fell on the covert prison, unnerving sounds found their way into the activist's cell from other parts of The Residence, which Dahlin estimated had been built to house about eight prisoners. "I could hear raised voices. I could hear muffled sounds of what I assumed would be someone slammed against the wall and floor."I was quite prepared that there was going to be six months of this. That was my timeframe. I was counting the days in my head."As Dahlin floundered in the secret jail the world outside went on. Exactly one week after he was seized, on 10 January, David Bowie died in his New York flat, news the Swedish activist only received after his release.Two days later, on 12 January, the first reports of Dahlin's detention began to emerge in the international media. Having initially denied knowledge of the activist's disappearance, the Chinese government now admitted "coercive measures" had been taken against him.Three days later, on 15 January, a state-run newspaper published an editorial accusing the activist of funding "radical political activists" who were seeking confrontation with the Communist party.Friends and relatives called for his release, warning that without access to his medicine, Dahlin, who has Addison's disease a rare hormonal disorder also suffered by John F Kennedy could die.Cut off from the world in this hidden jail, Dahlin knew nothing of what was going on outside. He used music to help him cope with the boredom and stress, attempting to alleviate the tedium by remembering the lyrics of songs by REM, Bob Dylan and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers."You think through everything. Not once or twice but 100 times for each thing. Every friend you had. Every relationship you had. Every date you had ... If you sit there for weeks on end with nothing to do you start having weird thoughts because there is nothing left to think about."About 10 days into his captivity Dahlin's ordeal took an Orwellian turn when interrogators told the activist they wanted to use a "communication enhancement" machine a species of lie detector to assist with their inquiries.Facebook Twitter PinterestPeter Dahlin faces his interrogators. Illustration: Nicolas Luna FleckElectrodes were attached to the activist's fingertips and small cameras trained on his pupils while he was asked questions. Dahlin suspects it was "a clever psychological play" to make him reveal details of his group's work and sponsors but the device appeared to fail."They seemed to have some problem with the fact that my fingertips would sweat so they couldn't get good readings," he says. "I don't think they got much from it."On about day 13 of Dahlin's stay at The Residence the omens improved. He was granted a visit from two Swedish consular officials who inquired if he had been given any fruit "Only one small bite of an apple," the prisoner replied then left.Two nights later came a second positive signal. At about 3am a group of officers came into his cell and one, whom he knew as Mr Zhang, perched on the edge of his rock-hard mattress. "I realised something was happening," Dahlin says.The confessionZhang told the activist he would need to pen "a self-criticism" in which he confessed to a series of crimes.Crucially, Dahlin should admit that the human rights lawyers with whom he had worked were "criminals" and taking money from the National Endowment for Democracy, a US-funded non-profit which has been demonised in countries such as China and Russia as an instigator of colour revolutions."Even though they were not among our biggest funders, that was a very core point," says Dahlin, who believes the attempt to link China Action to the endowment group was intended to help paint his group as a "hostile foreign force" that had been plotting to undermine the Communist party.I would go from a sense of serene contentment to being exhilarated to being incredibly despondentThe following night Dahlin received a second visit. "We need one more thing," the officer told him. "Let's make a video."Dahlin knew immediately what was being suggested.Since Xi had taken office apparently forced televised confessions had come back into vogue, used to humiliate a range of government foes including Gao Yu, a veteran journalist who was jailed for leaking a politically sensitive document, and Charles Xue, an internet celebrity known for his online outspokenness on social and political issues.Within hours Dahlin had been ordered to remove his prison uniform, don his normal clothes and was seated in a room opposite a glamorous female correspondent from the China Central Television, the state broadcaster. He was handed a set of seven or eight pre-written answers that had been typed on to a sheet of A4 paper."Prime time!" the activist says he thought as the camera began to roll. "Great!"Dahlin, who had lost nearly 6kg since his detention began, says he immediately agreed to the recording, knowing it would accelerate his release and, more importantly, that of his girlfriend."I have been given good food, plenty of sleep and I have suffered no mistreatments of any kind," he told his interviewer. "I have no complaints to make. I think my treatment has been fair."Facebook Twitter PinterestThe 'confession' of Peter DahlinDahlin says he tried to deflect blame from his Chinese associates by shouldering responsibility for his group's activities.He refused to label the Chinese lawyers he had worked with as "criminals" but admitted: "I have violated Chinese law through my activities here. I have caused harm to the Chinese government. I have hurt the feelings of the Chinese people."I apologise sincerely for this and I am very sorry that this ever happened," he concluded before the camera was turned off.The next day those comments were splashed across China's party-controlled media with Xinhua, the country's official news agency, using the "interview" to prove police had "smashed an illegal organisation that sponsored activities jeopardising China's national security".Dahlin, Xinhua claimed, had been planted in the country by "western anti-China forces" bent on stirring opposition to the regime.As a reward for his video confession Dahlin says he was given a cup of Nescafe instant coffee and a couple of cigarettes. Less than a week later he and Pan would be free.Dahlin says the final stages of his three-week stint in a secret jail were among the hardest, even though he sensed his release was imminent. "I would go from a sense of serene contentment to being exhilarated to being incredibly despondent and thinking, 'Fuck, this is it. I'm dead.'"Goodbye to ChinaOn the morning of 21 January he was told he had been granted medical parole and would soon be deported. Four days later, after being allowed a fleeting meeting with Pan, he was blindfolded and escorted back downstairs into The Residence's garage.Flanked by four burly guards in martial arts clothing, Dahlin was driven north towards Beijing's international airport where he was told he was being expelled under the espionage act."Stay out of trouble now," he recalls being told by one of the security agents, who escorted him on to Scandinavian Airlines Flight 996 to Copenhagen.Facebook Twitter PinterestPeter Dahlin's last view of China and his security mindersOnboard the passenger jet Dahlin turned on his phone and snapped one final photograph of China: a surreptitious shot of the security officers who had placed him on his last flight out of the country.The flight attendant in first class police officials had used cash confiscated from Dahlin's home to buy his ticket handed him a glass of champagne."I killed it," Dahlin says. "And then I had another glass. I had wine. I had a whisky. I had a beer and I had a coffee. All of the things I hadn't had."I get weird-ass dreams that I never had before; anxiety; never being able to relax properlySince touching down in Thailand in May, Dahlin says he has been gradually trying to rebuild his life.After the trauma of 23 days in secret custody and seven years living with the daily stress of concealing his work, he says he is struggling to adapt to a more mundane routine and fears he may be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder."I've gotten so used ... to living a lie. It takes time to break that habit down."I get weird-ass dreams that I never had before; anxiety; never being able to relax properly. I can deal with it but it takes time," he says. "Your mind plays tricks on you. You hear things by the gate at night."One afternoon Dahlin remembers suffering a panic attack when he lost sight of Pan, who moved with him to Chiang Mai, in a supermarket and concluded she had been snatched by Chinese agents as appears to have happened to a wave of Thailand-based dissidents and Communist party foes.On another occasion Dahlin's heart leapt when a group of Chinese men surrounded the couple at a local hotel. "I thought, 'Fuck, is this it? Are they here to do something?'"The here and nowBack in China, the situation is even gloomier. Recent weeks have seen a fresh round of detentions that suggest the crackdown on human rights lawyers has yet to run its course.Dahlin's former partner Wang remains in police custody awaiting trial. "It is not a happy story," Dahlin says of his friend. "I think he would rather die than admit defeat in this case [by confessing to crimes he didn't commit]. He is ready to be a martyr."Stein Ringen said he believed the world had failed to grasp the scale of the repression now playing out in China, still viewing the country as a "benevolent autocracy" when in fact it had mutated into "a very, very hard dictatorship which manages to look better than it is".Facebook Twitter PinterestPeter Dahlin near his home in Thailand. Photograph: Tom Phillips for the GuardianThe academic said he envisioned no change of direction while Xi, who will reach the halfway point of his anticipated decade-long term in late 2017, was in power."Regrettably, I think the best we can hope for is that it doesn't get worse ... My money during Xi Jinping's tenure would be that what we have now is pretty much what we are going to get that is a hard dictatorship that is nevertheless tempered by some pragmatism ... I'm completely bleak.""The alternatives I think are chaos that the control breaks and that China falls again back into chaos which it has done again and again over the last couple of centuries or that Xi Jinping's tightening of controls continues and pulls the system into one of fully fledged totalitarianism."I see no reason why they would ever give me a visa to go back. Why would they?On the veranda of his new home, surrounded by wind chimes, hanging planters, and the soothing sound of bird song, Dahlin reminisces about happier times.He speaks of his admiration for the Chinese campaigners still willing to sacrifice their freedom to promote change and fondly recalls nights spent at his favourite Mongolian whisky bar in Beijing."You miss a few things because my exit consisted of going from solitary confinement into an airplane," he says. "I left Beijing with a small bag, three books, two changes of clothes, some hard drives and a laptop."You do seven years of something ... and now it is all gone: your work, whatever you have accomplished, your clothing, your furniture, my cats, my friends."But with no political thaw in sight the activist said he doubted he would ever be able to return to the country he once dreamed of transforming."I see no reason why they would ever give me a visa to go back. Why would they?""I think the only reason I go back is after the government falls. And I'm not sure that is going to happen in my lifetime."Load-Date: January 3, 2017End of Document

Colleague: Missing Taiwan activist talked politics on WeChatAssociated Press InternationalMarch 28, 2017 Tuesday 12:54 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 541 wordsByline: By RALPH JENNINGS, Associated PressDateline: TAIPEI, Taiwan BodyTAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) - A Taiwanese pro-democracy activist believed to be in Chinese custody may have attracted the attention of China's security services after he used the social media site WeChat to discuss China-Taiwan relations, a colleague said Tuesday.Lee Ming-che, 42, disappeared after clearing immigration on March 19 in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory of Macau and never showed up for a planned meeting later that day with a friend across the border in the Chinese city of Zhuhai, according to Chiu Yi-ling, secretary general of the Taiwan Association for Human Rights, where Lee had been a volunteer.Cheng Hsiu-chuan, president of Taipei's Wenshan Community College where Lee has worked for the past year as a program director, said it's likely that Lee attracted the attention of Chinese security last year after using WeChat to "teach" an unknown number of people about China-Taiwan relations under the government of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen."For China, the material he was teaching would be seen as sensitive," Cheng said. WeChat has millions of active users and is hugely popular as a means of communication in China.Lee had traveled annually to China for the past decade to see friends, Cheng said. He would discuss human rights in private but had never held any public events there, Cheng said.However, in mid-2016 Chinese authorities shut down Lee's WeChat account and confiscated a box of books published in Taiwan on political and cultural issues, Cheng said."According to the news we've gotten, the state security bureau there doesn't know how to handle Lee's case," Cheng said.On his most recent trip, Lee planned to see friends and get Chinese medicine for his mother-in-law in Taiwan, his wife, Lee Ching-yu said. He was expected to stay in the southern Chinese hub city Guangzhou through March 26, she said.Lee Ching-yu said a Taiwanese government agency also told her this week it had indirect information pointing to a Chinese state security detention."I want the government of China to act like a civilized country and tell me what they're doing with my husband on what legal grounds and, like a civilized country, what they plan to do with him," Lee said.Police and government officials in southern China either could not be reached or said they had no information about Lee. China's foreign ministry said it was unaware of his case.China claims sovereignty over Taiwan, a free-wheeling democracy with freedoms largely unknown on the authoritarian, Communist-ruled mainland. China insists that the two sides must eventually unify and has raised pressure on Taiwan since the election last year of President Tsai, whose Democratic Progressive Party advocates for Taiwan's formal independence. China and Taiwan split amid civil war in 1949.Taiwan's semi-governmental Straits Exchange Foundation said it has asked its China counterpart for information.The Taiwan government's Mainland Affairs Council, a China policymaking body, demanded Monday that Chinese government departments disclose their "handling" of Lee and ensure his safety."The government is paying a high degree of attention to Mr. Lee's safety or danger and will continue doing its utmost to help his family members," the council said in a statement.Load-Date: March 29, 2017End of Document

RIGHTS GROUP CONDEMNS CHINESE LEADERSHIP, GLOBAL STRONGMEN IN ANNUAL REPORTStates News ServiceJanuary 12, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 850 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:By Roseanne GerinA report issued by an international rights group on Thursday takes aim at strongmen leaders around the world, including China's President Xi Jinping, whom it contends have asserted their own authority as a guarantor of peace and prosperity over that of government accountability and the rule of law.In its 687-page report which examines human rights practices in 2016 in more than 90 countries, New York-based Human Rights Watch said the outlook for freedoms of expression, assembly, association, and religion "remains dire" under Xi Jinping who will be in power in China until 2022 and possibly longer.The report entitled "World Report 2017: Demagogues Threaten Human Rights" noted that in February 2016, Xi Jinping visited three major state media organizations and called on them to pledge absolute loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party.It also cited the Chinese government's passage of a cybersecurity law that HRW says will "strangle online freedom and anonymity," further clampdowns on media outlets whose reports don't toe the Communist Party line, and other directives that tighten control over the internet."China's Xi Jinping, like [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, has pursued the toughest crackdown on critical voices in two decades," write HRW's executive director Kenneth Roth in the report's introductory essay.The report said Chinese authorities continue to detain most of the more than 16 rights lawyers rounded up during a nationwide sweep of rights advocates in July 2015.The report also noted the enforced disappearances of Hong Kong booksellers who sold publications that were critical of the Chinese government, and Beijing's interference in a court case in the special administrative region last November that HRW says undermined judicial independence and the territory's autonomy.The report went on to cite China's continued repression of ethnic minority Uyghurs in the country's northwestern Xinjiang region and of Tibetans in its western Tibet region by restricting their political activities and peaceful expressions of ethnic and religious identities."Worried as well that popular discontent would rise as economic growth slowed, Xi, too, has embarked on the most intense crackdown since the Tiananmen era, leaving his government even less accountable," Roth wrote, in a reference to the bloody suppression of students and other activists by the Chinese government in June 1989."Despite anointing himself with a lengthening list of leadership titles, this strongman looks increasingly fearful, while not delivering on the Chinese people's demands for cleaner air, safer food, a just judicial system, and an accountable government," he said.North Korea, Cambodia, and MyanmarNorth Korea continues to be one of the most repressive authoritarian nations in the world under seven decades of rule by the Kim family and the Worker's Party of Korea, the report said.Current leader Kim Jong Un has used public executions, arbitrary detentions, and forced labor to ensure obedience to the regime. He also firmed up travel restrictions in 2016 to prevent North Koreans from escaping and seeking refuge overseas, it said.In Cambodia, Prime Minister Hun Sen and the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) "significantly escalated persecution on political grounds" directed at the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), rights workers, social activists, and intellectuals, the report said.The actions have been intended to prevent the CNRP from winning in local elections in 2017 and national elections in 2018, which would unseat strongman Hun Sen who has ruled the country for 31 years.The report noted that CNRP president Sam Rainsy remained in exile in 2016 after he decided not to return to Cambodia when the government said it would enforce a two-year prison sentence against him on trumped-up charges.It also noted another such case of political retribution involving the CNRP's acting leader Kem Sokha who was convicted by a Phnom Penh court for disregarding a court summons to appear as a witness against two CNRP legislators on cooked-up charges.Myanmar, which began what appeared to be a promising political transition last April with the election of the civilian-led government under the National League for Democracy (NLD), has been stymied by ongoing clashes between the national armed forces and ethnic guerilla groups in Shan and Kachin states, the report said.The report called a security crackdown by armed forces in western Myanmar's Rakhine state following deadly attacks on border guard posts last October "the most serious humanitarian and human rights crisis" to have occurred there since an October 2012 "ethnic cleansing" campaign against the Rohingya Muslim minority.The security sweep in the northern part of Rakhine has forced tens of thousands of Rohingya to flee their homes to neighboring Bangladesh, where some have accused Myanmar soldiers of committing atrocities against them, including murder, torture, rape and arson. The government and army have denied the charges.Load-Date: January 13, 2017End of Document

Shanghai EBO Optoelectronics Company to Exclusively use Zecotek LFS Scintillation Crystals in ChinaMarketwiredMarch 9, 2017 Thursday 12:15 PM GMTCopyright 2017 Marketwire, L.P.

(TSX VENTURE: ZMS) (FRANKFURT: W1I) (OTC PINK: ZMSPF), a developer of leading-edge photonics technologies for healthcare, industrial and scientific markets, is pleased to announce that the Shanghai EBO Crystals Assembly Company, the largest crystal array producer and supplier in China, has been appointed exclusive distributor of its patented LFS scintillation crystals for all sales to end users and in particular the positron emission tomography (PET) medical scanner OEMs in China. Furthermore, EBO will not use any of the competitive crystals and will only use LFS scintillation crystals in arrays for all new PET medical scanners."The scientific team at EBO recognize the cost-performance superiority of Zecotek's patented LFS scintillation crystals when used in PET medical scanners," said Dr. A.F. Zerrouk, Chairman, President, and CEO of Zecotek Photonics Inc. "To have EBO become the exclusive distributor of LFS crystals, and agree to only use LFS crystals for their arrays sold to PET OEMs, will create significant value to our company. After extensive testing of our LFS crystals where EBO measured consistency of performance, product availability and cost/pricing considerations with end users, EBO has chosen to focus its crystal and array sales to PET OEM using only Zecotek LFS crystals. We expect today's announcement to drive significant crystal sales in China, as the government is aggressively growing the number of medical scanners to attend to the world's largest aging population."As mentioned in the previous announcement on January 25, 2017, EBO is the largest crystal array producer and supplier in China. Their arrays are used by many of the top OEMs in the very fast growing domestic PET medical imaging market. Those OEMs installing new scanning machines in hospitals and clinics across China will be using Zecotek's LFS crystal arrays. Historically, EBO used a number of different competing crystals, mainly the LYSO/LSO, in their arrays. However, due to the superiority of LFS, moving forward the organization will only use LFS crystals for array components for PET medical scanners.Recent changes to the regulatory landscape in China has caused OEMs to manufacture medical scanning devices domestically. The Chinese government has been using incentives to encourage domestic hospitals to use Chinese-made medical devices as it looks to stimulate the local market and reduce soaring healthcare costs. The strategy is working as more and more high quality medical devices are being manufactured in China and competing on a global basis.About Shanghai EBO Co.Founded in 2007 and headquartered in Shanghai, EBO has more than 120 employees and 4,000 square meters of manufacturing space.

Why China is banning beards and veils in XinjiangCNN.comMarch 30, 2017 Thursday 9:19 PM ESTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 1201 wordsByline: By Katie Hunt, Chieu Luu and Steven Jiang, CNNBodyNo long beards. No veils in public places. No home-schooling.China is intensifying its crackdown against what it deems religious extremism in the far-west province of Xinjiang, which is home to 10 million Muslims.The latest measures -- outlined in a sweeping new anti-extremism legislation -- take effect Saturday and come on the heels of a series of steps to increase surveillance in the region that include the surrender of passports and mandatory GPS trackers in cars."They're doubling down on security in Xinjiang," said James Leibold, an associate professor at Australia's Le Trobe University, whose research focuses on China's Uyghur minority.What are the latest measures?The new legislation, which was published on a regional news portal run by the provincial government, appears to standardize, and expand across the whole province, piecemeal rules and regulations that have been enacted in individual towns and cities.Specifically, it prohibits:Advocating or propagating extremist thoughts Wearing or forcing others to wear full-face coverings Hyping up religious fanaticism through growing beards or choosing names in an abnormal way Not allowing children to receive state education, interfering with state education; Deliberately interfering or harming the implementation of family planning policies; Publishing, downloading or reading articles, publications and audio-video material containing extremist content; Rejecting or refusing state products and services that include radio and television programming.The law didn't explain these measures in detail or define abnormal, but the English-language state-run China Daily did say that long beards would be banned "as they are deemed to promote extremism."Why is China so concerned?Hundreds of people have been killed in Xinjiang in recent years; the government describes the perpetrators as terrorists inspired by religious extremism.There has been a spate of high-profile attacks involving ethnic Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking minority, outside the province.These include a 2014 attack outside a rail station in the southwestern city of Kunming that killed 31 people, and an attack in Beijing in 2013 when a car drove into a crowd of tourists and killed five people.In March, President Xi Jinping called for a "great wall of iron" to safeguard the region's stability.Xinjiang, a resource-rich province, plays a key role in the "One Belt, One Road" initiative championed by Xi. The project aims to improve economic ties with central Asia and Xi wants no disruption to a landmark international conference he is holding on it in May."We'd be foolish to deny that China has a problem with terrorists," Leibold told CNN."But I think the Communist Party is exaggerating the threat of radical Islam and they are turning up the heat in assimilating the Uyghurs into the Chinese nation state."Who are the Uyghurs?The Uyghurs are largely Muslims, who are the dominant ethnic group in Xinjiang, a large autonomous region that borders Russia, Mongolia, central and south Asia.Uyghurs regard themselves as linguistically, culturally and ethnically close to central Asia, despite a long history of Chinese rule.Tensions have arisen between Uyghurs and the Han, the predominant ethnic group in China, who have migrated to Xinjiang in large numbers over the past 60 years.A 2011 report by the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China said that Han workers have taken most of the new jobs and unemployment among Uyghurs is high. Activists say China has been taking measures to undermine the Uyghur language, culture and religious practices including restrictions on observing Ramadan.In a response to a question on whether the Chinese government was seeking to repress the Muslim faith in Xinjiang, Lu Kang, China's foreign ministry spokesman said on Wednesday that "the objective fact is that the people of all ethnicities in Xinjiang, just like the people living in other regions of China, are enjoying better lives, working conditions and brighter prospect for development.""We oppose the approach of linking terrorism with a certain ethnicity or a certain religion," he added.Leibold said the government has been slowly increasing measures since July 2009, when some 200 people were killed in ethnic riots that were prompted by long-simmering resentment many Uyghurs have for the Han.Are there Uyghur terror groups?Beijing has blamed the violence on Islamic militants, led by the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), which the US State Department listed as a terrorist organization in 2002 a year after the September 11 attacks.But many analysts dispute its characterization as an Al Qaeda or ISIS-style group.In February, a 28-minute video analyzed by the SITE Intelligence Group appeared to show Uyghur militants threatening to return to China to "shed blood like rivers." SITE said it was produced by ISIS.When asked about the video, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he wasn't aware of it, but said: "East Turkestan terrorist forces represented by the East Turkestan Islamic Movement pose a grave threat on security and stability of China and the region."The China Daily, a state-run newspaper published an editorial that went further: "the video lends further credence to Beijing's claim, especially the oft-ignored assertions of links between domestic and foreign terrorist elements."China has long asserted Uyghur fighters have joined the ranks of ISIS in Syria and Iraq. New America, a US think tank, estimates that 100 Uyghurs having gone abroad to fight for the ISIS cause, while the state-run Global Times put the figure at about 300.How do people in Xinjiang feel about this?The Chinese government tightly controls access to the area.Journalists are closely monitored when in the province, and sometimes are prohibited from accessing certain parts of the region all together. The same applies for non governmental organizations.Leibold says the new security measures drive resentment underground and widens the gulf of misunderstanding and between the Chinese state and Uyghurs."This is an example of a surveillance society that we've never seen across China," he said.However, not all Xinjiang residents see Beijing's security build-up as a problem."I don't think they're restrictions," a 30-year-old Uyghur woman in Xinjiang's Manasi County told CNN earlier this month on the condition of anonymity because she's not authorized to speak to media by her employer. "I think the government is doing its job."She said while she's noticed a steady influx of ethnic Han Chinese move into the region over the years, but she hasn't felt discriminated -- either in the Chinese school she attended or in her job as a nurse.She added she didn't mind attending the mandatory weekly flag raising ceremony, because it's the same thing she did in school growing up, and thinks installing GPS in vehicles and other surveillance devices is for the greater good.Dolkun Isa, Secretary General of the World Uyghur Congress (WUC), an exile group based in Germany, said that Chinese news coverage focuses on violence perpetrated by a tiny fraction of the population and "this shapes how some view Uyghurs generally -- though clearly unfairly."Load-Date: April 1, 2017End of Document

Corn Products China News 1701PR NewswireFebruary 15, 2017 Wednesday 5:34 PM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2267 wordsDateline: NEW YORK, Feb. 15, 2017 BodyEditor's NoteWelcome to the Jan. Issue of Corn Products China News.This newsletter will help you stay ahead of the game in this fast-changing market with real-time reporting on the entire corn products industry chain, from grain markets to the downstream food and feed markets. It includes breaking news from China and abroad, the latest market data (price, import & export, production, consumption, operating rates, etc.), in-depth analysis of market trends, Chinese government policy, performance of leading Chinese producers, M&A, new technologies, and expert commentary from industry insiders.In 2017, China's market price of corn continues the downtrend. The price averaged USD266.08/t (RMB1,571/t) in Jan., down 26.92% YoY.The sliding corn price reduced the advantage of imported corn. In Jan.-Nov. 2016, corn import volume down by 33.8% YoY. So did the import volumes of corn substitutes. Affected by policy and price factors, the previous promising import business of corn substitutes will no longer exist.The MOC finalized the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on imported DDGS from the US. This move will further reduce Chinese DDGS import volume, strengthen demand for corn and soybean meal and stimulate the supply of alcohol.Downstream corn starch sector was also benefited. Now, demand for starch mounts in China. Coupled with the corn deep processing subsidy and growth of export, the sector is in an uptrend. However, the falling corn price also reduced downstream product prices. For example, the MSG price hit record lows continuously. Meanwhile, the increase cpacity may trigger out an integration in the MSG industry again.Besides, pig feed companies also made adjustments in their prices. In early 2017, leading pig feed companies cut prices in succession. Thanks to this, production cost of live pig farming reduced. Pig farming companies moved their businesses to inland areas due to government policies. As the industry moves forward, the Chinese government will have greater confidence in industry regulation, and the "pork cycle" could be restrained.Corn China News is a monthly published newsletter, which can be downloaded in PDF format. The subscription mode for this newsletter is yearly and the subscriber will receive 12 issues per year.HeadlinesThe Hubei Plants Protection Station published the 2017 key pesticides and equipment for promotion.2017 will witness ups in demand for fungicide and herbicide while downs in insecticide and acaricide in Hubei Province.Monsanto announced 2017 updates on progress made across its R&D pipeline.

The company's industry-leading pipeline integrates seeds, traits, crop protection and data science to support growers by mitigating challenges posed by weeds, insects, diseases and environmental shifts resulting from climate change each season.Agriaviation is now becoming a hot spot in the pesticide industry in China. Kunshan Longzhixiang, a joint venture with a registered capital of USD1 million, co-established by Jiangsu Rotam and Taiwan Geosat, was founded on 28 Dec., 2016 in Kunshan.China released the 2016 National Food Safety Standards on MRLs for Pesticides in Foods, which specified 4,140 MRLs for 433 pesticides in 13 categories of agricultural products, with an increase of 490 limits compared with the 2014 version, covering almost all kinds of commonly-used pesticides and major agricultural products.On 6 Dec., 2016, the 15th Anniversary Celebration of Cuikang & the Listing Conference for Cuikang Bichong cohosted by Guangdong Tianhe and Yara was held in Guangzhou. In 2009, Guangdong Tianhe took over the national exclusive distribution right of Cuikang, and proceeded with Yara this cooperation agreement of national exclusive distribution right again for another 5 years ever since 2011, which fully fulfilled the aspiration of cooperative partner for the long-term proxy and stable product promotion.On 12 Dec., 2016, the ICAMA published the list of 18 pesticides that passed the evaluations for formal registration on the 20th Plenary Session of the 8th National Pesticide Registration Review Committee. Bayer CropScience's 7 herbicides, including 4 active ingredients of terfuryltrione, triafamone, flurtamone, and flufenacet, were in the list. It marks that these products will be formally registered in China for the first time.In late-Oct. 2016, Yangnong Chemical won the Chinese Patent Award on its preparation process of pyrethroid compound intermediate.Jiangsu Yangnong was awarded a China Industry Award for its "green efficient pyrethroids development and application program".The No.3 Central Environmental Protection Inspectorate was settled in Hubei Province in the last 10 days of Nov. 2016. The environmental pollution issues in enterprises as Hubei Sanonda, Hubei Boerde and Hubei Jiaying reported by complainants have been resolved. As verified by investigations, the reported issues were partially true.As reported by Agropages on 13 Dec., 2016, France-based InVivo Corporation (InVivo) announced that it has reached an agreement with its Chinese partner HVH, a supplier of generic phytosanitary products, to establish a joint venture company in Shanghai. The joint venture company was being set up to commercialize and market generic pesticides. InVivo expects its first commercialization by 2018-2019, with the focus on field crops, especially corn. Moreover, InVivo also expects another partnership agreement with a Brazilian agrochemical company CCAB AGRO S.A. (CCAB) on commercialization of generic pesticides before the end of Dec."Faced with the concentration of global agrochemical sector, we are willing to keep access to complementary solutions to strengthen InVivo's market position", underlined Laurent Martel, director of the InVivo Agriculture division. The company also plans to focus its development on the areas of digital innovation, notably in terms of biocontrol and precision farming.As the largest agricultural corporation in France, and global leading enterprise in the industry, InVivo sustains an annual revenue of Euro5.7 billion with 6,600 staff in 20 countries. In March this year, InVivo signed agreement to acquire Bioline, specializing in marketing biological control agents, a subsidiary of Syngenta Participations AG. Founded in 2007, CCAB mainly engages in pesticides registration, export, marketing and pesticide application technical services. The shareholder of its holding company CCAB Participaes S.A. refers to Brazil's major producer's cooperative of cotton, soybean, corn and coffee, with an annual output value of over USD8 billion, and its annual pesticide consumption accounts for 20% of the entire Brazil. In Dec. 2016, Huapont Life Sciences Co., Ltd. participated in CCAB for its increase in capital and share with no more than USD20 million, landing 7.5% of CCAB's stock rights.The development of intelligent agricultural machinery will be a focus in the Chinese agricultural machinery market in 2017, especially the large-scale compound machinery. Besides, prices are expected to rise.Gao Xiangzhao, chief expert of the NAESC, recently made judgment of the market prospects of microbial fertilizer: at present, it is impossible for microbial fertilizer to replace chemical fertilizer, and vice versa. However, microbial fertilizer is likely to take place of chemical fertilizer when the microbial technology develops to a certain extent.Petrochemical industry is an important industrial pillar industry in Hubei. To speed up the transformation and upgrading of the petrochemical industry, enhance the quality and efficiency of industrial development, and achieve green and sustainable development, Hubei announced the implementation plan on promoting the transformation, upgrading, and green development of the petrochemical industry. The plan proposed to nurture and grow new industries, and one of them was to speed up the development of new pesticide varieties, including low toxic, high efficient, and low residual pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, viral inhibitors, and seed treating agents.In this article, CCM will provide the ex-works price of 23 pesticide TC (TK) in Nov. and Dec. 2016, including 8 herbicides, 8 insecticides and 7 fungicides.

Why Apple removed the New York Times from its app store in China; The move came one month after the Cyberspace Administration of China called for greater media scrutiny to prevent social disorder, moral harm, and threats to national security.The Christian Science MonitorJanuary 5, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights ReservedSection: BusinessLength: 605 wordsByline: Gretel Kauffman StaffBodyThe New York Times's apps can no longer be found in the Apple app store in China. Apple removed both the English- and Chinese-language apps late last month at the request of Chinese authorities, according to the Times. The apps had allowed readers in mainland China to access Times articles without needing to use a Virtual Private Network, or a VPN, to sidestep China's censorship apparatus after the government began blocking the Times's websites in 2012. "For some time now the New York Times app has not been permitted to display content to most users in China and we have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations," said Fred Sainz, an Apple spokesman, as reported by the Times. "As a result, the app must be taken down off the China App Store. When this situation changes, the App Store will once again offer the New York Times app for download in China." The move came one month after the Cyberspace Administration of China called for greater media scrutiny to prevent social disorder, moral harm, and threats to national security. Amnesty International said Apple's compliance with the Chinese authorities in removing the New York Times apps fits into a broader, growing trend of big tech companies enabling China to crack down on free speech, according to CNN. "China has a very particular view of how the Internet should be run: under a heavy government thumb," Peter Ford reported for The Christian Science Monitor in December 2015 from Beijing:And Beijing would like the rest of the world to agree that each government should rule its own Internet territory as it sees fit....The Chinese government has made the Internet one of its top priorities. With over 650 million people online and four of the world's top ten Internet companies, Beijing has publicly set a course to be "an Internet superpower" by the end of this decade."Harnessing cyberspace is central to the Communist party's policy," says Bill Bishop, a veteran China watcher and Internet entrepreneur. "They have a strategy ... to harness the Internet for maximum value for government and business and to control any challenge" from critics.The Times had asked Apple to reconsider its decision, to no avail. "The request by the Chinese authorities to remove our apps is part of their wider attempt to prevent readers in China from accessing independent news coverage by The New York Times of that country, coverage which is no different from the journalism we do about every other country in the world," Eileen Murphy, a Times spokeswoman in New York, said in a statement. A spokesman for Apple declined on comment on what local regulations the Times apps reportedly violated, who had contacted Apple and when, and whether a court order or other legal document had been presented, according to the Times. Patrick Poon, a researcher with Amnesty International, told CNN he found it "extremely worrying that Apple is kowtowing to China's censorship by deleting New York Times apps." Chinese mainstream media has not reported the app removal, although the move was discussed by many on social media. "This must be coming from the request of The Wall right?" one web user wrote on the microblogging service Weibo, in reference to state-backed internet censorship. "Apple has made enough money in China, it's OK for it to take the blame this time for the sake of the money."Apps from other international news outlets whose websites have been blocked in China, including those of the Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal, and CNN, were still available on the App Store in China as of Thursday.This report contains material from Reuters. Load-Date: January 5, 2017End of Document

Zhou defends Chinese policies, promotes relation with U.S.The Dartmouth: Dartmouth CollegeFebruary 3, 2017 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 555 wordsByline: Nathan SwireBodyZhou framed the speech as marking the 30th anniversary of Chinese-American trade relations and the decades of prosperity that grew from China's decision to engage in world trade."Economic and social progress has been enormous," Zhou said, citing increased life-expectancy, annual growth rates averaging more than 9 percent and a tenfold increase in per-capita Gross Domestic Product among other improvements to quality of life in China.Zhou said he supported his government's policies regarding issues that have recently been contentious between China and the United States, including Tibet, Taiwan and internet regulation."Tibet has been part of China for hundreds of years, and the affairs of Tibet are China's internal affairs," he said, accusing the Dalai Lama of trying to split China's territory and calling on him to end his campaign for Tibetan independence.Zhou also reiterated China's commitment to eventual reunification with Taiwan."The One China principle will remain unchanged," he said, referring to China's policy of pursuing a single government.Zhou also spoke about the increase in internet use in China, but maintained the government's responsibility to control content."It should be regulated so the interest of the state and the interest of the user are protected," he said.The Chinese government is committed to greater oversight and regulation of food and medicine, he said, a major concern within the United States.Zhou emphasized the importance of the partnership between China and the United States in driving economic growth."The economics of our countries complement each other, resulting in rapid expansion and win-win trade," Zhou said.Zhou applauded the use of bilateral agreements and economic frameworks in solving possible conflicts between the United States and China. He also said that Sino-American cooperation is essential for addressing non-traditional threats, such as terrorism.In the future, Zhou said, China will continue to promote business investment by increasing efficiency, reducing bureaucracy and further opening the market."The government will ensure consistency and stability of policies regarding foreign investment," he said.In order to facilitate this economic growth America in turn should end protectionist policies, he said."We want to buy more, but there are many things you just don't want to sell us," Zhou said, citing America's refusal to sell the Chinese government helicopters for civilian use.Zhou also discussed the challenges that China will face in the future, including environmental degradation and the difficulty of bringing growth to rural areas. He noted that China's per-capita GDP trails that of other major trading powers, a sign that China still qualifies as a developing country."The socialist market economy, democracy and the rule of law still need improvement," he said.Zhou added that one challenge the government has recently begun to focus on has been sustainable growth."We will make great efforts to balance economic growth and environmental protection," he said.When asked about his thoughts on the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Zhou said he was optimistic, regardless of the outcome."Whoever the United States president is, China wants to maintain a productive relationship with the United States and to pursue our shared interest," he said.Load-Date: February 3, 2017End of Document

As China Competes to Win, Some Investments in U.S. Firms Pose Dangerous Challenge to U.S. Technology Leadership, Jobs, Security, ITIF Testifies Before U.S.-China CommissionTargeted News ServiceJanuary 26, 2017 Thursday 6:34 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 666 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Information Technology and Innovation Foundation issued the following news release:To evaluate the impact of increasing Chinese investments in the United States, U.S. policymakers must first understand that China isn't merely participating in the global free market--it's playing hardball to ensure that its firms gain global market share at the expense of their competitors, said Robert D. Atkinson, president and founder of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), in testimony today before the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.On a deal-by-deal basis, some foreign direct investment from China is a net positive for the U.S. economy, Atkinson said. But at least one-third comes from Chinese state-owned enterprises, and it is likely that considerably more is guided and supported by the Chinese government as part of an "indigenous innovation" strategy that employs mercantilist policies and specifically targets sectors that are strategically important for U.S. national security or economic leadership."Too many economists and pundits tiptoe around China's increasing innovation mercantilism, suggesting that its industrial policy is only a problem because it distorts markets and creates an uneven playing field," said Atkinson. "But this is underselling the true impact. China's economic and trade policies are not so much market-distorting as they are firm-destroying. They represent a coherent array of measures designed to attack U.S. companies with the goal of defeating them. China is playing to win, and by focusing on the rules of the game instead of the results, America is merely playing to play.""China's goal is to gain global market share for its firms, period, whether through coercive mercantilism or legal acquisition," Atkinson said. "In this sense, some Chinese investments--especially acquisitions of U.S. tech firms--represent a direct challenge to U.S. technology leadership, jobs, and national security interests. America's policy response needs to be grounded in a broad understanding of China's hardball strategy and should dovetail with a concerted effort to push back on its innovation mercantilism. The right approach is neither to blithely ignore China's brass-knuckles tactics in the hopes that a free market will work itself out, nor to close the drawbridge as a way to defend 'fortress America.' The United States should welcome inward FDI that is market-driven and based on commercial interests, and it should block FDI that is driven by the mercantilist interests of foreign governments."To thwart harmful Chinese investment in the United States without foregoing the benefits of investments that contribute to the U.S. economy, Atkinson offered five policy recommendations:Reform the investment review process, including CFIUS;Insist on mutual access and treatment;Develop stronger analytic competence within the federal government;Rethink antitrust policy to consider foreign innovation mercantilism; andWork with U.S. allies to coordinate measures to constrain mercantilist-inspired Chinese FDI."It is clear that China's number one goal is to take U.S. technology capabilities so that Chinese firms can gain global market share at the expense of their foreign competitors," said Atkinson. "Access to U.S. technology and know-how is integral to China's plan to gain and ultimately surpasses the United States in technology capabilities.""When it comes to the economic competition between China and the United States, the United States is playing recreational softball to China's major league hardball. When China's FDI technology firm acquisition strategy is seen in this light, it should be much more worrisome than some irritating market distortion. It's time policymakers take action to ensure the United States can continue to compete."Read written testimony (http://www2.itif.org/2017-us-china-testimony.pdf?_ga=1.255190152.1082087885.1485241828).Copyright Targeted News Services30VitinMar-5758823 30VitinMarLoad-Date: January 28, 2017End of Document

Badiucao: A Chinese political cartoonist reinvents himself in AustraliaCNN.comMarch 2, 2017 Thursday 12:57 AM ESTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ARTSLength: 1565 wordsByline: James Griffiths, CNNDateline: Adelaide, Australia BodyHalfway up Mount Lofty, a squat, scenic mountain that overlooks the Australian city of Adelaide, Badiucao is uneasy.The dissident Chinese artist left his phone in the car, over an hour's hike away, and now he feels cut off.Even for a millennial, Badiucao -- he uses a deliberately nonsensical pseudonym to protect his identity -- is tied to his phone. With it in hand he is constantly checking Twitter, staying connected with China thanks to a non-stop stream of posts from journalists and fellow dissidents.After almost seven years in self-imposed exile in Australia, more than anything else he fears being cut-off from his homeland, becoming another irrelevant overseas critic fighting yesterday's battles.CensoredIt was easier when he could use Weibo. Badiucao joined China's heavily-censored but incredibly dynamic answer to Twitter in early 2011, around the time of the Wenzhou high-speed train crash.That was a pivotal moment in Chinese internet history, as hundreds of commenters took to social media to question the authorities' account of the disaster and fight back attempts at a cover-up."I felt this deepening of free expression, as everyone began to use the internet in a new way, I wanted to join in and be part of it," he said.Badiucao began drawing cartoons about the crash, soon expanding into commenting on other political topics and scandals, racking up thousands of followers in the process.The more attention he got however, the more censors started paying notice as well. After having more than 30 accounts deleted, he felt forced to give the platform up."I couldn't do it anymore. It wasn't effective. Every drawing was deleted, if I wanted to register new accounts I would have to give my personal ID, or have someone else take the risk," he said.Weibo did not respond to a request for comment about its censorship policies."Around 2010-2011 when Weibo was becoming very active, it was a relatively free medium, and a few cartoonists became popular," said Sophie Beach, editor of the US-based censorship watchdog China Digital Times."Once the authorities started cracking down on Weibo, they specifically targeted several of these outspoken cartoonists and the environment shrunk for them."By now living outside China, Badiucao decamped to Twitter, from where his cartoons could still occasionally spread to the other side of the Great Firewall -- China's sprawling internet censorship apparatus -- but there was no risk of account deletion.Freed from worrying about what Chinese internet users sarcastically call "harmonization," his profile continued to grow.When five young feminists were jailed in 2015 for trying to organize a campaign against sexual harassment on public transport in Beijing, Badiucao drew portraits of them. These were widely used in media coverage of the case, as were ones he later produced for Amnesty International highlighting the plight of dozens of lawyers and activists jailed in an ongoing crackdown on Chinese civil society."Badiucao has a knowledge and understanding of China and its human rights situation that comes from being a highly interested and keen observer," said Amnesty International's Tanny Chia. "His is a distinctive and impactful style that is quickly recognized among Chinese netizens."ExpressionBadiucao's cartoons meld the thick, blocky lines of German expressionism with the red-and-black punchiness of Chinese Communist propaganda posters."When I first saw Badiucao's work it resonated for me. It reminded me of KÃ¤the Kollwitz's woodcuts," Canadian cartoonist Daniel Murphy said, referring to the early-20th century German artist.According to Murphy, just as Kollwitz used posters and pamphlets to spread her political beliefs, Badiucao has taken advantage of social media."There's a power in pictures, they can immediately undermine some ruler on a golden throne in a golden hat and draped in ermine," he said. "It's the quickest way to yank somebody off a perch."China Digital Times' Beach said that Badiucao's style lends itself to China's often opaque online discussions."Whereas a lot of the time people writing about politics in China use all this coded language, cartoons are a direct form of expression," she said.Beach compared Badiucao to China's best-known dissident artist. "He has that same in your face manner as Ai Weiwei, of not caring what the authorities think," she said.Outspoken Chinese artists often don't fare well at home. Ai was put under house arrest in 2010 and detained by the Chinese government in 2011 in a separate incident for tax evasion, and has claimed he found government listening devices in his apartment.Cartoonist Wang Liming, better known as Rebel Pepper, fled to Japan in 2014 after what he said was prolonged harassment from the authorities."Maybe the Party wants to admonish people one by one as examples," Wang said in 2015. "If they don't throw you in jail, they'll make it impossible for you to live."ExpansionLike Ai Weiwei, Badiucao creates work in a number of different formats. His first major art show opened in Adelaide, Australia, in SeptemberÂ 2016.During that show, the artist stood silently in the corner in a prison jumpsuit with a hood over his head, both present and absent at the same time. A DJ played as attendees milled around, looking at brightly colored campaign posters stuck to the walls casting Chinese President Xi Jinping as a candidate in the recent Australian general election.Under Xi's face, painted in thick, blotchy oils, were slogans like "China's Reds for the chairman," and "We'll put Party first."On the floor, mounds of baby formula were piled on top of a black tarp and shaped to form the faces of six children killed in 2008 by a batch of milk powder contaminated with melamine, an industrial chemical used for making plastic tableware. Over the course of the two-month installation, the powder reacted with the moisture in the air, the faces of the children blurring and disappearing just as the story has faded from the headlines.Opposite the powder, in a small glass case, lay the catalyst for the show, and Badiucao's desire to push beyond his previous work. A passport, its dark red cover embossed with the emblem of the People's Republic of China, with the top right corner sliced off. After years overseas, Badiucao is no longer a Chinese citizen.UpbringingBadiucao's parents hoped he would not be political. He said his grandparents were imprisoned during Mao Zedong's Anti-Rightist Movement and his father grew up an orphan.His parents encouraged him to be a dentist or hairdresser -- "jobs that never get in trouble with the authorities" -- but instead he went to law school, dreaming of joining the ranks of China's incredibly brave and often arrested human rights lawyers.At university, a roommate acquired a copy of the 1995 film "The Gate of Heavenly Peace," about the Tiananmen Square massacre of June 4, 1989."The guy who downloaded the documentary is now a public security officer," Badiucao said. "There's no room for that kind of thought outside university. China makes it just hard enough to achieve that people have to censor and watch themselves to get ahead."The film had a profound effect on Badiucao however, one that is still visible in his work today.On the 2016 anniversary of the massacre, he re-created the famous Tank Man moment in Adelaide's city center, standing impassively dressed in black-and-white, with shopping bags at his side and a mask covering his face, until security guards forced him to leave.His parents sensed the danger in his talent and rebelliousness. "It was a constant struggle as I was growing up," he said. "There were lots of fights."Thinking of homeEven as he gets further away from the country of his birth -- becoming an Australian citizen and getting more involved in local politics and issues -- Badiucao has strived to maintain his relevance in China.His latest show -- "Home Thoughts From Abroad," which ran until April 6 -- is a collaboration with two other artists who exist at the crux of two countries, Afghan refugee Elyas Alavi and Filipina-Iranian Aida Azin.Badiucao's contributions to the show include a selection of his political cartoons, a giant air-pollution mask made from a Chinese flag, and a bed (the first he ever slept on when he came to Australia), with the mattress replaced by 4,000 individually-sharpened pencils.He sharpened all the pencils, ordered in bulk from a Chinese website, by hand. "First they were all the same, after I sharpened them, I gave them individuality, made them different," he said.He then took it away, with the piece representing his fear of fading back into the mass of China writ large: "On the bed they become united again, the personal characteristics of each pencil disappears, as if the individual is coming back under the control of the nation."While Badiucao's installation work is based on his cartoons, curator Joanna Kitto said that creating 3D versions of the work added a layer of complexity not always visible in print."Cartoons must be very direct in the way they speak about issues, when you (create installations) you need to leave a degree of space for the audience," Kitto said.Â Badiucao agreed. "People can feel that cartoons are exaggerations," he said."By making it into a real object, it will bring audiences back to reality. This is not a joke, this is something happening in the real world."Load-Date: December 20, 2017End of Document

Trump Is Right That China Poses Economic Threat, But Go-It-Alone Nationalism Is Wrong Response, Says Tech Think Tank; Report Proposes New Doctrine of Constructive, Alliance-Backed ConfrontationTargeted News ServiceMarch 16, 2017 Thursday 4:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 936 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Information Technology and Innovation Foundation issued the following news release:President Trump is right that China is flouting global trade rules to the detriment of the United States, says the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF). But economic nationalism is not the right response, the tech-policy think tank argues in a new report out today. Instead, ITIF contends that the United States must pursue a new doctrine of constructive, alliance-backed confrontation, where policymakers put "America First"--as the leader of an international coalition that pressures China to stop rigging markets and start competing on fair terms."China's systematic mercantilism represents a threat not just to the U.S. economy, but also to the very soul of the global trading system," said Robert D. Atkinson, ITIF's president and the report's lead author. "The U.S. response can't be more flaccid appeasement, because the status quo is untenable. And it can't be a retreat toward economic nationalism, because that would cede the global playing field. We need a new doctrine of constructive, alliance-backed confrontation--a version of 'America First' where America stands at the vanguard of an international coalition defending the norms of democratic, market-led capitalism against the mercantilist tactics of the top-down, state-led model. We should refuse to accept empty ministerial dialogues while China flouts trade rules. We have to insist on concrete results, and we have to be prepared to apply real pressure if China doesn't change its behavior."The ITIF report explains that China has positioned itself as the main economic rival of the United States through a mercantilist economic approach of both defensive protectionism and offensive efforts to achieve global dominance across a wide array of advanced-technology industries that are key to U.S. economic and national security interests. Its tactics include stealing competitors' intellectual property, making market access contingent on handing over proprietary technologies, lavishly subsidizing Chinese enterprises, and more.The U.S. government has tried for more than two decades to counter China's pattern of flouting global rules and norms by engaging in regular diplomatic dialogues, but China has only accelerated its efforts to overtake U.S. leadership in advanced industries. Absent a change in U.S. policies toward China, America will likely lose even more U.S. jobs in advanced industries over the next 20 years. So ITIF argues it is time for a new approach--but economic nationalism won't do."Engaging in dialogue in the hope that the Chinese government will listen and change its ways has not worked," said Atkinson. "But simply slapping a tariff on Chinese goods will only make it harder for the United States to compete globally, because so much of what America exports involves pieces and parts originally imported from China. Economic nationalism would leave the global playing field wide open for China to shape a trading system to its own interests and pressure other nations who would have no choice but to cut flawed deals with the world's new economic superpower."To enact a doctrine of constructive, alliance-backed confrontation, ITIF urges the Trump administration to assemble an international coalition of market-based, rule-of-law economies that together move beyond legalistic, "meeting-by-meeting" engagement with China toward a more results-oriented approach. This should entail holding China to specific goals, such as reducing its forced technology transfer and IP theft, as well as procedural goals, such as demonstrating a shift from predominantly export-led growth to growth generated chiefly by raising productivity in the country's non-traded sectors. And if China does not comply, this coalition must hold China responsible, says the think tank. The report lists an array of specific actions the administration can take if needed, including ceasing scientific cooperation with China until its use of innovation-mercantilist practices dramatically declines and establishing a zero-tolerance policy for Chinese imports that are counterfeit or otherwise illegal.The report warns that the Chinese government has demonstrated a willingness to fight back against legitimate efforts to stop it from manipulating the global trade system. As such, ITIF says the Trump administration needs to make it clear that it is not trying to hold China down; any punitive actions should be temporary and only kept in place until the Chinese government makes needed reforms to restore rules-based trade."When countries compete on equitable terms--according to global rules for market-based trade--it is a win-win for everyone," said Atkinson. "We have to unite around this goal, because a system predicated on innovation-mercantilist tactics is untenable for the U.S. economy and the global economy."Read summary (https://itif.org/publications/2017/03/16/stopping-chinas-mercantilism-doctrine-constructive-alliance-backed).Read report (http://www2.itif.org/2017-stopping-china-mercantilism.pdf?_ga=1.154304496.995117974.1488876531).The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) is an independent, nonpartisan research and educational institute focusing on the intersection of technological innovation and public policy.

U.S. firm outbids Chinese giant in effort to buy MoneyGramCNN WireMarch 15, 2017 Wednesday 6:30 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 417 wordsByline: By Sherisse PhamDateline: HONG KONG (CNNMoney) BodyHONG KONG (CNNMoney) --  U.S. electronic payments company Euronet Worldwide just offered $1 billion to buy national rival MoneyGram, potentially sparking a bidding war with Chinese competitor Ant Financial. MoneyGram said it "will carefully review and consider" Euronet's unsolicited offer. The Dallas-based company is one of the most popular avenues for sending money from the U.S. to Mexico and other countries. MoneyGram stock jumped nearly 25% following the new bid. Ant Financial, an affiliate of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, announced last month it would acquire MoneyGram for about $880 million.But this isn't just about the money. Euronet -- based in Leawood, Kansas -- is arguing a domestic takeover of MoneyGram would face fewer regulatory hurdles than a bid from a Chinese company. "The proposal offers stockholders a clear and significantly more certain path to a faster closing," the company said in a statement. Given the rising tensions between China and the U.S. over trade and foreign policy, a bid from a Chinese financial services giant was always going to face scrutiny. Ant Financial investors include Alibaba's billionaire chairman Jack Ma, as well as companies and funds backed by the Chinese government. Republican congressmen Robert Pittenger and Chris Smith openly criticized MoneyGram's deal with Ant Financial last month, raising alarms about the Chinese government's "significant" 15% stake in Ant. "As the Chinese government increasingly cracks down on political, religious and human rights activists, we must fully examine how the MoneyGram network may be used by the Chinese government to target these voices," the lawmakers wrote in a Wall Street Journal article. Ant Financial said it remains committed to the deal. "MoneyGram and Ant Financial continue to work cooperatively under the terms of our merger agreement, and together, we are making progress on schedule towards obtaining all required regulatory and shareholder approvals," the company said in a statement.MoneyGram said it "remains subject to the terms of the definitive merger agreement with Ant Financial and MoneyGram's board has not changed its recommendation in support of the merger agreement with Ant Financial." Ant Financial recently completed a funding round that valued the company at $60 billion, more than rival PayPal.

Billionaire Xiao Jianhua missing, believed abducted by Chinese policeUPIFebruary 1, 2017 Wednesday 9:46 AM ESTCopyright 2017 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 268 wordsByline: ED ADAMCZYKDateline: HONG KONG, Feb. 1 BodyXiao Jianhua, a billionaire with ties to the Chinese government, was abducted from his Hong Kong residence by Chinese police, a person close to him said.Xiao, 45, was allegedly taken from his residence in a Hong Kong hotel and transported into mainland China. He has been missing since Friday, and if the Chinese police are involved in his absence, it would violate Hong Kong's constitution, which only permits Hong Kong police to operate in Hong Kong, a former British colony.The Chinese-born Xiao, a Canadian citizen, is chief of the Tomorrow Group, a conglomerate involved in Chinese real estate, banks, insurance and the coal industry. In 2013 he invested in an equity firm owned by the sister and brother-in-law of Chinese president  to help them divest their financial holdings, and has since acted as a banker to the Chinese government elite, the New York Times reported Tuesday.Since his disappearance, Xiao posted two messages on his company's website, since removed, saying he was "recuperating abroad" and was not abducted. "Abroad" is a semi-official signal meaning outside of the Chinese mainland, and the person close to Xiao said the messages were meant to decrease interest in the story, the New York Times said.Hong Kong police said Xiao crossed to the Chinese mainland last week, contradicting those messages. They added his relatives sought the help of Hong Kong police in finding him, then withdrew their request for assistance.Citing reports, the Guardian said Xiao is in police custody somewhere on the Chinese mainland and may be assisting the Chinese government with a graft investigation.Load-Date: February 2, 2017End of Document

Chinese media falls for phony phone foil story about Trump; Multiple Chinese outlets picked up a satirical story claiming a paranoid Trump ordered White House phones wrapped in tinfoil.The Christian Science MonitorMarch 9, 2017 ThursdayCopyright 2017 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights ReservedSection: WorldLength: 591 wordsByline: Charlie Wood StaffBodyCNN may get a reprieve as the object of President Trump's ire, thanks to a serendipitous combination of two of the president's favorite topics: China and fake news.  Published Saturday in The New Yorker, comedian Andy Borowitz's humorous satirization of a paranoid president wrapping phones in tinfoil got picked up Tuesday by multiple Chinese news outlets. The truth had come out by Wednesday, but not before highlighting how easy it is for sarcasm to get lost in translation.Riffing on the president's Twitter allegations that former President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower phones before the election, The New Yorker article depicted a paranoid commander-in-chief insisting aids Obama-proof all White House phones with a layer of tinfoil."The President, still wearing his bathrobe after what was reportedly a sleepless night, personally supervised the tin-foil installation, sources said," read a line from the piece, which bears the label "Satire from the Borowitz Report."But that didn't stop Reference News, a Chinese website run by state media Xinhua that translates international coverage, from reporting the joke as serious on Tuesday. Publications that fell for the misreporting included respected outlets such as the business magazine Caijing, as well as news portal Sina.At least one internet reader, confronted with apparently earnest headlines such as "Trump turns White House upside down looking for signs of Obama: 'I know he's still here!' " quickly saw through the gaff."This was made up and meant to be funny," one user said, according to The New York Times. "Surprising it was treated as news. Editor, could you be more professional?"Some may be inclined to blame the miscommunication on Mr. Trump's tendency to defy convention, but Tuesday was just the latest in a string of incidents where Chinese media mistook comedic headlines for truth.In 2012, the Communist Party's newspaper The People's Daily ran a story naming North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un as the "Sexiest Man Alive." The American editorial board bestowing this great honor? The Onion, one of the most famous news satire organizations.  Ten years before, the tabloid Beijing Evening News picked up another Onion story reporting that Congress was threatening to leave Washington, D.C., to get a new building, much like sports team threaten departure as leverage to have cities build them new stadiums.Rumors and conspiracy theories run rampant on the Chinese internet, as they do on the internet at large, occasionally leading to the inevitable misreading."Fake news is undoubtedly a serious problem in China, as it is elsewhere in the world," David Bandurski, editor of the China Media Project at the University of Hong Kong, wrote in an email to The New York Times.But like Trump, the Chinese government uses the term to their advantage as well.Last Thursday, the state media reported that recent descriptions of a political activist's torture were "fake news" made up to gain attention.They're "probably borrowing it from Donald Trump's attack on major Western media," Patrick Poon, China researcher at Amnesty International told Reuters.Rights organizations say the Chinese police often use threats and violence to coerce confessions.Western media could not reach the detained activist for confirmation, but at least in the case of the tinfoil covered phones at the White House, the truth did win out in the end. Chinese media reported the story as false on Wednesday, and Reference News removed their coverage.This report contains material from Reuters.Load-Date: March 9, 2017End of Document

3 High-Yield Dividend Stocks You Definitely Want to ConsiderThe Daily Cardinal: University of Wisconsin - MadisonFebruary 11, 2017 SaturdayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 981 wordsBodyMany high-yield dividend stocks are now trading at a premium to the market and their industry peers, due to the multi-year bull market and low interest rates inflating demand for income stocks. But with interest rates set to rise this year, investors should be wary of dividend stocks that have historically low yields and historically high valuations.It might seem tough to find undervalued stocks with high yields in this frothy market. So in this article, I'll highlight three stocks that still trade at discounts to their industry peers while offering yields higher than 3% --Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM),Verizon (NYSE: VZ), andChina Mobile (NYSE: CHL).Image source: Getty Images.Shares of Qualcomm, the biggest mobile chipmaker in the world, have fallen nearly 20% since the beginning of 2017 due to an FTC lawsuit regarding the company's licensing practices, several related lawsuits from longtime customerApple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and mixed first quarter earnings.The main bear case against Qualcomm is that its core business model -- which uses a high-margin portfolio of patents to support its lower-margin chip business -- could be crippled if it's forced to lower its licensing fees, which many OEMs and regulators claim are too high. Qualcomm's chip business would continue losing market share to cheaper chipmakers likeMediaTek and first-party chipmakers like Apple andHuawei. To top it off, the probes and lawsuits could derail its proposed takeover ofNXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ: NXPI), which would make it the largest automotive chipmaker in the world.Meanwhile, the bulls believe that a Republican-led FTC will drop the case, Qualcomm will eventually reach a settlement with Apple, and the NXP deal can still clear its regulatory hurdles.Regardless of the outcome, the steep sell-off has made Qualcomm shares fundamentally cheap at 14 times earnings -- which is much lower than its industry average of 22. Qualcomm has hiked its dividend annually for 14 straight years, and currently pays a forward yield of 4% -- which is comfortably supported by its payout ratio of 63%.Shares of Verizon have slipped 10% since the beginning of the year, due to a mixed first quarter earnings report, a (recently dropped) FCC probe of its zero-rating strategies, and uncertainties regarding its planned acquisition of Yahoo's internet business and rumored interest in Charter Communications. All those question marks made Verizon look riskier than its primary rivalAT&T (NYSE: T), which dipped just 3% this year.But that fear also made Verizon a value play at 14 times earnings, which compares favorably to AT&T's P/E of 17 and the industry average of 25 for domestic telcos. The company has also raised its dividend annually for a decade, and currently pays a forward yield of 4.8% -- which matches AT&T's yield. Verizon's payout ratio of 66% also gives it plenty of room for dividend hikes in the future.Regardless of questions surrounding Verizon's near-term moves, the telco remains the largest wireless carrier in the U.S., and won't likely lose that title anytime soon. Analysts expect Verizon's revenue and earnings growth to remain nearly flat this year, but the company's low valuation, high yield, wide moat, and expanding digital ecosystem still make it an ideal income play for conservative investors.Investors looking for an overseas domestic telco might consider buying China Mobile, the biggest wireless carrier in China (and the whole world). The carrier had 849 million customers at the end of 2016, and a large number of its 2G and 3G users upgraded to higher revenue 4G plans throughout the year. It also has a small but growing wireline business with 79 million customers, which could eventually enable it to launch more comprehensive digital bundles like AT&T and Verizon.China Mobile is one of three state-owned telcos in China. The Chinese government sometimes rotates its management with that of its two peers --China Telecom andChina Unicom -- to ensure healthy competition between the three players. This prevents China Mobile from ever becoming a monopoly, but it gives it a comfortable safety net which limits its downside during market declines.China Mobile has a trailing yield of 3.1%, which is supported by a payout ratio of 42%. Its forward yield is uncertain, since it adjusts the payment every year based on its earnings, but its yield has stayed between 3% to 5% over the past five years. Its semi-annual yield might not appeal to income investors looking for quarterly payments, but China Mobile's trailing P/E of 15 makes it a solid value play compared to other foreign telcos, which have an industry average of 18.Qualcomm, Verizon, and China Mobile all have wide moats, low valuations, and high dividends. Their near-term growth might seem glacial, but I believe that they all have less downside potential than other income plays, which are trading at premiums to the market -- which makes them solid long-term plays at current prices.10 stocks we like better than Verizon CommunicationsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

HOTELS TURN AWAY SOUTH KOREANS, CHINESE SMASH GOODS AS MISSILE ROW WIDENSStates News ServiceMarch 13, 2017 MondayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 774 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Hotels in in northeastern China said they are refusing to take South Korean guests on Monday, while protesters elsewhere in the country filmed themselves smashing goods from South Korea in an ongoing row over Seoul's deployment of a U.S. missile defense shield.Residents of the northeastern Chinese city of Hunchun in Jilin province said anti-Korean sentiment is running high in the town."For example, a lot of [South Korean] goods have been taken off the shelves of the supermarkets," one Hunchun resident told RFA on Monday. "Either that or nobody's ordering alcoholic drinks from [South Korea] any more.""Basically it's that sort of thing," the resident said.Sources said hotels in the city are refusing to take guests from South Korea, after its government began deploying the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) antimissile system last week.The move has drawn strong diplomatic protests from Beijing, and sparked demonstrations and store closures at outlets of the South Korea retail chain Lotte across China.An employee who answered the phone at a hotel in Hunchun confirmed the report."We're not accepting [South Korean guests] either," the employee told RFA on Monday. "Not for the time being."An employee at a second hotel said she wasn't authorized to turn guests away."But if some South Korean nationals wanted to stay here, I'd have to check with my boss," she said.Cruise shipOn Saturday, all 3,400 Chinese passengers refused to disembark from a cruise ship after it docked at popular tourist destination Jeju Island.Some 80 tour buses were lined up to take them around the island, but the guests opted to stay aboard the Costa Serena cruise ship for four hours before it headed to the northern Chinese port of Tianjin, Chinese media reported.The nationwide anti-Korean protests appear to have been fueled by rising nationalist sentiment on social media.One passenger tweeted to their Weibo account: "The itinerary was set a long time ago before the THAAD incident, but we have chosen to support our country.""Everyone in our company is of one mind on this and we have had a lot of approval from Chinese people online," the passenger wrote."They approved of us 'annoying them to death from across the sea' and thanked us for saving China's face," the tweet said.Meanwhile, video footage circulating online showed men in black clothing smashing up packets of South Korean food in a supermarket.Another showed black-clad men smashing a South Korean-made washing machine on the streets, watched by a few dozen people, while the Chinese national anthem blared from nearby speakers.Another video of lines of military vehicles parked by a roadside claimed to illustrate a build-up of People's Liberation Army troops near the border with North Korea. RFA was unable to verify the footage independently.Reining in protestsThere are signs, however, that the authorities are moving to contain the protests, for fear that they may get out of hand."I think they are moving to ban this sort of thing now," a journalist who gave only his surname Chen told RFA following reports that authorities in the northern province of Hebei have already detained one person in connection with protests at a Lotte store."I think it was [the government] who initiated these things, who incited people to [protest]," he said."But they are also worried that they will lose control of the situation and perhaps that it might become something different, like a protest by ordinary people against the Chinese government.""Another thing is that they are worried that the protests might affect other foreign businesses, as a lot of foreign investors are leaving China right now because they don't think it's a favorable investment environment," Chen said.Current affairs commentator Jia Pin agreed, saying the Maoist left in China is a force to be reckoned with for the administration of President Xi Jinping."Mass movements have been a favorite method of the Chinese leadership in recent years, but they are also afraid that they will turn into a genuine mass movement," Jia said."There is a hard-left element in these things that is very extreme," he said. "Once they come out onto the streets, the government wouldn't be able to control things, and that's not an outcome that they would wish to see.""On the other hand, the government can't pass up this opportunity to put pressure on South Korea, but things are getting embarrassing now," he said.Reported by Yang Fan for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Wong Siu-san and Wong Si-lam for the Cantonese Service.

American Airlines may become China Southern Airlines' stakeholderEturbo NewsMarch 24, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 eTurboNews, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 651 wordsDateline: U.S. BodyU.S., March 24 -- American Airlines Group, the world's largest carrier, is in advanced talks to acquire a stake in China Southern Airlines through a USD 200 million investment.The negotiations focus on an investment of about USD 200 million by Fort Worth, Texas-based American in China Southern's Hong Kong-listed shares. The sale will likely take place via a private placement. China Southern has a market value of about USD 10 billion.Under the discussions, American would nominate to the Chinese company's board an observer -- a representative without voting rights. Details of a deal are subject to change and a transaction could still fall through.An investment in China Southern would allow American to strengthen its presence in a market that the International Air Transport Association predicts will surpass the U.S. to become the world's biggest in terms of passenger numbers by 2024. Delta Air Lines acquired a minority stake in China Eastern Airlines in 2015.A sale of a stake in China Southern would represent the Chinese government's efforts to diversify ownership of state-controlled enterprises. Authorities have urged firms in industries including power, energy, defense and aviation to take measures this year to broaden ownership.China Southern is the last of the nation's top three airlines to bring in a non-mainland Chinese strategic investor. Cathay Pacific Airways owns about 18 percent of flagship Air China. Besides Delta, Shanghai-based China Eastern also counts online travel services provider Ctrip among its shareholders.American connects 350 destinations in 50 countries, mostly in North America, the Caribbean, South America and Europe.

CHINA RAMPS UP CONTROL OF DOMAIN NAMES, ADDS NEW LAYER TO GREAT FIREWALLStates News ServiceJanuary 16, 2017 MondayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 741 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:The ruling Chinese Communist Party looks set to add a new layer to state control over what the country's 710 million internet users can see online, with a raft of new measures that could undermine their use of virtual private networks (VPNs) to get around censorship.The draft regulations, which were first released for public consultation in March 2016, would require any websites operating in China to register with a Chinese domain name, which is subject to state control and can be used to shut down entire websites within the country-level .cn top-level domain.Xinhua news agency published an article on Jan. 11 suggesting that the requirement, which sparked concerns at the time over deeper censorship and access by foreign businesses to the Chinese market, is unlikely to be dropped."The domain names are like the nerves of the internet," Xinhua cited experts as saying. "Once there is a problem with the nerves, it is difficult to take any kind of follow-up action."The draft rules would also "promote cooperation with China's development tasks among overseas organizations," the state-run agency said.Sang Young, information security expert at the Hong Kong Internet Society, said the move could also serve to tighten state control over Chinese users' access to overseas-based websites, adding another layer to the complex set of blocks, filters and human censorship known as the Great Firewall."Under the current Great Firewall system, Chinese users are still able to see content that the government thinks is unsuitable [by accessing overseas sites through VPNs]," he said."But under these domain name regulations being implemented by the Chinese government ... people who don't register with domestic domain names won't be allowed to [set up websites]," he said.Bolstering Great FirewallYoung said the new rules will likely affect overseas websites and content providers hoping to attract a Chinese audience or set up new services in China."In the past, they had a blacklist approach which meant that only sites that were considered problematic were blocked," he said.He said the ultimate target of the new rules is preventing users from tunneling under the Great Firewall with virtual private networks (VPNs)."Any overseas connections that are not approved will be blocked," Young told RFA. "Once the communication is cut off, it is the equivalent of a wall; there will be no holes for VPN to drill through."Guangzhou-based writer and internet expert Ye Du said the move will bring much more online content under Beijing's control."Once these rules are implemented, the government has a reliable way to ensure that overseas news organizations reporting on China will be forced to self-censor, if they want to open up bigger markets in China," Ye said."They will be forced to modify their own reporting in order to continue existing, to avoid being shut off completely once they are blocked," he said.China's powerful internet regulator has ordered online app stores to register with the government starting on Monday, heralding a new era of state control over the mobile web."Starting on Jan. 16, 2017, branches of the Cyberspace Administration at provincial, autonomous region and city level are required to be ready for the official launch of app store registration," the Cyberspace Administration said in a statement on its official website.Censoring all newsThe move is part of a bid to "further promote the healthy and orderly development of the online app store industry and regulate mobile app-based information services," the statement said.The emphasis on "mobile app-based information services" comes as the ruling Chinese Communist Party broadens a nationwide clampdown on any news or media content that hasn't been pre-approved by censors.Such apps have "resulted in the dissemination of illegal information," the Cyberspace Administration said.A spokesman for the agency said in the statement that online app stores seeking registration are now required to submit an application form to its website.They will be audited for security, handling of user data, and content, the statement said.China's cabinet, the State Council, recently highlighted "weak management" of online app stores, calling for unified government policies to police the fast-growing sector.Reported by Goh Fung for RFA's Cantonese Service.

PLANS TO BUILD FOUR NEW NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS IN CHINA'S HENAN SPARK OUTCRYStates News ServiceFebruary 21, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 1097 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Plans by authorities in the central province of Henan to move ahead with four new nuclear power stations in the wake of the Fukushima disaster have sparked growing public fears in China.In a directive dated Jan. 25, the provincial government was ordered to move ahead with the implementation of power generation plans that include new nuclear reactors at Nanyang, Xinyang, Luoyang and Pingdingshan, according to a statement on its official website."[We must make] steady progress with preliminary work for nuclear power projects," the statements said."We must complete onsite protection work for nuclear power projects at Nanyang, Xinyang and the other nuclear power projects," it said."We should proceed with the planning and construction of inland nuclear power projects on behalf of our country, and strive to continue to be included in the national nuclear long-term development plan," the directive said.It called on government departments to "strengthen public awareness of nuclear power projects, nuclear power project planning and construction to create a good atmosphere."As the plans circulated online, opposition to the plan appeared to be mounting in the wake of Chinese public reaction to rising radiation levels at the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan."An old issue in Japan has sent ripples across the East China Sea to shake China," the Global Times newspaper, the sister paper of ruling Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece The People's Daily, reported."The news has been traveling fast on the Chinese internet ... Many Chinese became worried, some even canceling their trips to Japan," the paper said.A resident surnamed Li of Henan's Anyang city told RFA that the news is causing great concern among local people."I am extremely worried about this; they definitely shouldn't go ahead with building them," Li said. "I heard the pollution from nuclear plants is very serious.""I expect there to be a public outcry in Anyang and in Henan about the plans to build nuclear power stations."Chernobyl fearsWhile one resident of Luoyang said they hadn't heard of the plans, another Henan resident Yang Chunxia, hit out at the plans online."Last year, 100,000 people took to the streets of Lianyungang in protest against a nuclear power plant there, and they successfully blocked [its] construction," Yang wrote."The whole of Eastern Europe was polluted by the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1983," the user added. "Now, they've got their eye on Henan. What will Henan people do about it? Please, everyone who lives in Henan, please pass this on!"Meanwhile, authorities in Anyang detained local resident Wang Shoufeng for five days' administrative detention for "making things up to disrupt public order" after he posted on social media in a similar vein.Wang told RFA on Tuesday that he was innocent."I don't believe that I did anything to disrupt public order," he said. "A lot of people here in Henan want the government to go public with the information on this, and clarify whether they are planning to go ahead with it.""We want to understand everything about this and to catch the attention of as many people as possible."Wang's friend Feng Lei said local people have a right to know about the dangers of nuclear power."They had that huge nuclear leak in Japan, and people here in Henan want a safe environment for their children and grandchildren to live in," Feng said."They will be pushing for that."Repeated calls to the Henan provincial government offices rang unanswered during office hours on Tuesday .The growing concerns over China's nuclear power program came as the Hong Kong-listed arm of a state-owned nuclear power company announced further delays to controversial reactors at Taishan in the southern province of Guangdong.China General Nuclear Power, or CGN Power, began building the U.S.$8.3 billion Taishan plant in 2009, the first in the world to use European pressurized reactors (EPR) designed by French nuclear firm Areva.Reactor design problemsProblems with the design of the reactors have emerged during testing, however, and were cited by Areva's parent company, energy giant Electricite de France (EDF) in a recommendation to the U.K. parliament that it postpone the Chinese-invested Hinkley Point nuclear plant, which will also use EPR technology."The expected commercial operation of Taishan Unit 1 and Taishan Unit 2 are adjusted from the original first half of 2017 and the second half of 2017 to the second half of 2017 and the first half of 2018, respectively," CGN said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange on Monday .The Taishan plant has sparked concerns both among local residents and anti-nuclear campaigners in Hong Kong.A resident of Chixi township on the outskirts of Guangdong's Taishan city, said the plant lies just two kilometers from his home."Nobody is comfortable with this, and there are always going to be some concerns around nuclear power plants," the resident said. "If they leak, it can be very dangerous, and nobody will be able to live around here any more; we would have to leave."Engineer and sustainability campaigner Albert Lai, who convenes the Hong Kong think tank Professional Commons, told RFA that the project has been subject to repeated delays by the French partners over safety concerns."The French nuclear safety authority (ASN) has raised concerns over the structure of the EPR reactors destined for the Taishan plant," Lai said. "I don't think the Taishan plant should proceed while there is any possibility at all [that they could fail]."He called on the Chinese government to make public the findings of recent tests of the reactors."There is another issue, which is that the Chinese nuclear safety authorities are closely entwined with the nuclear industry, and they lack an independent system for safety testing," Lai said."China's nuclear power industry has developed at such speed in recent years that there is now a shortage of technical and engineering personnel to run it."According to the ASN, the EPR reactors installed at the Taishan plant haven't been subjected to the most rigorous form of testing.It said some mechanical properties can be measured only by destructive tests, which had not been carried out on the Taishan reactors.It said problems that could lead to cracks in the reactor vessel can be detected only by destroying an identical reactor vessel during testing.Reported by Ding Wenqi for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Goh Fung for the Cantonese Service.

Globalite Executive Search Helps Young Taiwanese Start Career in Mainland ChinaPR.comFebruary 3, 2017 Friday 6:30 AM ESTCopyright 2017 PR.com, distributed by Contify.com All Rights ReservedLength: 567 wordsByline: GlobalitehunterBodyShanghai, China,  February 03, 2017 --(PR.com)-- 2016 has been a rough year for the official relationship between Taiwan and mainland China. However, some signals show the Chinese government has moved its focus more to the real needs of the Taiwanese people. Innovation incentive policy in China now also covers people from Taiwan. Many new government-sponsored platforms for Taiwanese people to exchange innovative ideas and raise venture funds are happening. For instance, Wenzhou, a third tier city in Zhejiang province, government has launched an Innovation Center for young Taiwanese (http://www.youthtw.com). The Shanghai government also established a similar center downtown very recently.Due to low economic growth and starting salary for college graduates, young Taiwanese have chosen to extend academic study in a way to delay entry into the job market. The fact that freshmen get paid NT$22,000 a month (equivalent to US$700) has become the norm nowadays in Taiwan. Companies refuse to raise the wage for reasons like stagnant economy and loss of competitiveness. In mainland China, the starting salary may be the same, however the annual increase could be significant. For graduates from the top 38 universities in China, it is very likely to get a monthly pay above RMB20,000 (US$3,000) after 5 years working. Such figures are way higher than the average in the Taiwan job market.In fact, there are more young Taiwanese moving and working in mainland China. Thanks to the popularity of social tools, they have been connected as alumni of high school or college. There are various sub-circles of different interest too, like apartment leasing, real estate investment, or even group purchase of Taiwan foods. Offline party activities are being held every year or season with a hope to help each other or simply be social. In the past 20 years, many Taiwanese moved to mainland China with ex-pat packages. Now the ex-pat package has become rare. Meanwhile, Chinese or western companies are sending managers to Taiwan to lead the APAC regional operations or the Taiwan branch.Many Taiwanese families encourage their young men and women to move outside the island. Going abroad to make more money has never been so frequently talked about. Major Chinese cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen are the top choices to these young Taiwanese. However, due to the political atmosphere and difference in Chinese characters used, limited Chinese job market information is available in Taiwan.Seeing such a trend and the need for job information, Globalite Executive Search has decided to launch a plan in 2017 to assist the young Taiwanese people to start their career in China. "The MTTC program shall be implemented in three aspects," said Julie Ting, the Director in charge of the program. "Facebook and Line shall be the main vehicles to proliferate the Chinese job market news to new graduates who have no job experience at all. We shall provide free assessments and coaching to young people that have a few years of working experience. On the other hand, to young professionals in semiconductors for which China is desperately asking, we would be happy to provide a placement service in a way as we do in normal executive search assignments."Globalite Executive Search sees the program as a new movement and shall also try to align with the Taiwan innovation centers to maximize the synergy.Load-Date: February 3, 2017End of Document

Why China is still saying no to Pokémon Go; China's state censor said Tuesday Nintendo's hit smartphone app and other augmented reality games carry potential security risks, and will not be licensed until these concerns have been evaluated.The Christian Science MonitorJanuary 10, 2017 TuesdayCopyright 2017 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights ReservedSection: TechnologyLength: 533 wordsByline: Mengqi Sun StaffBodyDespite vast enthusiasm and anticipation, Chinese smartphone users are unlikely to meet "Pokémon Go" any time soon. China's state censor said Tuesday Nintendo's hit smartphone app and other augmented reality games carry potential security risks, and will not be licensed in that country until these concerns have been evaluated, Reuters reports. On its website a games panel of the China Audio-video and Digital Publishing Association cited "threat to geographical information security and the threat to transport and the personal safety of consumers," as its reason for not licensing the game.This week's statement contradicts the state's previous positions in July. The free-to-play, location-based mobile game asks users to walk in real-life neighborhoods as they use their smartphones to hunt and capture virtual characters. It became an instant hit since it debuted in mid-2016, with Apple calling its most downloaded iOS app for that year a "cultural phenomenon." The game was also recently licensed in India, a country which some have described as being "equally bureaucratic" as China. Despite no official releases, "Pokémon Go" has still managed to create a sensation in China since its official worldwide launch, according to The Nanfang, a website published in Hong Kong devoted to news about China. It reports that the hashtag "PokemonGo" has been used 330 million times by late July on Sina Weibo, a Chinese microblog site. But the Chinese government appears to be holding firm in its view that the game poses too great a security risk for it to have an authorized released there. The Daily Beast reports that because the game's developer, Niantic Inc., a former internal Google startup, collects a vast amount of information from its users, some are calling its database of personal data "a hacker's dream." According to the Daily Beast, the San-Francisco-based company's privacy policy gives it the right to "hand personally-identifiable information (PII) over to law enforcement, sell it off, share it with third parties, and even store it in foreign countries with lax privacy legislation."In China, these concerns are reported to have developed into an elaborate conspiracy theory that the app could serve as a Trojan horse controlled by the United States and Japan to figure out where its military bases are located. The app relies on US-based Google to detect locations (whose service is blocked in China), and is partially owned by Japan's Nintendo, according to Reuters.The conspiracy theory claims that two countries could use the game to locate Chinese military bases through a process of elimination by determining where users can't go to capture Pokémon characters. "In China, the major security issue related to Pokemon Go is that the third-party distributor will very likely add backdoor Trojan horse viruses to the installation package, which gives remote access to your smartphones," Wang Biao, an internet security expert, told The Nanfang in July. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said he was unaware of reports that the game could be a security risk, according to Reuters, giving no further details about the matter.This report contains material from Reuters.Load-Date: January 10, 2017End of Document

China: As Xi Jinping praises free trade, critics of Mao lose their jobsCNN.comJanuary 17, 2017 Tuesday 3:29 AM ESTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 711 wordsByline: By James Griffiths, CNNDateline: Hong Kong BodyIn a speech in Davos Tuesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping treated his audience of world business leaders to a full-throated defense of globalization and free trade.It was a surprising move by the head of a party co-founded by Mao Zedong and which claims the "realization of communism is (its) highest ideal and ultimate goal."But as Xi positions the Chinese Communist Party as the flag bearer of liberal economics, back home critics of Mao are discovering the old ways are far from past.This month, state media has reported three high-profile incidents of people losing their jobs for criticizing Mao, as universities restrict discussion of the Party and school history textbooks are revised to emphasize the Communists' role in fighting Japan during World War II.Who is hungrier -- Trump or China?Fired over 'devil' commentOn Monday, Zuo Chunhe, a senior city official in Shijiazhuang, capital of Hebei province near Beijing, was removed from his post and ordered to "deeply reflect on his mistakes" over comments he made on social media, according to Party mouthpiece People's Daily.Zuo called Mao a "devil" and described annual commemorations of the late leader's birthday on December 26 as "the world's largest cult activity." He also mocked ongoing government efforts to boycott Western ideas and culture.Zuo's dismissal comes after university professor Deng Xiangchao was forced to retire over similar criticisms of Mao."The only thing he did right was die," Deng wrote on Weibo, pointing to the Great Leap Forward and other disastrous Mao policies that led to mass starvation and caused the deaths of millions of people. His account has since been deleted.Videos posted online showed a crowd of pro-Mao protesters who gathered outside the gates of Shandong Jianzhu University calling for Deng's dismissal and holding banners such as "whoever opposes Chairman Mao is an enemy of the people."In a statement, the university said Deng's "wrong" comments were a "severe problem and led to a bad public effect," according to the Global Times.TV producer Liu Yong, who worked for a regional station in the central province of Henan, was fired for posting messages backing Deng and criticizing Mao.Mao still divides opinion in China. His giant portrait hangs on Beijing's Tiananmen Gate, and thousands flock to see his embalmed body at his mausoleum in Tiananmen Square in the heart of the Chinese capital. But many families suffered during political movements like the Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forward.Chinese TV star caught insulting MaoCensoredThe dismissals are indicative of a wider government move to tighten control over freedom of expression, said Human Rights Watch researcher Maya Wang."It's an extension of a longstanding pathology of the Chinese government to control the narratives of the country both in the past and the future," she said.The recent cases come as the Party cracks down on what it terms "historical nihilism," any attempt to question the official version of history, said Amnesty International researcher William Nee.He pointed to a recent statement by China's top court that it was considering how to tackle the issue of people "infringing on the reputation of heroes and historical figures."The Ministry of Education announced this month that history textbooks will now emphasize the "14-year Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression," a move that critics say is designed to inflate the Communist Party's role in World War II.Most sources date the start of the conflict in China to Japan's full invasion of the country in July 1937.Earlier this month, Guangzhou's Sun Yat-sen University, one of the country's leading educational institutions, circulated a list of topics banned from class discussion, according to the South China Morning Post.These included "criticizing the constitution," "criticizing Chinese Communist Party leaders" and "spreading religion and superstition." The university did not respond to a request for comment.Previous tolerance of "pockets of discussion and greater liberty" within universities and other institutions is narrowing, Wang said."At a time when the country is rapidly changing and facing a lot of challenges, the national discussion is being greatly limited."Load-Date: January 19, 2017End of Document

Macau Is Growing Up -- Here's What's New in the Chinese Gaming MeccaThe Daily Cardinal: University of Wisconsin - MadisonFebruary 4, 2017 SaturdayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1033 wordsBodyMacau's resort landscape has grown substantially in the last year, even though its gaming revenue has suffered so much since 2014. Fool contributor and former Macau local Seth McNew gives insights on what companies likeLas Vegas Sands (NYSE: LVS),Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ: WYNN),Melco Crown (NASDAQ: MPEL), andMGM Resorts International (NYSE: MGM) are betting on going forward.A full transcript follows the video.10 stocks we like better than Wynn ResortsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Wynn Resorts wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.Click here to learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of January 4, 2017This podcast was recorded on Jan. 25, 2017.Vincent Shen: Moving on now to your travels a little bit, let's first go to Macau. I've had you on here before as like my insider having lived there for a little bit, and experience again now at the newest resorts that have opened from Wynnand other major casino operators in that region. What did you see?Seth McNew: Macau has grown so much since I lived there. It was great to be back. The city looks completely different. There are tons of new resorts open, but what struck me is, it didn't seem to have that many people. Having come from Vegas, the resorts look amazing and the whole area, and Macau has really grown up. It's just not like packed streets like you'd see in Vegas. That was a bit of a concern, but the resorts themselves ... I went to each of the new resorts. I'd say the two that really struck out were the new Wynn Palace which is just opulent and incredible. There's a gondola that takes you from the front side of the lake all the way up to your room. Inside it's just like you'd expect from Wynn. It's beautiful in its design. Great shopping, great casinos. There's not really a lot of entertainment aspects of it outside of the shopping and casinos, but that's kind of Wynn style.Moving on to Las Vegas Sands though, this was my favorite, it's the Parisian. It's kind of this French inspired resort. A 50%-scale Eiffel Tower right outside. You walk in, there are mime shows, there are clowns walking around. The place is the most interesting casino I've been in any country yet.Shen: Did you notice at all, I think, a big trend that people have talked about in Macau was the decline of what was previously the segment that really drove business there which was the VIPs. Did you feel like as these resorts, the industry overall tries to target what they call the mass market gamblers a little bit more. Did you see that actually when you were at the resorts in terms of the tables, the clientele there? Did you feel like you saw a lot more high roller VIPs which you might expect at Wynn, known for its opulence versus some of the other resorts or anything like that?McNew: Yeah. I think that gets back to kind of how the companies even before Macau taking it's dive pitched to their audience. Wynn is much more upscale kind of VIP experience, as it is in Las Vegas. Las Vegas Sands has always been kind of more of that mass market, but even more so now you really see that divide where when you go to the Parisian, that's the Las Vegas Sands, when you really see that it's entertainment first and gambling second, where the Wynn still feels the other way. It still feels gambling first, entertainment second.Shen: Okay. For the market overall, do you feel like it's finally at that point where people are seeing that recovery after a year, year and half, two years at most of ongoing declines. Month over month seeing their overall gaming revenue in that region fall by pretty significant amounts. How are the numbers now for that region looking?McNew: It was actually a little longer. I think it was 26 months of year-over-year declines since 2014. Actually, January was the fifth month in a row of year-over-year increases, at 8%, nothing to shake a leg at. It's definitely starting to grow again. Full year for 2016 was still down 3% over 2015, but analysts are expecting that 2017 will return to growth for the first time in a while. I think that's looking pretty good.For how much gambling revenue Macau still has, which is about three times as much as Las Vegas, it still just has a lot fewer visitors than Las Vegas has. I think ramping up the number of visitors with things like governments having better policies toward visitation, more entertainment-focused things to the mass market. I think we're really going to see a change there in the next couple of years.Shen: Just to add some context if you haven't been following the situation, I feel like overall, tourist traffic levels to that region took a dive overall once the Chinese government kind of cracked down on some of the VIP gaming. This was around more issues with like money laundering and essentially the ultra-wealthy in China taking their money out of the country and using Macau to kind of cycle it through. The President and the rest of the Government had a real crack down policy on that which really shifted things from Macau resorts catering to VIPs, to trying to reach a wider audience.McNew: Yeah, and it actually wasn't just the VIPs, it was even just travel restrictions for all people from mainland China going into Macau for amount of time they could spend, how often they could return to Macau. Those regulations kind of eased up a little bit in 2016 which helped those numbers to grow a little bit, but as we saw in December, there was news that the Chinese government was going to restrict ATM withdrawals, which again sent each of these stocks down. We can see that it's still volatile there. I'm trying to understand what the government policies will be, but as of right now, it still looks pretty positive.Seth McNew owns shares of Las Vegas Sands.

Apple yanks New York Times apps in ChinaCNN WireJanuary 5, 2017 Thursday 9:55 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 576 wordsByline: By Sherisse PhamDateline: HONG KONG (CNNMoney) BodyHONG KONG (CNNMoney) --  All the news that's fit to ban -- that's essentially China's position on The New York Times. After blocking the U.S. publication's English and Chinese websites for the better part of five years, Chinese authorities have now had Apple pull New York Times news apps from the App Store in China. "We have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations. As a result, the app must be taken down off the China App Store," Apple said in a statement. "When this situation changes, the App Store will once again offer the New York Times app for download in China."The New York Times called the removal of its English- and Chinese-language apps late last month "deeply regrettable," saying it had asked Apple to reconsider its decision."The request by the Chinese authorities to remove our apps is part of their wider attempt to prevent readers in China from accessing independent news coverage by The New York Times of that country -- coverage which is no different from the journalism we do about every other country in the world, including the United States," Times spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said in a statement.Amnesty International said the move by Apple is part of a growing trend of big tech companies effectively aiding China in its crackdown on free speech. "It's extremely worrying that Apple is kowtowing to China's censorship by deleting New York Times apps," said Patrick Poon, an Amnesty researcher.The apps allowed readers in mainland China to access Times articles without having to use a Virtual Private Network, or VPN, to skirt the country's huge censorship apparatus, known as the Great Firewall. Other international news apps, including those of The Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times and CNN, were still available on the App Store in China on Thursday. The New York Times app still works for users who had previously downloaded it, but anti-censorship group GreatFire.org said the app will no longer be updated for Apple devices and so will eventually stop working. Apple declined to specify which regulations the Times allegedly breached. It may be connected to new rules that went into effect in August, stipulating that apps mustn't disseminate banned content.The Cyberspace Administration of China, the country's top internet regulator, didn't respond to a request for comment. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular news briefing that he didn't know any details about the removal of the Times apps but reiterated that digital content "must comply with Chinese rules and regulations."Apple makes a significant chunk of its revenue in China, the world's second largest economy, and many of its products are assembled there. It's also not the only tech company bending to the Chinese government's will. Microsoft's Chinese chatbot refuses to talk about sensitive topics like the 1989 crackdown on Tiananmen Square protests or Chinese President Xi Jinping.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has made no secret of his desire to get the giant social network unblocked in China. His company is reported to have built a censorship tool that would keep certain posts out of people's news feeds. Apple has also been on the receiving end of China's content crackdown. Last year, Chinese regulators shut down its iBooks and iTunes Movies services.-- Nanlin Fang and Tim Schwarz contributed to this report.TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Blockchain Based Banking App Humaniq Reschedules Its ICO in Solidarity With Chinese Investors; Humaniq postpones its ICO to provide an equal opportunity for investors from across the globe.PR NewswireMarch 3, 2017 Friday 12:17 PM ESTCopyright 2017 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 733 wordsDateline: LUXEMBOURG, March 3, 2017 Body Humaniq, a blockchain based banking application with a mission to aid 2 billion currently unbanked people from emerging economies reschedules its ICO from February 28 to April 6, 2017. Humaniq hopes that the postponed ICO will ensure unhindered participation of investors from countries like China that is currently facing certain restrictions.Humaniq's primary goal is to create an Ethereum blockchain based mobile banking app that can be offered to the over two billion people with no current access to banking services. In addition to the banking service, the app will also provide the necessary infrastructure to allow third party insurance providers, p2p lenders, and data security services to use it. The blockchain banking platform is designed by accounting for different perspectives presented by people from various countries and cultures.Chinese investors have shown a lot of interest in Humaniq's ICO. In the wake of recent developments where the country's government has restricted the movement of Bitcoin, Humaniq has in good faith moved the ICO dates to prevent any inconvenience in shifting assets within the cryptocurrency investor community."I've been in close contact with our Chinese partners, and our internal information shows us that there is strong interest in this ICO among Chinese blockchain community members. Therefore, we're going to show some solidarity and good faith to our friends in China, and push back the ICO so that they don't miss out on early investor rewards,"says Alex Fork.Fork clarified that the change in ICO dates has nothing to do with any organizational challenges. The team behind Humaniq stands ready and continues to make progress with the app. The only reason for changing the dates is to see if the Chinese government will change its stance so that investors can feel free to participate in the crowd sale unhindered.About HumaniqLaunched in 2016, the Humaniq platform is a result of Alex Fork's discussions with Vitalik Buterin and the UN representatives on a later date at the ICT Conference in Moldova. Fork has also interacted with over 500 representatives from the Russian finance industry.Humaniq will be working closely with the head of Satoshi Centre in Botswana, Alakanani Itireleng and other partners from developing nations. They will function as regional and local leaders responsible for making the community understand the platform's importance. Itireleng is also one of the principal authors of "The African Blockchain Opportunity" and has been a tireless advocate for Blockchain in developing nations.With the goal of including over 2 billion unbanked people into the global economy, Humaniq is already off to a great start. The platform has been successful in its initial crowdfunding campaign in December 2016. The startup also has an ambitious agenda for 2017.Humaniq is sponsoring a startup competition at the BlockShow Europe 2017 in Munich, Germany. The contest schedule coincides with the ICO launch on April 6, 2017. The event will see six finalists competing for a (EURO)10000 prize which will be offered half in Bitcoin and rest in Humaniq tokens.Learn more about Humaniq at - https://humaniq.coLearn more about BlockShow Europe 2017 -            http://events.cointelegraph.com/buy-ticket/Humaniq on Twitter -            https://twitter.com/Humaniq_coFollow Humaniq's blog at -            https://blog.humaniq.co/Humaniq on GitHub -            https://github.com/humaniqHumaniq on YouTube:            https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXatRidLHbngYUtF8JXICPAMedia ContactContact Name: Peter BelContact Email: p@humaniq.coContact Phone: +7 950 228 45 68Location: LuxembourgHumaniq is the source of this content.

China: As Xi Jinping praises free trade, critics of Mao lose their jobsCNN WireJanuary 18, 2017 Wednesday 8:29 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 719 wordsByline: By James Griffiths, CNNDateline: HONG KONG (CNN) BodyHONG KONG (CNN) --  In a speech in Davos Tuesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping treated his audience of world business leaders to a full-throated defense of globalization and free trade. It was a surprising move by the head of a party co-founded by Mao Zedong and which claims the "realization of communism is (its) highest ideal and ultimate goal." But as Xi positions the Chinese Communist Party as the flag bearer of liberal economics, back home critics of Mao are discovering the old ways are far from past. This month, state media has reported three high-profile incidents of people losing their jobs for criticizing Mao, as universities restrict discussion of the Party and school history textbooks are revised to emphasize the Communists' role in fighting Japan during World War II. Fired over 'devil' commentOn Monday, Zuo Chunhe, a senior city official in Shijiazhuang, capital of Hebei province near Beijing, was removed from his post and ordered to "deeply reflect on his mistakes" over comments he made on social media, according to Party mouthpiece People's Daily. Zuo called Mao a "devil" and described annual commemorations of the late leader's birthday on December 26 as "the world's largest cult activity." He also mocked ongoing government efforts to boycott Western ideas and culture. Zuo's dismissal comes after university professor Deng Xiangchao was forced to retire over similar criticisms of Mao. "The only thing he did right was die," Deng wrote on Weibo, pointing to the Great Leap Forward and other disastrous Mao policies that led to mass starvation and caused the deaths of millions of people. His account has since been deleted. Videos posted online showed a crowd of pro-Mao protesters who gathered outside the gates of Shandong Jianzhu University calling for Deng's dismissal and holding banners such as "whoever opposes Chairman Mao is an enemy of the people." In a statement, the university said Deng's "wrong" comments were a "severe problem and led to a bad public effect," according to the Global Times. TV producer Liu Yong, who worked for a regional station in the central province of Henan, was fired for posting messages backing Deng and criticizing Mao. Mao still divides opinion in China. His giant portrait hangs on Beijing's Tiananmen Gate, and thousands flock to see his embalmed body at his mausoleum in Tiananmen Square in the heart of the Chinese capital. But many families suffered during political movements like the Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forward.CensoredThe dismissals are indicative of a wider government move to tighten control over freedom of expression, said Human Rights Watch researcher Maya Wang. "It's an extension of a longstanding pathology of the Chinese government to control the narratives of the country both in the past and the future," she said. The recent cases come as the Party cracks down on what it terms "historical nihilism," any attempt to question the official version of history, said Amnesty International researcher William Nee.He pointed to a recent statement by China's top court that it was considering how to tackle the issue of people "infringing on the reputation of heroes and historical figures." The Ministry of Education announced this month that history textbooks will now emphasize the "14-year Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression," a move that critics say is designed to inflate the Communist Party's role in World War II. Most sources date the start of the conflict in China to Japan's full invasion of the country in July 1937. Earlier this month, Guangzhou's Sun Yat-sen University, one of the country's leading educational institutions, circulated a list of topics banned from class discussion, according to the South China Morning Post. These included "criticizing the constitution," "criticizing Chinese Communist Party leaders" and "spreading religion and superstition." The university did not respond to a request for comment. Previous tolerance of "pockets of discussion and greater liberty" within universities and other institutions is narrowing, Wang said. "At a time when the country is rapidly changing and facing a lot of challenges, the national discussion is being greatly limited." TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Liberal economics think tank latest to be silenced in ChinaAssociated Press InternationalJanuary 25, 2017 Wednesday 8:24 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 655 wordsByline: By GERRY SHIH, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Authorities in China have shuttered the website and social media accounts of a prominent economics think tank amid a mounting assault on liberal academic voices.The Unirule Institute of Economics in Beijing is the latest target of a government crackdown after the forced retirement of a professor who criticized Mao Zedong and sacking of a provincial official who called communist China's founder the "devil."Liberal intellectuals and Chinese political observers are growing alarmed by the government crackdown, which overlaps with the rise of an increasingly cohesive and confident movement both on China's internet and its streets dedicated to defending Mao's reputation and his hardline legacy. Since President Xi Jinping took power in 2012, reformist magazines and websites have been shut while university professors and even the country's judiciary have been warned against spreading liberal Western values.Mao Yushi, Unirule's founder who is not related to Mao Zedong, said Wednesday that representatives from the ruling Communist Party informed him last week that the website was shut down because it violated the law, but gave no details."It's a terrible thing, it existed for many years," Mao told The Associated Press. "I told (the officials) this is not the law, and they had no response because they won't answer these questions."The Beijing branch of the Cyberspace Administration of China said this week it closed 17 websites, including that of Unirule, as part of a cleanup of websites providing unauthorized news and pornography.Unirule and Mao Yushi are particularly reviled by China's increasingly vocal "leftists" who see their support of free-market economics as antithetical to Mao Zedong's revolutionary legacy and traditional Communist Party ideology. In recent weeks, Maoists have organized online campaigns and street demonstrations to target a succession of liberal academics, with the apparent support from Chinese authorities who typically break up most forms of unauthorized political activity.The party's nationalistic Global Times tabloid, which reported Wednesday on the phenomenon of the growing Maoist movement, opined in a separate piece this week that Mao Yushi's silencing should serve as a lesson."Liberals absolutely must learn this lesson: openly being an oppositional speaker or denier will get you nowhere in China," said the op-ed, which was later removed from the paper's website. "Taking ideas from the West, and trying to pass them off as genuine, will eventually hit a wall."Since 2010, Mao has been under an undeclared overseas travel ban, one of the Chinese government's frequently utilized methods of silencing and punishing its critics. He was prevented that year from going to Oslo to attend the ceremony awarding imprisoned Chinese dissident writer Liu Xiaobo the Nobel Peace Prize.Two years later, he was awarded the Milton Friedman Prize by the libertarian Cato Institute, but was again banned from traveling to Washington, D.C. to accept the award. Unirule's website was also temporarily taken down by authorities at the time.In recent years, Mao has openly questioned whether the Xi administration has reversed course on decades of Chinese economic reform in favor of companies and entire industries under state control. He has also warned about the revival of a militant neo-Maoist movement reminiscent of the political violence and extreme xenophobia of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when fanatical Mao loyalists targeted ideological opponents and neighbors and relatives turned against each other to survive.In June last year, the 88-year old economist detailed to The Associated Press the abuse he suffered during the Cultural Revolution, when a gang of young Mao loyalists lashed his father and him with copper-flecked whips.His public remarks and incessant blogging have attracted protesters to his public events and threats against his safety at home.Load-Date: January 26, 2017End of Document

As Tesla's Chinese Sales Boom, Tencent Could Be a Useful PartnerRealMoneyMarch 28, 2017 Tuesday 8:04 PM EDTCopyright 2017 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 664 wordsByline: Eric JhonsaHighlight: Tencent, which just took a 5% stake in Tesla, could use its very popular messaging platforms to promote the EV maker. And Tesla could integrate Tencent's services within its cars.BodySince Tencent has said little about its $1.8 billion investment in Tesla Motors   outside of a boilerplate statement praising Elon Musk's "vision, ambition, and execution," it's hard to presume much for now about what kind of alliance the Chinese messaging and gaming giant envisions having with Musk's company. But a look at the breadth of Tencent's empire, along with Tesla's ambitions within the Middle Kingdom, raises some interesting possibilities.In an  published on Tuesday morning, Tencent disclosed it has bought 8.2 million Tesla shares, which is good for a 5% stake. Tesla rose 2.7% following the news to $277.45, putting shares about $10 below their February 14 peak. They've now fully recovered the late-February losses seen in response to  and earnings call commentary.The investment seems to have been made via open-market purchases, and thus won't have a direct impact on Tesla's balance sheet. But it's still a nice vote of confidence for a company that just two weeks ago announced it's  in stock and convertible notes to help finance a giant production ramp for its relatively cheap Model 3 sedan. Tesla is aiming to start volume production for the Model 3, which is believed to have seen over 400,000 reservations, in September.Officially at least, Tesla still wants to produce 500,000 cars in 2018 and 1 million in 2019, up from just 83,922 in 2016. If it turns out that the company needs more cash to finance its ramp, Tencent, which had $12.2 billion in available-for-sale financial assets and $8.1 billion in term deposits at the end of 2016, could be a useful source.Like fellow Chinese Internet giant Alibaba  , which has made a  in non-Chinese firms, Tencent may be looking to park some of its cash overseas. It might also see a big investment in a U.S. company as a good way to win favor in Washington. However, it's worth noting that while Tencent's platforms are supported by many American brands and game publishers within China, the company is believed to derive little revenue from the U.S.On the other hand, Tencent and Tesla could certainly be of use to each other in China. The former's WeChat/Weixin mobile messaging, commerce and social media platform is all but ubiquitous within the country, and claimed 889 million monthly active users (MAUs) as of the end of 2016, up 28% annually. Tencent also operates the popular QQ (PC/mobile messaging) and Qzone (social networking) platforms, and its WeChat Pay service claims a duopoly in the Chinese mobile payments market with Alibaba/Ant Financial's Alipay.Tesla, meanwhile, saw its Chinese sales  to over $1 billion, or more than 15% of its total revenue. The company has 24 retail stores and 114 supercharger stations in the country, with more to come, and has benefited from the Chinese government's aggressive efforts to promote EV sales.Tencent could promote Tesla's lineup within WeChat and other apps, while perhaps using its data to target affluent Chinese consumers who might be in the market for a Model 3 or Model S. It could also work with Tesla on using WeChat as a way to engage with current and potential customers. Tesla, meanwhile, could integrate WeChat's messaging and payment services with its infotainment system, 17-inch touchscreen and all, within cars sold in China.Visa  , Honda  , General Motors   and others have already been experimenting with in-car payment solutions that can be used to pay for things like gas, parking and drive-thru orders. Tesla and Tencent could collaborate on something similar. In 2015, the latter            held talks with Ford   about a WeChat-related partnership, but no deal was announced. Around the same time,            BMW said it would pre-install WeChat in its cars on its own.For now, neither side has much to say about where an alliance between Tencent and Tesla could lead. Musk merely replied to this morning's disclosure with  stating he's "glad to have Tencent as an investor and advisor to Tesla." But Tencent could easily become more than just that.Load-Date: March 29, 2017End of Document

China president plans to strengthen anti-corruption campaignLegal Monitor WorldwideJanuary 7, 2017 SaturdayCopyright 2017 Legal Monitor Worldwide Provided by Syndigate Media Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 370 wordsBody(JURIST) - China`s President Xi Jinping declared on Friday that the nation`s battle against corruption "must go deeper," stressing the need for the Communist Party to be governed "systematically, creatively and efficiently." Upon becoming party chief in 2013, Xi had set in motion a broad campaign to root out corruption among high-level officials. Xi has since stated his intention to establish a system that fully monitors all members of the public sector. Instead of utilizing an independent anti-corruption body, the Communist Party has thus far implemented its own watchdog group, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI). While Xi has stated that the party is capable of policing itself, critics have highlighted the CCDI`s need for external supervision. The CCDI recently acknowledged such criticisms and declared plans to create a stronger checks and balances system amongst its discipline officers. The CCDI`s plenary meeting, which began on Friday, will continue for two more days and allow the Communist Party to further address such issues.Following Xi`s promise to root out corruption, numerous officials, such as Zhou Yongkang, the former head of China`s domestic security services,and Ling Jihua, a senior aide to former President Hu Jinato, have received life sentences for their corruption charges. Thus far, Yongkang was the most senior official to be convicted of corruption charges in the history of China`s Communist regime. Last month, the Chinese government announced that it will prosecute Ma Jian, a former vice minister of China`s Ministry of State Security, on bribery charges. China`s Communist party exerts a strong influence over its courts systems, making it likely that Jian and all other officials that may face prosecution in the future will be convicted. Earlier last month, the Chinese government also arrested Iat Hong and Chin Hung of Macau, and Bo Zheng of China on cybersecurity allegations. In October 2015, Chinese authorities arrested individual hackers that allegedly misappropriated commercial secrets from US firms with the intention to sell proprietary information to state-owned entires within the the People`s Republic of China. 2016 Legal Monitor Worldwide.Load-Date: January 7, 2017End of Document

All Rights ReservedLength: 304 wordsBody(JURIST) - A Chinese court on Thursday sentenced Liao Yongyuan, the former general manager of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), to 15 years for graft, finding corruption based on accepting bribes and holding large amounts of property with no identified source. The court also fined Liao 1.5 million yuan, approximately USD $220,000. Through various positions at the company over the years, Liao admitted to securing promotions for certain individuals and accepting bribes. The court acted leniently based on this admission as well as Liao`s willingness to turn over proceeds from the actions.Earlier this month China`s President Xi Jinping declared that the nation`s battle against corruption "must go deeper," stressing the need for the Communist Party to be governed "systematically, creatively and efficiently."

Bitcoin exchanges halt withdrawal after China issues warningThe Ticker: Baruch CollegeFebruary 20, 2017 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 1Length: 727 wordsBodyChina, which accounts for over 90 percent of global bitcoin transactions, warned several exchanges of closure amid rising risks.For years, bitcoin has attracted a huge market base in China, which churns out over 90 percent of trade within the global bitcoin market.Following the meeting, the price of bitcoin fell drastically, despite the fact that bitcoin profits had peaked last month. The price of bitcoin fell by more than $250 a few hours after the discussion.The central bank expressed dissatisfaction at the potential of margin lending or money laundering occurring within bitcoin markets, according to CNBC.com. Adam White, the sitting vice president of Coinbase, predicted that the warning from the PBOC will set some regulatory precedents and create legitimacy within the global bitcoin operation, pushing bitcoin into the mainstream. Bitcoin will be seen as a more legitimate means of currency in China, according to White.White attributed China's flourishing bitcoin activity in the markets to its lack of fees for trading."We see China doing on average greater than 90 percent of the daily trading volume, and that's primarily because [of] the way the Chinese exchanges are structured. Customers tend to move money into a Chinese digital currency exchange and they trade many times over and over because there's no friction applied." Other exchanges throughout the world charge for friction, which helps to normalize the trading volumes.Back in 2013, the PBOC advised financial institutions to steer clear of bitcoins, which led to the price of bitcoin falling by $300. It is speculated that the price fell so drastically because the warning sent a fear that the Chinese government would try to intervene in bitcoin operations.Later that year, the PBOC released a statement that clarified that, while it did not believe that bitcoin itself was a threat, the PBOC believed that bitcoin created some consumer risk that should be brought to light. The dangers, as indicated by the PBOC, primarily revolved around the constant risk of money laundering. Virtual money is also difficult to regulate by government standards and can create global economic leaks in international trading systems.Despite all of the difficulties that came to light during the major declaration against bitcoin in 2013, the virtual currency was not outlawed in China. The new agreement stated that companies merely had to register with authorities in order to use bitcoin as currency.This issue is back in focus in China because the PBOC has a similar goal: to warn citizens that bitcoin is a virtual good and has no legal tender status, which may significantly alter the decision to get involved on the part of the consumer.To resolve the issue in 2013, the PBOC instructed financial institutions to prohibit and disclose anonymity in relation to bitcoin transactions. All exchanges must be accompanied by several documents of identification from customers and any suspicious activity, such as particularly large transactions, should be reported to the proper authorities. These parameters were set by the PBOC to better secure the market against money laundering.According to CoinDesk.com, "Although the total value of bitcoins in circulation is dwarfed by national currencies, Chinese authorities seem to be taking the issue very seriously. Many Chinese citizens are investing their savings in bitcoin and some even argue they are basically hoarding the currency. This also represents a risk in terms of price fluctuations, as many speculators have no qualms with leaving the market at the first sign of trouble."Bitcoin usage highlights several risks associated with digital currency, such as the potential for hackers, criminals and launderers to gather. Additionally, since digital currency often goes unregulated by a greater institution, the floor has the potential to be threatened by illegal trading sites and scams.Representatives from Huobi and OKCoin did not yet respond publicly to the news of the potential closure issued in the meeting. However, BTCC representatives agreed to work closely with officials from the PBOC in order to adhere to the currency regulations in China.BTCC representatives also took time to admonish the public about the dangers associated with digital currency, but indicated that the bitcoin exchange would like to minimize those dangers.Load-Date: February 20, 2017End of Document

But since then, its price has plunged more than 30% to around $760 after Chinese authorities stepped up scrutiny of bitcoin exchanges in the country, where the vast majority of bitcoin trading takes place."When China sneezes, bitcoin catches a cold," said Charles Hayter, CEO of digital currency comparison website CryptoCompare. The latest drop was set off by news of spot checks from Chinese regulators on local bitcoin exchanges. "The market has gone from being led up by the Chinese to dragged down by panic," Hayter said.Finance officials inspected exchanges in Shanghai and Beijing on Wednesday to check whether they were sticking to anti-money laundering rules and other regulations, according to statements from the Chinese central bank."The fear is that the [central bank] will impose strict or unreasonable regulatory demands on Chinese bitcoin exchanges," said Petar Zivkovski, COO of bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub.One of the Chinese exchanges, BTCC, issued a statement seeking to reassure customers."All operations at BTCC are normal and we continue to actively work with regulators to ensure that we remain compliant," it said, adding that it expects additional meetings with officials later this week.The visits followed a public warning from the Chinese central bank last week urging people to "invest rationally" when it comes to the digital currency. China appears to be putting the bitcoin exchanges on notice, analysts say. It's "clearly a segment of the market that regulators are getting increasingly concerned about and likely will regulate," said Zennon Kapron, the founder of financial market research firm Kapronasia in Shanghai. For Chinese investors, bitcoin can be a way to bypass rules limiting how much foreign currency individuals can buy each year, as well as a hedge against the sinking yuan.That's a worry for the Chinese government, which spent hundreds of billions of dollars last year trying to prop up its currency as huge sums of money poured out of the country.Chinese regulators could clamp down on bitcoin by classifying it as a foreign currency, which would effectively limit individual bitcoin transactions to $50,000 per year, said Kapron, author of the book "Chomping at the Bitcoin". Bitcoin is preferred by some people for its perceived anonymity, and it has also been used for illegal purchases of drugs and other products.-- Serenitie Wang contributed to this report.TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The announcement came weeks after Apple removed apps by The New York Times from its app store in China in response to a government request.To get around the government's filters, numerous foreign and domestic companies in China use VPNs to conduct business, and private citizens often use the technology to access banned foreign websites such as Google, Facebook and overseas news outlets.In response, China has blocked access to VPNs and regularly disrupts their channels.Wu Xiaodong, director of the China Digital Information and Security Industrial Alliance, said VPN services have previously been targeted by Chinese regulators but never with this degree of clarity.Under the new directive, all internet service providers, data centers and content distribution networks must be licensed with the government. They must also conduct "self-inspections" for any unlawful activity taking place on their servers, which would include those discreetly providing VPN services.A co-founder of U.S.-supported anti-censorship group Greatfire.org who goes by the pseudonym Charlie Smith said it was unclear whether the internet services industry would comply with government orders to fully snuff out VPNs."They will push back, quietly ... if they deem the cost of running these checks to be too high," said Smith, whose group helps internet users inside China bypass blockages on censored content.

Stock regulator: China plans to 'capture' suspects abroadAssociated Press InternationalFebruary 10, 2017 Friday 10:55 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 526 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - China plans to have people abroad who are accused of financial market misconduct "captured and returned," the country's stock regulator said in comments reported Friday by news outlets.The reports follow the disappearance from Hong Kong of a Chinese-born Canadian founder of an investment company and arrests of leading securities industry figures following the collapse of a stock market boom.The chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission said at a staff meeting Friday that "capital crocodiles" would be stopped from hurting investors, according to the business magazine Caixin and news websites."The capital market doesn't allow 'big crocodiles' to do whatever they want, stripping the flesh and drinking the blood of retail investors," the reports said, citing the regulator, Liu Shiyu. He was cited as saying Bejiing "will have 'capital crocodiles' captured and returned in a planned way."The reports did not indicate whether Liu meant Beijing might send its own representatives after fugitives or ask other governments to detain and repatriate them.An official of the securities agency's press office, Zhou Qian, confirmed the agency held a staff meeting Friday but would not confirm whether Liu made the comments.Beijing already is in the midst of a worldwide effort to catch and repatriate Chinese government officials, business figures and others accused of corruption and financial misconduct.The latest reports follow the disappearance of Xiao Jianhua, the billionaire founder of investment group Tomorrow Holding, from Hong Kong on Jan. 27.Chinese authorities have not confirmed reports mainland police took Xiao from his hotel. Hong Kong is Chinese territory but has its own legal system and mainland police are supposed to ask its government's permission to detain a suspect.A family member reported Xiao missing but withdrew the report a day later after hearing he was safe, Hong Kong police say. Messages posted in his name on his company's social media account said he is undergoing medical treatment and would return soon. A Hong Kong newspaper ad carried the same message.Authorities launched investigations of China's securities industry in 2015 after a stock market boom collapsed, inflicting heavy losses on small investors.A week before Xiao's disappearance, one of China's most prominent stock traders, Xu Xiang, was sentenced Jan. 23 to 5½ years in prison on charges of manipulating stock prices.Also, the general manager of China's biggest brokerage, state-owned Citic Securities Ltd., and two other executives were arrested on insider trading charges last April. Two other brokerages have said they were under investigation, but no arrests were reported.China's market benchmark soared more than 150 percent beginning in late 2014 after the state press said stocks were cheap. Prices peaked in June, 2015, and then collapsed, with the main market index falling 30 percent in a few weeks.The police ministry accused securities firms in July, 2015, of manipulating prices but released no details at that time. That prompted suggestions the ruling Communist Party was trying to deflect blame for the collapse.Load-Date: February 11, 2017End of Document

Analyst discusses cyber warfareThe Dartmouth: Dartmouth CollegeFebruary 3, 2017 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 584 wordsByline: Tatiana CookeBodyCyber warfare is increasingly important in international relations, Thomas said. He explained that a large scale attack on U.S. infrastructure has the potential to affect everything from the country's banking system to its military operations.Thomas compared his work with cyber warfare to his previous work monitoring Russian intelligence in the Soviet Army Studies Office of the Army during the Cold War. Western countries did not know what actions the Soviet Union would take at that point, he said, just as current military strategists are unaware what to expect with regards to cyber warfare.It is difficult for governments to trace the source of a cyber security breach because attackers can route information through servers in several countries, Thomas said. Even when the country of origin is known, as with many attacks originating from China, it is impossible to determine whether the attacker was acting independently or in service of the country's government.This "plausible deniability" makes it difficult for governments to take action against other governments suspected in cyber attacks, Thomas said. He cited several recent examples in which cyber attacks that may have been government-sponsored were blamed on individual hackers.Hackers located in China have launched cyber attacks against England, Australia, Germany, Canada, South Korea, Japan and the United States in the past decade, Thomas said. Given the wide range of these attacks, Thomas questioned whether the attacks were coincidental or constituted a set of probes by the Chinese government.None of these attacks have been directly linked to the Chinese government, he said. Many have been perpetrated by "patriot hackers," individuals acting independently of the Chinese government to promote what they believe to be China's interests, he said.Thomas, who researches Chinese thought about new technological warfare methods, said that Chinese strategy is focused on looking at objective conditions and trying to manipulate them. Strategies are often designed to mislead enemy perception and focus on the idea of control, he added."This is a much greater expansion of the concept of strategy than anything you'll see in this country," Thomas said. "The whole point of strategy is to make you do something you don't even realize you're doing. The Chinese have a saying: 'The only thing scarier than inferior technology is inferior thinking.'"Thomas said the United States should emulate the Chinese model of combining technology with new strategies."They're doing some very interesting things we should be learning from," he said.Thomas detailed the collision of American and Chinese military planes that led to the death of a Chinese pilot on April 1, 2001. The EP-3 incident was greeted by uproar in China, particularly directed against the United States. Civilian hackers in China began to attack U.S. web sites, causing American hackers to retaliate, Thomas said."You can see how this whole cyber issue with non-state actors can really take you to a place you don't want to be," he said.A year after the EP-3 collision, individual civilians began planning a large-scale attack, but stopped their plans after a receiving a warning from the Communist Party, Thomas said."The control mechanisms seem to be there from above," he said, referring to the government's ability to prevent the hackers from implementing their plan.Thomas recently published "Fighting the Virtual Dragon," a compilation of five Chinese books on strategy.Load-Date: February 3, 2017End of Document

Assessment of China's Market for Commercial Service Robots 2016-2021: 2016's Revenue up 47% from year PreviousGlobeNewswireMarch 28, 2017 Tuesday 7:03 AM PTCopyright 2017 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: RESEARCH ANALYSIS AND REPORTSLength: 942 wordsBodyDublin, March  28, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --      Research and Markets   has announced the addition of the         "Assessment of China's Market for Commercial Service Robots"   report to their offering.                       The study finds that the market has ballooned to RMB 15 Bn by the end of  2016 and will continue to grow in size and reach at least RMB 38 Bn in  2021. The report features an in-depth analysis of the Chinese Commercial Service Robot market and its selected market segments (Domestic (Cleaning) Robots, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), AGV, Education Service Robots, Medical Robots, Public Relations Robots, Personal Transportation Robots).  Earlier in April 2016, the Chinese government published an interim (2016-2020) development plan for the broader Made in China 2025' initiative. In this plan, the government listed that one of the milestones would be to grow the Chinese commercial service robots market to a size of over RMB 30 Bn by 2020. This report will show that this target is well within reach; barring any unforeseen circumstances.  Service robots are currently used in China by many industries, including private and enterprise ones for a wide range of applications. These robots are not just being deployed to perform the dull, dangerous and dirty jobs. Going forward, we expect strong demand from both private and enterprise end-users. These robots are slated to replace some of the loss in working population that China is going to experience as a result of demographic changes. We should see a more widespread use of service robots even in fields like healthcare, where it is traditionally thought of as having lower capacity for automation.  The report provides an in-depth analysis on the production, sales, distribution and applications of seven distinct service robots product segments in the Chinese market. This study finds that the market is currently dominated by domestic suppliers but many are congregating at the lower end of the value chain as most still lack the core competencies in component technology. Foreign suppliers have better market position in the cleaning robots, AGV and education service robots segments.   This market study draws on a three month in-depth primary survey of 76 of the market's suppliers, channel players and key customers. It is essential reading for any professional needing accurate and detailed strategic information of this market. Major areas covered include: market size and shares, five-year projections, market structure, pricing trends, distribution, an assessment of key suppliers and more.

Social gaming experts discuss future growthThe Dartmouth: Dartmouth CollegeFebruary 2, 2017 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 672 wordsByline: Casey AylwardBodyApproximately 50 million monthly gamers generate annual revenues of over a billion dollars for the industry, according to Tuck professor and panel moderator Eric Johnson. The social gaming industry is projected to expand 30 percent this year and social gaming companies will need to find ways to convert such growth into increasing profits, according to Johnson, who serves as director of Tuck's Glassmeyer/McNamee Center for Digital Strategies, which hosted the event.Panelist Chris Mahl, senior vice president and chief brand alchemist for SCVNGR, a gaming company that operates as a "location-based social platform," spoke about his experiences adapting the company to the evolving industry. The key to SCVNGR games is that they bring the gamer into the real world and change the way gamers interact with different locations and other players, Mahl said.Gamers can travel to various locations, ranging from parks to local restaurants, to complete interactive challenges, according to SCVNGR's website. Users win virtual reward points that translate into real-life rewards like free food or other prizes.Gamers' ability to win real-world goods helps build brand loyalty, according to Mahl.The demographics of social gaming are quickly changing, according to Steve Cassavant Tu'05, vice president of strategy and business development at IGN Entertainment. Although adolescent males were traditionally the main social gaming consumers, the consumer base has broadened to include new demographic groups, he said."The soccer moms are doing these micro-transactions and the ease of doing it is expanding the base of who is doing it, but the amount they're paying has sharply dropped," Cassavant said. "They are disproportionately contributing to the people who are paying for these micro-transactions, so monetization will be less about engaging the audience to play but finding a platform to make them pay for it."Users currently often take advantage of free or low-cost applications, according to Cassavant. In the future, companies will try to convert such users into customers willing to pay for more frequent upgrades, he said.Panelist Teemu Huuhtanen, executive vice president of business development and communications for Sulake, Inc.'s North American branch, discussed his work on a program called Habbo an online social networking and virtual world community for teens via video conference.Habbo has recently increased its marketing outreach efforts to encourage users to pay for more frequent updates, Huuhtanen said. In 2007, for example, Habbo sent program updates to users only a few times a year. The program currently analyzes player feedback and usage to provide daily updates on its website. Companies must adapt to the constantly morphing nature of the gaming industry in order to maintain consumer loyalty, Huuhtanen said.Huuhtanen also discussed the complications that accompany international expansion by comparing Habbo's success in South American markets with its shortcomings in Asian markets."South American markets and a couple of markets in Turkey which is the number four market in gaming in revenue in Europe monetize very well," he said. "They have large populations and now these people are getting their first broadband connections."Although Habbo established a short-lived joint-venture with the Chinese government, the Chinese market proved "too complex and hard" after government officials were unable to follow through with their end of the agreement, Huuhtanen said."What you have on paper doesn't mean anything because [the Chinese government] will change the agreement," he said. "Let's say you do well in China good luck getting your money out of it because not even Google can make it."To cement consumer loyalty, Mahl said he expects companies to launch large-scale campaigns that market their games as "broad commercial exercises." Allowing users to construct their own games and their own challenges would allow brands to connect with the consumer in an almost "unimaginable" way, Mahl said.Load-Date: February 2, 2017End of Document

VIETNAMESE POLICE HARASS, DETAIN CITIZENS AT CEREMONY OBSERVING SOUTH CHINA SEA SKIRMISHStates News ServiceMarch 10, 2017 FridayCopyright 2017 States News ServiceLength: 639 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Plainclothes police in a port city in south Vietnam on Friday harassed and detained three people who attended a ceremony commemorating a 1988 Sino-Vietnam skirmish in the disputed Spratly Islands of the South China Sea, those arrested and other attendees said.About 50 plainclothes and uniformed policemen arrived at the site 15 minutes into the ceremony in Vung Tau, capital Ba Ra»ia-Vung Tau Province. They collected wreaths of flowers which attendees floated in the water at a beach, and detained three peoplefreelance journalist Suong Quynh, Facebook blogger Tam Ke, and Le Cong Vinh."After the ceremony began, I saw many plainclothes police who tried to disrupt the ceremony," Suong Quynh told RFA's Vietnamese Service after she was released Friday evening local time."They called one another on their mobile phones and treated us like criminals," she said. "I used my phone to record the scene when they arrested Tam Ke.""When they saw that, they took me away," she said. "They interrogated me, but got no result. They then threw my phone into water and ruined it."Le Cong Vinh told RFA that police tried to force him to sign a paper, but he refused.They then punched him twice in the face, and released him at 1 p.m., he said.Kim Chi, another attendee, told RFA that the government should have organized the ceremony."But they did not do it," he said. "Moreover they tried to stop us. ... The blood shed by martyrs is not water."The Spratly Islands, which Vietnam calls Truong Sa and China calls Nansha, are a group of islets, cays, and reefs that form an archipelago in the South China Sea that lies off the costs of southern Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia.The countries have jockeyed with China for control of the islands, which are located amid strategic shipping lanes and abundant fishing grounds, and may contain oil and natural gas reserves under the seabed.Johnson South Reef skirmishOn March 14, 1988, the Vietnamese and Chinese navies engaged in a deadly skirmish near Johnson South Reef, called Gac Ma in Vietnamese, during which dozens of Vietnamese soldiers were killed and two Vietnamese ships were sunk.After the battle, China gained control of Johnson South Reef, despite ongoing claims by Vietnam and other countries in the region that the reef is part of their territory.Tensions between the two communist countries hit another high point in 2014 when China placed an oil rig in disputed waters, prompting protests across Vietnam.Chinese forces have also built a 3,000-meter aircraft runway on Fiery Cross Reef in the Spratly Islands to "maintain the safety of navigation" in the region and have attacked and chased away Vietnamese fishing boats, as they continue to assert their power in the South China Sea.Vietnam applauded a ruling by an international arbitration tribunal in July 2016 that said China had no right to resources within the nine-dash demarcation line that the Chinese government uses to mark its territorial claims in the South China Sea.The tribunal also ruled that China could not claim a 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone around reefs and atolls in the Spratly and Paracel Islands, which Vietnam also claims.China seized the Paracel Islands, which it still holds, in a skirmish with Vietnamese forces in 1974 that left 75 Vietnamese soldiers dead.Vietnam continues to assert its sovereignty over the Spratly Islands, though China has dismissed the ruling by the international arbitration tribunal and continues its military buildup in the South China Sea.Vietnamese police routinely break up anti-China protests marking the anniversaries of the takeovers of the Spratly and Paracel islands and detain demonstrators.Reported by RFA's Vietnamese Service.

Liberal think tank is latest to be silenced in ChinaAssociated Press InternationalJanuary 25, 2017 Wednesday 5:43 AM GMTCopyright 2017 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 572 wordsByline: By GERRY SHIH, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Authorities in China have shuttered the website and social media accounts of a prominent economics think tank amid a mounting assault on liberal academic voices.The Unirule Institute of Economics in Beijing has become the latest target of a government crackdown after the forced retirement of a professor who criticized Mao Zedong and sacking of a provincial official who called communist China's founder the "devil."Liberal intellectuals and Chinese political observers have grown increasingly alarmed by the government crackdown, which overlaps with the rise of an increasingly cohesive and confident movement both online and on China's streets dedicated to defending Mao's reputation and his hardline policies. Since President Xi Jinping took power in 2012, reformist magazines and websites have been shut while university professors and even the country's judiciary have been warned against spreading liberal Western values.Mao Yushi, Unirule's founder who is not related to Mao Zedong, said Wednesday that representatives from the ruling Communist Party informed him last week that the website was shut down because it violated the law, but gave no details."It's a terrible thing, it existed for many years," Mao told The Associated Press. "I told (the officials) this is not the law, and they had no response because they won't answer these questions."Unirule and Mao Yushi are particularly reviled by China's increasingly vocal "leftists" who see their support of free-market economics as antithetical to Mao Zedong's revolutionary legacy and traditional Communist Party ideology. In recent weeks, Maoists have organized online campaigns and street demonstrations to target a succession of liberal academics, with the apparent support from Chinese authorities who typically break up most forms of unauthorized political activity.The party's nationalistic Global Times tabloid, which reported Wednesday on the phenomenon of the growing Maoist movement, opined in a separate piece this week that Mao Yushi's silencing should serve as a lesson."Liberals absolutely must learn this lesson: openly being an oppositional speaker or denier will get you nowhere in China," said the op-ed, which was later removed. "Taking ideas from the West, and trying to pass them off as genuine, will eventually hit a wall."Mao Yushi was awarded the Milton Friedman Prize by the libertarian Cato Institute in 2012 but was banned from traveling to Washington, D.C., to accept the award. The Chinese government frequently uses travel restrictions as a method of silencing or punishing its critics.In recent years, Mao has openly questioned whether the Xi administration has reversed course on decades of Chinese economic reform in favor of companies and entire industries under state control. He has also warned about the revival of a militant neo-Maoist movement reminiscent of the political violence and extreme xenophobia of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when fanatical Mao loyalists targeted ideological opponents and neighbors and relatives turned against each other to survive.In June last year, the 88-year old economist detailed to The Associated Press the abuse he suffered during the Cultural Revolution, when a gang of young Mao loyalists lashed his father and him with copper-flecked whips.His public remarks and incessant blogging have attracted protesters to his public events and threats against his safety at home.Load-Date: January 26, 2017End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 31 of 352Global Eagle Receives vSTC for Airconnect Global Satellite Connectivity System on Boeing 737NG Aircraft in China; Chinese Government provides GEE with first app....  Page 49 of 352FOREIGN AFFAIRS  Page 52 of 352China enlists an unlikely ally in battling pollution: public activists; The Chinese government is cautiously embracing public activism - through social media an....  Page 54 of 352CHINESE AMBASSADOR TO GHANA H.E.
