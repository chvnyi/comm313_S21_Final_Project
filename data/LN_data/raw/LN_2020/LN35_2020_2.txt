PBS Pulls Film Linked To Chinese Foreign Agent Over Editorial Concerns In Response To DCNF ReportThe Daily CallerMay 28, 2020 Thursday 06:15 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: DAILY-CALLER-NEWS-FOUNDATION; usLength: 898 wordsByline: Chuck Ross, Investigative Reporter, chuck@dailycaller.comChuck Ross is a reporter at The Daily Caller.Author ImageBodyLink to Image• PBS pulled a documentary produced with a foreign agent of the Chinese government over concerns that it failed to meet the outlet's editorial standards.• A PBS affiliate that aired the film is also conducting an internal review into the funding behind the documentary, which aired twice in California earlier in May. • The review is a response to a report from the Daily Caller News Foundation. PBS pulled a documentary produced in association with a Chinese foreign agent over concerns that it did not meet the federally-funded media outlet's editorial standards.PBS SoCal, a PBS affiliate that co-produced the film “Voices from the Frontline: China's War on Poverty,” is also conducting an internal review of the funding for the documentary, the organization said in a statement.PBS made the decision in response to the Daily Caller News Foundation's May 14report  that the film was produced in association with CGTN, a Chinese media company. The U.S. Department of Justice requires CGTN to register as a foreign agent of China.Robert Lawrence Kuhn, a businessman who touts ties to the Chinese government and CGTN, was the lead producer of the film, which aired earlier in May on PBS SoCal and its sister station, KCET.The two stations received more than $5.5 million in federal funds in 2019 through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Tax filings show that Kuhn's charity, The Kuhn Foundation, donated $70,000 to PBS SoCal between 2015 and 2018. (RELATED: PBS Stations That Received Millions In Federal Funds Partnered With Chinese Foreign Agent On Pro-Beijing Film)PBS notified PBS SoCal, which is also known as KOCE, on May 20 about concerns with the funding behind the film.“The specific concern they had was around the funding and the funding relationship,” PBS SoCal CEO Andrew Russell said in a statement, adding that PBS headquarters said that “they did not find concerns in other areas of editorial integrity.”PBS SoCal said that the documentary passed its editorial standards and adhered to FCC guidelines before its initial airing on May 11.But after PBS headquarters examined the film, the outlet determined that it “did not meet PBS corporate guidelines,” PBS SoCal said in a statement.“Thus, PBS decided to pull the show from its streaming services on the PBS App and PBS passport.”“Our organization is planning to reassess the film as a result of these decisions made earlier this week, analyzing the content and the production further to validate our original decision to air the documentary,” the affiliate said.PBS SoCal and KCET will not air the film while it is under review, though other affiliates who previously planned to air the documentary will be permitted to do so.Current.org, a media trade publication, first reported that PBS was reviewing the documentary.Link to ImageChinese President Xi Jinping proposes a toast during the welcome banquet for leaders attending the Belt and Road Forum at the Great Hall of the People on April 26, 2019 in Beijing, China. (Photo by Nicolas Asfouri - Pool/Getty Images)The documentary tracks five Chinese families that received help through a program that Chinese President Xi Jinping initiated in 2013 to eradicate extreme poverty by 2020.The film aired on PBS SoCal in 2019, but received little attention at the time. But the Chinese government's activities in the media have received heightened scrutiny as Beijing has ramped up its propaganda efforts in response to the coronavirus pandemic.Chinese government officials and propaganda outlets have sought to displace blame for the pandemic, which originated in Wuhan late in 2019.Kuhn has been a staunch defender of Beijing's response to the pandemic.“China's mobilization is unprecedented in global health history. Nowhere could it work like it works in China. The reason it works is because the party works, the Communist Party of China,” Kuhn said during an episode of his show “The Watcher,” which airs on CGTN.“President Xi Jinping calls for fighting the outbreak in an open and transparent manner. That's the key: transparency, complete transparency. As China has done and is updating all confirmed patients and updating all the data everyday.”Kuhn has been a frequent guest on Chinese media outlets controlled by the government. He has also openly touted his ties to top Chinese government officials, including in the State Council Information Office, which is responsible for publishing foreign propaganda.Kuhn has also touted his China Reform Friendship Medal, the highest honor bestowed on foreigners. He received the award in 2018 at an event that Xi hosted.Kuhn defended his film in a statement to Current, saying it was a “shame” that PBS has pulled the documentary due to what he said were “extraneous internal political matters in the United States.”He also asserted that conservative media outlets unfairly targeted the film. Fox News published a story based on the DCNF's report about the documentary.Kuhn, PBS and PBS SoCal did not respond to multiple requests for comment before the DCNF published its story earlier in May.PBS did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

ON FOX BUSINESS, PORTMAN HIGHLIGHTS UPCOMING BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION TO HELP END CHINA'S THEFT OF US TAXPAYER-FUNDED RESEARCHStates News ServiceMay 14, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 746 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Ohio Senator Rob Portman:In an interview with Fox Business' Varney and Company today, Senator Portman highlighted the bipartisan legislation he plans to introduce soon to help stop foreign governments, particularly China, from stealing U.S. taxpayer-funded research and intellectual property (IP). Portman, as Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), led a yearlong investigation culminating in a bipartisan report in November 2019 that detailed how American taxpayers have been unwittingly funding the rise of China's military and economy over the last two decades while federal agencies have done little to stop it. Starting in the late 1990s through its "talent recruitment programs," China began recruiting U.S.-based scientists and researchers and incentivizing them to transfer U.S. taxpayer-funded research and IP to China for their own military and economic gain. Recently, the Department of Justice announced the arrests of two academics affiliated with American universities for allegedly concealing their participation in China's talent recruitment programs while accepting American taxpayer-funded grant funding. This must stop. Portman will soon introduce bipartisan legislation to protect American research and IP from global competitors.Excerpts of his interview can be found below and a video can be found here.PORTMAN ON HIS BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION TO STOP CHINA FROM STEALING U.S. TAXPAYER-FUNDED RESEARCH AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY:"Well, Stuart, it shouldn't surprise any of us because for two decades they have been doing exactly that, not just through hacking, but even prior to, you know, the hackers being able to do this, they have been coming to our country and taking our research for military, science, medical purposes. It's helped fuel their economic rise and helped fuel the increase in their military strength. We had reports, as you know, at the end of last year, you had me on talking about it, where we were able to show that through their what they call their Thousand Talents Program, they were targeting professors and scientists here in this country, getting their good stuff. We just had another case of it this week, an Arkansas professor who was arrested by the FBI. He was arrested because, you know, he wasn't telling the truth, but there needs to be tougher laws there. One thing we are doing is putting a new law in place to make it illegal to hide your contacts with the Chinese government. Remember the Harvard professor a couple months ago, same thing. He was getting paid $150,000 in living expenses, $50,000 a month, $1.5 million for a lab in China and they were taking his research. The research was paid for by U.S. taxpayers, $150 billion a year. So the accountability needs to be there, but frankly, Stuart, I think it needs to start with us. We need to better protect ourselves and that's what our legislation will do at every level."PORTMAN ON HOLDING THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY ACCOUNTABLE FOR STEALING U.S. TAXPAYER FUNDED RESEARCH:"Well, there may be some of that, but this is not about the Chinese people or the Chinese students. It's about the Chinese Communist Party. And if they are, in fact, coming to our country and stealing our research, again, the Communist Party is the one in charge of all this, remember, then that has to stop. But it should not be something that we then blame the Chinese people for, or even Chinese students that are coming over here for the purpose of learning and contributing to our economy, because many of them do, as you know. So it's a balance. We have to be careful about it. But we can't let this continue to go on. I mean, it's outrageous and it is causing us to fall behind both economically and militarily because they can effectively leapfrog us by getting our taxpayer paid research and using it before we do."PORTMAN ON BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR THE SAFEGUARDING AMERICAN INNOVATION ACT"Senator Carper and I are introducing the legislation together. Senator Carper is the ranking member of our investigative Subcommittee that's spent a year looking at this. We came out with a hard-hitting but very thoughtful report at the end of last year. We tried to keep this bipartisan and it should be, because we want to actually get something done here. And there's no reason that we as Republicans and Democrats shouldn't be able to agree on this issue of protecting research that's paid for by U.S. tax dollars."###Load-Date: May 14, 2020End of Document

Opinion | How China's fake news machine is rewriting the history of Covid-19, even as the pandemic unfoldsPolitico.comApril 4, 2020 Saturday 11:16 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 3430 wordsHighlight: Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson's retweet of an article blaming the U.S. for infecting Wuhan with coronavirus went viral, viewed 160 million times within hours. But where did the story come from?BodyThis opinion article is being published by POLITICO as part of a content partnership with the South China Morning Post. It originally appeared on scmp.com on April 4, 2020.By now, the early history of Covid-19 is well known, if not clear in its details. The virus was first detected somewhere around Wuhan, in Hubei province, then appears to have entered the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, from where it infected many others. Doctors in Wuhan first noticed the novel coronavirus in December and began exchanging urgent warnings. Local government authorities set out to silence them; some were detained and made to sign documents admitting wrongdoing.Meanwhile, Wuhan officials went about business as usual, which included a disastrous Lunar New Year banquet attended by about 40,000 families. Soon, many more thousands around Wuhan were infected, with hundreds dead or dying, including ophthalmologist Li Wenliang, who had been punished for trying to raise the alarm.Realizing it was in the firing line not just for running the nation that had unleashed the deadly virus on the world but also for ignoring, covering up and denying its spread, China's Communist Party moved into damage-control mode. This included suggesting it was the United States that was responsible for the virus.Chinese state media regularly tweet propaganda and what many describe as "fake news". Global Times has 1.7 million followers on Twitter; China Xinhua News, 12.6 million; People's Daily, 7.1 million; China Daily, 4.3 million; and China Global Television Network (CGTN), 14 million.Zhao Lijian, spokesman and deputy director general of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' information department, had 287,000 followers when he tweeted a link to a conspi­racy website alleging the U.S. was responsible for the virus. (Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying had 146,700 followers; the ministry's "spokesperson" account, used by Geng Shuang, had 61,000; and Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of Global Times, had 175,000.)With the outbreak of an epidemic, one of the first jobs of scientists and doctors, even while they fight to save lives, is to identify its source. This is critical in the search for medicines to combat a virus and a vaccine to prevent its spread.On January 24, an article written jointly by 29 Chinese medical doctors and scientists was published in The Lancet, one of the world's leading medical journals. The authors shared their findings from a study of patients who were suspected of having been infected with 2019-nCoV and had been admitted to a Wuhan hospital. The report said that by January 2, 41 of them had been "laboratory-confirmed" as infected with the virus - which causes Covid-19 - and two-thirds of those infected "had been exposed to the Huanan market".The findings appeared to support anecdotal evidence that the source of the virus was the market, which had been closed by city officials on January 1. This had been often repeated by Chinese authorities and reported widely in the global media. The Lancet article gave scientific currency to this narrative.Then, on February 19, another study - this time published on ChinaXiv.org, an open repository and distribution website used by scientific researchers - suggested the market was likely not ground zero for the virus, but rather that it had been "imported"from outside.The study was by a team of scientists from several institutions: Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden of Chinese Academy of Sciences; South China Agricultural University; and the Chinese Institute for Brain Research. It was revised on February 21. Neither version of the study suggested Covid-19 had originated outside China.But the fake news machine was about to go to work.On February 23, the People's Daily's English-language site reprinted a February 22 Global Times article titled, "Japanese TV report sparks speculations in China that Covid-19 may have originated in US". The original Global Times article, which is no longer available online, began: "A report from a Japanese TV station that suspected some of the 14,000 Americans died of influenza may have unknowningly [sic] contracted the coronavirus has gone viral on Chinese social media, stoking fears and speculations in China that the novel coronavirus may have originated in the U.S."The report, by TV Asahi Corporation of Japan, suggested that the US government may have failed to grasp how rampant the virus have gone [sic] on the US soil."The article continued: "The story sparked various conspiracy theories on [sic] Chinese cyberspace."The Military World Games were held in Wuhan in October. 'Perhaps the US delegates brought the coronavirus to Wuhan, and some mutation occurred to the virus, making it more deadly and contagious, and causing a wide­spread outbreak this year,' a user posted on China's Twitter-like Weibo."[An] international relations professor at the Shanghai-based Fudan University, noted that global virologists are working to track the origin of the virus, including the intel­ligence agencies. Netizens are encouraged to actively par­take in discussions, but preferrably [sic] in a rational fashion."The original Global Times article appears to have been replaced with one about the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's denial of the TV Asahi report.On March 4, the People's Daily reprint of this article was used as the basis for a piece published on conspiracy website GlobalResearch.ca, titled "China's Coronavirus: A Shocking Update. Did The Virus Originate in the US?" It was the first of two articles on the website that would lead to Zhao's tweet nine days later suggesting the U.S. Army had brought the virus to Wuhan.The March 4 article begins: "The Western media quickly took the stage and laid out the official narrative for the outbreak of the new coronavirus which appeared to have begun in China, claiming it to have originated with animals at a wet market in Wuhan."This omits a few salient facts: that China's state-controlled media had also "laid out the official narrative"; that reporters had received that narrative from the Chinese government; and that in the early days of the outbreak, the majority of evidence, including the Lancet article by 29 Chinese doctors, pointed to the Wuhan market.The Global Research article continues: "In fact the origin was for a long time unknown but it appears likely now, according to Chinese and Japanese reports, that the virus originated elsewhere, from multiple locations, but began to spread widely only after being introduced to the market."More to the point, it appears that the virus did not originate in China and, according to reports in Japanese and other media, may have originated in the U.S."The article then presents a subheading that inflates "may have originated in the US" to "Chinese Researchers Conclude the Virus Originated Outside of China". Under­neath, it quotes two reports - a February 22 article in Global Times and a February 23 article in CGTN - both about the ChinaXiv study, which did not suggest the virus originated outside China.But Global Research wanted readers to draw the conclusion that it did, and so it created some dots to be connected: "Chinese medical authorities - and 'intelligence agencies' - then conducted a rapid and wide-ranging search for the origin of the virus, collecting nearly 100 samples of the genome from 12 different countries on 4 continents, identifying all the varieties and mutations. During this research, they determined the virus outbreak had begun much earlier, probably in November, shortly after the Wuhan Military Games."They then came to the same independent conclusions as the Japanese researchers - that the virus did not begin in China but was introduced there from the outside."That was not the "conclusion" of the scientists who posted their research on ChinaXiv.Next, citing a February 27 story on Xinhuanet, Global Research invokes a Chinese national hero, Zhong Nanshan, who led the fight to contain severe acute respiratory syn­drome in 2003. "China's top respiratory specialist Zhong Nanshan said on January 27 ... 'Though the Covid-19 was first discovered in China, it does not mean that it originated from China'."Global Research translates this for its readers: "But that is Chinese for 'it originated someplace else, in another country'."Zhong did not say that. Neither did Xinhuanet. And the "Japanese researchers" Global Research refers to are never identified. The only reference to a Japanese source is: "In February of 2020, the Japanese Asahi news report (print and TV) claimed the coronavirus originated in the US, not in China ..."Global Research offers no link to Asahi, only a link to the February 23 People's Daily article, which also has no Asahi link but was a reprint of the Global Times story, which appears to have been revised on February 22, and - you guessed it - provides no Asahi link.An online search for "Asahi news coronavirus originated in the US" from February 1 to 29 reveals no link to any such Asahi article. Neither does a search of the Asahi news website, which returns 688 articles containing the word "coronavirus" through March 4. But not this one.Global Research also cites the Fudan University quote in Global Times: "[The professor] stated that global virologists 'including the intelligence agencies' were tracking the origin of the virus. Also of interest, the Chinese government did not shut the door on this. The news report stated: 'Netizens are encouraged to actively partake in discussions, but prefer­ably in a rational fashion.'"In China, that is meaningful. If the reports were rubbish, the government would clearly state that, and tell people to not spread false rumours."The final piece of "evidence" in Global Research's March 4 article is headed "Taiwan Virologist Suggests the Coronavirus Originated in the US", and includes an embedded video of a Taiwan television show, identified as This! Is Not News, and a screenshot of a man with a pointer giving a colourful lecture about the origins of the virus. "The man in the video is a top virologist and pharmacologist who performed a long and detailed search for the source of the virus," claims the article.Except the man in the video - whom the report does not name - is not a virologist at all. He is a politician from the pro-Beijing New Party and a member of the Taipei City Council, who, before entering politics full time in 2002, was a pharmacology professor.The clip opens with an introduction from a man in a crew cut, who talks about China and Russia and Georgian defectors carrying American biowarfare secrets, and mosquitoes and bats developed by the U.S. for diabolical purposes. As he talks, tabloid-sized purple characters scroll along the bottom of the screen, punctuated with question marks and exclamation marks, and the one English acronym every conspiracy theorist worldwide knows: "CIA!"Capping his performance is a 1981 analysis purported to have been carried out by the U.S. Army that showed the attraction of "entomological warfare" to the U.S. military and American taxpayers: 50 per cent of a city of 1.2 million people could be wiped out at a per-corpse cost of 29 cents.Up next, "the man in the video"notes that, while the man with the crew cut had been talking in terms of Cold War-style geopolitics where everybody fears and loathes everybody else, he is there solely to discuss science. Then he waves a pointer with a plastic yellow index finger at its tip, indicating diagrams of multicoloured circles. As the most complex diagram arrives on screen, he reassures the show's hostess, "The next slide will make it very clear."Such was Global Research's Taiwan "expert evidence". Undaunted, the article continues: "The Taiwanese doctor then stated the virus outbreak began earlier than assumed, saying, 'We must look to September of 2019'."He stated the case in September of 2019 where some Japanese travelled to Hawaii and returned home infected, people who had never been to China. This was two months prior to the infections in China and just after the CDC suddenly and totally shut down the Fort Detrick bio-weapons lab claiming the facilities were insufficient to prevent loss of pathogens."The introduction of the U.S. Army's Fort Detrick bio-weapons lab is a solid piece of conspiracy theory crafts­manship. The "man in the video" had not mentioned Fort Detrick - Global Research did, in an apparent attempt to tie the Taiwanese "virologist's" Japanese travellers who visited Hawaii in September to a U.S. Army bioweapons lab.The Fort Detrick facility had not been "suddenly and totally shut down" - it ceased research in mid-July (and not in September). And how one of the most contagious viruses in history travelled from Maryland to Hawaii over a six- to eight-week period, leaving no trail of illness and death, goes unexamined by Global Research.For good measure, the article closes by listing six outbreaks in 2018, 2019 and 2020 of "pandemics" that "sickened" and "killed" people, chickens and pigs in China. Each includes notes such as, "China needs to purchase U.S. agricultural products," suggesting that as part of the trade war, the U.S. has been unleashing pathogens in the mainland for more than two years in order to make China buy American.In summary, the March 4 article invokes mainland hero Zhong, the "Japanese" and the "Taiwanese" - two American allies with no reason to lie - and adds the "CIA" and a leaky U.S. bioweapons research lab for spice. All independent and none really confirming the others while appearing to come close. Perhaps most impressive of all, the author produced almost 2,000 America-bashing words, and not one of them was "Trump".On March 5, without citing the Global Research March 4 piece or any of the underlying Chinese media articles, Zhao tweeted: "Confirmed cases of #COVID19 were first found in China, but its origin is not necessarily in China. We are still tracing the origin."On March 11, Global Research published a follow-up: "COVID-19: Further Evidence that the Virus Originated in the US".The story begins by recapping the March 4 article, upgrading the never-found Japanese Asahi broadcasters and the "man in the video" to "Japanese and Taiwanese epidemiologists and pharmacologists [who] have deter­mined that the new coronavirus could have originated in the US". The "man in the video" was now also a "physician" and a "scientist".Recalling his attempt to place the first Covid-19 case in the U.S., Global Research again points out, "immediately prior to that, the CDC totally shut down the U.S. Military's main bio-lab at Fort Detrick, Maryland, due to an absence of safeguards against pathogen leakages, issuing a complete 'cease and desist' order to the military".As evidence, Global Research had posted a screenshot of an August 5 New York Times headline, "Deadly Germ Research Is Shut Down at Army Lab Over Safety Concerns; Problems with disposal of dangerous materials led the government to suspend research at the military's leading biodefence centre".In fact, the New York Times article had not stated the centre had been "totally shut down". It had reported that 900 people worked at the facility and, "Although many projects are on hold, [a facility spokeswoman] said scien­tists and other employees are continuing to work, just not on select agents". Both The New York Times and a local newspaper that first reported the cessation of the research noted that no pathogens had escaped the facility.Global Research's March 11 story continues: "We also had the Japanese citizens infected in September of 2019, in Hawaii, people who had never been to China, these infec­tions occurring on US soil long before the outbreak in Wuhan but only shortly after the locking down of Fort Detrick."Then, on Chinese social media, another article appeared, aware of the above but presenting further details. It stated in part that five 'foreign' athletes or other personnel visiting Wuhan for the World Military Games (October 18-27, 2019) were hospitalised in Wuhan for an undetermined infection."That other article is a blog on Chinese social media, identified only by a QR code, that began: "Because there have been so many American dogs recently, in consider­ation for my account's safety, [I must write] 'some country' or 'M Country' [when referring to America]."The blog entry, which appeared to be a work in progress and is no longer online, recycled much of Global Research's March 4 article, adding screenshots of local news stories about U.S. military personnel in Wuhan for the October military games who were hospitalized.According to Global Research: "The article explains more clearly that the Wuhan version of the virus could have come only from the US because it is what they call a 'branch' which could not have been created first because it would have no 'seed'. It would have to have been a new variety spun off the original 'trunk', and that trunk exists only in the US."So there it was. A post on "Chinese social media" about "'foreign' athletes or other personnel visiting Wuhan for the World Military Games" in October completed the conspiracy's journey. The fake news world had rewritten the origin of Covid-19: it was not due to a catastrophic natural occurrence somewhere in or around Wuhan, as the world's scientists believed, but to a bio­weapon brought to Wuhan by the U.S. Army.At the end of its March 11 article, Global Research returned to January, citing two articles in Science magazine for further "evidence" of its conspiracy - neither of which states the origin of the virus was, as Global Research puts it, "Not in Wuhan" - tying a bow around the package Zhao would soon forward to hundreds of thousands, who would forward it to hundreds of millions.On the morning of March 13, Zhao tweeted links to the Global Research articles: "This article is very much important to each and every one of us. Please read and retweet it. COVID-19: Further Evidence that the Virus Originated in the US. It would be useful to read this prior article for background: China's Coronavirus: A Shocking Update. Did The Virus ..."Followed by: "Just take a few minutes to read one more article. This is so astonishing that it changed many things I used to believe in. Please retweet to let more people know about it. China's Coronavirus: A Shocking Update. Did The Virus Originate in the US? - Global Research: The Western media quickly laid out the official narrative for the outbreak of COVID-19 which appeared to have begun in China ..."By late afternoon, the South China Morning Post reported that the hashtag topic "Zhao Lijian sent out five consecutive tweets questioning the US" had been viewed more than 4.7 million times on Weibo. Twelve hours later, The New York Times reported it had been viewed more than 160 million times.Zhao's Twitter followers have increased from 287,000 to more than 500,000. Media worldwide carried stories about his tweets, putting them in front of millions more readers, most of whom would never have seen them on Twitter or Weibo. Fake virus news had gone viral.In October, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence noted in the first line of its report on Russia's use of social media to meddle in the 2016 presidential election, that "information warfare [is] designed to spread disinformation and societal division". Zhao's tweets accomplished both. The disinformation was obvious. Critical thinking in abeyance, plenty of people will believe a claim that the U.S. Army planted Covid-19 in Wuhan; even more will want it to be true.When President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and others began fighting back by loudly and repeatedly calling Covid-19 "the Chinese virus", social division in the U.S. grew, if that is possible. The media accused Trump of being racist and xenophobic, and inciting more of the same towards Chinese-Americans. This only caused Trump to say it louder and more often.One wonders how much longer Washington will conti­nue fighting the information war against Beijing with one arm tied behind its back. Chinese media enjoy free run of the U.S., including on Twitter. The U.S. has no such freedom in China.Not a few pundits in these past few weeks have predicted Covid-19 will end globalisation, or even "life as we know it". That seems unlikely, given the short-term nature of people's memories and how profitable "life as we know it" has been for so many. But given the mischief Zhao's tweets caused, Beijing's days on Twitter might be numbered.Wen En and Wen You provided research and translation assistance.Load-Date: April 8, 2020End of Document

CECC CHAIRS MCGOVERN, RUBIO TO POTUS: ADVOCATE FOR DETAINED JOURNALISTS IN CHINAStates News ServiceMay 3, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1150 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of Massachusetts Rep. James McGovern:Congressman James P. McGovern (D-MA) Chair of the bipartisan and bicameral Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), joined United States Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), Co-Chair of the Commission, in sending a letter to President Donald Trump expressing concern about the Chinese government's "increasingly draconian" restrictions on press freedoms and freedom of expression and asking him to "advocate for the release" of unjustly imprisoned journalists, bloggers, and free speech advocates.The letter coincides with World Press Freedom Day (May 3) and notes that there are more journalists and bloggers detained in China than anywhere else in the world, including Ilham Tohti, Huang Qi, Lu Gengsong, Lobsang Jamyang, Gulmira Imin, and Gui Minhaiwhose case information is highlighted in the letter.In conclusion, the Chairs urged the President to make the free flow of uncensored news and information "a prerequisite of U.S.-China relations moving forward" because "press freedom, in print and online, is essential for thwarting global pandemics, stopping forced labor-made goods from entering the U.S. market, and providing reliable economic data for investors and businesses."Full text of the letter can be found below:President Donald TrumpThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NWWashington, D.C. 20500Dear Mr. President:We write to express our concern about the Chinese government's increasingly draconian restrictions on press freedom and the freedom of expression. On this World Press Freedom Day, we ask you to advocate for the release of unjustly imprisoned journalists, bloggers, and free speech advocates and publicly call on the Chinese government and Communist Party to end controls and permit the free flow of uncensored news and information. The many restrictions currently in effect limit not only what the world knows about China, but what the Chinese people know about their own government and its policies.There are more journalists and bloggers detained in China than anywhere else in the world. We ask that you and administration officials raise the following cases in discussions with General Secretary Xi Jinping and other senior Chinese officials:Ilham Tohti : In January 2014, Chinese authorities detained Uyghur scholar Ilham Tohti, and a court in Urumqi, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, sentenced him to eight months and later to life imprisonment for "separatism." Authorities have tortured him in detention and restricted visits from family members. Chinese officials shut down his popular website, Uyghur Online, which promoted understanding and dialogue between Uyghurs and Han Chinese, and sentenced seven of his university students to multi-year prison terms for their involvement with the website: Perhat Halmurat, Shohret Nijat, Abduqeyum Ablimit, Mutellip Imin, Atikem Rozi, Akbar Imin, and Luo Yuwei.Huang Qi : Authorities in Sichuan province detained human rights advocate and citizen journalist Huang Qi on November 28, 2016. Despite having acute kidney disease and cardiovascular ailments, Huang Qi received a 12-year prison sentence in July 2019 after being charged with "intentionally leaking state secrets" and "illegally providing state secrets overseas." Huang served prior prison sentences in connection with his advocacy for the families of victims of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre and investigative reports on the fallout from the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.Lu Gengsong : Chinese freelance journalist Lu Gengsong was detained in July 2014 for reportedly publishing online essays condemning Chinese government corruption and advocating for democratization. In August 2016, a judge sentenced him to 11 years in prison for "subversion of state power," a charge often used against citizens who publicly criticize the Communist Party. In 2017, despite suffering from diabetes and gallbladder necrosis, his request for medical parole was denied. Many other journalists, bloggers, and writers continue to be detained or disappeared for publicly reporting on or writing about government abuse of power, including Chen Jieren, Lu Yuyu, Liu Feiyue, Xu Zhiyong, Chen Qiushi, and Fang Bin.Lobsang Jamyang : Tibetan writer Lobsang Jamyang was detained and held incommunicado for more than a year before a court sentenced him on May 9, 2016 to 7 years and 6 months in prison for "leaking state secrets" and "engaging in separatist activities". Before being incarcerated, Jamyang frequently wrote (sometimes under his pen name, Lomig, or Lomik) for Tibetan-language websites and blogs about government restrictions on free expression. Other Tibetan champions of free speech and Tibetan culture, such as Tashi Wangchug and Konchog Tsephel, are also serving multi-year prison sentences in connection with their criticism of and reporting on Chinese government policies in ethnic Tibetan regions.Gulmira Imin : On July 14, 2009, authorities in Urumqi detained Gulmira Imin, a Uyghur website administrator and government employee, in connection with a posting on the Uyghur-language website Salkin calling for Uyghurs to demonstrate on July 5, 2009. She was sentenced to life imprisonment on charges of "splittism, leaking state secrets, and organizing an illegal demonstration." Authorities reportedly denied Imin access to pre-trial legal counsel, tortured her while in detention, and coerced her into signing a legal document before sentencing.Gui Minhai : Hong Kong-based publisher and Swedish citizen Gui Minhai was abducted from Thailand in 2015 and forced to give a televised confession to having fled China a decade prior while serving a suspended sentence. He was secretly tried and convicted in early 2020 of "illegally providing intelligence abroad" and given a 10-year prison sentence. Chinese authorities have refused Swedish consular officials' requests to visit Gui in detention, insisting without evidence that he surrendered his Swedish citizenship in 2018. Gui was one of five Hong Kong booksellers detained or illegally abducted to China during 2015.The individuals included here are only a representative few of the many more detained in violation of international human rights norms guaranteeing freedom of speech and the press.In addition to raising representative prisoner cases, we request that you continue to employ all available diplomatic options to reinstate the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Washington Post journalists expelled from China on March 17, 2020. The free flow of uncensored news and information must be a prerequisite of U.S.-China relations moving forward. Press freedom, in print and online, is essential for thwarting global pandemics, stopping forced labor-made goods from entering the U.S. market, and providing reliable economic data for investors and businesses.Thank you for your consideration of our requests.Load-Date: May 4, 2020End of Document

China takes advantage of coronavirus to invade Philippines territorial seaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 23, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 940 wordsBody       China has installed artificial islands to expand its territory (Wikipedia)Manila / Ho Chi Minh (Vietnam), 23 Apr.- China has deployed "mask diplomacy" with donations of health equipment and medical missions to several countries in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, a smokescreen that has allowed it to inadvertently expand its presence in disputed waters of the South China Sea.As the world focuses on responding to the pandemic and preparing for what is coming up as the worst economic crisis in decades, China has taken the opportunity to continue its military expansion by creating two new districts in disputed territories, irritating its neighbors in the region, particularly the Philippines and Vietnam."It intends to overwhelm the region at this difficult time by increasing the presence of its fishing fleet, the Coast Guard and its maritime militias," said Gregory Poling, director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, a Washington-based expert group that monitors developments at that sea."Beijing will not stop. Their strategy is to corner Southeast Asian governments until they decide that there is no other reasonable option than to surrender and accept any treatment China puts on the table," Poling said in a recent video conference with the foreign press accredited in the Philippines.Two new Chinese districtsChina announced last Saturday that it has created two new districts within the city of Sansha, in the southern province of Haian, covering territories of the Spratly Islands, Scarborough Atoll and paracel archipelago, Territories of the South China Sea disputed with other countries in the region.In the same vein as Poling, Carl Thayer, an expert professor in Vietnam at the University of New South Wales in Australia, considered in statements to the Vietnamese News Agency that this territorial expansion is "an illegal provocation."The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei claim parts of this strategic sea - which is circulating 30% of global trade and which is home to 12% of the world's fishing grounds, as well as oil and gas fields - although China attributes the sovereignty of these waters as a whole.According to the Hague Court of Arbitration in 2016, the Philippines holds ownership of the Spratly and Scarborough Atoll, making it the only country with an international ruling to support its position in the case, although Beijing does not recognize it.Diplomatic protestsFaced with this situation, the Philippines on Wednesday lodged two new diplomatic protests with the Chinese Embassy in Manila over the creation of these new districts and a recent incident with a Philippine Navy ship."They are clear violations of international law and Philippine sovereignty," Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin said on his Twitter account, who last year already filed several protests over the entry without permission of Chinese ships into Philippine waters.The Philippines also protested yesterday over an incident on February 17, when a Chinese warship entered the Philippines Exclusive Zone and hit a Philippine Navy ship."The incident can be considered the attack of a Chinese warship on a Filipino one, which is unacceptable in common military practice and a hostile act that, by amiscalculation, can lead to an escalation of the conflict," said Filipino analyst José Antonio Custodio, former national security council accountant.Although the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Armed Forces have denounced China's meddling, President Rodrigo Duterte - who has directed his foreign policy towards approaching the Asian giant in exchange for generous investments - has not spoken out, but has thanked China for his donation of medical supplies and sending doctors to fight COVID-19.Vietnamese firmnessVietnam, despite its close political and economic ties with China, has always been tenacly opposed to its expansion on the disputed islands and this time has been no exception.Deputy Foreign Minister Le Thi Tu Hang warned in a statement last Sunday that events such as the creation of the two districts in Sansha "do not lead to the development of friendly relations between countries and further complicate the situation" in the region.Hang, who recalled the legal and historical foundations he believes support Vietnamese positions, demanded that China "respect Vietnamese sovereignty, overturn erroneous decisions, and repeat similar actions in the future."Increased tension between China and VietnamTension between Hanoi and Beijing has already increased earlier this month, when the Vietnamese government accused a Chinese coastal patrol boat of sinking a Vietnamese fishing vessel with eight crew members near the Paracel Islands.Beijing justified the action on the grounds that the fishing vessel had crashed into the patrol car, a version denied by the Hanoi government, which received support, among others, from the United States and the Philippines.The Washington State Department responded with a call to China to focus on "supporting international efforts to combat the global pandemic and stop exploiting the distraction or vulnerability of other states to expand their illegal claims in the South China Sea."When we started the PanAm Post to try to bring the truth about Latin America to the rest of the world, we knew it would be a big challenge. But we were rewarded for the incredible amount of support and feedback from readers that made us grow and improve.Be part of the mission to spread the truth!Help us combat attempts to silence dissenting voices and contribute today.Contribute todayContribute to the PanAm Post today with your donationLoad-Date: April 24, 2020End of Document

Some governments want to sue Beijing for damages.Around the world, a backlash is taking place against China over its initial mishandling of the crisis that helped spread the coronavirus around the world, creating a battle of deeply polarizing narratives and repping China's ambition to fill the leadership vacuum left by the United States.China, which has never been receptive to external criticism and is wary of the damage they may cause to its internal control and long economic reach, has responded aggressively, combining medical aid to other countries with harsh nationalist rhetoric and mixing the demands for gratitude with economic threats.The result has only added impetus to China's growing distrust in Europe and Africa, undermining China's desired image as a generous global player.Even before the virus, Beijing showed a fierce approach to public relations, an aggressive style called "Wolf Warrior" diplomacy, named after two ultra-patriotic Chinese films featuring the evil plots and fierce disappearance of foreign mercenaries led by the United States.With the clear encouragement of President Xi Jinping and the powerful Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party, a young generation of Chinese diplomats has been demonstrating their loyalty with defiant, nationalistic and sometimes threatening messages in the countries where they are based."There is a new type of Chinese diplomats who seem to compete with each other to be more radical and ultimately insult the country in which they are stationed," said Francois Godement, Senior Advisor for Asia at the Paris-based Institut Montaigne. "They have fought with all the countries in northern Europe that they should be interested with, and they have distanced themselves from all of them."Since the emergence of the virus, tone has only hardened, a measure of the seriousness of the danger that Chinese leaders see as representing for its position in the country, where it has fueled anger and destroyed economic growth, as well as abroad.In recent weeks, at least seven Chinese ambassadors - in France, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Ghana and the African Union - have been summoned by their hosts to respond to accusations ranging from the dissemination of misinformation to the "racist abuse" of Africans in Guangzhou.Last week, China threatened to withdraw medical aid to the Netherlands by changing the name of its representative office in Taiwan to include the word Taipei. And before that, the Chinese embassy in Berlin publicly clashed with the German newspaper Bild after the tabloid demanded $160 billion in compensation from China for the damage caused to Germany by the virus.Trump said last week that his administration was conducting "serious investigations" into the handling of the coronavirus outbreak in Beijing.He has pressured American intelligence agencies to find the source of the virus, suggesting that it may have accidentally emerged from an Wuhan weapons lab, although most intelligence agencies remain skeptical. And he has expressed interest in trying to sue Beijing for damages, with the United States seeking $10 million for each American death.Republicans in the United States have mobilized to support Trump's attacks onChina. Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to hold Beijing accountable for the outbreak.Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt filed a lawsuit against China over the spread of the pandemic (Manuel Balce Ceneta/)A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Geng Shuang, called the lawsuit "frivolous," adding that it had "no factual and legal basis" and "only invites ridicule."The goal of the lawsuit seems to be less to secure victory in court, which is unlikely, than to pressure Congress to pass legislation that makes it easier for U.S. citizens to sue foreign states for damages."From Beijing's point of view, this contemporary call is a historic echo of the repairs paid after the Boxer Rebellion," said Theresa Fallon, director of the Center for Studies on Russia, Europe and Asia, referring to the anti-imperialist, anti-Christian and ultranationalist uprising that took place in China between 1899 and 1901 and ended in defeat, with huge reparations for eight nations in the following decades. "The party's cultivation of the narrative of humiliation makes it politically impossible for Xi to agree to pay for any reparation."Instead, it has been imperative for Xi to turn the narrative around, leading it from a story of incompetence and failure - including the suppression of early warnings about the virus - to a victory over the disease, a victory achieved through the unity of the party.In the latest iteration of China's new narrative, the enemy - the virus - did not even come from China, but from the US military, an unsubstantiated accusation made by the combative spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, Zhao Lijian.Chinese diplomats are encouraged to be combative, said Susan Shirk, a Chinese intern and director of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego. Zhao's promotion to spokesman and his statement on the US Army "indicates to everyone in China that this is the official line, so you get this megaphone effect," he said, adding that it makes any negotiation more difficult.But in the long run, China is sowing distrust and harming its own interests, said Shirk, who is working on a book called "Overreach," about how China's domestic politics has disrupted its ambitions for peaceful rise as a global superpower."As China began to control the virus and kick-start this health diplomacy, it could have been an opportunity for China to emphasize its compassionate side and rebuild trust and reputation as a responsible global power," he said. "But that diplomatic effort was hijacked by the party's Propaganda Department, with a much more assertive effort to leverage its help to gain praise for China as a country and as a system and its performance in stopping the spread of the virus."In recent days, Chinese state media have made numerous incendiary statements, saying that Australia, after announcing its desire for an investigation into the virus, was "chewing gum stuck on the sole of China's shoe." Beijing warned that Australia risked long-term damage in its trade partnership with China, which takes a third ofAustralia's exports. "Perhaps ordinary people will say, 'Why should we drink Australian wine? Eat Australian meat?" china's ambassador, Cheng Jingye, told The Australian Financial Review. Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne dismissed China's attempt as "economic coercion."Even in European countries like Germany, "mistrust in China has accelerated so much with the virus that no ministry knows how to treat it," said Angela Stanzel, a Chinese expert at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs.In Germany, as in Britain, in addition to new questions about the desirability of using Huawei for the new 5G systems, concerns about China's reliance on vital pharmaceuticals and materials have also increased.Europe begins to look suspiciously at Chinese company Huawei (Aly Song/)France, which traditionally has good relations with Beijing, has also been angered by critical statements by Chinese diplomats, including an accusation that the French had deliberately left their older residents to die in the asylums. This provoked a rebuke from French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and the wrath of lawmakers, despite an early reciprocal exchange of medical aid as masks.Recently, the German government complained that Chinese diplomats were requesting letters of support and gratitude for Beijing's help and efforts against the virus from government officials and the heads of leading German companies.The same has happened in Poland, the U.S. Ambassador to Warsaw, Georgette Mosbacher, said in an interview, describing Chinese pressure on President Andrzej Duda to call Xi and thank him for his help, a call the Chinese announced at his home. "Poland wasn't going to get these things unless the phone call was made, so they could use that phone call" to make propaganda, Mosbacher said.There is some discontent in China with the current diplomatic rhetoric. In a recent essay, Zi Zhongyun, now 89, a long-standing expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, parallels the harsh nationalist and xenophobic rhetoric of today's Wolf Warriors with the period of the Boxer Rebellion against Western influence in China.Zi said such reactions risked getting out of hand. "I can say without a doubt that as long as boxer-type activities receive the official seal of approval as 'patriotic', and as long as generation after generation of our Chinese compatriots are educated and instilled with a boxer-type mentality, it will be impossible for China to take its place among the modern civilized nations of the world."MORE ON THIS TOPIC:Pompeo stated that "there is huge amount of evidence" that the coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratoryLoad-Date: May 4, 2020End of Document

Neil Patel: Either We Heal As A Country Or We Are Going To CrumbleThe Daily CallerApril 17, 2020 Friday 12:53 AM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: OPINIONLength: 1166 wordsByline: Neil Patel, Co-Founder and Publisher, The Daily Caller, neil@dailycallernewsfoundation.orgNeil Patel is the co-founder and publisher of The Daily Caller News Foundation. He was previously chief policy adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney.Author ImageBodyLink to ImageFor the business community and those at the very top of America's economic ladder, China has been a godsend. They've made and saved billions and billions of dollars by outsourcing American manufacturing to China and offering goods and services to China's booming consumer market. For many top American companies, growth in China has been seen as essential for success. This is why so many American companies and upper-income American citizens are so thoroughly uninterested in hearing about Chinese atrocities. Remember last year when an NBA general manager made the mistake of tweeting something sympathetic to the freedom (and pro-American) protestors in Hong Kong? He was absolutely crushed by his league and the players, who all knew that China was where their future riches were to be made. China's behavior has not made it easy for their American apologists. In addition to their repressive actions in Hong Kong, China has carried out a repressive policy against their Uighur Muslim minority, including mass detention, mistreatment and even torture. Opposition activists in China are jailed or sometimes simply disappear. (RELATED: Asked Whether China Censored Early Coronavirus Data, Senior WHO Official Said He 'Didn't Look')The media and the internet are under complete state control. In recent years, China has even been rolling out “social credit scores” to rate citizens by their support for the regime and distribute government benefits or punishments accordingly. Even worse, China has been exporting this technology to other repressive regimes. Link to ImageUSA and China trade war. US of America and chinese flags crashed containers on sky at sunset background. 3d illustration (Shutterstock/rawf8)In the face of this behavior, we would expect the media and the activist community to be screaming about the situation in China. They've been largely silent. There is too much money to be made. For example, The Washington Post has been running a special sponsored news section called “China Watch” for the past three decades - which is published by a media outlet owned by the Chinese Communist Party. How much money has The Washington Post made from these advertising supplements? They have been asked many times and have refused to disclose that information. Such a lack of transparency over such an obvious conflict should be shocking, but the Post doesn't have to disclose it. Nobody else in the media wants to call them on it either, because most other large media outlets have their own China conflicts. Could this be affecting the news coverage? That's not a hypothetical question anymore. A story broke just this week showing Bloomberg News editors expressly killing an investigative news story into corruption in China for fear of hurting Bloomberg's China business interests. (RELATED: Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy: Coronavirus Crisis Is 'Not Because Of Anything That China Did')Why, besides the obvious corruption of it, does all this matter? Outsourcing our manufacturing and our corporate growth to China has done a lot to drive us to the two-class America we are becoming. The top tier of our country has thrived, in part by the efficiencies of incredibly cheap Chinese labor and access to the booming Chinese consumer market. Go to any private airport, and look at all the planes stacked up. The wealthy are having a good time, and China has been a big part of the reason why. At the same time, the loss of American jobs to China has harmed lower-income Americans. They get back cheaper consumer goods, but I'm not sure how many would trade their jobs for that. The transfer of American manufacturing and other jobs to China has had a big role in transforming us to the multitiered American society we have today, with so little in common between the tiers. Those in finance and top companies are getting rich by facilitating this transition. Others are suffering with lost jobs and lower wages. Now we all have to join together to fight a disease that started in China and grew, at least in part, due to secrecy and mismanagement in the Chinese government at the earliest stages of the virus - when the disease could have possibly been contained. Link to ImageMade in China. Cardboard boxes with text made in China and chinese flag on the roller conveyor. 3d illustration (Shutterstock/Maxx-Studio)Now as the price of dealing with this disease comes due, it's regular Americans who are paying it. More than 20 million have lost jobs. Most had very little savings coming into this. For those in the upper reaches of our society, including virtually every person making national- and state-level decisions about the way forward, quarantining has been a minor inconvenience. We work from home. We get to see our kids more. We watch a little more Netflix. All in all, it hasn't been that bad. For the people at the other end of the economic spectrum, it's been a nightmare. In other words, the same people who have been hurt by globalization are now paying the highest price for this disease, fueled in large part by our increased globalization. There are two possible roads ahead. On one hand, we can make plans going forward with the needs of those hardest hit firmly in mind. We can also rethink a lot of huge issues, like the supply chain vulnerabilities we now face due to making very little medicine and other key equipment in our own country. More broadly, we can take a harder look at the loss of American manufacturing and the flight of so many good jobs overseas. If we follow this path, we may look back on this crisis as the birth of some level of much-needed national reconciliation. (RELATED: Top WHO Official Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus Won Election With China's Help. Now He's Running Interference For China On Coronavirus)The other option is to continue ignoring the plight of those who have not fared so well these past couple of decades. If that happens, this crisis could go down as the final straw that broke this great country. What we need most is for those who hold power in America - those who have reaped massive financial benefit from our current system and who are not feeling much pinch today - to try to see the world through the lens of someone really hurting right now, who never saw any of the upside that got us into this mess in the first place.Neil Patel co-founded The Daily Caller, one of America's fastest-growing online news outlets, which regularly breaks news and distributes it to over 15 million monthly readers.

Trump Announces Punitive Action Against China - Terminates Relationship With WHO, Orders Barring Of Certain Chinese Students From Entering USThe Daily CallerMay 29, 2020 Friday 07:15 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc.

Furthermore, he directed the “presidential working group on financial markets to study the different practices of Chinese companies listed on the U.S. Financial markets with a goal of protecting American investors.”Trump additionally announced the U.S. is formally terminating its relationship with the World Health Organization for its role in helping China cover obscure the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, killing millions of people around the world. Trump added that funds normally reserved for WHO will go to other “deserving” global health needs.Link to ImageWASHINGTON, DC - MAY 28: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks in the Oval Office before signing an executive order related to regulating social media on May 28, 2020 in Washington, DC.

(Photo by Doug MIlls-Pool/Getty Images)Furthermore, Trump stated Friday's announcement “will affect the full range of agreements that we have with Hong Kong from our extradition treaty to our export controls and technologies and more.”Trump, joined by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin, National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien and other administration officials, told reporters gathered in the White House Rose Garden that “China's pattern of misconduct is well known.”“The United States wants an open and constructive relationship with China but achieving that relationship requires us to vigorously defend our national interest,” he continued. “The Chinese government has continually violated its promise to us and so many other nations. These plain facts could not be overlooked or swept aside.”WATCH:The White House announced ahead of the press conference that Trump spoke with U.K Prime Minister Boris Johnson about the situation in Hong Kong and “agreed to cooperate closely in responding to any action by China that undermines the Declaration.” Regarding Hong Kong, the two leaders reaffirmed the importance of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and agreed to cooperate closely in responding to any action by China that undermines the Declaration or goes against the will of the people of Hong Kong. - Judd Deere (@JuddPDeere45) May 29, 2020The United States joined the U.K. and the rest of the G7 Thursday to launch the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence, a new initiative to counter China's authoritarian use of A.I. against its own citizens. (RELATED: US Joins G7's 'Global Partnership' Against China's Abuse Of Artificial Intelligence)“While the Chinese Communist Party twists technology to infringe on basic rights, the United States is leading our allies to advance innovation in a way that upholds privacy and freedom,” White House chief technology officer Michael Kratsios told Daily Caller of the initiative. “The Trump Administration will continue to stand up for Americans' values and interests on the world stage.”Kratsios and the G7's other leading technology officials will now nominate individuals from within the industry to serve as GPAI representatives, where they will inform international A.I. policy in a way that coincides with Western values.News surfaced earlier in the week that the State Department was mobilizing to cancel thousands of visas for Chinese graduate students with direct links to the Communist Party of China.Multiple lawmakers have proposed legislation that would achieve a similar goal.Republican Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee entered the SECURE CAMPUS Act, which would block Chinese students from studying in American universities' science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs.“The Chinese Communist Party has long used American universities to conduct espionage on the United States. What's worse is that their efforts exploit gaps in current law,” Cotton said upon announcement of the bill. “It's time for that to end. The SECURE CAMPUS Act will protect our national security and maintain the integrity of the American research enterprise.”Graphic WASHINGTON, DC - MAY 28: U.S. President Donald Trump receives a briefing on the 2020 hurricane season in the Oval Office May 28, 2020 in Washington, DC.

When you look at what's happening I would say we're ahead of schedule now you hate to say it too loudly because all of a sudden things don't happen. But I think we will be sooner rather than later.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: And joining me now Oxbow Advisors Managing Partner Ted Oakley. Ted, good morning.TED OAKLEY, OXBOW ADVISORS MANAGING PARTNER: Morning Cheryl.CASONE: And I want to bring in our steam panel for the show today I got Pollster and Maslansky Partners President Lee Carter with make a morning delay Senior Fellow at the National Taxpayers Union and Former Strategies President Mattie Duppler is here and Former Wall Street Journal Editorial Board Member and a good friend of the show Stephen Moore.Guys, good morning to all of you. All right Ted, I do want to kick off the discussion with you because we're obviously looking at a market that is trying to recover but it's all about the economy.You know we got a $22 trillion economy that is 70 percent based on consumer spending consumption and we don't have that right now. Is the market do you think getting ahead of itself right now as we see the S&P out of bear market territory?OAKLEY: You know Cheryl, I do. I think what happens on these when you get really big cuts in a market like that you always have a certain group of people that want to catch the bottom or think they got the bottom that sort of thing.With these bear markets run they run a long time. They're certainly a lot longer than five weeks. And so I think that's where people probably making mistake but it's not it's not unusual it happens quite a bit. But it's certainly I think yes, it's ahead of itself right now.CASONE: And Mattie Duppler comes into this because I want to ask you that same question. There's so much talk about did we find the bottom Mattie, was the bottom of the market March 23rd, March 24th no one has got a crystal ball but a lot of analysts on Wall Street seem to think that they do?MATTIE DUPPLER, THE NATIONAL TAXPAYERS SENIOR FELLOW: Yes and that's their job to pretend they do right Cheryl sometimes. But the thing is that we have over the past several years completed the economy and the stock market yes.The stock market can tell us important things about the economy but they are not one and the same. And what we know right now is that we have a public health crisis that is weighing on our economy. Until we know that that destruction that is necessary to contain the public health crisis we know that the economy is not going to recovery.So it's true that some industries maybe seeing a bump. It's true that some industries may see a little bit more forward progress than others. But I have to agree with our guest here and there's still probably a lot of runway until we know for sure that the fundamental problem which is that a pandemic which we don't quite have a handle on yet is still the number one policy concerns United States. Until that's solved I don't think that we can say that we're in the clear yet.CASONE: Well, and Ted if we can look ahead to this morning 10:00 am eastern time we are going to be hearing from Fed Chairman Jay Powell is going to be at the Brookings Institute and it's going to be a live you know a live web stream.Investors are hoping that we can get some more light from him on how he sees the crisis unfolding from now? Of course we got the minutes yesterday from the March meeting in that show that basically they all agreed that they had to take these drastic steps. Do you expect anything more from the Fed Chairman today Ted?OAKLEY: Well, I don't know if Cheryl to get anything today. But I certainly do expect it. I think you'll have a lot more money coming because I think what they first put out probably won't cover it. And people probably in general - I don't really know how bad the credit markets are right now?They're still recently frozen and a lot of areas and so I can see them coming with more money over time. You may not say that today but I think they will.CASONE: Well and also Ted I do want to point out initial jobless claims are coming out at 8:30 am eastern time. We're going to have those live for our viewers on the show. 5.25 million is the estimate for unemployment but I've seen ranges go up to more than 9 million. The range like last week is it very vast one what are your expectations?OAKLEY: Well, I know the numbers out there are five or six million. I mean - that's going to put you up at 15, 16 million now over the last three weeks. And I'm certain that goes you know goes higher. I mean I just know too many industries where they've laid off everybody.And so you have a lot of that going on and so the numbers take a while to get in there. But it will be another big number.CASONE: All right and as far as the revision for last week do you expect that as well?OAKLEY: I don't know. I can't speak to that because I'm not really a look those revisions for that and what I might think that would be this week. But I think the one thing that people probably misinterpret in this whole thing is really the devastation on the average working person by the hour that's working the restaurants et center.CASONE: Yes.OAKLEY: There's a massive devastation out there.CASONE: It really isn't. Stephen Moore I want to bring you into this discussion obviously because it is all about the economy and these claims are going to give us likely another rough view of what's happening in America?STEPHEN MOORE, FORMER WALL STREET JOURNAL EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER: You right now when you look at the stock you're really seeing these increases in that also in the market for last couple weeks have gone in my opinion 80 to 90 percent aided by the news that is on the Coronavirus.So we have good news on Coronavirus. We see a big rise on the stock market when we speak passing news about the spread of diseases and the market falls. And so given what's happened in the last couple of weeks I think that is reflecting a real sense of optimism among investors that we are going to potentially be able to open up the economy somewhat sooner perhaps than Trump is talking about.Right now is saying it what April 28th? If he didn't stick to that date and possibly a few days earlier--CASONE: Yes.MOORE: --that I think you're going to see this continued euphoria. So my point is yes I don't even have to look at the news about what's happening with the numbers of cases on the number of deaths and so on? It's all reflected right now in the stock market.CASONE: Yes. Well Stephen they're certainly going to be a lot to talk about throughout the show. You're going to be with us throughout all of it. Ted Oakley, Ted thank you very much for joining us this early morning we appreciate it.OAKLEY: You bet Cheryl.CASONE: All right. Well, we have got a lot more coming up during this hour concealing the Coronavirus the Chinese government facing a fresh lawsuit for poorly lessening the severity of the deadly outbreak as early as November.CASONE: Suing China over the Coronavirus a group of small businesses in California reportedly are suing the Chinese government Wuhan and the country's Health Commission for $8 trillion in damages. They claim they will have suffered by the end of this crisis.The lawsuit alleges that China knew was early as mid November how deadly the virus could be an attempt to cover it up? This is according to a report in TMZ. Let's bring in Fox News Legal Analyst and Defense Attorney Mercedes Colwin. Mercedes, good morning.MERCEDES COLWIN, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Good morning Cheryl. Great to be on with you.CASONE: Yes, thank you. So what do you make of this? I mean it's a starting number 8 trillion first and foremost is mind blowing. But the basis of their case seems to me a little a little thin what do you make of all this?COLWIN: I mean that's a great point. I mean one of the biggest challenges this case is going to have rest in this Federal Law called the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. It basically gives cover to foreign states like the Chinese government, Chinese entities and says you won't have - we the U. S. courts don't have jurisdiction over you as a foreign entity.But there are two exceptions and that's what these businesses are trying to establish with this case. They're saying number one if this is more of a nature of a commercial case and the Chinese government and these entities actually committed tortuous acts within the U. S.But if you want package both of these exceptions this doesn't apply here. I mean, first this isn't about a commercial issue or trade. This is about allegations surrounding governmental actions, the censorship. The fact that the allegations at that time these government in these entities misled the World Health Organization.They didn't report accurately as to the nature of the virus the number of deaths the fact that they censored public - any sort of public dissemination of the information concerning the viruses and even detained medical doctors. Well that's all results in governmental action it's not really converse it's not business it's not treat.So that exception doesn't apply. And then the second part about this tortuous activity most courts says that the tortuous activities have to actually occur in the United States for that too attached. So it's these procedural hurdles are going to be so overwhelming for these businesses to overcome.CASONE: Yes not to mention I mean they trained all of this in the international courts versus the domestic courts. I want to bring in Stephen Moore. Steve.MOORE: Hi Mercedes. This is such a fascinating issue that we're seeing right now with the Chinese. And I'm hearing a lot of talk in Washington about a potential wartime violations for almost a case for the United States government suing.I don't know suing is the right word but penalizing the Chinese for - I'll sum up - effectively reparations payments that the Chinese would pay to the United States because of their disruption of the world in terms of the damage they've done to the economy. Do you think there's anything to that?COLWIN: It's going to be so difficult. I mean those - that's an excellent question because you look at just the nature of the cases that we're talking about with respect to these businesses. You kind of see some of the theories that are going to be out there.One really centers around that lab the bio weapon that the businesses claim that occurred which is why this apparently the allegations or that there's bio lab created this virus in the lab and then disseminated into the wet markets by selling the animals that were affected.And used in these lab experiments to the wet market as opposed to creating them which would create obviously then they couldn't they couldn't be contained the virus and disseminated throughout the country and then over to the United States.CASONE: Yes.COLWIN: So there are - it's going to be really difficult to show that there is some intentional act to the extent that it would be like a terrorist - bio terrorist acts. So it's going to be pretty difficult for the U.S. to have any type of claim like that.CASONE: Well, these businesses no matter what they are suffering and with that can't be lost in all of this. Mercedes, thank you so much for getting up early it is good to see you. Mercedes Colwin.COLWIN: Great to see you stay well and stay safe.CASONE: You too, you as well. All right, we've got a lot more coming up this morning. Then there was one Senator Bernie Sanders has suspended his 2020 bid. He is now cleared the path for Joe Biden to take on President Trump in November stay with us.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, (D-VT): While we are winning the ideological battle and while we were winning the support of so many young people and working people throughout the country. I have concluded that this battle for the Democratic Nomination will not be successful. And so today I am announcing the suspension of my campaign.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Well, it is official Bernie Sanders is out of the 2020 Race for the White House, the move essentially teeing up Former Vice President Joe Biden as the Democratic Nominee. Lee Carter to you what what's your take on what you heard from Mr. Sanders yesterday and the fact that he's going to be keeping his delegates?LEE CARTER, POLLSTER AND MASLANSKY, PARTNERS PRESIDENT: And so I think it was a really hard decision for him to end his campaign because he is not a traditional candidate. He's not that - he's looking at this more as a movement than he is just running for President.So I think this was very, very difficult for him and I'm not surprised that he is going to hold on to his delegates and he's going to try to keep his influence in this. Because I think he has a higher purpose and all of us.And so I think that's why he's doing it. And it is really interesting to see the pipette now because I think the Vice Presidential pick is going to be more important to Joe Biden because he himself is not the most popular candidate that we've seen going into an election. I think he won by default and he didn't win because people were exceptionally excited about him.CASONE: Well, but you saw like you basically did both see the Democratic Party in a way kind of come together and at the end of the day pushed Sanders out. And Mattie Duppler the Editorial Board of the Journal has a really good piece this morning about this.And they say look, you know what they that Sanders did was he yanked the Democratic Party sharply left especially to make sure promising Medicare for all and free college. And then they point to some of the Biden economic proposals which are still in place.I mean his proposed tax increase is still $3.4 trillion. His mind may change during the pandemic but that's still a Joe Biden platform which is going to be raised taxes and expand social programs.DUPPLER: That's right. And you know Bernie Sanders shouldn't get all the credit for pulling the party leftward. Elizabeth Warren did a heck of a job doing that as well. The challenge with Elizabeth Warren running in against Bernie Sanders is she actually did her math, right?Like she was the one who forced Bernie Sanders to admit that there's a lot of tax increases to pay for Medicare for all. It's not just cheaper healthcare. It's not just all of the benefits that he's been promising.So when you look at the Democratic Party now I think that the Sanders Campaign is instructive for some of the challenges that Biden now has. You look at the map for buying you know the thing that Bernie Sanders was saying is that he can create a coalition that the traditional Democrats can't.That he has young people he has workers he's going to get these Trump voters who had turned out to vote for the President in 2016. That did not ultimately end up being the case. So how does Biden replicate a map now? Does he have to - does he have to rely on the Obama coalition?It's not clear at all that he's going to be able to galvanize voters to that extent that they'll be coming out to vote for him. So certainly as Lee said that V.P. pick is what he's looking at to try and create that coalition to defeat the President.CASONE: Yes. Yes and he's committed as you just - ladies as you've said he's committed to a woman but Steve Moore of course the beddings has already started. I was looking at some of the odds and Kamala Harris at this point still has kind of a strong probability of being caught as well as being nominated. But also any Amy Klobuchar, Steve?MOORE: Yes. Well, a couple things. First of all I am not convinced that Joe Biden is going to be the Democratic Nominee. Now I'm talking to a lot of Democratic operatives in Washington who've watched his performance in front of the camera and the last month or two. And they are very nervous about Biden.He just doesn't seem like he has it all together right now. And as you know you've reported on this at Fox Business. There's been a little bit of a boom what lately to try to dump Biden and go with someone like Andy Cuomo.I don't think that's going happen but I wouldn't rule it out. And the other thing I'd say quickly is that you know you played that clip of Bernie saying look, I'm winning the ideological battle. You know what? He is because what we're seeing in Washington right now the craziness that's going on is the Bernie Sanders agenda.CASONE: Yes. Go back for a second Steve. You don't think that Joe Biden going to be the nominee? I mean.MOORE: Hold on--CASONE: I don't know that. That's hard to.MOORE: Yes, that's it one in three that the Democrats dump Biden they go to him and say look you can't be our Nominee. You know you're just too old and they may they may dump Biden and go with somebody like an Andy Cuomo or Michelle Obama.CASONE: Okay. Well, I think Andrew Cuomo is a little busy right now managing a crisis in New York State Steven. But I tell you what look this is been a wild year in so many ways. You never know - I know Steve will see all of you of course are just a little bit.All right well, you know it's true the reality is certainly change in our country. All right, Futures are hovering right now near the flat line as investors brace for what is expected to be a record number of jobless claims in the United States. Futures are down right now slightly across the board.Now there's a different story going on in the oil market. Right now there is the contract is up well look at that it's up more than 6.25 percent. This is ahead of OPEC's virtual meeting today that's going to be at 10:00 am eastern time. We're going to break that down when we come back.CASONE: And welcome back I'm Cheryl Casone in for Maria Bartiromo. It is Thursday it is April 9th your top stories at 6:30 am eastern time. Markets are searching for direction ahead of what is certainly another blockbuster initial jobless claims report that's going to be released at 8:30 am eastern time.Economists are expecting 5.25 million Americans filed for unemployment last week. We've seen estimates go above 9 million. We're going to get the actual number at 8:30. Right now the DOW is down by 30 in the pre market. S&P down 9 and 3 quarters NASDAQ is down 36.5 in the pre market.Now all of this is after signs of that the spread of the Coronavirus is stabilizing in some hot spot that led to a big rally yesterday. As you can see the DOW closed higher by 779 NASDAQ S&P gaining as well. The S&P 500 by the way actually entered a bull market exited a bear market yesterday at the close.Spotlight on oil, investors are watching this morning's OPEC virtual meeting that meetings going to include Saudi Arabia and Russia. Oil is rising right now while jumping almost 6.5 percent on the hopes in an agreement to cut production will be put in place. To bring an end to that costly price war we're going to be looking for those headlines at 10:00 am eastern time today.And then also take a look at global market action right now. Europe has been another story there's been reports that the numbers are stabilizing in Italy by the way for Coronavirus cases. In Spain as well so a little bit optimism the FTSE is higher.Right now the CAC 40 slightly lower. The DAX is higher. There is optimism growing that this threat is slowing down across the continent. Meanwhile, an update for you U. K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson does remain in intensive care. He is battling the Coronavirus but his condition reportedly has improved this morning.Now take a look at Asia. Overnight markets there were actually mostly higher except for in Japan the NIKKEI slightly losing for the cost of the HANG SENG and the SHANGHAI all gaining ground. Hong Kong announced nearly $18 billion in this stimulus it is mostly going to be focused on helping workers they're impacted by the Coronavirus.Well the body of Robert F. Kennedy's great grandson has been recovered. Jackie DeAngelis has all the details. Jackie, good morning.JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS: Good morning to you Cheryl. 8- year-old Gideon McCain and his mother Maeve Kennedy Townsend McCain went missing after canoe accident in the Chesapeake Bay last week. Her body was found on Monday. The family thanked searchers for bringing them some closure.And Linda Tripp a key figure in the Clinton impeachment has died aged Tripp secretly recorded conversations with Former White House Intern Monica Lewinsky during her affair with President Clinton. Hearing Tripp was near death Lewinski tweeted "No matter the past upon hearing that Linda Tripp is very seriously ill I hope for her recovery. I can't imagine how difficult this is for a family" Tripp who reportedly was fighting cancer was 70- years-old.And we work reportedly deferring rent payments and some of its locations as the COVID-19 pandemic hits revenue. Sources say the move comes as "We Work" tries to renegotiate leases with landlords. The Coronavirus outbreak is the latest challenge to "We Work's" future after receiving a bailout by Softbank following a botched initial public offering.And Google banning its employees from using Zoom the company emailing employees telling them to stop using the teleconferencing platform over its security privacy woes. Have you heard of the new trendy Zoom bottoming sounds funny but it's not Zoom CEO tells R. Charles Payne that the company is taking steps to fix its security flaws. Google isn't the first company to ban Zoom. Tesla stopped using the app earlier this month. Cheryl?CASONE: You know Jackie I actually wanted to you know "See my friends last night" and that we did a Zoom call and I realized that probably wasn't a good idea.DEANGELIS: Yes. It's a little dangerous but at the same time during these you know crisis times we have to have some way to be able to connect with people.CASONE: Yes.DEANGELIS: And Zoom was one popular way to do it.CASONE: It has a lot of companies are still using it even though they're probably not supposed to. Jackie DeAngelis in our Newsroom. Jackie thank, you for all those headlines. We'd want to get back to oil we were watching those contract right now. There's optimism out there.Look at this it's up almost 6.25 percent and the contract rallied yesterday. A lot going on in oil the world's largest oil producers are having this virtual meeting today 10:00 am eastern time. Those are really hoping that there's going to be a deal to cut production maybe 8 or 10 million barrels a day between this would be really between the Saudis and the Russians and that would end this costly price war that has really been hurting Steve Moore.U. S. energy companies especially shale producers because you know a lot of people don't realize Steve that we still import a certain amount of foreign oil because we can't - our refineries can't process all forms of domestic shale.MOORE: Well, that's right. Yes, I wrote a book about the whole shale revolution about 5 or 6 years ago that it's the amazing thing is Cheryl, that the 2008, 2009 recession remember that one before we had this one.That would be lifted out of that recession because of the shale oil and gas boom. It caught totally resurrected the economy and now they're almost those companies from North Dakota to Texas to Oklahoma to Pennsylvania Ohio those companies are almost victim of their own success because they created such a boom in oil production first in the U.S. and then in other countries around the world that you're seeing this depression on the price.But let me correct you on one thing you know you said this costly oil and gas war. Well yes, it's costly for the companies but hate crimes costly for consumers, right?CASONE: We can try.MOORE: You've seen the lowest gasoline prices that we see in decades. But we do have to do something to get a rise to these companies because they are - you go to some of those places and Texas and Oklahoma and Pennsylvania and Ohio now they're shutting down the wells really rapidly. So there is going to be some relief and you're seeing it now with the rise in prices.CASONE: I doubt. Lee Carter jump into this because I - Steven makes a great point that we've got these incredibly low retail gasoline prices across the country and we can't go anywhere.CARTER: Really fascinating time because usually when prices of gas are low it makes people feel better about the economy because they can go further than go places there's a lot of benefits to you and overall feelings and sentiments. But now you're right like this is a very, very unusual time where we can't enjoy the gas prices because we're all stuck at home.So I think one of the things that we're going to be seeing too is yes, the President isn't going to get the benefit of any of these kinds of things that actually do make Americans feel better about the economy. When you look at people's opinion of the economy and what they're afraid it's really, really bad.And you're looking at a President who has always the thing that people have always said no matter what it is I might not like all annex I might not support him in all these things but the economy is what he's good at. And I think that that's a big problem for him.CASONE: No, no. I agree. You know Mattie I want to bring you in because you know President Trump has said that he might use tariffs on oil if he had to. But at this point you know he's still optimistic that there's actually going to be an agreement.We've heard him - he has asked about that in a couple of the Coronavirus briefings. Obviously we're going to see how the President response to what the Saudis and the Russians do? But that you know the tariffs on oil imports is still kind of out there. I'm not sure the oil CEOs like it Mattie but I know that the President has considered it in past.DUPPLER: Well, you know who else would it like it would be those consumers that both Lee and Stephen just mentioned. Tariffs on imports increased prices here at home. So that would be a price effect that Americans would probably feel at a time when we're entering a recession and Americans are concerned about their household budgets.So I think that tariff imports at this point could potentially backfire for the President you know there are a number of other proposals out there to try and combat some of the recalcitrance from the OPEC countries.Senator Dan Sullivan from Alaska had suggested that perhaps we shouldn't be spending so much money and sending so much military support over to the Kingdom if that's the way they're going to treat this energy glad.I think that's probably a more effective route and of course the President needs to continue to negotiate with our allies to continue to use the full economic thrust of the United States while the entire globe is facing a slowdown the United States of course had a very strong economy heading into this pandemic.So we certainly have more cards to play perhaps than other actors particularly in the energy space.CASONE: Yes. I know that's a really good point and you know I have to say Steve as we wrap it up I mean who thought that going to the gas station was one of the most exciting things that we as Americans could do?MOORE: Yes. I haven't driven my car in weeks. But look there's a big political dimension that that we should just all be thinking about here. Think about those states I mention Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas another state New Mexico those are all battleground states.Donald Trump obviously doesn't want to go into November with a depression in the oil patch state scoring could be very costly in terms of who wins those big, big electoral rich states?CASONE: And he wants the economy opened as soon as we can and I know they're working on that at the White House potentially a second you know task force to do that. Alright guys thank you very much. We'll see all of you just a few moments.We've got a lot more coming up everyone could stay with us because well, we are saying grounded how airlines are fighting to keep customers safe while struggling to stay in the skies? We're going to talk about that coming up next.CASONE: Oil extending yesterday's rally we're looking at the contract right now. It really has jumped a lot and as you can see we're up almost 7 percent now. So the contract is actually inching higher. A lot of news in oil today and remember oil and this fight between the Saudis and the Russians is one of the big things that kind of kicked off the bear market of the world's largest oil producer is going to be meeting today virtually 10:00 am eastern time.Investors are hoping that they're going to cut a deal to cut production maybe 8 to 10 million barrels per day is kind of the hope at this point. But this is been a price war. Let's bring in Trafigura CEO Jeremy Weir.Jeremy we obviously have high expectations that the Saudis and the Russians can do something President Trump is optimistic are you optimistic?JEREMY WEIR, TRAFIGURA CEO: Good morning Cheryl and thank you for having me here with you this morning. We're certainly live in extraordinary times and you know heartfelt wishes go out to all those people suffering from the COVID-19 virus.The ones that is the old market I mean but obviously the prices really significantly. 10 million barrels cut is effectively what we believe is actually already embed into the process the expectation. And we have to see what happens once agreed later this afternoon?What I would say is and I think it's you know the initiative which is being undertaken by the President and by the Administration in trying to get all parties together to cut the production is a very positive initiative for the oil industry longer term because we're you know the industry really is in a severe distress and severe oversupply.CASONE: And Jeremy that we were talking about this in the last segment about obviously what's happening on the domestic front for U.S. oil producers? And you know that the big energy CEOs were at the White House with the President and he you know he had been asked by some Republican lawmakers kind of pushed if you will to maybe put tariffs on oil on the imports that we're bringing in particularly from the Middle East.And you know he didn't really commit to that. He said may be but these CEOs don't really want to see that in U. S. shale producers as well. How likely are tariffs if we don't get the kind of cut we need to see today from OPEC and the Russians?WEIR: I don't - I don't have a lot due to the tariffs but I think speaking truly from a physical as a physical market participant. I'm not from the politics behind this issue is it you know - certain crudes are required to blend and refined properly.And so therefore the importation of crudes really who are still the heavier crudes which makes with a lot of crudes produced in the U.S. So therefore if those imports are not allowed it probably can have a negative impact on the refineries production and their efficiency level so you know that's a critical issue.CASONE: Right. All right Jeremy Weir thank you for weighing in on this topic. Obviously we're going to be following that news right here on Fox Business 10:00 am eastern time everybody. We are going to be hoping to get those headlines out of that virtual meeting between OPEC and the Russians and obviously there's been somewhat of a price war between the two and a lot of that is seems to have fallen on the Russians.Let's bring in and talk about the airlines because like if you think about it. The airlines I mean they're shut down basically right now but what if jet fuel actually was cheaper for them for the rest of the year?Also big news they've been now told that they've got to give their customers refunds for cancelled flights that's a big story as well as Boyd Group International President and Aviation Analyst Mike Boyd, Mike good morning.MIKE BOYD, BOYD GROUP INTERNATIONAL PRESIDENT: Good morning to you.CASONE: All right. Oh Gosh I don't know where to start? Let's start with that jet fuel though discussion and then we'll get to the customer issue. Because you know what I mean and obviously jet fuel is one of the most expensive things they have. Airlines but they put in place negotiated contracts but those contracts are only six months a year.Now they have no customers. Capacity has been has been destroyed for the airlines have been look they've obviously gotten bailout money looking for ballot make money from the government. And there was a one bright spot for the industry that you can see right now.BOYD: Yes. It's a bright spot for the industry but it regardless what fuel costs there's nobody on the airplanes. So it's kind of a wash the real long term thing is if these prices stay down like that. Good news for the airlines real bad news for Boeing and Airbus because you're not going to need new airplanes to save fuel. You can pick up a bunch of work and ones that are sitting all over the world.CASONE: Now Boeing - we've also learned this week that Boeing just because you brought this up Mike that they have new software issues with the Max. And that they were hoping to get those planes back up in the air you know this fall. You know those new issues for Boeing seem to be something that's got a lot of people concerned that that Max is going to return at all in 2020?BOYD: It's going to be a real problem. First of all the U. S. airline industry going forward is not to need a lot of new airplanes. You know the impetus with a math that saved 15 percent on fuel while OPEC took care of that already. So I think the real issue for Boeing is not so much the glitches but we're even a sellers but it is going to be huge numbers of cancellations.For example China's going to have probably 600 excesses their plan. They're not going to need new ones. The U. S. carriers the same thing. So I think going forward Max or not written and is going to be in trouble.CASONE: Right. And real quick for you Boyd I don't have a lot of time but I want to ask you about the fact airlines are now being told you have to refund money to people when their flights are cancelled. They cancel themselves. I mean I can't believe we have to tell the airlines to do this but that's what it's come down to?BOYD: Yes. It's unfortunate. Somehow airlines get the impression when you book a seat you've made a commitment to fly regardless at some point. You can't get me to Omaha for the funeral because of a pandemic. I really like my money back and no I don't want to keep it in your bank account for a year with a lot of fine print.CASONE: This is why--BOYD: They really should refund that money and they should do it now.CASONE: That's why you look at some angry when they asked for $50 billion of the government but they still don't get. Mike Boyd, thank you very much good to see.BOYD: Thank you.CASONE: We'll be right back.CASONE: Well, the NFL 2020 draft is going to be happening just virtually team personnel are working from home for the League's largest off season event certainly one of the biggest events that we have when it comes to teeing up the season.I want to bring in the panel and talk a little football because at this point, Lee Carter, we need some football and hope it comes back. What do you make of the fact that this is now a virtual draft for the League? It's going to look well incredible by different.CARTER: It's going to look so different. But one other thing that I really hopeful about is with all the fantasy football and all of that kind of fun you can have around the draft. I'm hoping that they can make some more virtual fund out of all this because I think we all need a distraction.We only a moment we want to root for our teams. We want to hope for better times. We want to think about making chilly and watching football in a time of happiness and relaxation rather than the situations we are in. And so I'm hoping that we could come up with some fun games around all of that.CASONE: Yes. And you now see - you're a football fan like I am and part of the draft that I always love is seeing the people - the players and their families. You know they're sitting at their couches and they had that live shot and they are there on the couch they find out which teams are going to?I mean I'm thinking we might still get that a fact despite social distancing because up there with say their wife and children or their mother that they may be live with and we might so I kind of get some of that those smiles and that joy?MOORE: Yes. Give me that show.CASONE: Yes, Steve. Yes.MOORE: All right. So you know the amazing thing about the NFL draft it shows the power of football over our society that in the last 5, 6, 7 or 8 years the NFL draft has become an incredible audience grab around TV.People love to watch it. All they talk about you know I'm getting sick of turning on some of these sports stations and all you hear is your what pick this guy over that guy. But it'll be - I've never watched - I'm going to watch that draft on the virtual draft I think it will be kind of cool.CASONE: Curious to see again how it's going to affect the players, Mattie? At the same time I mean, we have to save our hope about whether it's baseball or basketball or football coming back, the question mark I think now is how comfortable are people going to be eventually and when getting together in a stadium, Mattie, final word?DUPPLER: I think that's true, but listen, your point about how this all can be connected remotely with the draft I think it is going to remind people that we will get there eventually we will all be together celebrating our sports soon once again.CASONE: Well said, we'll be right back.Load-Date: April 9, 2020End of Document

Chinese city discriminating against blacksUSA TODAYApril 17, 2020 FridayFIRST EDITIONCopyright 2020 Gannett Company, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 5ALength: 1164 wordsByline: Matthew Brown, USA TODAYBodyThe claim: A McDonald's location in China prohibited black people from enteringA sign barring black people from entering a McDonald's in the Chinese city of Guangzhou has gone viral on social media. The image, as well as video of an argument at the site, has become a flashpoint in a broader debate about racism in China's  response to the coronavirus pandemic."We've been informed that from now on black people are not allowed to enter the restaurant," the sign in thepost reads. "For the sake of your health consciously notify the local police for medical isolation, please understand the inconvenience caused.""An African man was reportedly asked to leave a McDonald's in the Chinese city of Guangzhou. The incident comes amid the growing number of reports of racial profiling and discrimination against Black people in the city," Nextshark posted on Instagram.Other incidents of discrimination against black people in Guangzhou have been reported.Videos of African residents being evicted from their homes by landlords over fears of COVID-19 were also posted to Facebook and other platforms."Apparently, people of Guangzhou are convinced that Africans in the city are responsible for the spread, and their racist and xenophobic precautions are leaving many black people without proper living conditions," The Shade Room wrote on Instagram.Government officials from African nations, China and the United States have spoken out on the controversy, and McDonald's has apologized for the sign.Guangzhou's African community and COVID-19Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, is a major international hub in southeast China. Situated in the Pearl River Delta metropolitan area alongside major cities Hong Kong, Macau and Shenzhen, the region is one of the wealthiest and most populous in the world.The city was home to one of the largest African communities in Asia, though that number has significantly fallen because ofimmigration crackdowns by the Chinese government. The region remains a major port and commercial site for business people operating between the continents.The incident at the Guangzhou McDonald's location was confirmed by the company, which said in a statement that the report was "not representative of our inclusive values.""Immediately upon learning of an unauthorized communication to our guests at a restaurant in Guangzhou, we immediately removed the communication and temporarily closed the restaurant," the company told USA TODAY.McDonald's also stated it would provide training "to further educate managers and employees on our values, which includes serving all members of the communities in which we operate."The incident appears to be part of a larger trend of racial incidents experienced by black people in the city after a state media report said that five Nigerian men broke quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19.Government officials and private businesses cracked down after the report; African communities in Guangzhou have reported targeted lockdowns and forced coronavirus testing in the city. In addition to being barred from stores, as in the McDonald's controversy, reports of black people being evicted from their homes have also surfaced.Guangzhou's police department and public health officials told reporters Tuesday that they had reacted to rumors that "300,000 black people in Guangzhou were setting off a second epidemic," which "caused panic." They now say the rumor was false.Xinhua, China's official state news agency, reported that 111 Africans in Guangzhou had tested positive for coronavirus and that 19 of those cases were "imported" from outside the country. The government had also required 4,553 African people to undergo testing since April 4.To date, the Chinese government has officially reported 1,566 cases of COVID-19 and eight deaths in Guangdong Province. There is no evidence that the disease is disproportionately represented in the city's African community.Diplomats and politicians from dozens of African nations have sharply criticized the moves, many opining that the actions taken against residents are racist and xenophobic."My Office invited the Chinese Amb to the AU, Mr. Liu Yuxi, to express our extreme concern at allegations of maltreatment of Africans in #Guangzhou+called for immediate remedial measures in line with our excellent relations," Moussa Faki Mahamat, chairperson of the African Union, tweeted."I have been briefed on the inhumane treatment being meted out to Ghanaians and other African nationals in the People's Republic of China," Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey, Ghana's Foreign Minister, said in a statement. "I regret and highly condemn this act of ill-treatment and racial discrimination."Femi Gbajabiamila, Nigeria's speaker of the House, criticized the "inhumane treatment"that Africans were experiencing in Guangzhou during a conversation with Chinese officials."We take it very seriously," China's ambassador to Nigeria, Zhou Pingjian, replied.Chinese officials have responded by meeting with delegations from several countries. Lijian Zhao, the spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, said that the Chinese government would "continue responding to the African side's reasonable concerns and legitimate appeals.""At the meeting, it was announced that the Government of the People's Republic of China had taken note of happenings and was taking immediate steps to stop the targeting of and ill-treatment meted out to Africans, particularly our compatriots in the Guangdong Province," a statement from Ghana's Foreign Ministry reads.African Americans in Guangzhou have also reported experiencing discrimination during the crackdown. In response, the U.S. Consulate there issued a statement cautioning black Americans from traveling to the city."The U.S. Consulate General advises African Americans or those who believe Chinese officials may suspect them of having contact with nationals of African countries to avoid the Guangzhou metropolitan area until further notice," a U.S. State Department report from Monday reads. "Without advance warning, officials might require such individuals to submit to a COVID-19 test and undergo 14 days of supervised quarantine at their own expense.""It is immoral & irresponsible to sow discord when we need solidarity. We urge U.S. to focus on #COVID19 at home & stop driving the wedge between China & Africa," Zhao said of the American statement.Zhao also said the Chinese government was mainly concerned with limiting "overseas imports" of COVID-19 but acknowledged that "there might be some misunderstandings in the implementation of measures."Our ruling: TrueA McDonald's location in Guangzhou did post a statement barring black people from entering the restaurant. This incident appears to be part of a larger trend of  targeting people of African descent in the city, which has been fueled by rumors about the spread of COVID-19 in African communities there. We rate this claim TRUE, as it is supported by our research.Contributing: Joshua Bote Load-Date: April 17, 2020End of Document

State Department asks Americans working for Chinese media to share personal detailsCNN WireMay 22, 2020 Friday 2:00 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 923 wordsDateline: LONDON (CNN Business) BodyLONDON (CNN Business) --  The State Department is asking all US-based employees of Chinese state TV network CGTN to fill out detailed questionnaires with personal information, alarming American employees of the network, CNN has learned.It's a result of five Chinese state media outlets being labeled Foreign Missions by the US earlier this year, marking them as extensions of Beijing's government and requiring them to comply with the same rules that govern foreign embassies and consulates.The action is part of a broader tit-for-tat between China and the United States, with media outlets in both countries serving as proxies.The five-page form, titled "State Department OFM (Office of Foreign Missions) Questionnaire," asks for employees' personal information as well as information about their spouses, children, and anyone else they live with, along with where the employee has worked for the past five years. A copy of the form was shared with CNN by two CGTN employees who did not want to be named for fear of reprisal. All CGTN employees, including those who are American citizens, have until Monday to complete the questionnaire.In an email to staff, shared by one of the CGTN employees, CGTN's legal department wrote the information normally is required only from diplomatic staff."We sincerely regret that OFM is requiring you to provide this information, but our request to OFM for some reasonable accommodation for employees who are US citizens or permanent residents was rejected," the email states. A State Department spokesperson told CNN the form sent to CGTN employees was not created by the government, but that the information is the same as what is required of any employee of a foreign mission, such as an embassy or consulate. Foreign missions are required to supply the information via a secure online web portal."It is necessary for the Department of State to have a record of individuals employed by all foreign missions in the United States," the spokesperson said. "Such information is managed in accordance with any protections that exist under Department policy and the Privacy Act of 1974."CGTN, the international arm of Chinese state television, has staff in more than 70 countries. Its bureaus employ both local and Chinese employees, though Chinese executives have final say on editorial matters. Staffers tell CNN that while they are often left to report as they see fit on some topics, subject matters such as Tibet are often deemed off limits. Stories on the Hong Kong protestors or the minority Muslim "reeducation" camps in Xinjiang, are presented in a way that is favorable to the Chinese government, despite protests from Western staffers. The network is currently under investigation by the UK media regulator for violating bias and impartiality rules.CGTN has played a key part of the Chinese government's overall strategy to muddy the waters of the coronavirus narrative through its state and social media. Segments have robustly defended China's response to the virus in the face of Western criticism, questioning the motives behind the critiques while showing off Chinese donations of medical supplies and expertise around the world. The five Chinese state media outlets labeled as foreign missions -- CGTN, Xinhua, China Radio International, the China Daily and the People's Daily -- now require US government approval to buy or lease office space, are limited in the number of Chinese employees they can have on staff, and must register personnel changes including new hires and staff departures with the State Department, just as foreign diplomatic missions do.In mid-March China announced it would expel journalists from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post, in a major escalation of tensions with Washington. The move was widely condemned by international news organizations. "The U.S. is taking this action in order to clearly communicate the severity of our concerns about the abusive, unfair, and non-reciprocal treatment of international press in China," a State Department official said at a press briefing on March 8. The second CGTN employee told CNN they see the questionnaires from the State Department as a way to pressure Americans to leave the network."Several people have told me they are considering quitting, but the pandemic is making it harder to do that," the employee said. "There is a sense the State Department wants to brand us as spies and create the impression that if we continue to work here we will he unemployable in the future. Including family members adds to the intimidation factor."The employee argued that while there are "valid concerns" around China's lack of press freedoms, the US is "supposed to be better than that" and allow freedom of the press, even if it's "unpopular speech."CGTN did not respond to a request for comment. But in a statement posted to its website in March, the channel slammed the foreign mission label as "hypocritical.""The US State Department has increased its control over Chinese media, while violating hallowed US commitments to freedom of speech and the press," the statement said. "US government suppression won't deter us from providing the world with more high-quality news.We hope the US government will cease politicizing legitimate news operations. CGTN provides a window on Chinese culture and a platform for Chinese perspectives on international affairs."Michael Callahan contributed to this report. TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Former Nonprofit Researcher Arrested For Hiding $3 Million In Chinese Funding While Accepting US GrantsThe Daily CallerMay 14, 2020 Thursday 08:11 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc.

(Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images)Authorities also allege that Wang participated in the Thousand Talents Program, a Chinese-government talent recruitment program that in some cases has resulted in violations of U.S law, including espionage, theft of trade secrets and grant fraud. Due to his admission into the program, Wang received $3 million in research funding from China to enhance the facilities at the Chinese university where he served as a dean. While receiving NIH funding, the Chinese government also provided Wang with free accommodations like travel and lodging for his trips to China, which included a three-bedroom apartment on campus for his own personal use. The charges against Wang are part of US law enforcement's crackdown on Chinese influence in American institutions, especially academic centers. Former Emory University professor Dr. Xiao-Jang Li pleaded guilty May 11 to filing false tax returns which omitted at least $500,000 in Chinese government funding.

We're doing something now. I think you'll find it very interesting, but I won't be talking about it today, I'll be talking about it over the next couple of days.Something you're going to be hearing about over the next -- before the end of the week.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me now is "Nuclear Showdown" author Gordon Chang along with Fox Business' Dagen McDowell, Senior Fellow at the National Taxpayers Union and Forward Strategies President Mattie Duppler and Forbes Media Chairman, Former Republican Presidential Candidate himself, Steve Forbes.Great to see everybody this morning. Welcome.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR: Welcome.BARTIROMO: And Gordon, welcome to you.GORDON CHANG, NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN AUTHOR: Good morning.BARTIROMO: So thrilled to have you here this morning. Thanks so much for joining me. Your reaction to what has taken place in Hong Kong overnight and what the president said, you'll know what we're going to do by the end of the week. Do you think it will be sanctions on the CCP, the Chinese Communist Party?CHANG: Well, in Hong Kong, Maria -- yes, in Hong Kong, Maria, we have seen an escalation, because the Hong Kong police flooded the streets and they were arresting people indiscriminately.Really this is an attempt to choke off not only freedom of speech but freedom of assembly. We've got to do something. Now, many people say, what can we do. Well first of all, we can revoke the sanctions exemptions that apply to Hong Kong, we can impose global Magnitsky sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials, and we can cease the assets of Chinese and Hong Kong officials, like Jimmy Lai mentioned to you yesterday.But the other thing that we need to do is view this into context. China is attacking us across the board.So, our response should be across the board. And that means what we do right now should not just limited to Hong Kong, it should be limited to all the other things that Beijing has been doing, stealing U.S. intellectual property, looks like it's not honoring the Phase 1 Trade Deal.It is now interfering with the U.S. Navy and the Global Commons. And of course with China's Wolf Warrior diplomacy, it is trying to grab territory from its neighbors. So clearly this is the moment we must act.BARTIROMO: Yes, I -- I'm glad you mentioned Jimmy Lai and also the president last week talked to me about this and -- and basically said, look, the Chinese Communist Party wants to renegotiate the Phase 1 deal, I'm not renegotiating anything.So we don't -- we don't know as -- as a confirm that they want to renegotiate, but the president said that to me last week.You mentioned Jimmy Lai, he's the Founder of Apple Daily, he's a Chinese entrepreneur. He's been in front of this from the whole time on the front lines and he joined me to talk about this ongoing fight with authorities. I want to get your take on something he said yesterday. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JIMMY LAI, FOUNDER OF APPLE DAILY: People like us who have dissidence, who fight for freedom will never be -- we'll be arrested and maybe sent to China for trial.BARTIROMO: They do want to arrest you again, right? How are you continuing to stay free when you know you -- right behind you you've got people looking to lock you up?LAI: Well, I'm not thinking about my safety at this moment. I'm thinking of how -- how should we keep on fighting.I think it's a good time now, the world especially America, confront the CCP. This is a time to confront China. This is the time to change China in order to change the world.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: So Gordon, knowing that the Chinese Communist Parties goals is to be the number one super power in the world, economically as well as militarily and seeing the display that the CCP put out there, you know, putting people in jail. They don't want anyone having this free speech. Do you think the rest of the world is with the United States on this? Do you think that he president has a group of allies globally to push back against the CCP right now?CHANG: Well, I think that across the world and it's not just the west, people agree that something's got to be done about China, and Hong Kong has become the flash point. I don't know how far other countries are prepared to go, but the one thing we know, Maria, is that what is possible changes by the day.So, I think that in a short period of time President Trump will be able to put together that coalition, because the U.S. is willing to take stern measures and I think the world will follow leadership from President Trump.You know, one thing about what Jimmy Lai said to you yesterday, which I think is absolutely critical. He also said, we in Hong Kong have two choices, we can flee or we can fight. And I see Jimmy Lai, of course, fighting and I think many people in Hong Kong will stay and fight as well.And because China has closed off the political process, this is now going to be determined in the streets of Hong Kong, and that means going forward there is going to be ugly situation one day after another as we saw today.BARTIROMO: Yes. I want to get Steve Forbes in here in a minute, but I've got to ask you your thoughts on global CEOs right now, Gordon. Do you think corporate CEOs get it? I mean, I know that the allure of selling to 1.4 billion people in China can be too much because it's all about the money and you want to sell to those people so you have to roll over when it comes to the CCP, but this morning we've got a situation around YouTube. Of course, the parent company is Google, Alphabet.YouTube is responding to allegations that it deleted comments related to criticism of the Chinese government. People online documenting how the phrases communist bandit or 50 cent party using Chinese characters are being automatically deleted. YouTube says that it's a glitch due to an error in the automated moderation system. However, I spoke with Palmer Luckey. Palmer Lucky has been a guest on this program. He's the founder of Anduril Industries. He made a comment about the CCP and YouTube deleted it. What do you think about that?CHANG: Yes. Well, I think that certainly Google does have a problem because they've been doing this for quite some time. We've got to remember that Google has some very important business relationships in China, and three of them are critical. They've got three artificial intelligence partnerships, and I think it's up to President Trump to force them to stop that, to get them to withdraw because first of all they are helping the Chinese military against us, and indeed it is giving Google and incentive to do the things you just talked about which is to censor those comments. So there needs to be an assessment of Google's relationship, and it's not just Google. It's other like Microsoft that have been engaged in helping China develop the surveillance networks that are being used against Uyghurs, Kosiks (ph), and indeed all of the Chinese people.BARTIROMO: That's exactly right, and that is why the president pulled that money to the Thrift Fund, our military money past and present, the 401(k) of the military that they were going to invest in those very companies building tanks, et cetera. Steve Forbes, jump in here real quick for Gordon. I mean, you can look back to World War II and say to your self, OK, imagine if companies around World War II, American companies said to the U.S. government, look, I don't want to work with you because I need a foothold in imperial Japan?STEVE FORBES, FORBES MEDIA CHAIRMAN: Well, that's exactly what did happen in the 1930s till Roosevelt in 1941 cut off oil shipments from the U.S. to Japan, which helped bring things to a head in December. So we've done this. We've been here before. I want to get - Gordon, you said we have to see this in a larger context in the South China Sea. Should the U.S. start to do what the Chinese did and put a physical presence in the South China Sea so if a confrontation ever came we'd have the means to cut off oil shipments to China? I know the Navy and the Marines are considering this. What do you - what would you recommend to tell our allies we are there, we're physically here?CHANG: I think something symbolic like that would be important. I think more important, Steve, we need to tell our allies, look, China has been reclaiming features in the South China Sea. Go ahead and reclaim your features as well so that you - for instance, you have Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines. Do the same thing, and that would show China that its actions are counterproductive.Also, we need to be a bit more aggressive on our freedom of navigation exercises, and we need to tell the Chinese in public as well as private that they may not interfere with the U.S. Navy or the U.S. Air Force in the global commons because they've been picking up the tempo of dangerous intercepts in the last several months.BARTIROMO: Really, really important issues. Gordon, we're glad you're here to walk us through it together. Thank you so much, Gordon Chang. Good to see you, sir. We will talk with you soon. Gordon.CHANG: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: We will be right back. Stay with us.Welcome back. Markets reporting to a big rally this morning. Taking a look at the market where we stand, we are expecting the Dow to extend yesterday's big rally. The Dow Industrials right now up 357 points. The S&P's up 35. Nasdaq up 76. All three major averages finishing sharply higher yesterday. Investors are weighing the rising tensions between Washington and Beijing as well as hopes of a COVID-19 vaccine amidst all of the reopenings.Joining us right now is Verdence Capital Advisors CEO, Leo Kelly. Leo, great to have you this morning. Thanks for being here. How do you allocate capital during this environment right now?LEO KELLY, VERDENCE CAPITAL ADVISORS CEO: Well Maria, the move that we've seen here recently is obviously a big one, and we still have a lot of water to carry with the economy. So the answer to your question is carefully. We have since the beginning of this crisis at the very bottom told clients be disciplined, stay focused, and rebalance your allocation. It's no different now. The market's up quite a bit and if you were smart enough to keep rebalancing, those positions are higher, and you have to keep that discipline to not let the risk get too far out, but we'll also say that the S&P 500 doesn't necessarily represent the whole market, so there's still value out there for investors to look at. It's just it's how much do you believe that we're actually coming out of this and what it's going to look like in 2021.BARTIROMO: Yes, I want to ask you what you think it's going to like. I mean, we've got more layoffs coming out. Boeing has layoffs to come. The company reportedly said to announce nearly 3,000 voluntary layoffs as the COVID-19 pandemic hits air travel hard. Boeing's not the only company feeling the pinch, of course. AMTRAC also planning to cut 20 percent of its workforce in the next fiscal year. This from an internal memo sent to employees yesterday according to The Wall Street Journal this morning. Leo, your reaction to where we are and whether or not we're going to be able to get back to where we were sooner rather than later. What are you expecting in terms of the economy rest of the year and into 2021?KELLY: Well Maria, I think when you think about the economy coming out of this crisis and you need to make decisions on allocating capital, I think you have to remember the term rate of change, and that's the term that we constantly talk about. What is the rate of change for the economic activity for the science around testing and vaccines and data around the coronavirus, giving us more accurate data, the politics of this whole thing. It's all rate of change.So from our perspective I think it's - I don't think you can think this is going to just snap right back, but the positive -(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Right.KELLY: -- part of this whole process is the rate of change is growing exponentially and science that's pulling the economy with it. And we're just starting to see -(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: OK.KELLY: -- some early data that's positive.BARTIROMO: So Steve Forbes, real quick. You're on the president's task force for reopening the economy. How's it going so far in week one where we have all 50 states having some sort of opening even if it's slower than others?FORBES: Oh, I think you're seeing what you're going to see is more states putting - doing things. They're going to put pressure on other states to get their act together, so talking about momentum I think that's fair. And Leo, you have said in the past in terms of investing you've got to go with high risk, otherwise you're going to get low-risk returns. What areas or companies can you recommend now that you think may look risky but have a payout if you're a disciplined investors a year, two years down the road, three years?BARTIROMO: Real quick.KELLY: Well yes, Steve. First of all, risk is a function of time as well as movement of money, so sometimes the high risk is not, right? The high- price securities that have already run take on more price risk because of that run.BARTIROMO: Right.FORBES: Right.KELLY: So for us, having a barbelled approached in financials, industrials, there's a lot out there that you can still buy today that have not made the significant rally and they're just now starting to go. The key is what's your time horizon.BARTIROMO: All right, we'll - yes. We will - we will look at that. Leo, great to see you this morning. Thank you so much. Leo Kelly -(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Thank you. Good to be here.BARTIROMO: -- joining us there. We've got a quick break, and then ready for take off. Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, will join me live next as SpaceX prepares to make history launching its first human crew to orbit today at 4 o'clock. And then a war over words. In an unprecedented move, Twitter is now labeling President Trump's tweets with a fact check warning. It is sparking fresh outrage over bias in the media. Back in a moment with that.Welcome back. Voting amid the coronavirus pandemic, Twitter putting a warning label on one of President Trump's tweets for the first time ever yesterday after the president tweeted about potential risks of mail-in voting, telling users to, quote, "get the facts". The president fighting back, accusing Twitter of election interference and stifling free speech. Now, earlier this month when I sat down with President Trump at the White House, I asked him about the risks of voting by mail.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)So there's another kind of interference, and that could be fooling around with voting machines. I mean, in terms of voting by mail, vote proxies, what's your take?DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Voting by mail is very dangerous because people can grab them. People can take that proxy, sign a name. They can - they can do all sorts of things, especially harvesting. They go out and they say just let's put them all together, and that's happened.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: Interesting that this is now front and center. Dagen McDowell, your take?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: Well, Twitter did warn President Trump's team going back to I think it was on May 20 about putting misleading statements out. The issue was that he tweeted that Michigan had sent absentee ballots ahead of the primaries, absentee ballots to people. Michigan had sent applications for absentee ballots and President Trump then deleted the tweet. However, if Twitter's going to fact check the president, maybe it ought to get the fact check right because initially Twitter in part of its fact check and its relying on news organizations with a questionable history of getting, well, history right, particularly with the Russia collusion fable that was told to the American people. I digress, but in part of the fact check Twitter was saying that mail-in ballots are already used in some states including Oregon, Utah, and Nebraska, but that statement appears to conflate automatic all-mail voting with absentee ballots in regard to Nebraska. Nebraska did send mailed applications to every voter in response to the pandemic, but the state didn't automatically send ballots.This is a - this is in The Wall Street Journal today, and in the fact check that Twitter also put out, it said fact checkers say there is no evidence that mail-in ballots are linked to voter fraud. Well, here's a quote for you. "Absentee ballots remain the largest source of potential voter fraud," unquote. That is from a bipartisan commission in 2005 led by the former President of the United States, Jimmy Carter, and the former Secretary of State, James Baker. People can go and read this report, but it goes into people basically putting pressure on citizens at home and nursing homes, in the workplace intimidation and vote buying. And in fact, in the '97 Miami mayoral election, there were 36 people - 36 arrests for absentee ballot fraud, so I don't know what Twitter is talking about. If they're going to fact check people, fair enough, then they ought to hire their own team of people to do it rather than leaning on people who have a questionable history of reporting actual facts.BARTIROMO: Right. Yes, that's right, and they names The Washington Post and The New York Times, the two publications that completely got it wrong in terms of the Russia probe in the last three weeks - in the last three years. Mattie Duppler, your reaction to this because it's not just what happened with Twitter, but also remember what happened to Palmer Luckey with YouTube. These social media -(CROSSTALK)MATTIE DUPPLER, THE NATIONAL TAXPAYERS UNION SENIOR FELLOW: That's right.BARTIROMO: -- organizations are immediately just jumping to, you know, away from anybody who thinks that they think are agreeing with President Trump.DUPPLER: Right, and Maria, this comes after last November when Twitter announced that it would be banning candidate ads from its platform in order to encourage more free expression. Well, if you're doing that, then creating your own labels on some tweets while leaving others out there which may contain malicious or false information, then you're de facto allowing candidates to use the platform differently and giving candidates a different edge. So you know, I just don't understand what Twitter thinks it's getting away with here. This comes at the same time where tech (ph) trying to say, no, no, we're not publishers. We should be able to operate freely because we're just the platform by which other people publish information, which I do think is the correct approach, but they certainly make it more difficult -(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Right.DUPPLER: -- for regulators who are looking at actions like this from Twitter to allow them to continue to function that way.BARTIROMO: That's exactly right. All right, we'll take a break. When we come back I'll speak with Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross. Last time he was with us, he broke news on Huawei, but today SpaceX prepares to make history launching its first human crew to orbit. We're going to ask the secretary about that. Stay with us. Back in a moment.MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS HOST, MORNINGS WITH MARIA: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, May 27th. Your top stories right now, it is 6:32 a.m. on the East coast.We got a rally underway once again. Futures indicating that we will stocks extend yesterday's big move. Dow Industrials up 350 points. The S&P futures up 36 and the NASDAQ futures higher by 76. This after the shortened trading week kicked off with a big rally yesterday thanks to optimism over the coronavirus vaccine trials and the reopening of America. As you see, markets higher across the board.Globally as well, European indices are higher. Take a look, investors are looking toward a stimulus package in the Eurozone. The FT100's up 87. Quatre Quarante up 78 and the DAX Index in Germany up 187. The European Union expected to announce a plan worth more than a trillion Euro's. Meanwhile European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde says that it is likely that the Eurozone economy will contract eight to 12 percent this year, due to the pandemic and the shutdown.In Asia overnight markets were mixed as tensions are rising in Hong Kong as China moves to restrict freedoms there. The Nikkei average was up in Japan, but the Hang Seng down 1/3 of a percent as well as the Shanghai Composite in China.Theme parks are rolling out plans to return this summer, meanwhile Cheryl Casone with that angle now. Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: That's right Maria. Good morning. Six Flags will reopen its first park in Oklahoma next week. Guests and staff are going to need face coverings to enter and the park will now require reservations will help maintain social distancing there. Disney World and Sea World are going to present their plans to reopen, actually, today. Both Florida parks have been closed since March. These plans must be approved by the local Economic Recovery Task Force, Orlando's Mayor and Governor Ron DeSantis. Disney recently reopened its Disney Springs shopping district. Universal Studio Orlando got state approval last week to reopen. That is going to be set for June 5.Well, Tesla could be yours, at least one for a lot less. The company is cutting car prices in North America as states reopen their economies. Prices falling by as much as six percent here and by four percent in China. Shares of Tesla little change ahead of the opening bell. Pretty much flat as you can see.And here is a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com. Coronavirus reportedly sees one in five teachers leaving the profession by the Fall. USA Today/Ipsos poll revealed 83 percent of educators say they're having a harder time doing their job properly. HBO Max to launch today with pre-order discount. Subscribers who pre-order and don't already pay for HBO can get joined for $12 for 12 months. Normally it's $15 a month. And finally, the best places to work in 2020. Massachusetts based software firm HubSpot claimed the top spot. Also making the list, In-N-Out Burger and Southwest Airlines. And those are all your trends, your headlines, everything you need. Maria, back to you.BARTIROMO: Alright, love that list. Best place to work, Cheryl, thank you. Meanwhile, we've got an historic space mission today. SpaceX is launching its first manned shuttle to the international space station later today, the Crew Dragon. It is the first time since 2011 that astronauts will lift off from American soil on American made rocket and spacecraft. This launch is coming on the heels of the latest initiative from the commerce department to help improve the licensing process for private US satellites fighting to put the US in the lead of the final frontier. Joining me right now is Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Mister Secretary it's good to have you this morning. Thanks very much for joining me.WILBUR ROSS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF COMMERCE: Good to be on, Maria.BARTIROMO: So, this is an exciting day. Tell me why the US wants to be front and center is space travel, and what we will see today.ROSS: Well, what has happened is, in contrast to 2011, when President Obama took us out of the space launch business, that ended our leadership in space launch. Now we're going to get it back. This is the first time since then that American rockets, American astronauts, to the American space station. And that's really important. We were paying the Russians up to $86 million dollars per seat to take our astronauts to our space station. That's now over with. And it's important, both commercially and militarily. You know the President has stood down the Space Force, which is a whole new branch of the military, because space will be the new war fighting domain.But the commercial side is very very important. It's bringing the cost of everything down, and that's what's going to facilitate space tourism, space manufacturing, space habitation, space mining, a whole bunch of new activities and that will take the industry from its current $400 billion dollar total to over a trillion dollars. So, this is a very very big deal and it's going to happen hopefully, precisely at 4:33 p.m. this afternoon from the famous launchpad 39A at the Kennedy Space Station at Cape Canaveral.BARTIROMO: Wow, it is really exciting. We're going to be taking it live later on, Wilbur, and we will look forward to that. Let me switch gears. Ask you about China and the tensions rising in Hong Kong. Riot police firing tear gas pellets at protestors. They're demonstrating over this bill criminalizing disrespect of China's National Anthem and against plans by Beijing to impose national security laws. President Trump says that, you know, saying should these laws through, they would be a response in quote, the next couple of days. What kind of a response might we expect Secretary?ROSS: Well I don't think we should get out of ahead of the President. This is a very complex situation. Our hearts go out to the individual civilians in Hong Kong. We're with them. But the President will have to decide exactly what is the appropriate response to it. And as you indicated, he has said that he will do that within the next very very few days.BARTIROMO: Yeah, because I mean, you have to distinguish between the Chinese Communist Party and Chinese people. Does it make sense to zero in and target specific the CCP with sanctions on Chinese officials?ROSS: Well there's a whole menu of potential things that he could do and I'm sure their working right now on exactly how to refine the thinking and come up with something that's an appropriate response.BARTIROMO: I see. Wilbur, let me ask you, the last time you joined us, there was breaking news on Huawei, the US moved to cut off chip supplies to Huawei from global chip makers. What has been the impact?ROSS: Well, you've seen Huawei make some very big complaints about it. But at around the same time, although it was not particularly related, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing announced that they have plans to build their new cutting edge chip factory that can make the tiniest chips of any in the world, namely five nanometer, in Arizona. That's a huge huge breakthrough, because heretofore, they've only had small facilities in Washington and elsewhere. But this will be a big deal. It's something like a $13 billion dollar project. And we believe that it will lead to more fabs being built. Fab is the operation that makes the semiconductor chip.BARTIROMO: I see.ROSS: So, this is a series of very powerful things. In addition, we more recently put 33 more Chinese entities on our so-called entities list. That was mainly for human right violation relating to the Uyghur's, a very beleaguered part of the Chinese population. And so, that was a response to that situation.BARTIROMO: I suspect the response from the Chinese Communist Government is going to be they're not going to follow through and buy that $250 billion dollars in commodities. Is that what you expect?ROSS: Oh, I think we shouldn't pre-judge either what the President will do, or what the Chinese might do in response. This is a very delicate situation. A lot of things need to be balanced. But mainly our hearts do go out to the Chinese civilians and we hope things work out well from their point of view.BARTIROMO: Okay. Yes, as we all do. Secretary, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks very much.ROSS: Thank you Maria for having me on.BARTIROMO: And great to see you. Secretary Wilbur Ross there. Coming up, the China threat. How one State Senator is fighting to keep manufacturing here in the United States. He will join me next with that plan to make sure manufacturing happens in the United States not China. And then Google gets back to work. The technology company outlining its reopening plans. Offering some employees a hefty check to stay at home. We've got those details. Wait until you hear this. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Protecting America's supply chains from China's dominance. One state Senator fighting to keep an aluminum smelter open in his community. One of only five such facilities in the entire country. China has at least 145 smelters running right now. Joining us right now is State Senator Doug Ericksen of Washington. Senator its great to have you this morning. Tell us why this issue is so important.DOUG ERICKSEN (R-WA), COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES, COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS: Hey, thanks Maria for having me on today. You know, I think America has to make a decision very shortly if we want to protect and preserve in our national interest, of the primary metal industry here in America. And aluminum being one of the key ones. As you just mentioned China has 145 to 150 smelters. They're dumping product into a down market. And American's field just can't compete with that right now. So, we're reaching out the Trump administration and Congress to try to put in place a program to keep these aluminum jobs in place, not only in Northwest Washington where I live, but all around the country.BARTIROMO: Isn't it more expensive for a company who is inputting aluminum to have its more expensive to have those smelters in the United States, right?ERICKSEN: Well right now, how do you compete against China when they're dumping product into a market? The government is subsidizing their energy comps. They have a program over there in China currently, basically the corner of the market in world aluminum, so, here in the United States there are certain things that we can be doing to make us past competitive, you know, with China, going forward. Number one, the Trump administration has to engage, which they have been doing, and keep pushing forward solutions that are going to work, you know, to get the aluminum prices to where they need to be. We should be looking to stockpile aluminum to keep the prices up on a short term basis.And then, long term, we should be looking at a loan and a grant program to go out to the aluminum industry so they can compete on the world stage. It's going to take President Trump doing what he's doing to get tough with China and the Congress stepping up and supporting him and those efforts to work together as a team to protect those crucial interests. And it's not about one smelter in Ferndale, Washington where I live. It's about the national interest, national security, and national defense. We don't want to be depending on China for aluminum to go into our fighter planes.BARTIROMO: Mattie Duppler.MATTIE DUPPLER, SENIOR FELLOW, THE NATIONAL TAXPAYERS UNION: Senator, trade goes both ways and Washington is a huge export state. Particularly to China where exports have fallen by half over the last four years, so, what may be good for steel would be very challenging for agricultural products in Washington. How do you presume to be able to protect steel when the rest of the state really depends on that trade with China to keep the economy going?ERICKSEN: You know, this is where it gets so difficult to the entire arena of trade with China. But there has to be a way to shore up our metal market. Stop China from being able to dump products. I think President Trump started us down the right path, and the aluminum industry was recovering in America before the whole COVID crisis. But what you also talk about highlights the other problem we have, which is ALCOA, which is essentially a US based company. They are selling ore from Australia into China. So, the parent company, the facility in my district is very concerned about getting involved and engaging on this at the national level because they don't want to lose the ability to sell ore into China. So, I realize this is incredibly complicated. But, you know, we see it here in Washington State with Boeing, we see it with selling our cherries and our apples and our strawberries and our raspberries, blueberries into China.So, we have to find that balance to protect this industry because we simply cannot lose the ability to smelt aluminum in the United States and be dependent on countries like China who could cut us off at any time for aluminum for our trucks, for our fighter jet planes, for our commercial airliners. You know, and also for things like ventilators where we use aluminum to go into those products.BARTIROMO: Right, well we saw that play out in real time during this pandemic when the state run media threatened that they would not send the 70 percent of prescription drugs that are made in China. Just at the time when we needed it we were in the middle of a pandemic. So, Senator, you make a lot of good points, we'll be watching the developments. Thanks, so much sir. We will see you soon.ERICKSEN: Hey, thanks for having me on.BARTIROMO: Senator Doug Ericksen, joining us from Washington State. Plus, Google getting back to work. How the technology giant is offering some employees a home office renovation, big check to do that. Wait until you hear this. And then the chicken fight, KFC testing a new twist on its chicken classic sandwich. We've got all the details coming up. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Time for the morning buzz. First up, Google announcing that it is going to pay employees $1,000 dollars each for equipment and office furniture as they work from home. Google says it's planning to reopen offices starting on July 6. But many employees can work remotely until September, or even next year. Mattie, you're take, they're actually giving them money to set up the office at home too.DUPPLER: Well I would argue that Google should not give employees money, but instead have employees get reimbursed for office expenses. Why? Because then it's not taxable income. If Google's just giving $1,000 dollars out to their workers, that's taxable income that they need to account for at the end of the year when they're filing their taxes. So, I would just be aware of that if you're a worker for Google, make sure that you're holding on to a couple of bucks if they're giving you $1,000 bucks for that office, you're going to have to pay taxes on that money.BARTIROMO: That's a good point. Dagen, what do you think?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: We all know that people working from home, particularly for a tech company are sitting on their sofa. This is the dumbest idea ever. Google ought to give the money to people who are actually going to be commuting to the office, because you know what, I've been coming into the studio every single day, even during the height of the pandemic. And it was kind of scary, and now, New York, for example, they don't have any plan for the public transportation. What are they going to do about people jamming onto subway cars and commuter rails? You know what? If you have enough gumption to get on a train and go to work, you deserve an extra grand from Google or your employer. That's my take.BARTIROMO: That's a good, that's another good point. How about this, distancing, but make it fashion. Check out this picture. Burger King launches giant social distancing crowns to make sure customers stay six feet apart. The Burger Giant introducing the creative new way to keep customers socially distant as franchisees began to reopen dine in services in Germany. Steve, quite a look. Are you a fan of these crowns?STEVE FORBES, EDITOR IN CHIEF, FORBES: Yes, you might say when it comes to crowns, Burger King has a real whopper there. And the nice thing about it, or the bad thing about it, it doesn't have jewels on it.BARTIROMO: There you go.FORBES: But, it's also useful for you to take to Taco Bell. They could call it a sombrero. And the nice thing is, everyone gets a chuckle out of it. But, it's not the kind of thing you'd want, though, for a romantic evening, so, I think just for takeout it's great.BARTIROMO: Oh god, it's funny to see how everybody, all these companies are approaching this differently.MCDOWELL: Steve. We're going to fine you a grand for that horrible grandpa joke. I'm just saying.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Still ahead, teaching with tech. Go ahead Steve.FORBES: I was just going to say, I'll pay Dagen, in Zimbabwe and I'll pay her a billion dollars.BARTIROMO: The best ways to utilize technology as schools--There you go. Stay with us. We've got a big show ahead.Load-Date: May 27, 2020End of Document

BEWARE THE COSTS OF A TECHNOLOGY TRADE WARStates News ServiceMay 21, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1051 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Cato Institute:By Daniel J. Ikenson and Huan ZhuIn a post last month, we raised concerns about the unforeseen and underappreciated costs of expanding export controls on U.S. technology. Either those concerns fell on deaf ears or the administration did its due diligence and determined that the expected benefits outweigh the expected costs becauseearlier this weekthe Commerce Department published new rules further restricting Huawei's access to U.S. technology.U.S. exports to Huawei have been tightly controlled since Huawei and its affiliates were placed on the Entity List in 2019 for national security reasons. However, because of the design of U.S. export regulations and the nature of technology supply chains, Huawei and its affiliates were still able to import semiconductors from foreign producers that use U.S. chipmaking equipment and software. The new rules are intended to close this loophole and completely cut off Huawei from U.S. technology.Explaining the purpose of those new rules, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Rossbetraying na¯ve expectations that Huawei would have just thrown in the towel and shut down its operations after last year's U.S. sanctionsoffered:Despite the Entity List actions the Department took last year, Huawei and its foreign affiliates have stepped" up efforts to undermine these national security" based restrictions through an indigenization effort. However, that effort is still dependent on U.S. technologies. This is not how a responsible global corporate citizen behaves. We must amend our rules exploited by Huawei and HiSilicon and prevent U.S. technologies from enabling malign activities contrary to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.Although we have been skeptical from the start that this is the right way to proceed with China, the die most definitely has been cast and the technology trade war is moving ahead at full speed. Of course, the U.S. government (many in the Trump administration and many in the Congress) has its reasons (some factual; some presumptive; some political) for this course of action. So, instead of rehashing concerns already raised, we offer (in convenient bullet point fashion) the most relevant facts and assumptions culminating in the current policy, as well as the expected benefits and likely costs of that policy. Unfortunately, the list of likely costs is long.FactsThe U.S. government sees the Chinese government as a bad actor.The U.S. government sees Huawei as an adjunct of the Chinese government.The U.S. government sees Huawei as the leader in 5G technology.The U.S. government sees Huawei's leadership in 5G technology as a threat to U.S. national security.The U.S. government sees a vulnerability to Huawei's 5G leadership in Huawei's dependence on U.S. semiconductors and semiconductor technology.The U.S. government seeks to exploit that vulnerability by depriving Huawei of the technology it needs to continue to dominate 5G.AssumptionsTargeting Huawei with export controls and entity list restrictions to deprive it of needed inputs will slow or stop Huawei's progress.U.S. sanctions on Huawei from the supply side will compliment U.S. efforts to compel other governments to forego purchasing Huawei gear on the demand side.Slowing or stopping Huawei's progress will enhance U.S. national security.U.S. national security will be enhanced because U.S. or U.S.-backed 5G companies will emerge and fill the void as standard" setters and dominant suppliers of 5G network gear and consumer products.Leadership in 5G begets leadership in the next generation of communications technology and other technologies; followership consigns to more followership.The expected benefits of the U.S. government's approach outweigh its expected costs.Benefits (if the assumptions are accurate)The Chinese government's ability to control or have disproportionate influence over global information and communications networks (and whatever other currently unforeseen powers that control or influence would bestow upon Beijing) will be reduced.Reducing Beijing's power isin this context and with certain caveatsakin to enhancing U.S. national security.Impeding Huawei's success (albeit, through compulsion of other governments and laws restricting private companies from engaging in commerce or research and development with Huawei) could buy time for U.S. companies or U.S.-backed companies to emerge and take leadership in 5G and 6G technology space, providing U.S. economic and security benefits that might not otherwise manifest.CostsCutting off Huawei from U.S. semiconductors, semiconductor equipment, and software will expedite China's development of indigenous semiconductor production capabilities and, ultimately, put the world's largest market for semiconductors out of reach of U.S. producers within a few years.Cutting off Huawei from semiconductors made with U.S equipment in third countries will compel chipmakers in those third countries to purchase non-U.S. equipment, ultimately drying up current U.S. export markets.Cutting off Huawei will inject even more uncertainty into global information and communication technology (ICT) markets, which likelywill slow the process of standards setting, which likely will retard product development schedules, which likely will deter investment in new technologies, and which likely will be resolved only by bifurcation or even greater splintering of global technology standards.Bifurcation or splintering of technology standards would significantly limit scope for economies of scale in production, as firms all along the ICT supply chain would be producing for fewer customers or producing in separate production runs for customers that follow different sets of standards.U.S. supply chain warfare could prove contagious, encouraging Chinese restrictions on exports of rare earth minerals or other inputs and Chinese retaliation against U.S. technology companies, while opening the door to all countries to treat trade as a strategic weapon rather than as a tool of cooperation and economic betterment.Technology decoupling will inspire a cold" war style competition between the United States and China to win the hearts and minds of third countries through the offering of carrots and the threats of sticks.Load-Date: May 22, 2020End of Document

Amid pandemic crosses, U.S. advances on key company for ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 15, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 376 wordsBodyAmid crosses with China by the coronavirus,the Trump Administration rekindled its attacks on tech giant Huaweiby cutting back its chip supply.The U.S. Department of Commerce reported that it would tighten its export rules to"strategically target Huawei's acquisition of semiconductors that are a direct product of certain U.S. software and technology." The change is a setback for Huawei and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.,a large chip producer for Huawei's HiSilicon unit.Huawei – one of the key companies of the 'Made in China 2025' government project to position the country as a leader in the technology sector - can replace some low-end chips with local production, but for the most advanced ones, those that need to develop its 5G network, it depends on US factories. But it'snot the first timeArguing national security concerns, last year the U.S. had already put Huawei on an 'Entity List',forcing U.S. companies to process a special license to sell products to the Chinese giant. The measure had already restricted Huawei's access to the chips it needs. However, "Huawei continued to use U.S. software and technology to design semiconductors, undermining the national security and foreign policy purposes of the 'Entity List' by commissioning its production at overseas smelters using U.S. equipment," Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said today.While Huawei avoided commenting on the new U.S. government's actions, in March Eric Xu, the company's rotating president, had warned that China would retaliate should the U.S. restrict sales of TSMC – the Taiwanese   that only hours will announce the construction of a second plant in the US for$12 billion– to her company. "I don't think the Chinese government will just stand idly by and allow Huawei to be massacred on a cutting board. I think the government will also implement some defensive tactics."Indeed, as a retaliation, China would be willing to place some of the major U.S. companies – such as Apple, Cisco Systems, and Qualcomm– on a "list of unreliable entities,"according to the Global Times newspaper, a media linked to the People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party. The government would also be evaluating the suspension of Boeing's aircraft purchase.Load-Date: May 16, 2020End of Document

CONGRESSMAN MATT GAETZ CALLS ON AG BARR TO GROUND ALL GOVERNMENT-OWNED DJI DRONESStates News ServiceMay 5, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 916 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz:U.S. Congressman Matt Gaetz (FL-01) yesterday called on Attorney General William Barr to ground all DJI drones owned and operated by U.S. government entities, local law enforcement, and state law enforcement, over national cybersecurity concerns that the drones may be providing data to the Chinese government.In a letter to the Attorney General, Congressman Gaetz expressed concern that the drones "may exfiltrate sensitive law-enforcement data to China," noting that local law enforcement agencies had neither the "technical expertise nor the cyber-forensic tools necessary to determine whether or not these UAS (unmanned aircraft systems) are transmitting sensitive data to the CCP regime."In 2017, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security revealed that DJI (D -JiÄng Innovations), a Chinese technology company, is "likely providing U.S. critical infrastructure and law enforcement data to (the) Chinese government." The Department further assessed that DJI has sought out and targeted local law enforcement agencies as product consumers, and that "China could provide DJI information to terrorist organizations...to coordinate attacks against U.S. critical infrastructure."Following this report, the U.S. Army, the Department of the Interior, and other government entities suspended their use of DJI drones. However, local law enforcement agencies in twenty-two states and over forty municipalities recently received drones as a donation from DJI, and have been utilizing them despite the potentially severe national security implications."China is massively expanding a Trojan horse spying operation in our country and your local police department may be unknowingly helping them. The United States Army and the Department of Interior have banned their use of these DJI drones, citing vulnerability and potential value for other countries. The Department of Homeland Security wrote a scathing report that said that China specifically goes after local law enforcement. They did so even before the coronavirus so that they can get key information transmitted to the Chinese government. Then, our own Department of Homeland Security wrote that this is precisely the type of information we're worried that China might sell to terrorists," said Rep. Matt Gaetz.Congressman Gaetz announced his letter last night on "Tucker Carlson Tonight," and highlighted specific concerns he had raised in the letter. Video of Congressman Gaetz's appearance is available below. A copy of the letter sent to AG Barr may be found HERE or below.CLICK TO WATCH VIDEOVideo of Gaetz Exposes Chinese Spy Drones on Tucker CarlsonLETTER TEXTThe Honorable William BarrAttorney General of the United StatesUnited States Department of Justice950 Pennsylvania Avenue NWWashington, DC 20530The Honorable Jeffrey RosenDeputy Attorney General of the United StatesUnited States Department of Justice950 Pennsylvania Avenue NWWashington, DC 20530Dear Attorney General Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rosen:We write to express our grave concerns about potential national security threats posed by Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) produced by Chinese company Da Jiang Innovations (DJI), and distributed by DJI to American states, localities, and law enforcement agencies.Several departments and agencies of the federal government have already banned or ceased to use DJI products. The Army banned their purchase and use in 2017. The Department of the Interior retired their DJI UAS fleet in 2019. The Fiscal Year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act banned their purchase and use across the entire United States military.The reason for these bans has been national security, grounded in well-established assessments that DJI UAS (drones) may transmit sensitive information to China. A 2017 report from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Los Angeles office) stated that DJI drones are "Likely providing U.S. critical infrastructure and law enforcement data to [the] Chinese government." That same report states that "SIP Los Angeles further assesses with high confidence the company is selectively targeting government and privately-owned entities within these sectors [infrastructure and law enforcement] to expand its ability to collect and exploit sensitive U.S. data."The DJI website mentions the "45 police, fire and public safety organizations in 22 states" to which they have donated drones. In Florida, DJI donated at least two drones to the Daytona Beach Police Department, under the guise of helping with the problems caused by the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. These "donations" are deeply troubling to us.We have the following questions:-What authorities do you have to limit or end the use of DJI UAS in the United States?-When will you begin taking action to use these authorities?Local police departments that have received these UAS from DJI, such as the Daytona Beach Police Department (which was contacted prior to sending this letter), have neither the technical expertise nor the cyber-forensic tools necessary to determine whether or not these UAS are transmitting sensitive data to the CCP regime. Furthermore, because these UAS may be connected to police computers, it seems possible that they may exfiltrate sensitive law-enforcement data to China. We hope that your swift action will keep this dangerous scenario from coming to pass.Thank you for your attention to this matter.Sincerely,Matt GaetzMember of Congress###Load-Date: May 5, 2020End of Document

A documentary about the origin of the coronavirus says the Chinese Communist Party concealed that it is synthetic and leaked from a labCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 12, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 2615 wordsBodyAccording to a new documentary that delvened the origin of the new coronavirus, which as of April 11, had caused nearly 1,800,000 cases of COVID-19 in the world, with nearly 110,000 deaths, it is unlikely that the cause of the pandemic that has stopped the planet will be in the Wuhan animal market, as the Chinese government has insisted on presenting. On The Epoch Times's YouTube Crossroads channel, journalist Joshua Philipp charted an alternative path leading to the city's Institute of Virology's Level 4 biosecurity lab, where, as an aggravating way, SARS-CoV-2 could have been a design or recombination of fragments of different viruses to facilitate human entry, part of the study conducted by scientist Shi Zhengli.According to Philipp, who "writes about subversion, unrestricted war, and China's manifest espionage," according to his Twitter profile, before it left the market—where, on the other hand, bats, presumed first carrier of the coronavirus—the virus should have gone in there, as there is scientific evidence, from the beginning of the contagions, that there were cases that are not linked to that place , as well as various manifestations of Beijing's attempt to control the narrative of coVID-19's trajectory.According to Joshua Philipp, the cause of the pandemic that has stopped the planet is unlikely to be found in the Wuhan animal market, as the Chinese government has insisted on presenting. (China Daily via REUTERS) (CHINA DAILY/)As part of an investigation for the multi-language newspaper, founded by John Tang and other U.S. citizens of Chinese descent linked to the Falun Gong spiritual movement and blocked in mainland China, Philipp began by tracking the first official communication, a document of December 30, 2019 from the National Health Commission, which spoke of "successive occurrences of pneumonia cases of unknown origin" and asked health centers to report cases Similar. The next day, the Huanan Market in Wuhan was mentioned, which on 1 January 2020 was closed, while another government document spoke of "obvious evidence of human transmission".Following the disinfection of the site, something that in The Origin of Wuhan Philipp Coronavirus compared to "the destruction of the crime scene", the Institute of Virology of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of China (CCDC) announced that "33 of the 585 environmental samples of the Huahan Market revealed content of nucleic acid from the new coronavirusvirus , and that the virus was successfully isolated, suggesting that the virus originated in wild animals that were sold on the market."That amounted to the official conclusion of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC): the virus began at a wildlife sales center for human consumption.Days later a Science article challenged this hypothesis: "The Wuhan animal market may not have been the source of the new coronavirus that spreads globally." The text cited a study published in The Lancet, which analyzed 41 cases of COVID-19 treated at Jin Yin-tan Hospital, the first in the city for the disease. Sean Lin, former director of the virus branch of the Walter Reed Military Research Institute (WRAIR), interpreted the work for the Crossroads documentary: "It has important information, such as that the beginning of symptoms in the first patient was on December 1 and had no relation to the Huanan Market."More than a third of the first coVID-19 cases had no links to the Huanan Market, where, on the other hand, no bats were sold, according to this documentary. (NOEL CELIS / AFP) (NOEL CELIS/)The expert told Philipp: "The main finding is that this study counted 41 patients and 14 of them turned out to be unrelated to the animal market, which represents more than a third. And no one sells bats at the animal market, too." The study bore the signature, as lead author, of the deputy director of Jin Yin-tan Hospital, Chaolin Huang.Other subsequent work on more patients confirmed the same, such as one out of 99 cases, "of which 50 did not have a history of exposure to the animal market", the journalist synthesized, or the analysis of Daniel Lucey, an epidemiologist at Georgetown University, who considered that "if the data were accurate, the first case of infection by the virus would be November 2019 given the incubation period; that is to say that the virus should have reached the market before it had come out."However, "the criteria issued by the hospital [where that first check was performed] to determine whether a patient had the new coronavirus were: 1) a history of contact with the Huanan market; 2) fever; 3) complete genome sequence".Gordon Chang, an expert at Asian Affairs, assessed that in the general context "the figures we receive from China on new infections and deaths are simply very suspicious." He added: "We know that Beijing suppressed information about the epidemic for six weeks in December and January, and then, when they officially recognized it, on January 21, they began an information disposal campaign."Based on a study by The Lancet, Science immediately challenged the Chinese authorities' version: "The Wuhan animal market may not have been the source of the new coronavirus that spreads globally."Brigadier General Robert Spalding, former director of strategy at the U.S. National Security Council (NSC) and hudson institute researcher, added that in 2003 he was in China when it was the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and that "the current response, in perspective with what I saw then, is exactly the same."After finishing the first part of the documentary, "The History of the Wuhan Market", the second, "The Mysterious Genetic Sequence", analyzed scientific details that would indicate that the virus was not of natural transmission from one species to another or of spontaneous origin, but synthetic. On January 11, Zhang Yong Zhen of the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center at Fudan University published an analysis in Nature in which he noted that the cause of Wuhan atypical pneumonia "is closely linked to the two viruses (CoVZC45 and CoVZXC21)". The documentary added that these viruses were found in bats in Zhoushan as part of a Chinese army investigation in 2018.Zhang's team had actually isolated and identified the entire genome sequence on January 5, and had communicated it to the authorities. It was published only in the face of government silence on January 11 in Nature. The laboratoryZhang was closed soon after.By then many international researchers had used the BLAST platform, from the U.S. National Institute of Health (NIH), and confirmed these findings: the virus had an 88% similarity to these bat strains, while showing 79% with SARS and about 50% with the cause of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). It was also found that the protein at the tip of the new coronavirus, which allows it to enter the human body, showed the peculiarity of being equal to that of SARS.The genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that it had characteristics of bat coronavirus that are not passed to humans and SARS, which caused a global epidemic in 2003, such as its tips that allow it to infect cells (NIH/via REUTERS) (NIAID/)"It's hard to see a protein that's 100% identical when a virus goes from one species to another," Lin's finding in Crossroads read. "That may suggest that perhaps the virus was generated by a reverse engineering process." He was joined by Judy A. Mikovits, a molecular biologist and former director of the Antiviral Mechanism Laboratory at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in the United States, who added: "It is not possible for it to be a natural mutation. It's almost certainly a lab recombination event."At the time, he evaluated the investigation of The Epoch Times, SARS-CoV-2 bore enormous similarity to two bat coronaviruses that had not passed on to humans, the CoVZC45 and CoVZXC21, and on the other hand, to SARS, which caused an epidemic in humans.The Health Committee of Hubei Province, of which Wuhan is the capital, commanded: "Current samples of the virus must be destroyed. The publication of information on samples, studies and associated data is prohibited". Following a Notification Letter No. 3 from the national health authorities, "the previously active Chinese scientific community was left in mysterious silence," Philipp said.The third part of the documentary, "The Discoveries of Dr. Shi Zhengli", proposed the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 is a laboratory product that mistakenly escaped its containment scope. Shi has been researching bats and coronavirus for years and is the person who found how they pass from other species, including bats, to humans. Since 2015 he has worked at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in the area of synthetic viruses and his laboratory has the resources to manipulate these microorganisms, according to Philipp.Shi Zhengli in China's largest expert on the passage of coronaviruses between species and was investigating the synthetic generation of infectious microorganisms. (Screenshot from Crossroads, by Joshua Philipps/The Epoch Times)After analyzing several studies of Shi, conducted between the 2003 SARS epidemic and the present, he focused on one in November 2015, published in Nature together with theresearch by the largest coronavirus expert in the United States, Ralph Baric of the University of North Carolina (UNC), "discussing the synthetic creation of a virus capable of self-return, which had as its structure SARS-CoV, with the tip protein replaced by one found in a bat coronavirus", summed up the journalist, which gave him a great capacity for infection between species.The isolation of three bat viruses, "one of which had a tip protein that interacted with the human receptors of the [angiotensin-converting enzyme] EDA", caused controversy among scientists. Simon Wain-Hobson of the Pasteur Institute in France warned in Nature: "If the new virus leaked, no one could predict its trajectory."According to Mikovits, Shi's research "strongly tests or supports the hypothesis that it is not possible that [COVID-19-causing coronavirus] was generated in a natural zoonotic transmission, but had to come from a hospital, laboratory environment, almost certainly biosecurity-level research facilities 4 in Wuhan."In 2018 Shi gave a lecture on bat coronavirus and interspecies infections at Jiao Tong University in Shanghai; however, "records were deleted from the institution's website," Philipp found when searching for them. He wanted to analyze another striking element that, following the Wuhan outbreak, a group of Indian researchers found in SARS-CoV-2.Scientist at The Pasteur Institute in France warned of a Shi investigation: "If the new virus leaked, no one could predict its trajectory." (China Daily via REUTERS) (CHINA DAILY/)Scientists published a preliminary study on the tip protein of the new coronavirus and found "four inserted sequences that were not in the original SARS", but came from the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV. "Shi discredited them," the documentary continued. But it did not offer an official refusal to claim that the microorganism that causes COVID-19 appears to have fragments of material that lives in bats and fragments of material that lives in humans."They work on developing a coronavirus for human hosts, which leads us to the question of why someone would create a coronavirus that can infect humans," Spalding raised. "What would be the purpose of that investigation? Is it for a gun? Is it then to sell a vaccine of which to be the only beneficiaries?"The penultimate part of the documentary, "The Secret of Wuhan's P4 Laboratory," analyzed that following Wuhan's isolation on January 23, Shi published in Nature an article that pointed to a natural source of the coronavirus, bats, in line with the Chinese authorities' version of the market where wild animals were sold for gastronomy."At the same time the authorities restricted access to all the dead of the virus, which prevented international experts from joining the investigation, and used national television to slander doctors, such as Li Wenliang, who revealed the outbreak, for defaming rumors," Philipp reminded the doctor who died from COVID-19. Unlike other containment episodes of other viruses in recent years, the Wuhan Institute of Virology was not involved in the efforts.Following Wuhan's isolation, Shi published an article to scientifically base the Chinese authorities' version of the origin of the new coronavirus. (REUTERS/Juan Medina) (JUAN MEDINA/)The reporter noted that, while several scientists "denounced, with their real name, that the [bad] hazard control of Shi Zhengli's lab could have caused The Wuhan virus to leak," China's army's leading biochemical weapons expert Chen Wei took over from the P4 lab. There were also rumors that a researcher at the institute had been patient zero and died, and President Xi Jinping pushed a biosecurity law, associated the documentary.In those days something striking happened, he noted The origin of Wuhan coronavirus: the Institute of Virology preemptively requested a patent for the use of remdesivir in COVID-19. One of its directors, the son of an important CCP member Jian Zemin, has private interests in a pharmaceutical company, which heads another son of the communist elite.It was precisely in the Jian years in power that two Chinese military men published a report entitled "Unrestricted War," where "strategies for one nation less stronger than another to combat it in the context of modern warfare, " Philipp sued." He quoted one of the authors, Qiao Liang: "After the first crisis in the Strait of Taiwan we understood that if there was a direct fight between the Ramadan forces of China and the United States, we would be at a disadvantage. As a result, we needed a new strategy to help our military twist the balance of power."As of April 11, COVID-19 reached nearly 1,800,000 cases worldwide, with nearly 110,000 deaths. (REUTERS/Yves Herman) (YVES HERMAN/)That would be unrestricted war, the documentary detailed: "It could be associated with the military, including guerrillas, terrorism and biochemical warfare, or it might not be military, such as drug trafficking, poisoning, environmental destruction and dissemination of computer viruses."In his latest tranche, "Facing the Pandemic," Philipp's work analyzed that "the propaganda drive, which has escalated in recent weeks, is primarily aimed at deflecting the chinese regime's sloppy handling of Wuhan virus, sowing international disagreement, and presenting the image that the regime has contained the outbreak." The same Chinese scientists who disclosed information or made allegations refused to interview requests from The Epoch Times, which is described in the film as "a giant CCP censorship network cast on the world's virologists."On the grounds that "the CCP violated international health regulations, the United States and the international community must regain their meaning and take action," the origin of Wuhan coronavirus concluded. "Every time [the coronavirus] comes back—because he's going to come back, because he's going to be with us permanently now, and he's coming back—every person he kills, every person he hurts, will be directly attributable to the CCP," He gave the closure to Spalding,recalling that since March, several nations have begun legal action and in international organizations to demand that China pay compensation for the multimillion-dollar damage caused to economies by COVID-19.MORE ON THIS TOPIC:US outperformed Italy as the country with the deadest by coronavirus with more than 20,000 fatalitiesCoronavirus vaccine may be ready by SeptemberLoad-Date: April 13, 2020End of Document

Chinese agents spread messages among US population to sow panic, intelligence officials warnedCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 22, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1425 wordsBodyAlarming messages came quickly in mid-March, appearing on cell phone screens and on the social media of millions of Americans dealing with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.The messages said: The Trump administration is about to block the whole country."They'll announce it as soon as they have troops to help prevent looters and rioters," warned one of the messages, which he cited to a Department of Homeland Security source. "He got the call last night and was told to pack up and be ready for today's call with his office."The messages spread in such a way for 48 hours that the White House National Security Council had to issue an ad via Twitter to report that they were "FALSE."Since that wave of panic, U.S. intelligence agencies have discovered that Chinese operatives helped convey messages across platforms, according to information from six U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to publicly discuss intelligence issues. Amplification techniques are alarming to officials because misinformation appeared in the form of text messages on the cell phones of many Americans, a tactic many said they had not seen before.This has encouraged agencies to look for mechanisms that other nations - such as China and Russia - are using to spread misinformation during the pandemic, they explained.The origin of the messages remains murky. U.S. officials refused to reveal details of the intelligence linking Chinese agents to spreading misinformation, citing the need to protect their sources and methods for monitoring Beijing's activities.The officials interviewed for this article work in six different agencies. His broader warnings about disinformation in China are supported by recent findings from external bipartisan research groups, including the Alliance for Democracy Security and the Center for a New American Security, which is expected to release a report on the issue next month.REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/Archive (Jonathan Ernst/)Two U.S. officials emphasized that they did not believe that Chinese agents had created the messages, but amplified existing ones. These efforts allowed the messages to capture the attention of enough people to then spread on their own. The messages seemed to gain a significant attraction on Facebook, as they also proliferated through texts, according to an analysis of the New York Times.Officials said the operatives had adopted some of the techniques used by Russian trolls, such as creating fake social media accounts to send messages to sympathetic Americans, who in turn unknowingly help spread them.Officials say Chinese agents also appear to be using encrypted text messages and messaging apps, including WhatsApp, as part of their campaigns. It is much more difficult for researchers and officials to track disinformation disseminated through text messages and encrypted applications than on social media platforms.U.S. intelligence officials are also examining whether Chinese spies sent to U.S. diplomatic missions helped spreadfalse blocking messages, explained a senior official. U.S. agencies have recently increased their scrutiny of Chinese diplomats and employees of state media organizations. In September, the State Department expelled two employees from the Chinese embassy in Washington because they were suspected of committing such practices.Other rival powers may also have been involved in the broadcast. Misinformation has proliferated during the pandemic: In recent weeks, some pro-Trump media have promoted anti-American conspiracy theories, including one that suggests the virus was created in a laboratory in the United States.U.S. officials said that China, using Russia's strategies, has been trying to deepen political division in the United States."It's part of the expansionary division's playbook," said Senator Angus King, independent of Maine.However, propaganda efforts go beyond texting and social media posts aimed at the American population. In China, senior officials have issued directives to agencies to participate in a global disinformation campaign on the virus, U.S. officials reported.Handout via REUTERSSome intelligence officers are worried. The messages emphasize the idea of disunity among European nations during the crisis and praise China's "donation diplomacy." Of course, there is no mention of reports from Chinese companies delivering poor quality equipment.Trump himself has shown little concern about China's actions. He has always praised the handling of the pandemic by Chinese leaders: "A lot of respect!" he wrote on Twitter on March 27. Three days later, he dismissed concerns about China's misinformation use when asked about it at Fox News."They do and we do it," he said. "All countries do it."When asked about the new allegations, China's Foreign Ministry said: "Relevant statements make no sense and are not worth rebutting." Zhao Lijian, the ministry's spokesman, has refuted accusations by US officials that China has disseminated manipulated information. "We urge the United States to stop political manipulation, get its own home in order, and focus more on fighting the epidemic and boosting the economy," Zhao said at a press conference on Friday.An information warREUTERS/Jason Lee. (Jason Lee/)The United States and China are involved in a titanic war on the pandemic, which has meant a new dimension to their global rivalry.President Trump and his advisers are trying to turn the spotlight on China, as they face intense criticism for the federal government's widespread failures in responding to the pandemic, which has killed more than 40,000 Americans. President Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party are trying to turn their attention to national and international support and setting aside the fact that they covered up information that allowed the virus to spread.Chinese officials accused Trump and his allies of disseminating informationmalicious, noting that the president repeatedly referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or the suggestion of some Republicans that the virus may have originated as a Chinese biological weapon, a theory supported by U.S. intelligence agencies.Republican strategists believe that blaming China for the virus will increase support for Trump and other conservative politicians for the upcoming November election.Given the toxic information environment, foreign policy analysts are concerned that the Trump administration will politicy intelligence work to promote an anti-China narrative.But it has also become clear that for more than a month the Chinese government has been driving disinformation and anti-American conspiracy theories related to the pandemic. Zhao, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, wrote on Twitter that the US military may have brought the virus to the Chinese city of Wuhan. That message was amplified by the official Twitter accounts of Chinese embassies and consulates.China's global state television network broadcast a video in the Middle East where an Arab presenter claimed that "some new facts" indicated that the pandemic may have originated from U.S. infiltrations into China. The network has an audience of millions, and the video has had more than 365,000 views on YouTube.REUTERS/Stringer (STRINGER/)Active and retired U.S. officials have said Chinese operatives adopt strategies that were long used by Russian agents, a phenomenon that also occurred during the Hong Kong protests last year.The goal remains the same as always: wreaking havoc and undermining trust among Americans for their government."There is no national closure," he said, adding that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention "have published and will continue to publish the latest guidance."Since January, Americans have shared many other messages that included misinformation: that the virus originated in a US Army lab; often such publications are attributed to an unidentified source in the US government or to an institution such as Johns Hopkins University or Stanford University.As the messages have sown confusion, it has been difficult to trace their true origins or pinpoint all the ways in which they have been amplified.MORE ON THIS TOPIC:Missouri sued China for causing the coronavirus pandemic: "They lied to the world, they must take responsibility"Step by step: the report explaining how the Chinese regime allowed the coronavirus to become a pandemicFalse quarantines, torture and disappearances: China's brutal method of silencing those who were encouraged to denounce the regime's lies about the coronavirusLoad-Date: April 23, 2020End of Document

PALAZZO JOINS CHORUS OF LAWMAKERS CALLING FOR STATE DEPARTMENT AND DOJ TO SUE CHINA FOR COVID-19 COVER-UP IN INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICEStates News ServiceApril 22, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1022 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of Mississippi Rep. Steven Palazzo:Congressman Steven Palazzo (MS-4) has co-signed a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Attorney General William P. Barr, urging the two US leaders to bring a case against China to the United Nations' International Court of Justice (ICJ) for violating the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR).If China fails to submit itself to a fair trial in the ICJ, Articles 49-51 of the U.N. Charter outline countermeasures injured parties could pursue. Options for the United States include: China's removal from international organizations, like the WHO and WTO, suspension of air travel to China and the broadcasting of Western or Taiwanese media into China.Palazzo has also cosponsored a resolution to hold the Chinese government accountable for their mishandling of the outbreak.Full text of the letter can be found below or downloaded here.Dear Secretary Pompeo and Attorney General Barr:I write to you today to urge you to bring a case against China to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for its actions during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.The International Court of Justice's role is to settle, in accordance with international law, legal disputes submitted to it by U.N. Member States. The United States has a strong case to make against China for their cover-up.As one of nearly 200 states legally bound to the 2005 International Health Regulations (]HR), China has a duty to rapidly gather and protect information and contribute to the common understanding of public health emergencies with international implications. Article 6 of the IHR says States must provide expedited, timely, accurate and sufficiently detailed information to the WHO about the public health emergencies identified in the second annex to prevent global pandemics. Among those health emergencies are SARS and cases of human influenza caused by a new subtype. The regulations also specify that states must provide timely and transparent information as requested within 24 hours.The Chinese state made intentional false claims to its own people and the world about the nature of the virus. In late December, when doctors and journalists tried to warn of a new coronavirus 87% similar to SARS and the emergence of "pneumonia of unclear cause,'' the Chinese authorities suppressed or jailed them. On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission falsely stated there was no human-to human transmission of the disease, describing it as a seasonable flu that was "preventable and controllable,'' despite contrary reports from Chinese doctors battling the virus. This prompted the World Health Organization to announce in a now infamous tweet on Jan. 14 that "preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) identified in Wuhan, China." China rejected repeated offers from the WHO and CDC in late January and early February to study the new disease without explanation.Article 5 of the IHR requires States to monitor and record the "clinical descriptions, laboratory results, sources and type of risk, numbers of human cases and deaths, conditions affecting the spread of the disease" United States intelligence agencies concluded that the Chinese regime intentionally underreported the number infected and deceased coronavirus patients. As we mentioned, the Chinese government misled the WHO and the public about the "conditions affecting the spread of' COVID-19, when it denied human-human transmission. And on January 3, 2020, the leading public health authority in China, the National Health Commission, directed all Chinese research institutions to cease publicly releasing any information related to a then unknown SARS-like virus, and ordered them to either destroy existing laboratory samples of the virus or transfer them to approved testing sites.An epidemiological model at the University of Southampton found that had China acted responsibly just three weeks earlier, the number affected by the virus would have been cut by 95 percent.Those three weeks could be accounted for here: On December 30, Dr. Li Wenliang sounded the alarm in an online chatroom. Four days later, the Chinese Public Security Bureau forced him to sign a letter acknowledging he made "false statements." Almost one month later, Chinese authorities were still making false assurances to the public that it was safe for large gatherings to assemble and celebrate the Lunar New Year on Jan. 25. Dr. Li Wenliang died on Feb. 7, 2020 from COVID-19.If China fails to submit itself to a fair trial in the International Court of Justice, the Charter of the United Nations gives guidance to injured parties: Articles 49-51 explain how states could suspend their obligations to China as means to induce Beijing to fulfill its responsibility for the calamitous damages inflicted on the world. Options include China's removal from international organizations, reversing China's entry into the World Trade Organization, suspending air travel to China and broadcasting Western or Taiwanese media into China.As Josh Rogin writing in the Washington Post notes, there is bipartisan consensus emerging towards the Chinese Communist Party's role in this pandemic: "Republicans and Democrats now largely agree that the Chinese government bears responsibility for the spread of the pandemic, that it can't be trusted on this or any other issue, and that the U.S. government should maintain a tough position on China on trade and overall, especially if Beijing again falters in its commitments."Please fulfill the desire of the American people to see China held accountable for their role in this pandemic.Sincerely,Jim Banks, Member of CongressThe following Members of Congress have co-signed this letter:Austin ScottBrian BabinW.

Sens. Portman, Carper Applaud DOJ Efforts to Combat Chinese Espionage, Protect U.S. Telecom InfrastructureTargeted News ServiceApril 10, 2020 Friday 8:51 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 489 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, issued the following news release:* * *- PSI Has Been Investigating Chinese, Government-Owned Telecommunications Firms & Plans to Release Report in Coming Months* * *U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Tom Carper (D-DE), Chairman and Ranking Member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), announced their support for steps taken by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to protect U.S. telecommunications networks by recommending that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) revoke China Telecom Americas' authority to operate and provide telecommunication services in the United States. PSI, which has released groundbreaking reports on China's exploitation of the American education system through Confucius Institutes, Chinese efforts to steal US taxpayer-funded research and intellectual property, and Chinese-led cyber-attacks against U.S. companies, has been investigating Chinese government-owned telecommunications firms licensed to operate in the United States for a year, and plans to release a report in the coming months.China Telecom Americas, which is owned and controlled by the People's Republic of China, has had a FCC license to provide telecommunication services in the United States since 2002. DOJ's recommendation highlights the substantial and serious national security and law enforcement risks associated with China Telecom Americas' domestic operations, particularly in light of China's intelligence collection and espionage efforts against the United States."As demonstrated in recent investigations by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, China regularly exploits the American education and scientific research sectors to further its national interest," said Senator Portman. "DOJ's recommendation demonstrates that it's the same story with our telecommunications industry. China regularly uses China Telecom Americas' authority to provide telecommunications services in the United States to further its intelligence collection and espionage efforts. This is unacceptable and should not be allowed to continue. I am pleased to see DOJ exercising its oversight responsibilities, and I encourage the FCC to use its enforcement authority to ensure our communications networks are secure for all Americans.""The Chinese government has moved aggressively in recent years to launch cyber-attacks against our businesses and government agencies and get ahead militarily and economically with stolen American research and intellectual property. These activities have left our nation no choice but to act," said Senator Carper. "The Department of Justice's decision to recommend that the FCC revoke a Chinese government-owned telecommunications firm's license to operate in the United States is likely a necessary step in our ongoing efforts to protect our national security against foreign spies and hackers."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7083155 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: April 10, 2020End of Document

AUSTRALIAN STUDENT ACTIVIST FACES EXPULSION AFTER CRITICISM FROM CHINESE DIPLOMATStates News ServiceApril 16, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1365 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:An Australian student is facing expulsion by the University of Queensland after he publicly questioned the school's close relationship with China and was termed an "anti-China separatist" by a Chinese diplomat with close ties to the school.The university is taking disciplinary action against conservative student activist Drew Pavlou, who has repeatedly criticized the university's close ties with the Chinese Communist Party.The university has accused Pavlou, 20, of harming its reputation, engaging in intimidating and disrespectful conduct and disrupting the running of the university, among other charges.Pavlou -- who has said he suffers from depression -- faces 11 allegations of misconduct, including activities that the authorities say breached its integrity and harassment policies and the student charter, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.The authorities have presented as "evidence" of his alleged misconduct social media comments he made regarding the pro democracy movement in Hong Kong, in which he claimed to be speaking "on behalf of the university" following his election as student representative to the university senate.On the petition website Change.org, more than 11,000 people had signed a petition calling for the disciplinary procedure against Pavlou to be dropped by 17.45 GMT on Thursday.Pavlou has also reported being physically attacked by Chinese Communist Party supporters during a campus brawl at UQ sparked by Chinese students' opposition to a Hong Kong protest-related activity.According to UQ, Pavlou also allegedly placed a sign on the UQ Confucius Institute -- a cultural organization embedded in campuses around the world and directly staffed and controlled by the Chinese government -- in March, declaring it was a "biohazard" amid the coronavirus epidemic, according to a post he made on Facebook.Critic of UQ's China tiesPavlou has said he is being singled out because of his specific criticisms of UQ's relationship with China.A UQ spokeswoman denied this on Wednesday. "The university rejects Mr Pavlou's statement that the university's process is an attempt to penalize him for airing his political beliefs," she told RFA.Xu Jie, the Chinese Consul General in Brisbane, has previously accused Pavlou of engaging in "anti-China separatist activities." China's Global Times tabloid newspaper, published by Communist Party paper the People's Daily, has made similar claims.Xu was awarded the post of visiting professor by UQ vice president Peter Hoj on July 12, 2019, a move which also drew criticism from Pavlou at the time.Feng Chongyi, a political researcher at the University of Technology in Sydney, said UQ is very likely retaliating against Pavlou's criticisms of China."It is totally unacceptable for somebody to be [disciplined] over their [political] speech in Australia," Feng said. "It is unacceptable that UQ has no hesitation in breaching someone's human rights because of the benefits of their China deals.""The university is exactly like the Chinese Communist Party ... targeting him for his speech and then saying it's for other reasons."Feng said China has supporters and agents throughout public life in Australia, including politics, business and higher education.Wu Lebao, an international student at the Australian National University, said UQ could easily go along with claims by Little Pink Chinese nationalists that criticism of China is racist in making charges against Pavlou.Solidarity with Hong Kong, Tibet and the UyghursHe said the Little Pinks carry out monitoring operations to keep track of anyone taking part in events showing solidarity with Hong Kong, Tibet or the Uyghurs, and taking Beijing's propaganda war to streets and campuses around the world.Wu cited the intimidation and disruption of Hong Kong students and their supporters on UQ campus last July."Instead of punishing them, they are going along with the Chinese Communist Party's wishes, which are to punish opponents of Beijing," he said. "This incompatible with freedom of speech here in Australia.""Western governments and universities are reluctant to risk the accusation that they are persecuting so-called minority groups," Wu said. "But these Little Pink students have direct connections to the Chinese embassy and act as thugs for a totalitarian regime. They don't represent an ethnic minority."U.S.-based legal scholar Teng Biao agreed."[This is] about revenge against Pavlou for his long-term human rights activism," Teng said. "It is also the latest example of the overseas influence of the Chinese Communist Party and of self-censorship by Western universities to pander to Beijing.""If this attempt succeeds, it will be a serious infringement of Australian citizens' freedom of speech, and will have a chilling effect, meaning that fewer people will dare to criticize the Chinese Communist Party," he said.Sulaiman Gu, a research student at the University of Georgia said he has long been concerned about Pavlou, who he said had received death threats last year."The school is trying to expel the victim, and there is a political motive behind it," Gu said. "If an Australian citizen can be expelled from universities in their own country for criticizing China ... this will turn those universities into Beijing's party schools, just without the party committee."Australia feels the heat from BeijingPavlou, who also criticized China's system of internment camps that hold as many as 1.8 million Uyghurs and force them to undergo political indoctrination, received sympathy from exile Uyghur intellectuals and groups, many of whom face harassment from Chinese agents in foreign countries."It's disturbing that a student activist is on the verge of being expelled from an university in a democratic country for exercising his free speech. It's another example of CCP's nefarious influence that threatens fundamental freedoms of people in a democracy," U.S.-based Uyghur attorney and activist Nury Turkel told RFA's Uyghur Service."The University of Queensland should not cave into foreign influence to silence an Australian student who is exercising his freedom and constitutional rights to raise awareness on the human rights abuses, especially the arbitrary detention of millions of Uyghurs in China's concentration camps," he added.Australian author and professor of public ethics Clive Hamilton's book, Silent Invasion: China's Influence in Australia, was initially turned down by three publishers citing fears of reprisals from Beijing.Finally published in February 2018, Silent Invasion argues that Australia's elites, and parts of the country's large Chinese-Australian diaspora, have been mobilized by Beijing to gain access to politicians, limit academic freedom, intimidate critics, gather information for Chinese intelligence agencies, and organize protests against Australian government policy.According to Reuters, the Chinese Communist Party was behind a massive cyber attack on the Australian national parliament ahead of May's general election.The agency cited the country's cyber intelligence agency, the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), as saying that Beijing was responsible for the attack on the parliament and the three largest political parties, and that originated with the Ministry of State Security in Beijing. The findings were initially kept secret to avoid damaging trade ties.Canberra last year said it would crack down on suspected Chinese Communist Party influencers in the country following the introduction of new laws targeting activities by lobbyists and agents of foreign governments in June 2018, and later denied a passport to a top Chinese businessman.In February 2019, the authorities rejected the citizenship application of a prominent Chinese billionaire and revoked his permanent residency there over concerns about his ties to Beijing.Huang Xiangmo had made donations of nearly U.S. $1.9 million to political parties in Australia over the five years prior to lodging his application.Reported by Ng Yik-tung and Sing Man for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Alim Seytoff for the Uyghur Service.

For China, the 'USA Virus' Is a Geopolitical PloyAtlantic OnlineApril 11, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 2376 wordsByline: Renée DiRestaBodyThis article was updated at 9:45 p.m. on April 11, 2020The coronavirus that became a global pandemic first surfaced late last year in Wuhan, China. But according to one common narrative making its way around Chinese messaging apps, an American soldier was patient zero. "Chinese netizens and experts" are urging the United States to release health information about a U.S. delegate who attended the Military World Games in Wuhan, asserted a February 22 story from Global Times. The publication, an offshoot of the Chinese Communist Party organ People's Daily, insinuated that a U.S. military cyclist might have brought the disease from Fort Detrick in Maryland. Chatter about American origins of the disease had begun a month earlier, in the wilds of China's chat services and on tiny YouTube channels. That alone wouldn't have amounted to much; conspiracies are as common on social media as ants at a picnic, and the small accounts speculating about "bioweapons" and "the USA virus" got little early traction.But this time, Chinese state media picked up the story from internet chatter and turned it into an international phenomenon involving not only official media channels but influential diplomats as well. State channels with massive Facebook followings backed away from prior acknowledgments that the virus had originated in Wuhan, recasting the idea as merely a theory-just one of            many unknowns. Zhao Lijian, the spokesman and deputy director general of the Information Department of China's Foreign Ministry,            speculated to his half-million followers on Twitter that the United States was secretly concealing early 2020 COVID-19 deaths in annual flu counts. In an unusually overt act of tinfoil-hat diplomacy, he shared an article from the notorious anti-American crackpot site GlobalResearch. The headline reads, "COVID-19: Further Evidence that the Virus Originated in the U.S."[           Nadia Schadlow: Consider the possibility that Trump is right about China]While spreading conspiracy theories-stories involving claims that shadowy, powerful interests have secretly engineered events to their own advantage-is a time-honored ploy by which states try to discredit their rivals, the first global pandemic of the social-media era shows just how efficiently wild theories can travel. And as Zhao's Twitter account shows, state-sponsored propaganda has become deeply entangled with anonymous conspiracy mongering. Authority figures are now legitimizing tropes from the recesses of the internet-and ensuring mass popular awareness of those ideas.State-sponsored media have long played a role in geopolitical power games. Since World War II, the TV, radio, and print media channels of many governments have created what some experts call "white propaganda": messaging for which official sources claim authorship. (In gray and black propaganda, the origins are partially or entirely concealed.) In the present day, white propaganda has expanded to include the social-network presences of official channels, as well as the individual accounts of bureaucrats and top politicians. Sometimes, the messages these outlets carry are meant for a regime's own citizens; other times, the outside world.Messaging from state media also goes by another, friendlier name:            public diplomacy. While academics debate the line between propaganda and public diplomacy, in an interconnected world, having the ability to shape narratives is            an imperative. The long-term goal is to make people think favorably of the country and its rulers. In other words, it's a branding exercise. But in the shorter term, state media channels are also used for more direct advocacy campaigns, convincingly conveying an official point of view on specific issues to those outside its borders. In more heated times, this may extend to smearing an adversary's government, institutions, or policies. But the narrative manipulation around COVID-19 on China's official state channels has escalated far beyond spin to outright conspiracy.From the beginning, the Chinese Communist Party has been struggling to manage both domestic and outside perception of its handling of the outbreak of the disease now known as COVID-19. The coronavirus's rapid spread within China, and its high death toll, triggered a domestic crisis of confidence in President Xi Jinping's leadership. Although dissent is often quickly censored, Chinese social-media forums were flooded with comments about Xi being "gutless" for not going to Wuhan,            among other criticisms. The situation didn't play any better internationally: The revelation that the Chinese government knew of the outbreak for two full weeks before taking steps to contain it outraged people worldwide and prompted accusations of            a cover-up.[           Andy Carvin and Graham Brookie: Here's how to fight coronavirus misinformation]As the crisis has begun to recede within China, with Wuhan exiting lockdown and new infections dropping to a trickle, the Communist Party's            public-diplomacy efforts have            gone into overdrive: At the Stanford Internet Observatory, where I work, we            gathered months of China's English-language state-media Facebook posts, identifying key themes that were pushed repeatedly: stories of survival rather than deaths, glowing coverage of the "construction miracle" of new hospitals (whose sudden appearance was framed as the result of patriotic engineering ingenuity, rather than as proof of the need to bolster an overwhelmed medical system), and claims that China had bought the world time through its aggressive containment procedures. One remarkable China Daily article from February 20            boasted, "Were it not for the unique institutional advantages of the Chinese system, the world might be battling a devastating pandemic." The item also slammed international criticism as the result of "ingrained bias against the country." Other stories presented a rosy revisionist history. State media coverage of the death of the whistleblower optometrist, Li Wenliang, mourned him as a hero, and entirely neglected to mention his detention by police after he discussed the emerging virus in a chat group of close friends. As the writer Louisa Lim            put it in Foreign Policy, "China is trying to rewrite the present."The Chinese Communist Party has prioritized "           persuasion and information management" for years. It has            amassed an extensive white-propaganda apparatus since 2000, building and buying TV, radio, and print media, optimizing localized content and messaging in a wide range of languages. Since 2015, it has invested in building a massive English-language presence for its media properties on the very same social networks it has banned within its own border. The English-language Facebook pages for the state-owned newspaper China Daily and the official Xinhua News Agency have more than 75 million followers each; and the China Global Television Network has a following of 99 million; by contrast, CNN has 32 million and Fox News has 18 million. Part of this growth has come from running paid ads on social-media platforms that China's own citizens are blocked from using. My team has studied hundreds of state-media ads from Facebook's recently launched political-ads archive. They are targeted at English speakers worldwide. Throughout 2019, the ads frequently involved friendly images of pandas and kittens, highlighted Chinese art and culture, and amplified feel-good political stories.In February 2020, they took a different turn. The ads began boosting state media coverage of the coronavirus, with dozens of ads praising Xi for his leadership and emphasizing China's ability to contain the disease. They incorporated hashtags such as #UnityIsStrength and #CombatCoronavirus, predictions of a quick economic recovery, and stories in which world leaders in Italy, Serbia, and elsewhere express gratitude to China. By March 2020, angry ads appeared in the mix, promoting outraged coverage of President Donald Trump's use of the term Chinese virus.[           Adam Serwer: Trump is inciting a coronavirus culture war to save himself]Of course, Facebook pages for broadcast media aren't the Communist Party's only messaging tool. For years, it has also run peer-to-peer persuasion strategies involving            influencers, trolls, bots, and commenter armies. The comment legions-called Wumao, or the 50 Cent Army-have been            a shadowy           presence on China's internet and message-board ecosystem for more than a decade. The party has also tried using Twitter bots and Facebook sock puppets, including those uncovered during the 2019 Hong Kong protests.            ProPublica and other investigative journalism teams have reported that similar shenanigans are happening in the coronavirus conversation as well, though attribution remains a challenge; connecting hypernationalist activity back to direct orders from the party is difficult.           *That managing the narrative is a top priority for the Communist Party is abundantly clear. Among the nine members of China's task force for managing the COVID-19 response are the            party's policy czar for ideology and propaganda and the director of its Central Propaganda Department.Political conspiracy theories appear even in the analog propaganda of decades past. Mark Fenster, the author of Conspiracy Theories: Secrecy and Power in American Culture, describes them as a "populist theory of power" serving an important communication function: helping unite the audience ("the people") against an imagined secretive, powerful elite. So when state media in China, for example, create or spread these theories, the elite puppet master is the United States, a geopolitical rival. By exposing the villainy of its adversary, the Chinese Communist Party presents itself as a defender of its people.The "bioweapon" trope is particularly useful, because it can be readily applied to any disease outbreak. During the Cold War, the KGB's information-operations department was a notorious practitioner of conspiracy as statecraft. Perhaps its greatest hit was the widely believed claim that            a secret U.S. government lab created AIDS. A Soviet telegram explaining the operation may sound familiar to those following COVID-19 news today:The goal of these measures is to create a favorable opinion for us abroad that this disease is the result of secret experiments with a new type of biological weapon by the secret services of the USA and the Pentagon that spun out of control.That narrative was initially placed in a pro-Soviet Indian newspaper by way of a whistleblower-style anonymous "letter to the editor" in 1983. It spread through newspapers in 80 countries over a period of four years; the Soviets occasionally revived it with relevant twists for whatever local media environment was of strategic interest. But in the era of Facebook and WeChat, these stories become a high-speed information virus themselves, and the murky source of the initial claim disappears as messages spread across chat groups.State media outlets rarely transmit conspiracies in the form of bold, direct claims. They usually do it through a combination of insinuations: We're just asking questions, really. This sometimes happens via interviews with conspiracy-theorist guests who claim they've been silenced by their own government, or publishing provocative headlines. Russia has            elevated this to an art form, with the English-language RT and Sputnik networks regularly featuring those purportedly censored by the American media.[           Read: All the president's lies about the coronavirus]While easy to mock, tinfoil-hat diplomacy serves a purpose for China. Domestically, it's allowed the Communist Party to distance itself from its own failings by reframing a poorly managed crisis as something that was inflicted on the Chinese people by outsiders. And Chinese state media are far from the only state source "just asking questions" during this pandemic. RT is hosting American kooks who allege on social media that the virus is part of a mass-vaccination campaign masterminded by Bill Gates, while Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is referencing            claims that the virus was "specifically built for Iran using the genetic data of Iranians." Americans aren't above this kind of rumor mongering. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas darkly noted the existence of a Wuhan "           biosafety level-four super laboratory" in comments on Twitter and to the media, speculating that COVID-19 is a Chinese bioweapon. But neither mainstream American media nor U.S. government-sponsored entities such as Voice of America are pushing conspiracies as a public-diplomacy strategy. U.S. leaders are, however, demanding increased attention to the information war: Senators Mitt Romney, Marco Rubio, and Cory Gardner are            calling for a task force to counter Chinese propaganda, and to provide U.S. embassies with guidance on how to counter false narratives locally.The tension from            the information war between the United States and China on the origin of COVID-19 has resulted in increased political brinkmanship; Trump's administration has requested that the United Nations Security Council            include a statement verifying that the virus originated in China in a COVID-19 resolution. Diplomats            have been summoned. U.S. reporters have            lost press credentials in China. This is not an ideal state of relations at any time, let alone during a pandemic that requires international cooperation.But letting these narratives spread unchallenged is also not an option. Social-media companies should be paying far closer attention to the stories they're allowing state-media propagandists to pay to boost. Allowing misleading narratives to take hold during a pandemic can cause immeasurable harm, and risks turning the major tech platforms into accomplices in the deliberate spread of lies. We must keep the focus on finding cures, not fighting over conspiracies.           *An earlier version of this article misattributed a story published by ProPublica.Load-Date: April 12, 2020End of Document

Does China digital currency defy U.S. power?CE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 14, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 3174 wordsBodyThe recent announcement that China's digital currency has entered a testing phase and is expected to be fully operational in the near future to rekindle the debate over the future of the international monetary and financial system. This news is linked to the recurrent, so far frustrated forecasts, of the impending fall in the global power of the United States and its currency, the dollar, as the main international currency. In this case also in relation to the possibilities of new technologies revolutionizing the very nature of the currency.This Chinese initiative may represent an immediate break of the status quo in the international monetary and financial system confuses different analytical and conceptual planes, so it can be said that this outcome is far from the horizon. The impact of China developing an all-digital currency combines three issues that appear to be related, but must be conceptually distinguished in order to be understood.The question of the feasibility of a currency that is entirely digital;In relation to this point, the existence of a digital currency means that a private currency such as bitcoin or the Facebook Pound could replace the state currency(s).The success of The Chinese digital currency means that it is contesting the U.S. global financial power, particularly because it has announced that it would not be related to the US dollar.All three dimensions have different answers.1. Is a digital currency feasible?First, it is feasible for a currency to be fully digital.For centuries, with the appearance of Bills of Exchange or simple promissory notes, it was known that the payment cycle does not necessarily require a material object. Keynes in the Coin Treaty had stipulated that the unit of account—that is, the measurement of value—was the main function of the currency, above being a means of payment and reserve of value. Increasingly, monetary circulation has been dispensing monetary materiality (tickets and coins) with the use of credit card or the internet. Monetary aggregates for years far exceed the printing of banknotes and material coins. The digital yuan is an additional form of expression of the Chinese state currency. Innovates as much as the various historical instruments of monetary expression have innovated, such as paper currency, checks, credit and debit cards and the use of cell phones to make payments, to name a few.The content of the currency lies in its ability to fully exercise the functions of unit of account, means of exchange and reserve of value. A full currency should be a benchmark for prices and contracts and therefore be the means by which property rights are transferred between economic operators, both now and over time. The historical development of monetary standards, credit and financial intermediation is the basis for the expansion of commercial enterprises.The content of this important social convention is expressed in "forms" that may change due to social and technological advances. The currency can be physical (coins, representative banknotes, bills of exchange, etc.) or virtual, in which debits and credits are settled with 'plastic money' (debit and credit cards) and 'electronic money' or 'digital'- for the use of cell phones, cryptocurrencies, etc.2. Rising a comprehensive digital currency, could this be private?This point connects to the next, that is, if the fact that there is a fully digital currency, it could be private, like bitcoin, and no longer state.The answer here is no. But this has nothing to do with the physical character ofthe coin. It has to do with the capitalist social constitution.Confusion is largely caused by the orthodox view of the economy that continually treats the state as a necessary and almost marginal evil of private economic activity. In fact, capitalist society arises from the constitution of national states which, among other things, stipulate a currency and its value in a certain geographical area. It's about that coin that private people seek to accumulate wealth.If a private person were in charge of managing that currency, he would be hoarding social validation of private accumulation, being that he would also be active in that search. That is, it would be judge and part, which is obviously contradictory and would not be accepted by others. Conceptual bewilderment can lead to the fact that private activities exist based on certain monetary functions, such as the creation of means of payment or value reserves, with the most well-known example of banks being the most well-known.In the contemporary debate, the emergence of private digital currencies came to be celebrated as the possibility of eliminating the monopoly on the issuance and regulation of monetary rules and the financial intermediation of the State. If such a possibility exists at the top level of theoretical abstractions, it is unlikely that it will gain ground in the complex world of market relations in modern market societies. This is because private cryptocurrencies are highly volatile instruments and for this reason no longer have quality demand to be the benchmark for prices and contracts, i.e. unit of account. This function is the central function. It is precisely for this reason that the state monopoly on monetary management is revealed as an essential public good.Private cryptocurrencies already perform certain monetary functions, such as reserving value (such as other financial assets) and means of exchange (or means of payment). This could continue in the future. In return, there is nothing to prevent central banks from adopting the digital format for their currencies. This is precisely the step that China is currently taking. But it is the Chinese state that preserves a monopoly on determining the unit of account of the currency, while cryptocurrencies and other private financial assets and means of payment must be referenced in some state currency.Whether it were merely for the material feasibility of the coin, any private would have the conditions to issue a currency, whether digital or not, because the technological possibility and printing costs are accessible. That is, if it were conceptually feasible for a private person to replace the state currency, the fact that it is digital does not change anything, and could already do so. Therefore, the emergence of a digital currency does not override the question that it will remain state-owned.3. The success of China's digital currency would mean that it is contesting the US's global financial power. USAChina has become the world's largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity, with 18% of global GDP, and the second in market values behind the United States. In addition to having a prominent stake in global trade in goods and services and net ownership of financial assets abroad, it presents impressive progress in technological capacity and its companies have taken on leadership positions in several areas. The U.S. Special Commission of Congress recently stated that "the economic competitiveness and security of the United States are under threat from the Chinese government, which systematically seeks leadership in artificial intelligence, new materials, and new energies." This success underscores the view of many that China's economic rise will lead to a new global financial order, now stimulated by the projectof a digital yuan.By having a digital-only currency, the Chinese government can increase control over families and businesses, as the respective costs for the acquisition of goods, services and various assets would be easier to track, and increase tax efficiency. Moreover, as recent research by Deutsche Bank points out, the Chinese government may force local and multinational companies to use this new form of payments, with potentially beneficial effects on its internationalization strategy. These and other effects are likely, but none of them lead directly or automatically to a new financial order. So far, the Chinese currency has a marginal share in international transactions. The way forward for global consolidating is long and winding.Since the end of World War II, the international currency is the US dollar, strengthened after the fall of the Soviet Union. Currently, approximately 2/3 of the reserve assets of the world's central banks are denominated in dollars. The dollar is the leading currency in global private and public use to refer to commercial and financial contracts. The SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) platform reports that, in April 2020, 44% of international transactions recorded therein were settled in dollars. The euro appears as the second most internationally traded currency, with 30% of total payments. The Chinese yuan is the fifth leading currency, with just under 2%. In recent years, the Chinese currency has disputed this position with the Canadian dollar.The dollar is by far the main source of global liquidity and the largest benchmark for commercial and financial contracts. According to the Bis Quarter-At-Quarter Report of December 2019, in the global economy the stock of dollar credits was US$65.4 trillion, of which us$12.2 trillion was outside the United States. Measured in dollars, euro credits, the second currency in the global hierarchy, reached half of the world's stock in the U.S. currency, and outside its area accounted for one-third of dollar loans. Stock in the yen outside Japan, the third largest currency, is equivalent to 4% of the US. The dollar also excels in transactions in the foreign exchange market, with a daily turn of more than $6 trillion. The U.S. currency appears as a counterparty in half of these transactions. In derivatives terms, the US dollar participates in at least 90% of the volume traded in exchange swap contracts. The Chinese currency was the eighth with the highest daily volume of transactions in the foreign exchange market, according to another BIS survey, and, comparing the results of the 2016 and 2019 surveys, recorded lower growth in the use of the yuan.Thus, while China has become considerably close to the US in aspects of the 'real' economy, in terms of financial variables, it remains far behind. The United States' participation in foreign exchange flows, the designation of bank loans and debt issues, the designation of international trade contracts, the value of central bank foreign exchange reserves, among other measures, fluctuates between 50% and 65% of global totals. These proportions have remained more or less stable over the past seven decades. Thus, it seems difficult for America's financial power to be at risk.4. America's financial powerThere were always few national currencies capable of performing international functions. At the international level, unlike the national level, there is no maximum authority such as the State; therefore, there is no international currency either. Themonetary relations between nations reflect a state's power to project itself outside its border by creating its own monetary space. This determines a hierarchy of currencies based on the power capacity of individual national states according to military, technological, economic and socio-political aspects. At the top of this hierarchical pyramid is the currency issued by the most powerful state of the international system, which fully exercises its functions as a means of exchange, unit of purchase and reserve of value. That country possesses what British academic Susan Strange calls structural power: the ability to define 'the rules of the game'.On the monetary side, at first, it was believed that this power was limited by the rules of convertibility and parity of the gold-standard system promoted by Britain in the 19th century—even though in practice it was not followed to the letter. Keynes in the 1920s already called that vision that would condition monetary policy to a certain stock of gold . The Bretton Woods system established by the U.S. in 1944 limited that direct link only to the dollar, while the other currencies were indirectly determining a relationship with the US. This was the original basis for the current financial and trade 'rules' in the world: the gold-dollar standard, the creation of the IMF and the World Bank, the GATT-WTO system, the UN Security Council, NATO, etc.,The United States was the only country that did not respect these rules when it thought it was appropriate. And he also repudiated and reformulated them when they ceased to match their strategic interests. In 1971, Nixon ended the dollar to gold limitation forever and since then the dollar has no management commitment. That decision actually sanctioned the practice that the U.S. had already exercised from the outset since it was never really limited to dollar-gold parity—which resulted in what the French claimed was the 'exorbitant privilege' of being able to issue without ever having to adjust.In the 1970s, both Japan and Germany had higher economic growth than the United States. However, they could not contain the pressures of American financial diplomacy, precisely because they lacked the military and political power to do so. For the same reason, they leaned towards the dollar's strong diplomacy and the subsequent realignment of exchange rates in the early 1980s. The same was done with emerging developing countries during the external debt crisis of the 1980s and during recurring crises in the 1990s and 2000s. These episodes clearly demonstrate the power of the United States.The United States used its monetary power to recompose international hierarchies from the shock of interest that Paul Volcker applied in 1979 as director of the Federal Reserve that led the Western world into a severe global recession. The European countries and Japan, as well as the Third World, which had been contesting spaces of power, went on to adopt national policies of economic and, in particular, financial openness (absent from the Bretton Woods model), which almost entirely globalized the dollar as a global currency. Thus, the questioning of the power of the dollar in the early 1970s became its total globalization two decades later, further strengthened by the demise of the Soviet Union.This dollar power was built by incorporating countries into their monetary space. At the beginning of the last century President Teodoro Roosevelt bought Britain and Germany the debts Venezuela had with them so that they have no reason to meddle in the Americas based on the Monroe Doctrine. By moving the debt to dollarsVenezuela, that country was left at the mercy of U.S. monetary power. This was then expanded in what was called 'dollar diplomacy' with new countries in the Caribbean and Central America becoming dollar indebted. In the inter-war, the dollar's monetary space expanded with loans from the Dawes and Young Plans to solve Germany's reparations and Franco-British debts to the U.S. itself during the war. This was repeated during the second world war and then the Marshall Plan and other U.S. aid policies expanded the dollar's international monetary area. In the 1970s he grew more with third-world indebtedness. With the fall of the USSR, former Soviet countries were also incorporated into the dollar's monetary space.So, if China as a growing power is to create its own monetary space not dependent on the US dollar, whether or not its currency is entirely digital is not relevant. If China had the power to create its own monetary space, it would do so with its current currency. It can positively affect other countries' view of their political, technological and social management capabilities. But this alone is not enough to replace the dollar as a global currency.This has to do with the dimension of power. And if, so, as in the financial sphere China is extremely distant from the US, in the military aspect, despite a significant effort, it is also far away. According to the SIPRI 'Military Spending Database', U.S. military expenditures accumulated between 2001 and 2018 amounted to US$12.5 trillion or 44% of the overall expenditures for the period. China spent $2.6 trillion or 8.9% of the global total. Even if it is argued that Chinese data are underestimated, the difference between its investment capabilities in the military area exceeds distances in terms of economy size or representativeness in terms of global trade. In short, the United States in the military dimension also remains far superior, as well as its overall power in the world.Digital currency and global powerIn its latest issue The Economist deals with the financial aspect of The Sino-American rivalry. Matthieu Favas states that "many assume that the status quo is too ingrained to be challenged, but that is no longer the case. A separate financial realm is forming in the emerging world, with different pillars and a new master." This despite also recording that "America's strength within the system remains enormous. When catastrophes strike, the dollar goes up. It remains the world's safest reserve of value and the main means of exchange. That makes the institution that mints it the metronome of world markets." The same thing records with finances.For Favas three issues are modifying this table. First, it argues that the U.S. is oversteering the use of this power, including with its geopolitical allies. Second, emerging countries seek accessible financial alternatives and with a debt stock of $2.8 trillion, their inability to pay an expensive dollar can impact the system. Finally, the impact of COVID-19 can disintegrate world trade in regional spaces by opening up the possibility for China to expand financially, moving to "writing its own rules."However, he concludes by stating that the most important thing is for the United States to lose confidence in the vision of other countries: "America's ability to ensure global prosperity is the glue that holds the financial order together. With its legitimacy greatly affected, renewed attacks on the system seem inevitable."In other words, the possibility of China dominating the systemmonetary-financial is mostly dependent on the behavior of the United States—and not so much on Chinese. If, finally, the dollar succumbs to its domain, china's opening a fully digital currency will have been a minor factor. Not decisive.On the other hand, The Economist's analysis places too much emphasis on the confidence that the rest of the world has in the dollar and not so much on the power that the United States possesses in dominating global money and financial markets, as well as military, ideological, diplomatic, and cultural dominance in the world—and a real economy equivalent to China, and much higher per capita GDP.  Hard to think that you will not use this power to influence the future outcome.On all the visions that point, in one way or another, the collapse of the United States, in the latest edition of Foreign Affairs Ruchir Sharma warns: "America's economic supremacy has repeatedly proven that the declines are wrong."Load-Date: May 15, 2020End of Document

Cuomo Says China Is Donating 1,000 Ventilators To New YorkThe Daily CallerApril 4, 2020 Saturday 04:51 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: DAILY-CALLER-NEWS-FOUNDATION; healthLength: 511 wordsByline: Chuck Ross, Investigative Reporter, chuck@dailycaller.comChuck Ross is a reporter at The Daily Caller.Author ImageBodyLink to ImageNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Saturday that the Chinese government has arranged to send 1,000 ventilators to help the Empire State deal with the coronavirus pandemic that originated from China.“This is a big deal, and it's going to make a significant difference for us,” Cuomo said at a daily press conference.Cuomo said that Jack Ma and Joseph Tsai, the founders of the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, have arranged to donate the ventilators in coordination with Beijing. The equipment will arrive at JFK airport on Saturday, the governor said.Cuomo has battled with the U.S. government to provide ventilators to New York as it deals with the highest hospitalization rates for coronavirus in the country. Cuomo said that 15,905 New Yorkers are currently hospitalized with coronavirus. More than 4,100 of those are in the ICU. (RELATED: Here's A List Of Countries That Received Faulty Medical Supplies From China)“We got really good news today that the Chinese government is going to facilitate a donation of 1,000 ventilators that will come into JFK today,” said Cuomo. “This is a big deal and it's going to make a significant difference for us”: 1,000 donated ventilators will arrive at JFK today from China, Gov. Cuomo announces https://t.co/j4xc56ss4S           pic.twitter.com/AzKCVBUE5u - CBS News (@CBSNews)            April 4, 2020While Cuomo thanked the Alibaba founders and the Chinese ambassador for the donation, he asserted that the U.S. needs to fix supply chain issues that have forced hospitals to rely on China for ventilators and other medical equipment.“China is remarkably the repository for all of these orders - ventilators, PPE (personal protective equipment) - it all goes back to China,” Cuomo said. “Which long term we have to figure out why we ended up in this situation where we don't have the manufacturing capacity in this country.”“We need the capacity in this country to do this,” he continued.The Chinese government has waged a propaganda campaign to highlight its donations of medical equipment to other countries, even though some of the supplies have been defective.Nearly half of the 1.3 million masks that the Chinese government donated to the Netherlands were found to be defective. Eighty percent of coronavirus test kits that Beijing provided the Czech Republic and Spain did not work.The novel coronavirus strain is believed to have emerged out of a Wuhan wildlife food market in November 2019. Chinese officials waited nearly six weeks to inform outside health organizations about the new virus. They also cracked down on physicians in Wuhan who alerted peers outside of China about the threat of a pandemic.The Central Intelligence Agency also reportedly believes that the Chinese government has vastly undercounted coronavirus infections and deaths.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

AUSTRALIAN UNIVERSITY SUSPENDS STUDENT WHO CRITICIZED ITS CHINA TIESStates News ServiceMay 29, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 891 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A disciplinary panel at Australia's University of Queensland has suspended an outspoken student activist who criticized Beijing's influence at the university and took part in protests in support of Hong Kong. "I've been expelled from The University of Queensland for two years as a reprisal for my activism criticizing the Chinese government," Drew Pavlou said via his Twitter account on Friday. "Will launch immediate appeal." "The University of Queensland has expelled me, an Australian student, for attacking the Chinese government's human rights record," he said. "Twenty per cent of their revenue comes from China, so my pro-Hong Kong activism threatened their business model." Pavlou, who is a democratically elected UQ Senator, said he would take his case "all the way to the Supreme Court." He said the suspension period covered his entire tenure on the UQ Senate. There were signs on Friday that the university may already be seeking to distance itself from the disciplinary council. UQ chancellor Peter Varghese issued a statement saying he had concerns about the decision. "I was today advised about the outcome of the disciplinary action against Mr Pavlou," he said in comments reported by The Australian newspaper. "There are aspects of the findings and the severity of the penalty which personally concern me [and] I have decided to convene an out-of-session meeting of UQ's Senate next week to discuss the matter."'Kangaroo court'Varghese's statement came after Pavlou's lawyer, barrister Tony Morris QC walked out of the disciplinary panel hearing last week, saying it was a "kangaroo court." Morris said the panel had refused to hand over documents allegedly supporting the case against Pavlou. The university's disciplinary panel alleged that Pavlou, a 20-year-old student of English and philosophy, had harmed UQ's reputation, engaged in intimidating and disrespectful conduct, and disrupted the running of the university, among other charges. Pavlou -- who suffers from depression -- faced 11 allegations of misconduct, including activities that the authorities say breached its integrity and harassment policies and the student charter. Pavlou earlier said the authorities had presented as "evidence" of his alleged misconduct social media comments he made regarding the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, in which he claimed to be speaking "on behalf of the university" following his election as student representative to the university senate. Pavlou has also reported being physically attacked by Chinese Communist Party supporters during a campus brawl at UQ sparked by Chinese students' opposition to a Hong Kong protest-related activity. According to UQ, Pavlou also allegedly placed a sign on the UQ Confucius Institute -- a cultural organization embedded in campuses around the world and directly staffed and controlled by the Chinese government -- in March, declaring it was a "biohazard" amid the coronavirus epidemic, according to a post he made on Facebook. Pavlou says he is being singled out because of his specific criticisms of UQ's relationship with China, as well as his support for the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement and for the Turkic Uyghur ethnic group, who have been subjected to mass incarceration in "re-education" camps by the CCP. Pavlou also burned a copy of the collected works of Chinese President Xi Jinping outside the Chinese consulate in Brisbane. 'Silent Invasion' felt in AustraliaXu Jie, the Chinese Consul General in Brisbane, has previously accused Pavlou of engaging in "anti-China separatist activities." China's Global Times tabloid newspaper, published by Communist Party paper the People's Daily, has made similar claims. Xu was awarded the post of visiting professor by UQ vice president Peter Hoj on July 12, 2019, a move which also drew criticism from Pavlou at the time. Canberra last year said it would crack down on suspected Chinese Communist Party influencers in the country following the introduction of new laws targeting activities by lobbyists and agents of foreign governments in June 2018, and later denied a passport to a top Chinese businessman. Australian author and professor of public ethics Clive Hamilton's book, Silent Invasion: China's Influence in Australia, was initially turned down by three publishers citing fears of reprisals from Beijing before being published in 2018. Hamilton's book argues that Australia's elites, and parts of the country's large Chinese-Australian diaspora, have been mobilized by Beijing to gain access to politicians, limit academic freedom, intimidate critics, gather information for Chinese intelligence agencies, and organize protests against Australian government policy. According to Reuters, the Chinese Communist Party was behind a massive cyber attack on the Australian national parliament ahead of May's general election. The agency cited the country's cyber intelligence agency, the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), as saying that Beijing was responsible for the attack on the parliament and the three largest political parties, and that it had originated with the Ministry of State Security in Beijing. The findings were initially kept secret to avoid damaging trade ties. Reported by RFA's Mandarin and Cantonese Services. Edited by Luisetta Mudie.Load-Date: May 30, 2020End of Document

CONNECTING PACIFIC EP2States News ServiceMay 28, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 4000 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: ANN ARBOR, Mich. BodyThe following information was released by the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor:Connecting Pacific EP2 Transcript[Sound]Hans Anderson: This is Connecting Pacific. A podcast from the University of Michigan of personal stories and perspectives about the changing relationship between China and the United States. I'm Hans Anderson.Anderson: We talk to a group of U of M student and alumni about their experiences being ethnically Chinese during the pandemic in this unique political climate. And we also ask them to share their memory of SARS outbreak in 2002.Anderson: Xin Sun is a current Ph.D. student from U of M. She shared her memory about SARS.Xin Sun: I was in my second-grade elementary school. So, I don't really have a strong memory of that, especially since I'm not from Beijing. I'm from Shandong, a province that is quite far from Beijing. But I do have some memory that, like every day at school we took our temperatures. And then like the teachers, they asked us to take temperatures at home and then the parents need to sign their names and then you need to bring these certifications back to school.Anderson: Professor Yuhua Wang, a graduate of political science in 2011 from the University of Michigan, is now an associate professor at Harvard.Yuhua Wang: I was a senior in college in 2003. I was in Beijing, the ground zero of SARS. But looking back, you know, they were all good memories. I remember at the beginning there was panic, like this time, and then you keep hearing friends or classmates, having fever or being quarantined dorm after dorm. Classes were canceled. And then I went back home. But then I stayed for, I think a month. I worked on my senior thesis at home, and then I was asked to come back to campus to attend the commencement. The commencement was not canceled.It happened in early May. And then to re-enter campus, I had to be quarantined for two weeks with some other friends who went home. But those were probably the best two weeks in my life. There were no classes, no work. Our food was delivered every day. There was no social distancing, so I could hang out with my friends every day. So that were the fun two weeks actually.Anderson: Joseph Xu, an UM alum, now works at the college of engineering.Joseph Xu: My experience of SARS was very limited in the sense that, you know, I grew up in the Midwest and have lived here my whole life, and there wasn't much about SARS here in the US.[Sound]You know, we had heard about it on the news. I think there are a handful, something like 20 some cases in the US ultimately, and there just wasn't much concern about it. It was just sort of something that was really isolated to China and something that at least for me, didn't really affect my life much at all.Anderson: What impact did SARS leave on China, if any, and what can we learn from that?Sun: I heard that China has built this sort of direct, like a system that you can report these kinds of potential diseases or like contagious diseases up to the head, or like the top officials of the government like avoiding all these bureaucracies. But from what I heard this time, it doesn't work. And then that system was only for known diseases. So that's why this new novel thing is not reported that quickly. That's from what I heard.Wang: I think there are probably two levels for the public. The SARS certainly prepares people for COVID this time. I remember in 2003, the central television station just everyday broadcasting about how to wash your hands, how the self-quarantine, how to take care of someone who is sick at home. So, people in China are better prepared this time. You don't see people protesting, for example, against the lock down in China.So this time we see, for example, the early signs of breakout in Wuhan and then covered up by the local government or, you know, we don't know who covers that, but you know, by the government are there some cover up and then later on, it escalated. We see the numbers, then the government has to acknowledge the breakout.And then you have removal of local officials, right? So, the central government will blame the local officials for the cover up. And then, you know, at the end, more recently we see, you know, propaganda to establish a more positive image of the central government. So, in terms of how the government responds to the crisis, we see a very similar timeline.[Sound]Anderson: When COVID19 was first found in Wuhan in December last year, what was your first reaction?Wang: I totally underestimated, like the government everywhere. I didn't think it would be a thing. There were reports of science of epidemic every year, right? So, you hear, H1N1, swine flu, Ebola, so on and so forth. But every time you hear it, you think it's just, it's not a big deal until you see the numbers.Right? So, I think this time when I heard the first case in Wuhan, and I thought, you know, that's just one of those epidemics. And then, it'll be contained. It's probably not, you know, human to human transaction. So I think we'll some cases, and it will die out very soon. that's my first reaction.Xu: I think, as an American who grew up, you know, reading and watching things about H1N1, mad cow disease and SARS obviously, this just felt like another one of these things. Another one of these things that wouldn't affect us. Right? And I think that's, as you know, the professor mentioned, is kind of a worldview, right? We felt like it was isolated to China. We thought it would just be something that China would deal with and then would maybe, you know, like SARS be something that concerned us a little bit, but at the end of the day wouldn't be that much of a big deal.And so, I think emotionally when it hit us, it hit us that much harder because of sort of the history of how we've been experiencing these situations in the past 10, 15 years or so.Sun: I would say if it's back in last December, I totally won't associate those with, even H1N1 or SARS because I just thought, oh, just some cases, it's sort of unknown but like it won't be a big deal. And when I started to connect that with, like H1N1 or like SARS, it was like January, like mid or late January. So, like at first response I was like, oh, just a couple of cases. That's it. I think doctors, governments would take care of that and we'll be fine.Anderson: Did you do anything differently in the US when the pandemic started to make its way here?Sun: My parents definitely asked me to do a lot of things, like buying facemasks and protect, like stay at home, at least go out less. And then I went to local, like supermarkets and stuff. I don't remember if that's like late January or early February, but around that time. My parents were like, you need to buy some masks. You need to buy some of these supplies to sort of better prepared for that. And then it's really hard to get the masks, like early February or like late January here even. I don't think at that time I should wear a mask. But I wear mask pretty early. I would say earlier than a lot of the Americans.Xu: It was only really in the last month (March) that my parents started making the calls to like, you know, buy a mask. Be extra vigilant about staying safe and all that sort of stuff for me. But you know, my parents and I had been talking about it since December. Just to give a quick background, I was born in China, but I moved here when I was about a year and a half old. And my parents were in their mid to late thirties when they moved here.And so, for my parents and me, really, one of the values they instilled as immigrants was fitting in. They did not want me to wear a mask. They did not want me to do all these extra sorts of things, a precaution that we're now doing, because they didn't want me to be picked on. Basically, they didn't want me to be seen as like an outsider in a sense. And this was something I talked at length about with my dad. He was afraid that, you know, I'd face unnecessary discrimination. And this is something they express a little bit during the SARS outbreak, but I was a little bit too young, I think, at that point to really understand where they're coming from all that sort of stuff.So, it was interesting to watch them, finally, I guess embrace the safety measures that we're now embracing now, as immigrants, but also as Americans in a sense too.Wang: In January, I just under prepared, I didn't think it would spread to the US so quickly. I was worried about my family and friends in China at the moment, I remember this is around the time of the spring festival in China. And then my parents said they were planning on, you know, getting together with relatives who haven't been there and so on, so forth.But then they had to cancel the dinner and I realized, this is getting serious. And then you heard the news from the government, you know, it's locked down in Wuhan and so on, so forth. So, at that moment in January, I was primarily worried about people in China. And then, the only thing I did differently was, you know, I remember, I just started to help people connect in the US and also making donations to ship masks to China. You know, so as Xin said, she's having trouble getting masks in China, probably due to the fact that a lot of Chinese and Chinese Americans in the US were shipping those masks back to China. Now looking back, we probably should have saved some masks in the US because we are now running short.[Sound]Wang: I was attacked on Twitter. I tweeted after Zhao Lijian, China's foreign ministry spokesperson said that, the virus might be from the US. It was a conspiracy theory. You know, I didn't like it. I said on Twitter that we should just stop debating about where the virus came from and should focus on ending it. And then the next morning I woke up, it was like thousands of replies already. And now it's gotten more than 500,000 impressions. It's my most popular tweet, actually.I tweeted, because I didn't like Zhao Lijian's conspiracy theory, but then because I'm Chinese, people on Twitter interpreted as a defense for Zhao Lijian. I learned a few things from the experience, actually. The first thing is for the people who haven't used Twitter yet, try to avoid Twitter, if possible. There are a lot of trolls on Twitter. But more importantly, a lot of prejudices against Chinese and Chinese Americans. It's very different from, for example, racism against the blacks in this country.The prejudice against Chinese is based on a very strong, but implicit assumption that all Chinese are agents or supporters of the Chinese regime. So, people think in a way, our Chinese, we have a Chinese name and they think you must be hired by the Chinese government no matter what you're saying.Anderson: Do you think this relates to the history of anti-Chinese racism in the United States? Like there is a very particular type of racism against Chinese. It goes back actually many years, like railroads, like the Chinese exclusion act. Do you think that there's a theme to the anti-Chinese racism in the United States?Wang: Yeah, certainly there's a historical root of this, but I think the prejudice, or the stereotype of Chinese has changed dramatically, I think over the last decades.I saw some statistics that the Asian Americans, including the Chinese, especially are the highest income, and also, fastest growing minority group in the US, and also the highest education group in the US. I think this is very different from the railroad Chinese from the 19th century. I think, part of the prejudice is based on this perception that the Chinese now are very competent. They can do bad things, they have high education, high income. They are very different from the average Americans. And so, they can do bad things. They have the capabilities to do those things, but also at the same time, you know, they are forever foreigners. There is this saying that, you know, Asians are forever foreigners. They never fit in, you know, no matter what you do? Right? You can wear a baseball cap, you can wear a hoodie, but you are never a part of the Americans, so I think that is still very strong in the US.Sun: I started wearing masks right after spring break, which was early March. Before or around the same time Michigan has announced the first two cases. And then there was this night when I went to a grocery store with my boyfriend and then we just walked there. It's like 20, 30 minutes' walk. And then when we walked back. We were wearing masks. And then there's this guy in a car that was yelling at us. Like, oh dude, do you have this Corona coronavirus thing, if not, why you wear a mask? And then, he threw us like a metal thing, like a key or something. I didn't see it very clearly, we luckily didn't get hit, but that was the experience.And then actually when I talked... at that time with my advisors and people in the lab, I got to know that there's no like mask culture here. Like people don't wear mask, and only the people who are sick would wear masks. I do also think that people should be aware that there's this pandemic, if not getting here, but it's in other parts of the world. And then they should respect those people who choose to wear a mask to protect themselves.Xu: It's weird how it's become this visual symbolism of fear for a lot of Americans. Similar to like how the hijab was that in post 9/11. I went jogging the other day. I've been, you know, obviously barred from the gyms with quarantining and in state lockdown and all that sort of stuff.And this older gentleman, who is driving down the street, like basically stopped while I was like jogging down the street and basically said... I don't know the intention... I don't know if this was for me, being Chinese, said, you shouldn't be out jogging. You probably have the COVID.It's one of those things. I think, you know, prior I had been reading a lot of news articles about how the FBI was talking about the potential for the rise in hate crimes and all that sort of stuff. And it's just something that is an added extra layer. Right. I think as an Asian American in this country, I grew up like a lot of Asian Americans being bullied, for flat face, the shape of my eyes, stinky food, all that sort of stuff. And now it just feels like this is this extra thing to be self-conscious about. This is this extra thing of when you go jogging, when you go outside, am I being stared at and am I being stared at because of this?You know, I don't know if people are staring or not, but it's a sort of adding an extra layer of anxiety and paranoia that I think a lot of us have to unfairly live with right now. Right. And it sucks!Anderson: Do you still feel self-conscious wearing a mask now that lots of Americans are wearing masks?Xu: So, I do not wear a mask actually. It's something that I'm still honestly mentally struggling with doing. I know it is recommended by the CDC and is probably of a safer sort of thing. I have it laying on my desk, but I haven't worn it because I am scared in some sense of being, you know, that visual terror, that visual fear for others and obviously being attacked because of that. I know it might not be the most socially responsible thing, but at the same time, it just feels... I am scared of being made to feel like more of other than I already normally feel like, if that makes sense.Anderson: Professor Wang, you wrote an article in the Washington Post saying that political rhetoric could make stereotypes worse. Could you speak more about it?Wang: The idea is that many people hold prejudices against certain races, groups, you know, gender, you name it. And then, but under most circumstances, they don't feel comfortable expressing or acting on it. This is what we call Social Desirability Pressure. It's a very good thing because it can keep people from saying or doing bad things.The question then is the conditions under which people start feeling okay with practicing or even acting on those prejudices. So, a lot of the research in political science shows that political leaders matter, media matter.When political leaders publicly attack a certain group of people, say for example, you know, when Trump calls it, you know, the Chinese Virus and then people who hold those prejudice are emboldened to do the same thing.Because they feel it is okay. You know, it is not a taboo anymore because our president, you know, can say, our lawmakers can say, so therefore, it's okay for me to say it as well. So, this time I think, we see a very clear pattern, right. The anti-Asian attacks increased dramatically after Donald Trump and several other GOP lawmakers call the virus the Chinese virus.And then there are websites that can track those incidents. And then you see a very clear increase after Trump said that is Chinese Virus. So, I think it means that the political leaders can really make people feel okay to say bad things. And also, you know, in some cases to act on those bad thoughts.[Sound]Anderson: What do you think about these divergent worldviews and these competing narratives between the US and China? What does this say about the tension between the two countries?Wang: This is actually the saddest part during this pandemic. You know, two leading economies are pointing fingers at each other rather than collaborating on ending the crisis. The tension was before COVID, you know, the US-China relations were bad before this. There was a trade war, remember, right? And COVID just became a new arena for power play, where two countries are using the pandemic to direct attention of the public to a foreign country rather than their own problems. This is a classic playbook tactic used by politicians to shift blame.And looking forward, I'm not very optimistic that two countries can mend the fences very quickly. One of the keys to US-China relations in the past four decades, you know, the friendship in the past four decades is that people to people exchange. Think about Xin, I and Joseph. we are ethnically Chinese, and then we came to this country, you know, some of us stay here and have families. You also have numerous students, visiting scholars, tourists, and businesses. Those people are the key to the US-China relations in the last four decades.And one of the unfortunate consequences of the pandemic is that Chinese are leaving the US. We'll see students are going back to their homes and then people who were planning on staying, you know, got denied visa or people were planning on taking a job in the US were their denied H1B or green card. And then at the same time, on the other side you also see Americans leaving China which means this people to people exchange, will be much reduced after the pandemic. So, this is the true worry, right? So, you know, in the next several years, right after the pandemic, we will see a much decreased level of people to people exchange between the two countries, which I think is, you know, in the long term will hurt US-China relations.Xu: I think it's petty, and kind of disgusting just using this as a platform for politics, when people's lives are at stake. I mean, with all sort of Trump's rhetoric about the China virus and sort of all this trickled down racism that he is, in a sense, instilling within our nation, you know, for me, like personally, I don't view as really a reflection of maybe his views as much as just this political move of trying to displace the blame and trying to get reelected....and whatever other sort of political moves that he wants. And to me, it's just really disgusting in a sense. I'm really sad that we're here doing this rather than trying to figure out a solution together.Anderson: What do you think the people in the US get wrong about China and what do people in China get wrong about the US?Wang: Well, let me be clear first, I want to be on the right side of history. So, you know, I do condemn the Chinese government's cover up all the early cases. You know, this is 100% wrong. They should not have done it. But then there's a very strong assumption in the world, in particularly in the US, right now, that, if China didn't cover up the virus in the early stage, there wouldn't be the spreading of the virus across the world. Right?This is what is what driving people crazy. They blame China because they think, Oh, it's okay you get the virus but you should, you know, contain it at the very early stage, but because of your cover-up, it led to the spreading of the virus to other parts of the world. You know, this is the main reason why people are accusing China, right.But then if you think about this assumption, this is in social sciences we call this a counterfactual scenario. That is, you know, something that didn't happen. We simply don't know whether it's true that if China didn't cover up the virus at the early stage, there wouldn't be the spreading of the virus across the world. Therefore, you know, I would call for caution for believing in this unrealistic assumption and get mad at China.You know, this is something we get wrong. I think the right conclusion should be this virus we are dealing with is a very contagious virus. And that even without the coverup in China, for example, in December, January, and the virus would still spread to other parts of the world.Sun: The thing I want to say about people in China got wrong about US is like...I feel like Chinese they feel the US are not that aware of the severity of this thing. But actually, I think some of the people, they are like, oh, let's all reopen the economy. Let's go back to the beach or whatever.This is some of the Americans, and then there are other Americans. They're like, let's go social distancing. We need to stay at home. We need to take all these measures. I told my parents that all. Now I go to the grocery store. When I wait in the line, there are like signs like six feet away, you need to wait. Like, you will need to practice all of these things. They're like, oh, US is doing a pretty good job. Like you're doing these. Because from the news they're like, oh, US people they don't take that very seriously.But like, I would say, there are quite a lot of people, they really know the severity of this thing and then they're doing a lot of things. Also of course US is a really diverse country. People have different opinions. And then the good thing is also like, people can tell each other your thoughts. Like it's like whole lot of different views. You cannot just see one side of it.Xu: Kind of the same stuff that I grew up with, right. They are bad at telling about.... just assuming that all Chinese people are the same. Chinese people are the same as Asian Americans and Chinese Americans. And just basically being granular. Right!And knowing that we all have our own individual stories, and that we don't all support the Chinese government. Some of us do, some of us don't. Right. And some of us have different mixed feelings and mixed views about this as well. The interesting thing I will say to corroborate another point is that, you know, when this first started in the US definitely I think my family, in China and here were just kind of, you know, being prideful about how China handled it in the sense that community values. Basically, how China got through it with this communal value. And how the US wasn't going to be prepared to do it and too selfish, too self-interested to do it.I'll be honest, as someone who spent a decent amount of time in Southeast Asia last fall and really spend some time looking at that value, I was very cynical about our potential of handling the situation. And obviously I don't think the US has handled it perfectly, nor has any country really. But I've been pleasantly surprised about the sort of community aspect of us as Americans and how we're handling it.Anderson: I am Hans Anderson. This has been connecting Pacific.

AFRICAN NATIONS ISSUE PROTESTS OVER RACISM IN CHINA'S GUANGZHOU IN COVID-19 FIGHTStates News ServiceApril 13, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1285 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:UPDATED at 1:30 P.M. EDT on 2020-04-13African envoys in the Chinese capital Beijing have written a protest letter and governments of several African nations have summoned Chinese ambassadors following reports of forced coronavirus testing and quarantines, evictions from apartments and hotels, and other acts they said constituted racism against black people in the southern city of Guangzhou."The African Group of Ambassadors observes with consternation the discrimination and stigmatization of Africans whereby they are made to forcefully, and in a very crude manner to undergo epidemic investigation and Nucleic Acid Test, 14 days quarantine even if they had not traveled outside their jurisdictions, not come into contact with infected persons, not had close contact or showing any symptoms of the COVID-19," said the letter, dated April 10.The envoys said that they had not been made aware of cases in which African nations had violated Chinese pandemic control laws, "Therefore, the singling out of Africans for compulsory testing and quarantine, in our view, has no scientific or logical basis and amounts to racism towards Africans in China," they wrote."We have received disquieting reports of inhuman treatments meted out to Africans particularly in Guangdong Province," said the letter, addressed to Chinese State Councilor Wang Yi.Among examples of abuses the letter cited were Africans ejected from hotels in the middle of the night, African students singled out for coronavirus testing, Africans married to Chinese removed from their families and quarantined in hotels alone, the seizure of passports and threats of revocation of visas, arrest, detention and deportation of legal visitors "for no cogent reason," they said.The group of African envoys "immediately demands the cessation of forceful testing, quarantine and other inhuman treatments meted out to Africans in Guangdong Province in particular and the whole of China," they wrote.In African capitals, the foreign ministers of Uganda, Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria have all summoned Chinese ambassadors in recent days after multiple reports and video clips emerged of evictions targeting African immigrants in the city as the authorities implement coronavirus quarantine and testing programs.The Twitter account of Black Livity, a news and current affairs website for and about black people living in China, tweeted a video on April 11 of a laminated notice in English at a branch of McDonalds in China, which read: "We've been informed that from now on black people are not allowed to enter the restaurant."The notice then tells the recipient to report to the local police for coronavirus testing. The person shooting the video then hands it back to the employee, who is wearing a McDonalds uniform, after reading it.African-Americans also warnedBlack Livity commented: "For those who still doubt that Black people and particularly #AfricansinChina are being targeted we feel it is our duty to share this. A sign at a @McDonalds restaurant seems to make this perfectly clear."The U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou, the largest city in southern China and home to a trading district colloquially known as "little Africa," has said police have ordered local businesses not to serve people "who appear to be of African origin.""African-Americans have also reported that some businesses and hotels refuse to do business with them," it said in an alert on its website."The U.S. Consulate General advises African-Americans ... to avoid the Guangzhou metropolitan area until further notice," it said.Black people could be required to submit to a coronavirus test and then undergo 14 days' quarantine at their own expense, it warned.Two months ago, Black Livity ran an op-ed discussing a recent spate of racist videos on Chinese social media targeting black people, but particularly Africans, including one in which black children say the words "I am a black monster [the Chinese equivalent of the N-word] and I have a low IQ."Uganda's foreign minister Sam Kutesa conveyed his government's "serious concern ... on the harassment and mistreatment of its nationals," the foreign ministry said in a statement, while Nigerian foreign minister Geoffrey Onyeama called via his Twitter account for "immediate Chinese government intervention" over the alleged maltreatment of Nigerians in Guangzhou.Kenya's Saturday Nation newspaper ran a front page story with the headline: "Kenyans in China: Rescue us From Hell," reporting on "long nights in the cold, racial discrimination in shopping malls and retail outlets and attacks on public transport in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak.""Residents of African descent have been kicked out of apartments on accusations of spreading the virus," the paper said, citing online video footage of young African immigrants sleeping on pavements and backstreets, or photos of signs barring foreigners from retail outlets.'We do not have discrimination in China'The country's foreign ministry has issued a "complaint note" to Beijing and asked the Chinese Embassy to follow up, the paper said.Ghana's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration, Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey condemned what she called the "ill-treatment and racial discrimination" meted out to Ghanaians and other African nationals in China in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak."I have been briefed on the inhumane treatment being meted out to Ghanaians and other African nationals in the People's Republic China with regards to the COVID-19 outbreak," Botchwey said in a statement reported by Ghana's Citinewsroom website on Saturday."I regret and highly condemn this act of ill-treatment and racial discrimination," Botchwey said, adding that she had summoned the Chinese ambassador over the matter.Moussa Faki Mahamat, who chairs the African Union Commission, said the Commission had followed suit "to express our extreme concern at allegations of maltreatment of Africans in #Guangzhou.""We do not have discrimination in China against African brothers," Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a daily news briefing."It is irresponsible and immoral for the U.S. to sow discord," he said. "Its attempt to drive a wedge between China and Africa will never succeed."he said.Without addressing the African letter or other diplomatic protests, Zhao said the provincial authorities in the southern province of Guangdong, of which Guangzhou is the capital, "are working promptly to improve their working method.""The Chinese government has been attaching great importance to the life and health of foreign nationals in China," Zhao said in a statement reported by Agence France-Presse on Sunday."The Guangdong (provincial) authorities attach great importance to some African countries' concerns," he said.The Black Livity op-ed, written two months ago, said black people living in China were "all angry about the mistreatment of our continent, communities and people.""While our host country China battles coronavirus and bemoans [anti-Chinese] racism (rightly so) we, Africans and people of African descent have rushed to the country's defence producing videos in support of the country and volunteering to assist in efforts to bring the nation back to normalcy," it said.The article said the responsibility for educating its citizens lies with China, and quoted the late Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison, who wrote: "The function, the very serious function of racism is a distraction. It keeps you from doing your work. It keeps you explaining, over and over again, your reason for being."Reported by RFA's Mandarin and Cantonese Services.

MILK TEA ALLIANCE TAKES ON CHINA'S LITTLE PINKS IN MEME WARStates News ServiceApril 15, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1127 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Social media users from Thailand, Taiwan and Hong Kong have taken to Twitter in recent days to hit back at China's "Little Pink" nationalists, who started trolling Thai users after an online altercation with Thai actor Vachirawat Cheevaari (known as Bright) and his girlfriend Weeraya Sukaram.The row erupted after online supporters of the Chinese Communist Party, known as Little Pinks, took issue with a tweet from Bright, the star of hit Thai TV show 2gether, who seemed to imply Hong Kong was a separate country from China.Weeraya also drew their ire by suggesting the coronavirus originated in a laboratory in Wuhan, prompting Chinese netizens to threaten to boycott Thai soaps and not to travel to the country as tourists after the pandemic.Thai users hit back with video of Chinese tourists piling their plates and shoving each other at an all-you-can-eat buffet, and multiple references to the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, including the "Tank Man" image in a number of guises, including an impromptu sculpture made from fast food.In a loose confederation of Twitterati known as the "Milk Tea Alliance" and using the hashtag #nnevvy, Weeraya's Twitter username, users from Thailand, Hong Kong and democratic Taiwan also fought back with a string of memes.Meanwhile, Weeraya commented that she dressed more like a "Taiwanese" after being told she looked like a "cute Chinese girl", drawing down further Little Pink ire on the couple.While Chinese users hurled insults at the Thai king and called Thais poor, Thai users responded with photos of collapsed apartment buildings due to substandard building materials linked to official corruption in China.When they claimed Taiwan as belonging to China, Thai users asked why Chinese nationals need a visa to visit the democratic island, which remains a sovereign state as the 1911 Republic of China.The clincher, according to some comments, lay in the Thai users' keenly developed political humor and their freedom to deploy it, for example, when a Thai user responded to a Chinese insult targeting the Thai government with the words: "Say it louder!"'Your mother is dead'The flame war quickly drew the attention of other Twitter users tired of being targeted by Little Pinks, who need to use a banned VPN to evade their own government's Great Firewall of censorship, and whose comments often include the insult "ni ma sile" (NMSL), meaning "your mother is dead."The alliance was soon joined by users from Japan, the Philippines, Malaysia, South Korea and India.One meme, posted by Twitter user Amazing, referenced the anniversary of the Boxer Rebellion against the Qing Dynasty on Tuesday .In a retake of a painting commemorating the Seymour Expedition of 1900, the meme shows an overwhelming force of soldiers carrying aloft the flags of eight nations, including that of Taiwan, and advancing on a lone Chinese who utters the words "NMSL."The punitive expedition -- which didn't actually end in victory, although a later one did -- is taught to Chinese nationals as an example of national humiliation at the hands of foreign oppressors."Taiwan is not China," Amazing wrote. "Free Hong Kong and Xinjiang and Tebet! (sic) Thank you Thais Free mainland china ... bomb the wall! #nnevvy #freechina"Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong joined in with a meme showing Hong Kong, Thailand and Taiwan depicted as three types of milk tea, labeled the "Milk Tea Alliance."Wong posted a selfie while watching 2gether, and urged Hong Kong to "stand with our freedom-loving Thai friends.""Perhaps we can build a new kind of pan-Asian solidarity that opposes all forms of authoritarianism!" he wrote.Taiwan supports 'alliance'From Taiwan, the mayor of Taoyuan city, Cheng Wen-Tsan, threw his support behind the alliance."Thank you our friends from #Thailand," Cheng tweeted, along with the flags of Taiwan and Thailand."Thailand has long been a popular travel destination for the Taiwanese. We look forward to increased exchanges after the #COVID19 outbreak!"Former 1989 student leader Wang Dan said the Little Pinks may appear to be acting as individuals, but they have strong incentives for behaving this way."The so-called Chinese netizens who came out and insulted people overseas obviously had government backing," Wang told RFA. "This was a government action, a part of its overseas influence [operations], and a part of its ideology of expanding its reach overseas."In Thailand, exiled pro-democracy activist Zhao Changfu said that while people there may admire China's economic achievements, they are less impressed by the Chinese government's persecution of religious believers and its indifference to public safety."They have more freedom of speech here, more freedom to [criticize] the government, what it does badly," Zhao said."The people are not very happy about their current prime minister and think they are too dependent on the Chinese Communist Party," he said.Pent-up anti-China feeling?Thai police have detained and deported Chinese dissidents at Beijing's request in spite of their having U.N. recognized political refugee status, and allowed the departure of Swedish national and Hong Kong-based bookseller Gui Minhai from his holiday home in Pattaya in 2015, in murky circumstances.Fellow Thailand-based activist Li Xiaolong agreed."A lot of countries have maintained their ties with China based on the business that it brings in, the tourism, and a lot of them have become economically dependent [on China]," Li said."They have let China get away with stuff for so long ... but I think the coronavirus pandemic has triggered a lot of pent-up [anti-China] feeling which has all come out at once," he said.Chinese current affairs commentator Jin Shan said China's education system trains everyone to think the same thing, which means its students typically lack the habit of independent thought."It's that sense of entitlement paired with a blinkered attitude you get in people from a powerful country," Jin said. "They are overly fragile about certain issues, and over-react to things, getting very upset.""They take very seriously stuff that wouldn't really bother us at all," he said.He said another factor was Chinese President Xi Jinping's policy of expanding China's overseas influence.Citizen journalist and computer expert Zhou Shuguang, who is now a national of Taiwan, said the Thais were widely seen as having won the #nnevvy battle."I think the Thais crushed the Little Pinks with their attitude and their experience," Zhou said. "All the Little Pinks knew how to say was 'your mother is dead'."Reported by Wang Yun for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Wong Lok-to for the Cantonese Service.

At one-month highs. (Related: SU, NBL, MPC, SSL, IMO...)CCL (16.75 +15.84%): Rises on above average volume alongside various cruise peers and other travel and leisure industry names on hopes for the further reopening of economic activities that have been pressured or shuttered by COVID-19-related restrictions. At one-month highs.VLO (66.45 +14.83%): Posted upside Q1 results on the top and bottom lines. Results have been impacted by decreased demand for gasoline amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Co's refining segment reported a $2.1 bln operating loss for Q1 vs an operating income of $479 mln in the prior year quarter. Renewable diesel reported an operating income of $198 mln while ethanol reported an operating loss of $197 mln.

Downgraded to Equal-Weight from Overweight at Morgan Stanley.15:40EBAY eBay Q1 earnings preview (39.33 +0.25)eBay (EBAY) is scheduled to release first quarter results after markets close this evening. A conference call to review those results will begin at 6 p.m. ET.Currently, S&P Capital IQ Consensus expects the company to report Q1 EPS of $0.72, up from $0.67 in the prior year quarter, and revenues of $2.32 bln, which would represent a decline of approx. 12% yr/yr.An upside earnings result from eBay would continue a seven-quarter streak of beats on the bottom line for the company. The company reported revenues in-line with or above consensus in each of the last four quarters. The company's recent $4.05 bln divestiture of ticket exchange unit StubHub to viagogo is reflected in the company's anticipated results. After completing the divestiture in mid-February, eBay guided for Q1 revenues of $2.31-2.36 bln, factoring in the StubHub transaction, and for non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $0.72-0.75. For FY20, the company then expected revenues of $9.56-9.76 bln and non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $3.00-3.10. S&P Capital IQ Consensus currently estimates that the company will achieve FY20 EPS of $2.89 and revenues of $9.51 bln. Since eBay's last earnings report, the company has provided several updates of note. Back in February, the company indicated that it continued to be involved in discussions with multiple parties regarding a potential transaction for its Classifieds Group as part of a strategic review process; further updates are expected by mid-year. In more recent news, eBay has appointed a new CEO: Jamie Iannone, most recently COO of Walmart (WMT) eCommerce, took the helm as eBay's CEO effective April 27. The company has also continued to expand its payment managing services internationally, last week announcing plans to expand to Australia and Canada later this year. eBay has yet to offer formal commentary on any impact dealt by the COVID-19 pandemic to its operations.EBAY has a market valuation of circa $31.3 bln and trades at roughly 14x forward earnings estimates. The stock on Monday recorded its highest levels since September.15:20BONDX Treasury Market SummaryTreasuries End Mixed as Fed HoldsU.S. Treasuries ended Wednesday on a mixed note after backing off their morning highs. Treasuries started the cash session with solid gains, but the first 30 minutes of action saw a pullback, which took place after the release of a Q1 GDP report, which pointed to the sharpest contraction since the financial crisis. However, the early pullback found support near yesterday's closing levels, allowing Treasuries to bounce to fresh highs. The market remained near its best levels of the day into mid-morning action, but an aggressive upward charge in stocks invited some selling in Treasuries. The afternoon release of the latest FOMC Statement was met with a muted initial reaction, but Treasuries slipped to lows into the close. The FOMC repeated its promise to support the flow of credit through asset purchases and Fed Chairman, Jay Powell, reiterated that the central bank remains ready to act aggressively. The U.S. Dollar Index slid 0.3% to 99.57, pausing just above yesterday's low. Yield Check: 2-yr: -1 bp to 0.19% 3-yr: -1 bp to 0.25% 5-yr: -1 bp to 0.36% 10-yr: +2 bps to 0.63% 30-yr: +4 bps to 1.25%News: Australia's Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, said that Australia will relax its lockdown measures soon. Tokyo will extend its state of emergency past May 6. Yonhap reported that the Bank of Korea has expanded its digital currency pilot program with major retailers. Fitch lowered Italy's rating to BBB- from BBB with a Stable outlook. South Korea's March Retail Sales fell 1.0% m/m (last -6.0%) while March Industrial Production increased 4.6% m/m (expected -1.3%; last -3.8%), rising 7.1% yr/yr (expected -1.9%; last 11.3%).

Eurozone's April Business and Consumer Survey fell to 67.0 from 94.2 (expected 74.7). March M3 Money Supply increased 7.5% yr/yr (expected 5.5%; last 5.5%). Germany's March Import Price Index fell 3.5% m/m (expected -2.5%; last -0.9%), decreasing 5.5% yr/yr (expected -4.0%; last -2.0%). Spain's March Retail Sales fell 14.1% yr/yr (last 1.8%) while April Business Confidence fell to -35.1 from -7.1. Swiss April ZEW Expectations increased to 12.7 from -45.8. Today's Data: First quarter GDP declined at an annualized rate of 4.8% (Briefing.com consensus -4.3%) while the GDP Price Deflator was 1.3% (Briefing.com consensus 1.1%). This was the largest decline in GDP since the fourth quarter of 2008. The key takeaway from the report is that it hints at how ugly the Advance Q2 GDP report will be given that shutdown measures in the U.S. didn't start to gain steam until the latter half of March. Pending Home Sales tumbled 20.8% in March after a revised 2.3% increase (from 2.4%) in February. The weekly MBA Mortgage Index fell 3.3% to follow last week's 0.3% downtick. The Purchase Index rose 11.6% while the Refinance Index fell 7.3%. Weekly crude oil inventories increased by 8.99 mln barrels after increasing by 15.0 mln barrels during the previous week.

The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for non-GAAP EPS is $1.27 and for revenue it's $33.70 bln. It's important to note that MSFT typically guides on the call, although with the pandemic, MSFT may not provide guidance this time. Last time, MSFT guided to MarQ revs of $34.1-34.9 bln.Microsoft operates in several areas and it's important to know the breakdown by segment: Productivity and Business Processes (Office 365, LinkedIn, Dynamics 365, which are cloud-based ERP and CRM apps), Intelligent Cloud (Azure, SQL Server, Windows Server), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Surface, Xbox).In January, MSFT's guidance by segment was: PBP: $11.5-11.7 bln IC: $11.85-12.05 bln and MPC: $10.75-11.15 bln. In February, Microsoft said it was seeing strong Windows demand as expected. However, the supply chain was returning to normal operations at a slower pace than anticipated. As a result, Q3 (Mar) revenue for its MPC segment would come up short of prior guidance. The silver lining is that all other components of Q3 guidance remain unchanged. Microsoft's crown jewel has been its Azure cloud computing business which primarily competes Amazon's (AMZN) AWS service. In Q2 (Dec), Azure revenue jumped 62%, an acceleration from 59% in Q1 (Sep). Another bright spot has been Dynamics 365, which is a suite of ERP and CRM applications for businesses. It grew by 42% yr/yr in DecQ. MSFT tends to be very consistent in terms of beating consensus estimates with 14 EPS beats in a row, including double digit EPS beats in each of the past four quarters. Something we have a concern about is how the quarter ended. When IBM reported results last week, it said it saw a noticeable change in client priorities towards cash preservation in mid-March. There was effectively a pause, especially in IBM's software business, where the vast majority of transactions typically close in the last two weeks of the quarter. With MSFT's heavy exposure to software and enterprise customers generally, we'll be watching for any late-quarter deals getting pushed into JunQ. On a final note, MSFT's Azure rival Amazon is set to report tomorrow after the close. Azure's performance, especially late in the quarter, should give us a window into what to expect for AWS tomorrow.15:08ECONX Fed Chair Powell says unemployment rate to be a high number in Q2 (uncertain what that will be)When consumer spending starts to pick up again, people will start getting rehired.Thinks it will be "some time" before we get back to anything that resembles maximum employment.15:04ECONX Fed Chair Powell says he has been advocate for getting back on sustainable fiscal path, but this is not the time to act on those concernsNeed to use the resources of the government to guard against long-term damage from this COVID-19 experience.14:59ECONX Fed Chair Powell: Q3 could see fairly large GDP increase given size of the fall, but unlikely the increase would bring us back to pre-virus levelsConsumers and businesses likely to still show some caution even after some of the social distancing guidelines are relaxed; sooner the virus can be brought under control, the sooner everyone will regain confidence.14:54ECONX Fed Chair Powell says corporate credit facility is near being finalized and should be operating fairly soonClose to announcing new term sheet for Main Street lending Facility; thinks there will be a couple different types of lending going on here and that the facility is likely to expand for some time, so will see a start to facility for some of it soon but doesn't expect full operations to happen fairly quickly.In characterizing what Fed means by saying there are considerable risks to the economic outlook over the "medium term," he says medium term means next year or so. Some possible recovery impediments include: 1) the path the virus takes 2) the possibility of damage to the productive capacity of the economy (i.e. workers facing long-term unemployment and unnecessary insolvencies for businesses) and 3) the global dimension of the COVID-19 impact.14:43ECONX Fed Chair Powell says legislators should embrace policies that protect against avoidable insolvenciesAdds such policies will have a hefty price tag but that they would help ensure we come out of this situation with less long term damage.Notes monetary policy position is right where it should be for now to help avoid deflationary spiral.14:39SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Saia (SAIA) gains following upside first quarter results -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersNCLH (15.59 +19.1%): Rises to its highest levels in a month on close to 2x average volume. Stocks representing industries that have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, including co and various cruise line peers, rise amid a rebound in the broader market bolstered by hopes for further economic reopening and the latest results from Gilead Sciences' (GILD) trial of antiviral remdesivir in treating COVID-19.SAIA (101.77 +19.07%): Posted upside Q1 EPS and revs (+8.7% yr/yr to $446.4 mln). Co's operating ratio improved by 170 bps yr/yr; co reported that it saw improved productivity across its operations derived from focus on pricing and mix management. LTL shipments per workday rose +2.3% yr/yr. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, co experienced a downturn in volumes across its network in March following a "strong" start to the month; co responded with cost adjustments. Rises to two-month highs. LSCC (22.29 +14.02%): Topped consensus for Q1 EPS while missing on revs. Gross margin expanded to 59.8% from 58.6% in the prior year quarter, benefiting from actions taken to expand gross margin and profitability; cash flow from operations was $21 mln. Issued in-line guidance for Q2 revs. Price target raised to $27 from $24 at Cowen, which comments positively on co's June quarter guidance as well as co's on-track product roadmap and gross margin progress. Climbs to three-month highs, outpacing gains for the broader semiconductor sector.Mid Cap LosersFRO (9.2 -12.13%): Tanker and oil shipping industry names generally fall in contrast with rebounding oil prices, which may indicate a shift in the demand landscape for oil cargo storage providers. ALKS (14.67 -8.91%): Posted upside results for Q1 on the top and bottom lines. Net sales for VIVITROL grew approx. +14% yr/yr to $78.8 mln; ARISTADA sales rose approx. +68% to $51.0 mln. Owing to the uncertainties and disruptions created in the healthcare system by COVID-19, co is withdrawing its 2020 expectations at this time. COVID-19 has impacted timelines on certain of co's clinical trials. VIR (30.4 -7.08%): Sees volatility alongside various names in the COVID-19 treatment and therapy space, which today processes results from Gilead Sciences' (GILD) Phase 3 SIMPLE trial evaluating antiviral remdesivir in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19.14:38ECONX Fed Chair Powell notes Fed has slowed pace of asset purchases in recent weeks due to improvement in market conditionsSays depth and duration of downturn are significantly uncertain and that severity is dependent on the government's response.Reiterates that Fed is committed to using full range of its policy tools.Stresses that low rates don't help if there isn't a flow through to financial markets and businesses and consumers can't get access to credit.Q&A portion of press conference now beginning.14:33COMDX Energy Settlement PricesJun Crude Oil futures rose $2.85 (23.1%) to $15.19/barrel Jun Natural Gas $0.06 lower (-3.23%) at $1.885/MMBtu Jun RBOB Gasoline settled $0.06 higher (8.24%) at $0.762/gallon Jun Heating oil futures settled $0.07 higher (10.48%) at $0.7853/gallon14:27TSN Tyson Foods 'is now offering $120 million in 'thank you bonuses' for 116,000 U.S. frontline workers and truckers, up from the $60 million announced in early April' (63.46 +0.66)Tyson Foods is also increasing short-term disability coverage to 90% of normal pay until June 30, 2020, for team members who are unable to work due to illness.14:23TALKX Market Briefing: Muted response to FOMC directive as participants wait to hear from PowellThe stock market had already moved off its best levels of the day leading up to the FOMC announcement at 2:00 p.m. ET. The FOMC news didn't change much, partly because the FOMC view didn't change.In a unanimous vote, the target range for the fed funds rate was maintained at 0.00-0.25%. It was noted that the target range is expected to remain there "until [the Fed] is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals."In other words, the target range is going to remain where it is for a long time considering where the unemployment rate is headed with 26 million+ unemployment claims in the last five weeks and assuming it is unlikely to return to its current level (4.4%) anytime soon.The muted response to the directive isn't surprising. Market participants are focused on what Fed Chair Powell says at his press conference, which begins at 2:30 p.m. ET. Most are hoping for additional context on what would motivate the Fed to do more (such as maybe buying stocks?) or encourage it to do less.The Russell 2000 is up 4.9%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 3.3%; the S&P 500 is up 2.6%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 2.3%.14:14MCD McDonald's: Earnings Preview -- We get our first look at how MCD is adapting to the pandemic (188.43 +2.47)McDonald's (MCD) is set to report Q1 results tomorrow before the open with a call to follow at 8:30am ET. The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for Q1 non-GAAP EPS is $1.55 and for revenue it's $4.66 bln. The company has already withdrawn 2020 guidance.MCD breaks down its sales into several segments: US (its largest segment), International Operated Markets (IOM) which is comprised of wholly-owned markets, or countries in which MCD operates restaurants, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Russia, Spain and the UK, and International Developmental Licensed Markets (IDL) which is comprised of the remaining markets in the McDonald's system.Global comps are always a key metric for MCD, although MCD has already disclosed Q1 comps, so this will not be new information. Global comps in Q1 were -3.4%. US comps were +0.1%, IOM comps were -6.9%, IDL comps were -4.3%.This will be our first look at how MCD is adapting to the pandemic as substantially all its US restaurants are operating Drive-thru, Delivery, & Take-away only. However, China has resumed operations in 98% of its restaurants. The good news is that the stock has bounced nicely off its mid-March lows as it's clear investors feel MCD will be able to adapt. It makes sense as most of MCD's restaurants already have drive-thru capabilities which is kind of tailor-made for off-premise dining. Also, a chain like Chipotle (CMG) has been able to do well and it has only a limited number of drive-thru locations. It's focusing more on free delivery. We think with comps already having been reported for Q1, investors will be focusing on the Q2 outlook. We are unlikely to get specific guidance, but it would help to see how comps are performing in April.14:07KPTI Karyopharm Therapeutics presents results from Phase 3 BOSTON study (23.72 -0.38)In addition to the BOSTON abstract, four additional abstracts were selected for presentation during the virtual program, including two poster presentations highlighting updated results from Darzalex (daratumumab) and Kyprolis (carfilzomib) arms of the ongoing Phase 1b/2 STOMP study evaluating XPOVIO in combination with backbone therapies in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The two remaining selected abstracts include a trial-in-progress (TIP) poster describing the ongoing Phase 3 SIENDO study evaluating XPOVIO as a maintenance therapy in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer following one prior platinum-based treatment, and a poster describing molecular predictors of selinexor response in recurrent glioblastoma.14:03MDT Medtronic: FDA grants marketing authorization to CARPEDIEM device for continuous dialysis therapy for use in pediatric patients with certain kidney conditions (100.37 +2.33)The FDA today granted marketing authorization for a new device indicated to provide continuous hemodialysis or hemofiltration therapy to critically ill pediatric patients weighing between 5.5 to 22 pounds. Continuous hemodialysis or hemofiltration therapy -- known as continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) -- involves using a dialysis machine and a special filter, or dialyzer, to continuously clean a patient's blood for an extended period of time, without stopping, instead of the more traditional three times a week therapy session. CRRT is typically performed in intensive care unit settings. The CARPEDIEM System is the first CRRT device intended for a lower weight-specific pediatric patient population 5.5 to 22 pounds who have a sudden or temporary loss of kidney function (acute kidney injury) or have too much water in their bodies because their kidneys are not functioning properly (fluid overload). The FDA granted marketing authorization of the CARPEDIEM System to Medtronic.14:00ECONX Fed statement from April meetingThe Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals.The coronavirus outbreak is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. The virus and the measures taken to protect public health are inducing sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses. Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices are holding down consumer price inflation. The disruptions to economic activity here and abroad have significantly affected financial conditions and have impaired the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. In light of these developments, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information related to public health, as well as global developments and muted inflation pressures, and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, the Federal Reserve will continue to purchase Treasury securities and agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. In addition, the Open Market Desk will continue to offer large-scale overnight and term repurchase agreement operations. The Committee will closely monitor market conditions and is prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate.Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michelle W. Bowman; Lael Brainard; Richard H. Clarida; Patrick Harker; Robert S. Kaplan; Neel Kashkari; Loretta J. Mester; and Randal K.

The Nasdaq Composite (+3.6%) and Russell 2000 (+4.9%) pull ahead of the benchmark index, while Dow Jones Industrial Average (+2.6%) follows behind.All 11 S&P 500 sectors are trading higher, led by the energy (+5.9%), communication services (+5.2%), and information technology (+3.9%) sectors. The consumer staples sector is up just 0.3% and is the only sector up less than 1.0%.Gilead Sciences (GILD 83.90, +5.25, +6.7%) provided sentiment a boost this morning when it affirmed that its remdesivir drug met its primary endpoint in an NIAID placebo-controlled study. The official statement has put to rest prior conflicting reports on the potential therapeutic and has supported the market's reopening optimism.Throw in a 30% spike in WTI crude futures ($15.95, +3.60, +29.3%) and bullish reactions to earnings reports from Alphabet (GOOG 1343.92, +110.25, +8.9%), MasterCard (MA 282.13, +17.52, +6.6%), and Boeing (BA 143.68, +12.38, +9.4%), and the market has now nearly forgotten the GDP data.Briefly, the advance estimate for Q1 GDP declined at an annualized rate of 4.8% (Briefing.com consensus -4.3%). Most expect Q2 to be worse, but the market is thinking a revival in economic activity will buoy the Q3 figure. Of course, there's no telling what Q4 would look like, but the market is leaning on the side of optimism.Separately, Starbucks (SBUX 77.64, -1.05, -1.3%), General Electric (GE 6.72, -0.08, -1.1%), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 54.09, -1.42, -2.5%) are bucking the broader trend following their earnings reports.Coming up next in this busy news day is the Fed's policy directive at 2:00 p.m. ET and Fed Chair Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET.

Revs increased +4% sequentially, driven by a +$21 mln increase in the US gas utilities sector. Sales were negatively impacted by decreasing demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Co is taking steps to reduce its operating costs by $80 mln and to reduce its inventory by $140 mln or more relative to 2019 amid demand weakness. Co expects to generate over $200 mln in cash flow from operations in 2020. Energy sector stocks generally outperform amid improvement in oil prices.EAT (24.45 +27.72%): Topped consensus for Q3 EPS and revs. Co commented that its decision in recent years to enhance its off-premise business, including through online ordering and third-party delivery services, has enabled it to conveniently serve a "significantly higher" volume of off-premise customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Comp sales trends for the quarter were generally positive as of March 8, prior to the impact of COVID-19. Commenting on the weeks subsequent to the end of Q3, co noted that off-premise sales have grown each week since the pandemic began and have captured 57% of prior year total restaurant sales during the week ended April 22, adjusted to exclude an acquisition. SAH (23.84 +27.28%): Reported upside Q1 EPS and revs. EchoPark revs increased +33% yr/yr to $331.7 mln. Co's stores, deemed essential, have remained open during the pandemic, but since mid-March, co has experienced a significant decrease yr/yr in overall vehicle sales volumes and service department revs due principally to demand softness connected to COVID-19. Co recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $268.0 mln in the quarter related to its franchised dealerships reporting unit as a result of a decrease in co's market value due to the pandemic. Total liquidity was approx. $418.4 mln as of April 28.Small Cap LosersFDP (29.47 -16.11%): Missed estimates for Q1 EPS. Co's global operations were challenged by COVID-19 in Q1; beginning in January in Asia and ramping further in March, sales were impacted across all of co's markets; near-term demand and sales in co's foodservice distribution channel for higher price point products like pineapples, avocados, and fresh-cut vegetables and fruits, said co, remains "challenging." Adj. gross profit declined yr/yr to $76.5 mln from $95.1 mln, impacted by lower gross profit in co's fresh and value-added and banana business segments. Co expects Q2's results to continue to be pressured. Co also declared an interim cash dividend of $0.05/share, halved from co's prior dividend. The stock drops away from one-month highs.NAT (6.39 -13.01%): Pulls back after spiking yesterday to new three-year highs; at yesterday's close, the stock had netted an advance of circa +82% since mid-April. Today's decline takes place amid a general pullback in tanker and shipping stocks and a spike in oil prices; weekly petroleum data showed an increase in US commercial crude oil inventories of 9 mln barrels from the previous week.

The WTI contract for June delivery is up 32% to $16.26/bbl.One missing, and notable, element is a sell-off in the Treasury market. Despite the rally in stocks, the 10-yr note yield is down one basis point at 0.60% ahead of today's FOMC announcement at 2:00 p.m. ET.The Russell 2000 is up 3.7%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 3.1%; the S&P 500 is up 2.5%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 2.2%.11:05SOXX Industry Briefing: Chipmakers (239.62 +7.02)The PHLX Semiconductor Index (+3.2%) represents a pocket of relative strength in the early going of today's session.

Due to these measures and restrictions, the company has had limited access to its office buildings. This has resulted in a significant delay in preparing the company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, as previously disclosed, the company's Board has formed a Special Committee to oversee an internal investigation. Due to the impact of the delayed financial statement preparation process caused by COVID-19 and the pendency of the investigation, the company will not be able to file its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2019 by April 30, 2020.

The study demonstrated that patients receiving a 10-day treatment course of remdesivir achieved similar improvement in clinical status compared with those taking a 5-day treatment course (Odds Ratio: 0.75 [95% CI 0.51 - 1.12] on Day 14). No new safety signals were identified with remdesivir across either treatment group. Gilead plans to submit the full data for publication in a peer-reviewed journal in the coming weeks.This study sought to determine whether a shorter, 5-day course of remdesivir would achieve similar efficacy results as the 10-day treatment regimen used in multiple ongoing studies of remdesivir. Secondary objectives included rates of adverse events and additional measures of clinical response in both treatment groups. Patients were required to have evidence of pneumonia and reduced oxygen levels that did not require mechanical ventilation at the time of study entry. Clinical improvement was defined as an improvement of two or more points from baseline on a predefined seven-point scale, ranging from hospital discharge to increasing levels of oxygen support to death. Patients achieved clinical recovery if they no longer required oxygen support and medical care or were discharged from the hospital.In this study, the time to clinical improvement for 50% of patients was 10 days in the 5-day treatment group and 11 days in the 10-day treatment group. More than half of patients in both treatment groups were discharged from the hospital by Day 14 (5-day: 60.0%, n=120/200 vs.10-day: 52.3% n=103/197; p=0.14). At Day 14, 64.5% (n=129/200) of patients in the 5-day treatment group and 53.8% (n=106/197) of patients in the 10-day treatment group achieved clinical recovery. Clinical outcomes varied by geography. Outside of Italy, the overall mortality rate at Day 14 was 7% (n=23/320) across both treatment groups, with 64% (n=205/320) of patients experiencing clinical improvement at Day 14 and 61% (n=196/320) of patients discharged from the hospital.In an exploratory analysis, patients in the study who received remdesivir within 10 days of symptom onset had improved outcomes compared with those treated after more than 10 days of symptoms. Pooling data across treatment arms, by Day 14, 62% of patients treated early were able to be discharged from the hospital compared with 49% of patients who were treated late. Remdesivir was generally well-tolerated in both the 5-day and 10-day treatment groups. The most common adverse events occurring in more than 10% of patients in either group were nausea (5-day: 10.0%, n=20/200 vs. 10-day: 8.6%, n=17/197) and acute respiratory failure (5-day: 6.0%, n=12/200 vs. 10-day: 10.7%, n= 21/197). Grade 3 or higher liver enzyme (ALT) elevations occurred in 7.3% (n=28/385) of patients, with 3.0% (n=12/397) of patients discontinuing remdesivir treatment due to elevated liver tests.A second SIMPLE trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir administered intravenously in patients with moderate manifestations of COVID-19, compared with standard of care. The results from the first 600 patients of this study are expected at the end of May.08:35WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +58.40.

The company states, "We understand that the trial has met its primary endpoint and that NIAID will provide detailed information at an upcoming briefing.""Remdesivir is not yet licensed or approved anywhere globally and has not yet been demonstrated to be safe or effective for the treatment of COVID-19. Gilead will share additional remdesivir data from the company's open-label Phase 3 SIMPLE trial in patients with severe COVID-19 disease shortly. This study will provide information on whether a shorter, 5-day duration of therapy may have similar efficacy and safety as the 10-day treatment course evaluated in the NIAID trial and other ongoing trials. Gilead expects data at the end of May from the second SIMPLE study evaluating the 5- and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir in patients with moderate COVID-19 disease.""Gilead will continue to discuss with regulatory authorities the growing data set regarding remdesivir as a potential treatment for COVID-19."08:22BYSI BeyondSpring changes primary endpoint for its Study 106 Phase 3 superiority clinical trial with first-in-class lead asset, Plinabulin, for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia prevention (12.64 )For more than 20 years, the standard primary endpoint for CIN trials has been the duration of severe (Grade 4) neutropenia (DSN).

The patent is directed to methods for inhibiting the enzyme Sphingosine kinase 1 in patients using the company's proprietary compound SK1-I and related Sphingosine kinase 1 inhibitors.In February, Enzo reported the publication of work demonstrating that drug candidate SK1-I decreased Interferon (IFN) signature, pDC activation, and glomerulonephritis, the inflammation of the filtration units of the kidney, in a chemically induced mouse model of lupus. In more detail, that work demonstrated that SK1-I reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines including Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and Interferon-alpha and -beta in the animal model. Significantly, elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6, are reported to be associated with the development of respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. Based on the results obtained in the lupus model and prior work demonstrating the anti-inflammatory activity of SK1-I in animal models of other immune disorders and on isolated human blood cells, the company is exploring avenues for the development of SK1-I as a potential treatment for COVID-19.08:13CMPR Cimpress reports prelim Q3 results; Apollo Global Management (APO) confirms agreement to provide a $300 million secured note to Cimpress (63.20 )Co reports prelim Q3 revs of ~$598 mln vs $608.9 mln S&P Capital IQ two analyst estimate; Adjusted EBITDA of ~$71 mln, a year-over-year decline of 20%.

The company expects a delay in the ISR launch until 2021. At this time, it is too early to predict what impact this pandemic, and the associated economic downturn, will have on the company's business. While it remains confident in its prospects over the longer term, there is considerable uncertainty and lack of visibility regarding near-term revenue growth prospects and product development plans due to the rapidly evolving situation.

However, revenues from Programmatic were hit particularly hard, finishing the quarter short of expectations.

AMC's remarks include the following: "Universal stated it only pursued a direct-to-home entertainment release for 'Trolls World Tour' because theaters were closed and Universal was committed to a lucrative toy licensing deal. We had our doubts that this was wholly Universal's motivations [...]. Nonetheless, we accepted this action as an exception to our longstanding business practices in these unprecedented times.""In [the] Wall Street Journal, Jeff Shell is quoted as saying that: 'The results for 'Trolls World Tour' have exceeded our expectations and demonstrated the viability of PVOD [...]. As soon as theaters reopen, we expect to release movies on both formats.' This radical change by Universal to the business model that currently exists between our two companies represents nothing but downside for us and is categorically unacceptable to AMC Entertainment.""Going forward, AMC will not license any Universal movies in any of our 1,000 theatres globally on these terms.""Accordingly, we want to be absolutely clear, so that there is no ambiguity of any kind. AMC believes that with this proposed action to go to the home and theatres simultaneously, Universal is breaking the business model and dealings between our two companies. It assumes that we will meekly accept a reshaped view of how studios and exhibitors should interact, with zero concern on Universal's part as to how its actions affect us. It also presumes that Universal in fact can have its cake and eat it too, that Universal film product can be released to the home and theatres at the same time, without modification to the current economic arrangements between us." "It is disappointing to us, but Jeff's comments as to Universal's unilateral actions and intentions have left us with no choice. Therefore, effectively immediately AMC will no longer play any Universal movies in any of our theatres in the United States, Europe or the Middle East. This policy affects any and all Universal movies per se, goes into effect today and as our theatres reopen, and is not some hollow or ill-considered threat. Incidentally, this policy is not aimed solely at Universal out of pique or to be punitive in any way, it also extends to any movie maker who unilaterally abandons current windowing practices absent good faith negotiations between us, so that they as distributor and we as exhibitor both benefit and neither are hurt from such changes. Currently, with the press comment today, Universal is the only studio contemplating a wholesale change to the status quo. Hence, this immediate communication in response."18:27ERYP ERYTECH Pharma receives FDA Fast Track Designation for eryaspase in second-line pancreatic cancer (8.29 +0.79)The FDA has granted eryaspase Fast Track Designation for the development of a second-line treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

However, given the worldwide constrained availability of many of these products, our backlog has also increased substantially as we were unable to fulfill many of these orders which would have mitigated other softness in the market. As a result, we recorded low double-digit revenue declines during the closing weeks of the quarter which now appear to have stabilized at approximately 20% in April. We anticipate that we will be able to ship a portion of this backlog in the second quarter as visibility into our supply chain and product lead times has improved."17:05SUPN Supernus Pharma to acquire central nervous system portfolio from US WorldMeds for total consideration of $530 mln (19.49 -0.09)Supernus Pharmaceuticals announced that the company entered into a definitive agreement under which Supernus will acquire the central nervous system (CNS) portfolio of US WorldMeds, a privately-held biopharmaceutical company.

The new preclinical program targets MHC class I related proteins A (MICA) and B (MICB) and is supported by an exclusive license from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute to intellectual property covering novel antibody fragments binding MICA/B for iPSC-derived cellular therapeutics. MICA and MICB are stress proteins that are selectively expressed at high levels on many solid tumors."[W]e are pleased that our engineered iPSC-derived CAR-MICA/B NK cells have shown potent anti-tumor activity in preclinical studies," said Scott Wolchko, President and CEO of Fate Therapeutics. "Importantly, since the shedding of MICA/B is a common escape mechanism deployed by many tumors to evade immune cell recognition, we are encouraged that our novel CAR design, which uniquely targets the a3 domain of MICA/B, prevents protein shedding and promotes NK and T cell-mediated tumor immunity."16:52CRSP CRISPR Therapeutics misses by $0.11, misses on revs (52.52 -2.48)Reports Q1 (Mar) loss of $1.15 per share, $0.11 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($1.04); revenues fell 52.1% year/year to $0.16 mln vs the $3.04 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Vaccine recipients demonstrated strong antibody and T cell immune responses after 2 or 3 doses with 0.6 mg of INO-4700, a DNA vaccine that targets the MERS-CoV Spike (S) glycoprotein, delivered with intradermal CELLECTRA device. The vaccination regimen was well-tolerated with no vaccine-associated severe adverse events.Overall, for those receiving 0.6 mg of INO-4700, 88% demonstrated seroconversion after a 2 dose regimen at 0 and 8 weeks, while for those receiving a 3 dose regimen given at 0, 4 and 12 weeks, 84% seroverted after 2 doses and 100% after 3 doses, as measured by a binding antibody assay against the full-length S protein. Additionally, 92% of the vaccine recipients in both groups displayed the ability to neutralize the virus using a neutralization assay. Robust T cell responses were observed in 60% of vaccine recipients after the 2 dose regimen and 84% of those in the 3 dose group. A single dose of 0.6 mg of INO-4700 intradermal vaccination resulted in 74% binding antibody response rate and 48% neutralization antibody response rate. These results were selected for an oral presentation at the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy (ASGCT) Conference, to be held virtually from May 12-15.INOVIO is planning to advance INO-4700 into a Phase 2 clinical trial in the Middle East with a previously announced funding of $56 mln by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.16:31AMD Advanced Micro reports EPS in-line, revs in-line; guides Q2 revs in-line; guides FY20 revs in-line (55.51 -0.98)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.18 per share, excluding non-recurring items, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.18; revenues rose 40.4% year/year to $1.79 bln vs the $1.79 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus and company guidance of $1.75-1.85 bln.Gross margin 46% versus 41% in prior-year period.

As a result, the company withdrew its 2020 guidance and five-year growth targets in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 16, 2020.16:23HIW Highwoods Prop beats by $0.04, reports revs in-line; lowers FY20 FFO in-line (37.70 )Reports Q1 (Mar) funds from operations of $0.93 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.89; revenues rose 11.8% year/year to $192.8 mln vs the $192.55 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The diversion of resources to treat COVID-19 patients has significantly impacted the operations at most of the investigative sites where patients in the co's clinical trials are recruited and treated. This has resulted in reduced trial starts and slowed new business awards. Co is withdrawing previously provided revenue, EBITDA, net income, and net income per diluted share guidance and is not issuing new guidance at this time.16:22MRC MRC Global beats by $0.11, beats on revs (4.47 +0.44)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.04 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.11 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.07); revenues fell 18.1% year/year to $794 mln vs the $762.31 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.COVID-19 impact:The COVID-19 global pandemic and related mitigation measures have created significant volatility and uncertainty in the oil and gas industry. Oil demand has significantly deteriorated as a result. The unparalleled demand destruction has resulted in lower spending by customers and reduced demand for the company's products and services. There is significant uncertainty as to the duration of this disruption.As a critical supplier to the global energy infrastructure and an essential business, the company has remained operational with no closures to any facilities. MRC has had four confirmed illnesses reported, and all have recovered. MRC Global has also implemented various safety measures for employees working in the company's facilities and implemented remote working for those whose jobs permit it. MRC Global is committed to a safe working environment for all employees.From a supply chain perspective, the effects have moved around the globe as the virus has spread. Given the company's inventory position and the reduced demand, the company has fulfilled orders with little disruption. However, the longer the shutdowns continue, the greater the order fulfillment risk exists.16:22ACA Arcosa beats by $0.20, beats on revs (39.72 +0.36)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.71 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.20 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.51; revenues rose 18.8% year/year to $488.2 mln vs the $479.22 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.2020 OutlookConstruction markets were robust throughout the first quarter, and construction activity has remained at healthy levels during the early part of the second quarter. Our outlook remains intact for overall revenue growth in our combined wind towers and utility structures product lines, as the combined backlog provides solid visibility and utility structures demand continues to be robust. Our outlook for segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA margin growth remains intact, as our barge backlog provides visibility for significant volume growth in 2020 versus 2019.Rail components revenues are expected to be lower in 2020 versus 2019.

JNPR expects to see sequential volume driven improvements in margin during the June quarter to be offset by certain strategic insertion opportunities in addition to increased logistics and other supply chain-related costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Commentary: "While we are seeing uncertainty in our business due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect to see sequential revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth in Q2. Confidence in our forecast is driven by strong backlog and healthy momentum with our Service Provider and Cloud customers. We believe these factors should help offset increased uncertainty in certain segments of the Enterprise market. Due to the uncertain macroenvironment we have widened our revenue range for the second quarter."16:20LPLA LPL Financial subsidiary acquires Lucia Securities (58.13 +1.32)LPL Financial LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of LPL Financial Holdings, has signed an agreement to acquire Lucia Securities, a broker-dealer and registered investment advisor firm headquartered in San Diego.

The purchase agreement provides for both a payment at closing and potential contingent payments. The company estimates a transaction multiple of ~6x post-synergy EBITDA.16:20WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryThe S&P 500 declined 0.5% on Tuesday in a mixed session. Large-cap technology and health care stocks lagged, while reopening enthusiasm continued to flow into the small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%) and S&P MidCap 400 (+1.0%). The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.4%.The day started with broad gains that lifted the S&P 500 as much as 1.5% shortly after the open, as part of the reopening momentum from Monday. That broad momentum quickly dissipated, presumably due to valuation concerns, but lingered in areas of the market that had underperformed when the shutdown angst was rampant.Some of those included the small-cap and mid-cap stocks, as previously noted, but also the cyclical S&P 500 energy (+2.2%), materials (+2.0%), industrials (+1.8%), and financials (+0.9%) sectors.Conversely, the large-cap stocks that were deemed as relatively safe, and thus outperformed over the past few months, lost some of their appeal today and heavily dragged on the broader market. Those were found in the health care (-2.1%), communication services (-1.9%), and information technology (-1.4%) sectors.The health care space also had some negative catalysts despite the reported progress on the coronavirus front. For instance, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 151.39, -2.90, -1.9%) was downgraded to Neutral from Buy at UBS, while Pfizer (PFE 37.91, -0.42, -1.1%) and Merck (MRK 81.18, -2.80, -3.3%) declined after reporting earnings.In other earnings news, shares of Caterpillar (CAT 115.46, +0.26, +0.2%), 3M (MMM 157.61, +3.96, +2.6%), and PepsiCo (PEP 136.32, +1.4%) finished higher, even after the companies withdrew full-year guidance, while shares of UPS (UPS 96.43, -6.12, -6.0%) faltered after the company missed profit estimates.U.S. Treasuries reclaimed most of yesterday's losses, driving yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined three basis points to 0.20%, and the 10-yr yield declined five basis points to 0.61%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 99.88. WTI crude declined 4.6%, or $0.60, to $12.37/bbl, although it was down as much as 22% at one point during the session.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data:The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for April plunged to 86.9 (Briefing.com consensus 86.5) from a downwardly revised 118.8 (from 120.0) for March. The April reading is the lowest since June 2014.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers, while thinking positively about things reopening again, are still less optimistic about their financial prospects, which could be a headwind for spending activity during the recovery phase.The advance goods trade deficit totaled $64.2 bln in March after a $59.9 bln deficit in February. Advance retail inventories declined 1.3% in March after decreasing 0.3% in February. Advance wholesale inventories decreased 1.0% in March after decreasing 0.7% in February.The S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for February increased 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.7%).Looking ahead, investors will receive the advance estimate for Q1 GDP, Pending Home Sales for March, and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite -4.1% YTDS&P 500 -11.4% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -15.6% YTDRussell 2000 -22.0% YTD16:20CHRW C.H.

In April 6 Form 8K filing, the Company withdrew its 2020 financial guidance previously issued in its earnings release dated February 19, 2020 and is not providing further guidance in this earnings release.16:19AGR AVANGRID reports EPS in-line, misses on revs; reaffirms FY20 EPS guidance (44.98 -0.59)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.76 per share, excluding non-recurring items, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.76; revenues fell 2.9% year/year to $1.79 bln vs the $1.9 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Our Braun, Vicks, PUR and Honeywell products are supporting consumer health at a time of extreme need, and our OXO products are providing convenience, comfort and solutions as families spend unprecedented amounts of time at home. We are working around the clock to meet as much of the ongoing demand for thermometers, humidifiers, air purifiers and water purifiers as possible. We are also working with suppliers and retailers to provide consumers with OXO kitchen, cleaning and storage products, as well as volumizers in Beauty, where demand is high in channels that are open. While encouraging, we do expect to see a net adverse impact to our results for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2021. Although still very early, we are making plans to continue selectively investing in the key Phase II initiatives once the economic situation allows. With our diversified portfolio of leading, trusted brands, a strong balance sheet with low net leverage, and a corporate culture driven to rise to the challenge, we believe Helen of Troy is well positioned to navigate the current unprecedented situation and emerge strong."Due to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and the related business uncertainty, the Company is not providing an Outlook for fiscal 2021 at this time. In order to reduce costs and preserve cash flow, the Company has implemented a number of measures that will remain in place until there is greater certainty, a reopening of retail customer brick and mortar stores and improved consumer demand, which include the following: A graduated salary reduction for all associates, including named executive officers and the other members of the Company's executive leadership team; A reduction in the cash compensation of the Company's Board of Directors; Suspension of merit increases, promotions and new associate hiring until further notice; The furlough of associates in specific areas directly tied to sales volume, with assistance to maintain health insurance coverage, as well as a reduction of external temporary labor and reduced work hours; Reduction or deferral of marketing expense. The Company will lean into brands with strong current demand and reduce investment in other key brands without sacrificing brand awareness; Limited reduction of investment in new product development and launches, in anticipation of more normalized economic activity; Elimination of travel expense in the short term, with a significant reduction planned for the second half of fiscal 2021; and Reduction of consulting fees and capital expenditures for projects that are not critical.16:17MET MetLife increases quarterly common stock dividend to $0.46/share from $0.44/share (35.18 +0.76)16:15TENB Tenable beats by $0.10, beats on revs; guides Q2 EPS above consensus, revs below consensus (24.70 -0.12)Reports Q1 (Mar) loss of $0.09 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.10 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.19); revenues rose 27.8% year/year to $102.6 mln vs the $100.07 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Following the pandemic declaration on March 11, we experienced above normal demand for two to three weeks as consumers purchased essential products for their homes. This led to demand for the full month of March 2020 being comparable to March a year ago. "April 2020 freight demand has held up fairly well so far, with some expected gradual weakening given that many parts of the U.S. economy are shut down or have been significantly curtailed. Our freight base is designed to more effectively manage through what we anticipate will be an extremely difficult economic environment in second quarter 2020, as a significant portion of our revenues come from delivering essential goods and products. 62% of revenues from our top 100 customers (85% of revenues in first quarter 2020) came from the discount retail, home improvement retail, food and beverage or consumer packaged goods verticals."

Because PAYC charges clients on a per-employee basis for certain services it provides, fluctuations in headcount at its clients will impact results of operations in future periods.Significantly lower average interest rates in 2020, as well as slower growth in the average funds held for clients balance due to lower employee headcount at its clients and clients electing the Social Security tax deferral under the CARES Act, will have a negative effect on recurring revenue growth in future periods.16:13DVAX Dynavax reported immunogenicity and safety data from an interim analysis of the ongoing clinical trial evaluating HEPLISAV-B (3.85 -0.04)Demonstrated seroprotection rate of 86.4% at week 20 after 4 standard doses of HEPLISAV-BSafety data showed HEPLISAV-B was well toleratedCompany to host webinar review of data Thursday, April 30, 2020 at 1:00 p.m. ET/10:00 a.m. PT16:13WW WW beats by $0.12, reports revs in-line; withdraws FY 20 outlook (23.22 +1.22)Reports Q1 (Mar) loss of $0.09 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.12 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.21); revenues rose 10.2% year/year to $400.4 mln vs the $402.72 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Service Revenues in Q1 2020 were $324.7 million.

Strong portfolio performance was offset by about $600 million from increased credit-loss reserves, and higher depreciation on off-lease vehicles awaiting sale and anticipated operating lease defaults -- all reflecting estimated impact of the coronavirus in future periods.In March, the company withdrew guidance for 2020 financial performance it had given in early February. That outlook excluded possible implications of the coronavirus, which at the time had not yet reached pandemic stage. According to CFO Stone, today's economic environment remains too ambiguous to provide full-year 2020 financial guidance.

The UsT had warned of the danger of Chinese laboratories and their coronavirus trials on batsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 15, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1341 wordsBodyThe US State Department had warned more than two years ago of the dangers that bat experiments could pose if the Wuhan lab - the epicenter of the current outbreak - where the trials were conducted did not maintain adequate safety standards for its treatment. The wires were revealed by columnist Josh Rogin of The Washington Post."Two years before the new coronavirus pandemic turned the world, U.S. embassy officials visited a Chinese research center in Wuhan several times and sent two official warnings to Washington about inadequate safety in the lab, which was conducting risky studies on bat coronavirus. The cables have fueled discussions within the North American government about whether this or another Wuhan laboratory was the source of the virus, even though conclusive evidence has not yet emerged," says Rogin in his article.The columnist covering international news and domestic politics in the United States also revealed that the cables were dated January 2018, exactly two years before the outbreak was made public despite the beijing regime's concealment. "In January 2018, the U.S. embassy in Beijing took the unusual step of repeatedly sending American scientific diplomats to the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), which in 2015 became the first laboratory in China to achieve the highest level of international security in biological research (known as BSL-4). WIV issued a press release in English on the last of these visits, which took place on 27 March 2018. The U.S. delegation was led by Jamison Fouss, the Consul General of Wuhan, and Rick Switzer, the embassy's environmental, science, health and technology advisor. Last week, WIV deleted that statement from its website, although it is still archived on the Internet," the reporter said."What U.S. officials discovered during their visits were so concerned that they sent two diplomatic cables classified as Sensitive but Unclassified to Washington. The cables warned of safety and management weaknesses in WIV's lab and proposed more attention and help. The first cable, which I obtained, also warns that the laboratory's work on bat coronavirus and its possible human transmission posed a risk of a new SARS-like pandemic," said the blunt diplomatic paper that Rogin had access to.The cable broadcast by The Washington Post was clear and left no doubt about the dangers involved in a Chinese laboratory's manipulation of coronavirus in bats: "During interactions with scientists in the WIV lab, they noted that the new laboratory has a severe shortage of properly trained technicians and researchers needed to operate this high containment lab safely" , indicates the shipment dated January 19, 2018."Chinese researchers at WIV were receiving assistance from Galveston National Laboratory in the University of Texas Medical Branch and other U.S. organizations, but the Chinese requested additional assistance. The cables argued that the United States should provide more support to Wuhan's lab, mainly because its research on bat coronavirus was important but also dangerous. As the cable pointed out, visitors to the United States met with Shi Zhengli, the head of the research project, who had been publishing studies related to bat coronaviruses for many years. In November2017, just before the visit of U.S. officials, Shi's team had published an investigation showing that the horseshoe bats they had collected from a cave in Yunnan Province were most likely from the same bat population that spawned SARS coronavirus in 2003," Rogin wrote on Tuesday.But the most important thing about the cable had not yet been published: "Researchers also showed that several SARS-like coronaviruses may interact with ACE2, the human receptor identified for SARS coronavirus. This finding suggests that SARS-like bat coronaviruses can be transmitted to humans to cause SARS-like diseases. From a public health perspective, this makes continued surveillance of SARS-like coronaviruses in bats and the study of the animal-human interface critical for the prediction and prevention of emerging coronavirus outbreaks in the future."Rogin explained that the research aimed to prevent another SARS-like epidemic in 203. However, the safety standards they followed were not the best, something that had also been warned in 2015. "Other scientists questioned whether Shi's team was taking unnecessary risks. In October 2014, the U.S. government imposed a moratorium on funding any investigation that makes a virus more deadly or contagious, known as 'function gain' experiments. As many have pointed out, there is no evidence that the virus that is now ravaging the world has been designed; scientists largely agree that it comes from animals, although that's not the same as saying it didn't come from the lab, which spent years testing bat coronavirus on animals, explained Xiao Qiang, research scientist at the University of California, Berkeley's School of Information.""There are similar concerns about the laboratory near the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which operates at biosecurity level 2, a significantly less secure level than the level 4 standard claimed by the Wuhan Institute of Virology lab, Xiao said. That's important because the Chinese government still refuses to answer basic questions about the origin of the new coronavirus while suppressing any attempt to examine whether any of the labs were involved. Sources familiar with the wires said they were meant to sound an alarm about serious safety concerns in WIV's lab, especially regarding their work with bat coronaviruses," the Washington Post said."The wires," Rogin revealed, "began circulating again" within the White House "over the past two months as officials discussed whether the lab could be the source of the pandemic and what the implications would be for the response of the U.S. pandemic and relations with China. Within the Trump administration, many national security officials have long suspected that the WIV lab or Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention was the source of the new coronavirus outbreak. According to The New York Times, the intelligence community has provided no evidence to confirm this. But a senior administration official told me that the cables provide further evidence to support the possibility that the pandemic is the result of a laboratory accident in Wuhan."Rogin spreads more doubts about the discussed origin of the virus. Versions of the Beijing regime talked about the sale of bats at the Wuhan market, which was not the thing. Thereyou didn't sell that kind of animal. But for the worse: the first patient to show up as a carrier of Sars-CoV-2 was never there."Meanwhile, the Chinese government has put a total blockade of information related to the virus's origins. Beijing has not yet provided US experts with samples of the new coronavirus collected from the first cases. The Shanghai laboratory that published the new coronavirus genome on 11 January was quickly shut down by the authorities for 'rectification'. Several of the doctors and journalists who reported on the spread from the beginning have disappeared," the chronicler from the American capital added.Finally, the investigative journalist concluded: "Knowing the history of origin is not just about blaming. It's crucial to understand how the new coronavirus pandemic started because that informs how to prevent the next one. The Chinese government must be transparent and answer questions about Wuhan laboratories because they are vital to our scientific understanding of the virus," Rogin wrote in his column citing Xiao.MORE ON THIS TOPIC:A documentary about the origin of the coronavirus says the Chinese Communist Party concealed that it is synthetic and leaked from a laboratoryChina's deception of the world was worse: evidence shows that the coronavirus already existed since before December and the regime hid itThe coronavirus pandemic exceeded two million contagions worldwide"The Spark Of Fire": How much coronavirus is enough to infect a personLoad-Date: April 16, 2020End of Document

The study demonstrated that patients receiving a 10-day treatment course of remdesivir achieved similar improvement in clinical status compared with those taking a 5-day treatment course (Odds Ratio: 0.75 [95% CI 0.51 - 1.12] on Day 14). No new safety signals were identified with remdesivir across either treatment group. Gilead plans to submit the full data for publication in a peer-reviewed journal in the coming weeks.This study sought to determine whether a shorter, 5-day course of remdesivir would achieve similar efficacy results as the 10-day treatment regimen used in multiple ongoing studies of remdesivir. Secondary objectives included rates of adverse events and additional measures of clinical response in both treatment groups. Patients were required to have evidence of pneumonia and reduced oxygen levels that did not require mechanical ventilation at the time of study entry. Clinical improvement was defined as an improvement of two or more points from baseline on a predefined seven-point scale, ranging from hospital discharge to increasing levels of oxygen support to death. Patients achieved clinical recovery if they no longer required oxygen support and medical care or were discharged from the hospital.In this study, the time to clinical improvement for 50% of patients was 10 days in the 5-day treatment group and 11 days in the 10-day treatment group. More than half of patients in both treatment groups were discharged from the hospital by Day 14 (5-day: 60.0%, n=120/200 vs.10-day: 52.3% n=103/197; p=0.14). At Day 14, 64.5% (n=129/200) of patients in the 5-day treatment group and 53.8% (n=106/197) of patients in the 10-day treatment group achieved clinical recovery. Clinical outcomes varied by geography. Outside of Italy, the overall mortality rate at Day 14 was 7% (n=23/320) across both treatment groups, with 64% (n=205/320) of patients experiencing clinical improvement at Day 14 and 61% (n=196/320) of patients discharged from the hospital.In an exploratory analysis, patients in the study who received remdesivir within 10 days of symptom onset had improved outcomes compared with those treated after more than 10 days of symptoms. Pooling data across treatment arms, by Day 14, 62% of patients treated early were able to be discharged from the hospital compared with 49% of patients who were treated late. Remdesivir was generally well-tolerated in both the 5-day and 10-day treatment groups. The most common adverse events occurring in more than 10% of patients in either group were nausea (5-day: 10.0%, n=20/200 vs. 10-day: 8.6%, n=17/197) and acute respiratory failure (5-day: 6.0%, n=12/200 vs. 10-day: 10.7%, n= 21/197). Grade 3 or higher liver enzyme (ALT) elevations occurred in 7.3% (n=28/385) of patients, with 3.0% (n=12/397) of patients discontinuing remdesivir treatment due to elevated liver tests.A second SIMPLE trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir administered intravenously in patients with moderate manifestations of COVID-19, compared with standard of care. The results from the first 600 patients of this study are expected at the end of May.08:35WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +58.40.

The company states, "We understand that the trial has met its primary endpoint and that NIAID will provide detailed information at an upcoming briefing.""Remdesivir is not yet licensed or approved anywhere globally and has not yet been demonstrated to be safe or effective for the treatment of COVID-19. Gilead will share additional remdesivir data from the company's open-label Phase 3 SIMPLE trial in patients with severe COVID-19 disease shortly. This study will provide information on whether a shorter, 5-day duration of therapy may have similar efficacy and safety as the 10-day treatment course evaluated in the NIAID trial and other ongoing trials. Gilead expects data at the end of May from the second SIMPLE study evaluating the 5- and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir in patients with moderate COVID-19 disease.""Gilead will continue to discuss with regulatory authorities the growing data set regarding remdesivir as a potential treatment for COVID-19."08:22BYSI BeyondSpring changes primary endpoint for its Study 106 Phase 3 superiority clinical trial with first-in-class lead asset, Plinabulin, for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia prevention (12.64 )For more than 20 years, the standard primary endpoint for CIN trials has been the duration of severe (Grade 4) neutropenia (DSN). The new primary endpoint will be the rate of the prevention of Grade 4 neutropenia -- a more clinically meaningful and trial-sensitive endpoint -- and will be used to establish superiority of the Plinabulin-G-CSF combination over G-CSF alone.A robust plan will be submitted to the FDA to prospectively validate this new primary endpoint against clinical outcome measures.

The patent is directed to methods for inhibiting the enzyme Sphingosine kinase 1 in patients using the company's proprietary compound SK1-I and related Sphingosine kinase 1 inhibitors.In February, Enzo reported the publication of work demonstrating that drug candidate SK1-I decreased Interferon (IFN) signature, pDC activation, and glomerulonephritis, the inflammation of the filtration units of the kidney, in a chemically induced mouse model of lupus. In more detail, that work demonstrated that SK1-I reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines including Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and Interferon-alpha and -beta in the animal model. Significantly, elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6, are reported to be associated with the development of respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. Based on the results obtained in the lupus model and prior work demonstrating the anti-inflammatory activity of SK1-I in animal models of other immune disorders and on isolated human blood cells, the company is exploring avenues for the development of SK1-I as a potential treatment for COVID-19.08:13CMPR Cimpress reports prelim Q3 results; Apollo Global Management (APO) confirms agreement to provide a $300 million secured note to Cimpress (63.20 )Co reports prelim Q3 revs of ~$598 mln vs $608.9 mln S&P Capital IQ two analyst estimate; Adjusted EBITDA of ~$71 mln, a year-over-year decline of 20%.

Much of this can be attributed to the bounce in crude oil, which is up 14% and trading over the $14 area.

AMC's remarks include the following: "Universal stated it only pursued a direct-to-home entertainment release for 'Trolls World Tour' because theaters were closed and Universal was committed to a lucrative toy licensing deal. We had our doubts that this was wholly Universal's motivations [...]. Nonetheless, we accepted this action as an exception to our longstanding business practices in these unprecedented times.""In [the] Wall Street Journal, Jeff Shell is quoted as saying that: 'The results for 'Trolls World Tour' have exceeded our expectations and demonstrated the viability of PVOD [...]. As soon as theaters reopen, we expect to release movies on both formats.' This radical change by Universal to the business model that currently exists between our two companies represents nothing but downside for us and is categorically unacceptable to AMC Entertainment.""Going forward, AMC will not license any Universal movies in any of our 1,000 theatres globally on these terms.""Accordingly, we want to be absolutely clear, so that there is no ambiguity of any kind. AMC believes that with this proposed action to go to the home and theatres simultaneously, Universal is breaking the business model and dealings between our two companies. It assumes that we will meekly accept a reshaped view of how studios and exhibitors should interact, with zero concern on Universal's part as to how its actions affect us. It also presumes that Universal in fact can have its cake and eat it too, that Universal film product can be released to the home and theatres at the same time, without modification to the current economic arrangements between us." "It is disappointing to us, but Jeff's comments as to Universal's unilateral actions and intentions have left us with no choice. Therefore, effectively immediately AMC will no longer play any Universal movies in any of our theatres in the United States, Europe or the Middle East. This policy affects any and all Universal movies per se, goes into effect today and as our theatres reopen, and is not some hollow or ill-considered threat. Incidentally, this policy is not aimed solely at Universal out of pique or to be punitive in any way, it also extends to any movie maker who unilaterally abandons current windowing practices absent good faith negotiations between us, so that they as distributor and we as exhibitor both benefit and neither are hurt from such changes. Currently, with the press comment today, Universal is the only studio contemplating a wholesale change to the status quo. Hence, this immediate communication in response."18:27ERYP ERYTECH Pharma receives FDA Fast Track Designation for eryaspase in second-line pancreatic cancer (8.29 +0.79)The FDA has granted eryaspase Fast Track Designation for the development of a second-line treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

We anticipate that we will be able to ship a portion of this backlog in the second quarter as visibility into our supply chain and product lead times has improved."17:05SUPN Supernus Pharma to acquire central nervous system portfolio from US WorldMeds for total consideration of $530 mln (19.49 -0.09)Supernus Pharmaceuticals announced that the company entered into a definitive agreement under which Supernus will acquire the central nervous system (CNS) portfolio of US WorldMeds, a privately-held biopharmaceutical company.

The new preclinical program targets MHC class I related proteins A (MICA) and B (MICB) and is supported by an exclusive license from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute to intellectual property covering novel antibody fragments binding MICA/B for iPSC-derived cellular therapeutics. MICA and MICB are stress proteins that are selectively expressed at high levels on many solid tumors."[W]e are pleased that our engineered iPSC-derived CAR-MICA/B NK cells have shown potent anti-tumor activity in preclinical studies," said Scott Wolchko, President and CEO of Fate Therapeutics. "Importantly, since the shedding of MICA/B is a common escape mechanism deployed by many tumors to evade immune cell recognition, we are encouraged that our novel CAR design, which uniquely targets the a3 domain of MICA/B, prevents protein shedding and promotes NK and T cell-mediated tumor immunity."16:52CRSP CRISPR Therapeutics misses by $0.11, misses on revs (52.52 -2.48)Reports Q1 (Mar) loss of $1.15 per share, $0.11 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($1.04); revenues fell 52.1% year/year to $0.16 mln vs the $3.04 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Vaccine recipients demonstrated strong antibody and T cell immune responses after 2 or 3 doses with 0.6 mg of INO-4700, a DNA vaccine that targets the MERS-CoV Spike (S) glycoprotein, delivered with intradermal CELLECTRA device. The vaccination regimen was well-tolerated with no vaccine-associated severe adverse events.Overall, for those receiving 0.6 mg of INO-4700, 88% demonstrated seroconversion after a 2 dose regimen at 0 and 8 weeks, while for those receiving a 3 dose regimen given at 0, 4 and 12 weeks, 84% seroverted after 2 doses and 100% after 3 doses, as measured by a binding antibody assay against the full-length S protein. Additionally, 92% of the vaccine recipients in both groups displayed the ability to neutralize the virus using a neutralization assay. Robust T cell responses were observed in 60% of vaccine recipients after the 2 dose regimen and 84% of those in the 3 dose group. A single dose of 0.6 mg of INO-4700 intradermal vaccination resulted in 74% binding antibody response rate and 48% neutralization antibody response rate. These results were selected for an oral presentation at the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy (ASGCT) Conference, to be held virtually from May 12-15.INOVIO is planning to advance INO-4700 into a Phase 2 clinical trial in the Middle East with a previously announced funding of $56 mln by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.16:31AMD Advanced Micro reports EPS in-line, revs in-line; guides Q2 revs in-line; guides FY20 revs in-line (55.51 -0.98)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.18 per share, excluding non-recurring items, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.18; revenues rose 40.4% year/year to $1.79 bln vs the $1.79 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus and company guidance of $1.75-1.85 bln.Gross margin 46% versus 41% in prior-year period.

Large-cap technology and health care stocks lagged, while reopening enthusiasm continued to flow into the small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%) and S&P MidCap 400 (+1.0%). The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.4%.The day started with broad gains that lifted the S&P 500 as much as 1.5% shortly after the open, as part of the reopening momentum from Monday. That broad momentum quickly dissipated, presumably due to valuation concerns, but lingered in areas of the market that had underperformed when the shutdown angst was rampant.Some of those included the small-cap and mid-cap stocks, as previously noted, but also the cyclical S&P 500 energy (+2.2%), materials (+2.0%), industrials (+1.8%), and financials (+0.9%) sectors.Conversely, the large-cap stocks that were deemed as relatively safe, and thus outperformed over the past few months, lost some of their appeal today and heavily dragged on the broader market. Those were found in the health care (-2.1%), communication services (-1.9%), and information technology (-1.4%) sectors.The health care space also had some negative catalysts despite the reported progress on the coronavirus front. For instance, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 151.39, -2.90, -1.9%) was downgraded to Neutral from Buy at UBS, while Pfizer (PFE 37.91, -0.42, -1.1%) and Merck (MRK 81.18, -2.80, -3.3%) declined after reporting earnings.In other earnings news, shares of Caterpillar (CAT 115.46, +0.26, +0.2%), 3M (MMM 157.61, +3.96, +2.6%), and PepsiCo (PEP 136.32, +1.4%) finished higher, even after the companies withdrew full-year guidance, while shares of UPS (UPS 96.43, -6.12, -6.0%) faltered after the company missed profit estimates.U.S. Treasuries reclaimed most of yesterday's losses, driving yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined three basis points to 0.20%, and the 10-yr yield declined five basis points to 0.61%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 99.88. WTI crude declined 4.6%, or $0.60, to $12.37/bbl, although it was down as much as 22% at one point during the session.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data:The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for April plunged to 86.9 (Briefing.com consensus 86.5) from a downwardly revised 118.8 (from 120.0) for March. The April reading is the lowest since June 2014.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers, while thinking positively about things reopening again, are still less optimistic about their financial prospects, which could be a headwind for spending activity during the recovery phase.The advance goods trade deficit totaled $64.2 bln in March after a $59.9 bln deficit in February. Advance retail inventories declined 1.3% in March after decreasing 0.3% in February. Advance wholesale inventories decreased 1.0% in March after decreasing 0.7% in February.The S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for February increased 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.7%).Looking ahead, investors will receive the advance estimate for Q1 GDP, Pending Home Sales for March, and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite -4.1% YTDS&P 500 -11.4% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -15.6% YTDRussell 2000 -22.0% YTD16:20CHRW C.H.

Our Braun, Vicks, PUR and Honeywell products are supporting consumer health at a time of extreme need, and our OXO products are providing convenience, comfort and solutions as families spend unprecedented amounts of time at home. We are working around the clock to meet as much of the ongoing demand for thermometers, humidifiers, air purifiers and water purifiers as possible. We are also working with suppliers and retailers to provide consumers with OXO kitchen, cleaning and storage products, as well as volumizers in Beauty, where demand is high in channels that are open. While encouraging, we do expect to see a net adverse impact to our results for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2021. Although still very early, we are making plans to continue selectively investing in the key Phase II initiatives once the economic situation allows. With our diversified portfolio of leading, trusted brands, a strong balance sheet with low net leverage, and a corporate culture driven to rise to the challenge, we believe Helen of Troy is well positioned to navigate the current unprecedented situation and emerge strong."Due to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and the related business uncertainty, the Company is not providing an Outlook for fiscal 2021 at this time. In order to reduce costs and preserve cash flow, the Company has implemented a number of measures that will remain in place until there is greater certainty, a reopening of retail customer brick and mortar stores and improved consumer demand, which include the following: A graduated salary reduction for all associates, including named executive officers and the other members of the Company's executive leadership team; A reduction in the cash compensation of the Company's Board of Directors; Suspension of merit increases, promotions and new associate hiring until further notice; The furlough of associates in specific areas directly tied to sales volume, with assistance to maintain health insurance coverage, as well as a reduction of external temporary labor and reduced work hours; Reduction or deferral of marketing expense. The Company will lean into brands with strong current demand and reduce investment in other key brands without sacrificing brand awareness; Limited reduction of investment in new product development and launches, in anticipation of more normalized economic activity; Elimination of travel expense in the short term, with a significant reduction planned for the second half of fiscal 2021; and Reduction of consulting fees and capital expenditures for projects that are not critical.16:17MET MetLife increases quarterly common stock dividend to $0.46/share from $0.44/share (35.18 +0.76)16:15TENB Tenable beats by $0.10, beats on revs; guides Q2 EPS above consensus, revs below consensus (24.70 -0.12)Reports Q1 (Mar) loss of $0.09 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.10 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.19); revenues rose 27.8% year/year to $102.6 mln vs the $100.07 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

"April 2020 freight demand has held up fairly well so far, with some expected gradual weakening given that many parts of the U.S. economy are shut down or have been significantly curtailed.

Because PAYC charges clients on a per-employee basis for certain services it provides, fluctuations in headcount at its clients will impact results of operations in future periods.Significantly lower average interest rates in 2020, as well as slower growth in the average funds held for clients balance due to lower employee headcount at its clients and clients electing the Social Security tax deferral under the CARES Act, will have a negative effect on recurring revenue growth in future periods.16:13DVAX Dynavax reported immunogenicity and safety data from an interim analysis of the ongoing clinical trial evaluating HEPLISAV-B (3.85 -0.04)Demonstrated seroprotection rate of 86.4% at week 20 after 4 standard doses of HEPLISAV-BSafety data showed HEPLISAV-B was well toleratedCompany to host webinar review of data Thursday, April 30, 2020 at 1:00 p.m. ET/10:00 a.m. PT16:13WW WW beats by $0.12, reports revs in-line; withdraws FY 20 outlook (23.22 +1.22)Reports Q1 (Mar) loss of $0.09 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.12 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.21); revenues rose 10.2% year/year to $400.4 mln vs the $402.72 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Service Revenues in Q1 2020 were $324.7 million.

(FOXA 28.47, +1.33, +4.9%): RBC Capital Markets started coverage with Outperform ratings.Walt Disney (DIS 111.31, +5.10, +4.8%) and ViacomCBS (VIAC 19.43, +1.98, +11.4%): RBC Capital Markets started coverage with Sector Perform ratings.Omincom Group (OMC 62.12, +5.62, +10.0%): Down 22% from Feb. 19 high, trading at 10.1x trailing earnings with 4.60% dividend yield. Advertising company reported better-than-expected earnings before Tuesday's open.12:56WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stocks rally on remdesivir news; investors await FedThe S&P 500 has rallied 3.0% today, as a positive remdesivir update feeds into the market's bullish bias and helps dismiss a weak Q1 GDP print. The Nasdaq Composite (+3.6%) and Russell 2000 (+4.9%) pull ahead of the benchmark index, while Dow Jones Industrial Average (+2.6%) follows behind.All 11 S&P 500 sectors are trading higher, led by the energy (+5.9%), communication services (+5.2%), and information technology (+3.9%) sectors. The consumer staples sector is up just 0.3% and is the only sector up less than 1.0%.Gilead Sciences (GILD 83.90, +5.25, +6.7%) provided sentiment a boost this morning when it affirmed that its remdesivir drug met its primary endpoint in an NIAID placebo-controlled study. The official statement has put to rest prior conflicting reports on the potential therapeutic and has supported the market's reopening optimism.Throw in a 30% spike in WTI crude futures ($15.95, +3.60, +29.3%) and bullish reactions to earnings reports from Alphabet (GOOG 1343.92, +110.25, +8.9%), MasterCard (MA 282.13, +17.52, +6.6%), and Boeing (BA 143.68, +12.38, +9.4%), and the market has now nearly forgotten the GDP data.Briefly, the advance estimate for Q1 GDP declined at an annualized rate of 4.8% (Briefing.com consensus -4.3%). Most expect Q2 to be worse, but the market is thinking a revival in economic activity will buoy the Q3 figure. Of course, there's no telling what Q4 would look like, but the market is leaning on the side of optimism.Separately, Starbucks (SBUX 77.64, -1.05, -1.3%), General Electric (GE 6.72, -0.08, -1.1%), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 54.09, -1.42, -2.5%) are bucking the broader trend following their earnings reports.Coming up next in this busy news day is the Fed's policy directive at 2:00 p.m. ET and Fed Chair Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET. U.S. Treasuries are holding steady in the meantime, ignoring the enthusiasm in the stock market. The 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 0.60%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 99.72.Reviewing today's economic data:First quarter GDP declined at an annualized rate of 4.8% (Briefing.com consensus -4.3%) while the GDP Price Deflator was 1.3% (Briefing.com consensus 1.1%). This was the largest decline in GDP since the fourth quarter of 2008.The key takeaway from the report is that it hints at how ugly the Advance Q2 GDP report will be given that shutdown measures in the U.S. didn't start to gain steam until the latter half of March.Pending Home Sales dropped 20.8% in March after increasing a revised 2.3% in February (from +2.4%).The weekly Mortgage Applications Index declined 3.3% following a 0.3% decline in the prior week.12:49SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: GILD (43.13 mln +6.81%), INO (27.17 mln +1.02%)Industrials: GE (110.51 mln -0.74%), LUV (69.84 mln +5.65%), AAL (65.93 mln +12.43%), HTZ (61.27 mln -14.4%), DAL (50.14 mln +11.74%), BA (33.25 mln +9.4%), UAL (30.21 mln +11.57%)Consumer Discretionary: F (70.33 mln +0.41%), CCL (64.78 mln +14.11%), NIO (64.22 mln +12.28%), NCLH (33.06 mln +20.85%)Information Technology: AMD (64.32 mln -2.9%)Financials: SQQQ (38.29 mln -9.62%), BAC (37.93 mln +4.57%)Energy: OXY (32.6 mln +7.05%), OAS (31.79 mln +7.24%), RIG (25.42 mln +12.22%)Consumer Staples: ABEV (27.62 mln +3.05%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: SIEN (2.37x +42.82%)Industrials: LUV (5.09x +5.65%), HTZ (3.59x -14.4%), TGI (2.48x +13.26%)Consumer Discretionary: IRBT (2.12x -3.53%), EAT (2.07x +28.21%)Information Technology: RPD (3.64x -4%), XELA (3.57x +8.85%), CALX (2.71x +13.01%), AKAM (2.34x -5.9%)Energy: MMLP (3.98x -13.68%), LBRT (2.44x +31.2%), BTE (2x +11.54%), NBR (1.87x +13.24%), SM (1.84x +42.33%)Consumer Staples: COTY (2.36x -4.65%), FDP (2.1x -16.08%)12:48SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: SIEN (2.59 +42.82%), TXMD (1.24 +24.91%)Materials: RYAM (1.76 +30.37%)Industrials: MRC (5.82 +30.09%), CMPR (78.22 +23.77%)Consumer Discretionary: CPS (14.29 +31.22%), SAH (24.24 +29.42%), EAT (24.54 +28.21%), CAL (8.04 +27.22%), DIN (47.23 +26.18%), HOME (2.81 +26.03%), LOVE (14.09 +24.54%)Energy: SM (2.69 +42.33%), LBRT (4.71 +31.2%), PVAC (5.79 +31.18%), NR (1.41 +30.09%), MTDR (6.12 +24.14%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: ALKS (14.63 -9.13%), NVAX (18.67 -9.13%), LIVN (52.42 -7.01%), KNSA (19.45 -6.63%), RDUS (15.58 -5.35%), TBIO (13.73 -4.65%), CYH (3.52 -4.48%)Industrials: HTZ (4.28 -14.4%)Information Technology: AKAM (95.91 -5.9%)Financials: SQQQ (11.75 -9.62%)Energy: MMLP (3.03 -13.68%), STNG (22.78 -13.22%), FRO (9.43 -9.98%), DHT (7.47 -7.55%), TK (3.92 -7.01%), EURN (11.27 -5.29%), APY (10.39 -4.68%)Consumer Staples: FDP (29.48 -16.08%), UNFI (10.94 -7.33%), COTY (5.54 -4.65%)12:37QCOM Qualcomm to report this evening (77.93 +2.64)Qualcomm (QCOM 77.93, +2.64, +3.5%) will report its Q2 results after today's closing bell, followed by the management's conference call at 16:45 ET.The Capital IQ consensus expects the chipmaker to report a 2.6% yr/yr increase in EPS to $0.79 on a 3.3% yr/yr increase in revenue to $5.044 bln. The company guided for Q2 EPS between $0.80 and $0.95 and revenue between $4.90 bln and $5.70 when it reported Q1 results on February 5. Shares of QCOM trade about 20% below their high from early January going into the report. The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Apple (AAPL 287.13, +8.55, +3.1%) will delay the production of this year's iPhone line by a month, which could delay some of QCOM's sales. Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to Sell from Neutral on April 17 while JP Morgan removed the stock from its Focus List on April 1. Deutsche Bank upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold on March 27. The company increased its quarterly dividend to $0.65/share from $0.62/share on March 10.Qualcomm trades at 15.2x forward earnings expectations, which represents a discount to Cirrus Logic (CRUS 77.84, +4.22, +5.7%), Maxim Integrated (MXIM 56.07, +1.07, +2.0%), and Marvell (MRVL 27.87, +0.99, +3.7%).12:26SUMRX Economic SummaryEconomic Data Summary:04/25 MBA Mortgage Applications Index -$64.2B; prior was -0.3% Q1 GDP-Adv. 0.9% vs; -4.3% was 2.1%The key takeaway from the report is that it hints at how ugly the Advance Q2 GDP report will be given that shutdown measures in the U.S. didn't start to gain steam until the latter half of March.Q1 Chain Deflator-Adv. -1.0%; 1.1% was 1.4% Mar Pending Home Sales 3.5%; prior was revised to 2.3% from 2.4%Upcoming Economic Data:04/25 Initial Claims due out Thurs at 8:30 ET (Briefing.com consensus of 3.05M; prior was 4.427M) 04/18 Continuing Claims due out Thurs at 8:30 ET (prior was 15.976M) Mar Personal Income due out Thurs at 8:30 ET (Briefing.com consensus of -1.5%; prior was 0.6%) Mar Personal Spending due out Thurs at 8:30 ET (Briefing.com consensus of -3.6%; prior was 0.2%) Mar PCE Prices due out Thurs at 8:30 ET (prior was 0.1%) Mar PCE Prices - Core due out Thurs at 8:30 ET (Briefing.com consensus of 0.1%; prior was 0.2%) Q1 Employment Cost Index due out Thurs at 8:30 ET (Briefing.com consensus of 0.6%; prior was 0.7%) Apr Chicago PMI due out Thurs at 9:45 ET (Briefing.com consensus of 39.2; prior was 47.8)12:09SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Brinker (EAT) gains following third quarter press -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersMRC (5.77 +29.08%): Posted upside Q1 EPS and revs (fell 18.1% yr/yr to $794 mln). Revs increased +4% sequentially, driven by a +$21 mln increase in the US gas utilities sector. Sales were negatively impacted by decreasing demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Co is taking steps to reduce its operating costs by $80 mln and to reduce its inventory by $140 mln or more relative to 2019 amid demand weakness. Co expects to generate over $200 mln in cash flow from operations in 2020. Energy sector stocks generally outperform amid improvement in oil prices.EAT (24.45 +27.72%): Topped consensus for Q3 EPS and revs. Co commented that its decision in recent years to enhance its off-premise business, including through online ordering and third-party delivery services, has enabled it to conveniently serve a "significantly higher" volume of off-premise customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Comp sales trends for the quarter were generally positive as of March 8, prior to the impact of COVID-19. Commenting on the weeks subsequent to the end of Q3, co noted that off-premise sales have grown each week since the pandemic began and have captured 57% of prior year total restaurant sales during the week ended April 22, adjusted to exclude an acquisition. SAH (23.84 +27.28%): Reported upside Q1 EPS and revs. EchoPark revs increased +33% yr/yr to $331.7 mln. Co's stores, deemed essential, have remained open during the pandemic, but since mid-March, co has experienced a significant decrease yr/yr in overall vehicle sales volumes and service department revs due principally to demand softness connected to COVID-19. Co recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $268.0 mln in the quarter related to its franchised dealerships reporting unit as a result of a decrease in co's market value due to the pandemic. Total liquidity was approx. $418.4 mln as of April 28.Small Cap LosersFDP (29.47 -16.11%): Missed estimates for Q1 EPS. Co's global operations were challenged by COVID-19 in Q1; beginning in January in Asia and ramping further in March, sales were impacted across all of co's markets; near-term demand and sales in co's foodservice distribution channel for higher price point products like pineapples, avocados, and fresh-cut vegetables and fruits, said co, remains "challenging." Adj. gross profit declined yr/yr to $76.5 mln from $95.1 mln, impacted by lower gross profit in co's fresh and value-added and banana business segments. Co expects Q2's results to continue to be pressured. Co also declared an interim cash dividend of $0.05/share, halved from co's prior dividend. The stock drops away from one-month highs.NAT (6.39 -13.01%): Pulls back after spiking yesterday to new three-year highs; at yesterday's close, the stock had netted an advance of circa +82% since mid-April. Today's decline takes place amid a general pullback in tanker and shipping stocks and a spike in oil prices; weekly petroleum data showed an increase in US commercial crude oil inventories of 9 mln barrels from the previous week. (Related: TNP, STNG, TNK...)AVDL (10.5 -10.64%): Priced a public offering of 11.63 mln ADSs at $10.75 per ADS; co expects gross proceeds from the offering of approx. $125.0 mln.

As part of the one-time restructuring charges for this plan of termination, in the second quarter of 2020 the Company expects to record a stock-based compensation charge and corresponding payroll tax expense related to equity compensation for employees who were terminated and a restructuring charge related to the shutdown of certain facilities. Separately, as part of its cost reductions in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has furloughed approximately 288 employees and has implemented reductions in base salary for exempt employees for a twelve week period beginning in May 2020, consisting of a 30% reduction for executive leadership, 20% for vice presidents and 10% for all other exempt employees.11:38AWK American Water Works increases quarterly cash dividend from $0.50 to $0.55 per share (124.85 -1.67)11:25TALKX Market Briefing: Remdesivir news feeds recovery rally effortThere is a bullish bias in the stock market today notwithstanding the fact that the first quarter saw the largest decline in GDP on an annualized basis (-4.8%) since the fourth quarter of 2008 and an awareness that second quarter GDP will be far worse.The ability to look past those realities has been aided by several factors, namely the Fed's liquidity support and a belief that the worst of the COVID-19 issue is behind the market, both literally in terms of caseload trajectory and figuratively in terms of GDP forecasts.Fittingly, the market has reacted quite favorably today to the news that an NIAID study of remdesivir, and antiviral treatment for COVID-19 from Gilead Sciences (GILD 82.50, +3.83, +4.9%), met a primary endpoint, creating some hope that an effective therapeutic treatment for patients with COVID-19 symptoms could be on the horizon.That news overshadowed the GDP report and fueled the reopening/recovery hope that has been driving stock prices sharply higher from their March 23 lows.Additionally, positive responses to the earnings reports and commentary from Alphabet (GOOG 1338.00, +104.33, +8.5%), Boeing (BA 139.10, +7.80, +5.9%), and Mastercard (MA 282.06, +17.46, +6.6%) to name a few has also contributed to today's rally effort, which is being led by the energy (+5.0%), communication services (+4.8%), information technology (+3.5%), and financial (+3.2%) sectors. The WTI contract for June delivery is up 32% to $16.26/bbl.One missing, and notable, element is a sell-off in the Treasury market. Despite the rally in stocks, the 10-yr note yield is down one basis point at 0.60% ahead of today's FOMC announcement at 2:00 p.m. ET.The Russell 2000 is up 3.7%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 3.1%; the S&P 500 is up 2.5%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 2.2%.11:05SOXX Industry Briefing: Chipmakers (239.62 +7.02)The PHLX Semiconductor Index (+3.2%) represents a pocket of relative strength in the early going of today's session. The high-beta group is now up 3.9% for the week versus a 3.2% week-to-date gain in the S&P 500 (+2.3%) and a 2.6% week-to-date gain in the Nasdaq Composite (+2.9%).Almost every component of the SOX index trades ahead of the broader market, reflecting a belief that chipmakers are well positioned for a recovery from coronavirus-related shutdowns. AMD (AMD 53.99, -1.52, -2.7%) has bucked the trend, trading at a one-week low, after reporting in-line Q1 results and issuing somewhat conservative guidance for Q2.Notable movers:MKS Instruments (MKSI 107.04, +9.29, +9.4%): leading performer, rising to a two-month high after beating Q1 expectations and issuing in-line guidance for Q2. Monolithic Power (MPWR 205.00, +13.69, +7.2%): rising to a fresh record after beating Q1 expectations and guiding Q2 revenue ahead of estimates.

Qualcomm (QCOM 77.73, +2.42, +3.2%): trading near a two-week high ahead of tonight's release of Q2 results. AMD (AMD 53.99, -1.52, -2.7%): weakest performer in the group after in-line Q1 results and cautious guidance for Q2.10:44LK Luckin Coffee delays filing of annual report for the year ended December 31, 2019 (stock remains halted)Luckin Coffee is furnishing this current report to indicate its reliance on the order (Release No. 34-88465) issued by the SEC on March 25 providing conditional relief to public companies that are unable to meet a filing deadline as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.The company's business, operating subsidiaries, and employees are located in China, where the Chinese government has imposed nationwide quarantine control and travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 outbreak since January 2020. Due to these measures and restrictions, the company has had limited access to its office buildings. This has resulted in a significant delay in preparing the company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, as previously disclosed, the company's Board has formed a Special Committee to oversee an internal investigation. Due to the impact of the delayed financial statement preparation process caused by COVID-19 and the pendency of the investigation, the company will not be able to file its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2019 by April 30, 2020. The company is working diligently to explore possible ways to file the Annual Report as soon as possible and intends to file the Annual Report within the available extension period.10:37COMDX Summary of Weekly Petroleum Data for the week ending April 24, 2020U.S. crude oil refinery inputs averaged 12.8 million barrels per day during the week ending April 24, 2020 which was 305,000 barrels per day more than the previous week's average.

The study demonstrated that patients receiving a 10-day treatment course of remdesivir achieved similar improvement in clinical status compared with those taking a 5-day treatment course (Odds Ratio: 0.75 [95% CI 0.51 - 1.12] on Day 14). No new safety signals were identified with remdesivir across either treatment group. Gilead plans to submit the full data for publication in a peer-reviewed journal in the coming weeks.This study sought to determine whether a shorter, 5-day course of remdesivir would achieve similar efficacy results as the 10-day treatment regimen used in multiple ongoing studies of remdesivir. Secondary objectives included rates of adverse events and additional measures of clinical response in both treatment groups. Patients were required to have evidence of pneumonia and reduced oxygen levels that did not require mechanical ventilation at the time of study entry. Clinical improvement was defined as an improvement of two or more points from baseline on a predefined seven-point scale, ranging from hospital discharge to increasing levels of oxygen support to death. Patients achieved clinical recovery if they no longer required oxygen support and medical care or were discharged from the hospital.In this study, the time to clinical improvement for 50% of patients was 10 days in the 5-day treatment group and 11 days in the 10-day treatment group. More than half of patients in both treatment groups were discharged from the hospital by Day 14 (5-day: 60.0%, n=120/200 vs.10-day: 52.3% n=103/197; p=0.14). At Day 14, 64.5% (n=129/200) of patients in the 5-day treatment group and 53.8% (n=106/197) of patients in the 10-day treatment group achieved clinical recovery. Clinical outcomes varied by geography. Outside of Italy, the overall mortality rate at Day 14 was 7% (n=23/320) across both treatment groups, with 64% (n=205/320) of patients experiencing clinical improvement at Day 14 and 61% (n=196/320) of patients discharged from the hospital.In an exploratory analysis, patients in the study who received remdesivir within 10 days of symptom onset had improved outcomes compared with those treated after more than 10 days of symptoms. Pooling data across treatment arms, by Day 14, 62% of patients treated early were able to be discharged from the hospital compared with 49% of patients who were treated late. Remdesivir was generally well-tolerated in both the 5-day and 10-day treatment groups. The most common adverse events occurring in more than 10% of patients in either group were nausea (5-day: 10.0%, n=20/200 vs. 10-day: 8.6%, n=17/197) and acute respiratory failure (5-day: 6.0%, n=12/200 vs. 10-day: 10.7%, n= 21/197). Grade 3 or higher liver enzyme (ALT) elevations occurred in 7.3% (n=28/385) of patients, with 3.0% (n=12/397) of patients discontinuing remdesivir treatment due to elevated liver tests.A second SIMPLE trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir administered intravenously in patients with moderate manifestations of COVID-19, compared with standard of care. The results from the first 600 patients of this study are expected at the end of May.08:35WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +58.40.

The patent is directed to methods for inhibiting the enzyme Sphingosine kinase 1 in patients using the company's proprietary compound SK1-I and related Sphingosine kinase 1 inhibitors.In February, Enzo reported the publication of work demonstrating that drug candidate SK1-I decreased Interferon (IFN) signature, pDC activation, and glomerulonephritis, the inflammation of the filtration units of the kidney, in a chemically induced mouse model of lupus. In more detail, that work demonstrated that SK1-I reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines including Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and Interferon-alpha and -beta in the animal model.

As such, 737 MAX aircraft production will resume at low rates in 2020 as timing and conditions of return to service are better understood and gradually increase to 31 per month during 2021, with further gradual increases to correspond with market demand.The estimated abnormal production costs from the temporary suspension of 737 MAX production have increased by approximately $1 bln, bringing the estimated total to approx $5 bln.There was no material change to estimated potential concessions and other considerations to customers related to the 737 MAX grounding.The 787 production rate will be reduced from 14 per month to 10 per month in 2020, and gradually reduced to 7 per month by 2022.

Global Services segment: Revenue was roughly flat at $4.63 bln, reflecting higher government services volume, largely offset by lower commercial services volume due to COVID-19.Boeing sees significant impact on the demand for new commercial airplanes and services, with airlines delaying purchases for new jets, slowing delivery schedules and deferring elective maintenance. Boeing is taking several actions that include reducing commercial airplane production rates. Co also announced a leadership and organizational restructuring to streamline roles and responsibilities, and plans to reduce overall staffing levels with a voluntary layoff program and additional workforce actions as necessary. Boeing has also taken action to manage near-term liquidity, as it has drawn on a term loan facility; reduced operating costs and discretionary spending; extended the existing pause on share repurchases and suspended dividends until further notice etc.Boeing believes it will be able to obtain sufficient liquidity to fund its operations.

AMC's remarks include the following: "Universal stated it only pursued a direct-to-home entertainment release for 'Trolls World Tour' because theaters were closed and Universal was committed to a lucrative toy licensing deal. We had our doubts that this was wholly Universal's motivations [...]. Nonetheless, we accepted this action as an exception to our longstanding business practices in these unprecedented times.""In [the] Wall Street Journal, Jeff Shell is quoted as saying that: 'The results for 'Trolls World Tour' have exceeded our expectations and demonstrated the viability of PVOD [...]. As soon as theaters reopen, we expect to release movies on both formats.' This radical change by Universal to the business model that currently exists between our two companies represents nothing but downside for us and is categorically unacceptable to AMC Entertainment.""Going forward, AMC will not license any Universal movies in any of our 1,000 theatres globally on these terms.""Accordingly, we want to be absolutely clear, so that there is no ambiguity of any kind. AMC believes that with this proposed action to go to the home and theatres simultaneously, Universal is breaking the business model and dealings between our two companies. It assumes that we will meekly accept a reshaped view of how studios and exhibitors should interact, with zero concern on Universal's part as to how its actions affect us. It also presumes that Universal in fact can have its cake and eat it too, that Universal film product can be released to the home and theatres at the same time, without modification to the current economic arrangements between us." "It is disappointing to us, but Jeff's comments as to Universal's unilateral actions and intentions have left us with no choice. Therefore, effectively immediately AMC will no longer play any Universal movies in any of our theatres in the United States, Europe or the Middle East. This policy affects any and all Universal movies per se, goes into effect today and as our theatres reopen, and is not some hollow or ill-considered threat. Incidentally, this policy is not aimed solely at Universal out of pique or to be punitive in any way, it also extends to any movie maker who unilaterally abandons current windowing practices absent good faith negotiations between us, so that they as distributor and we as exhibitor both benefit and neither are hurt from such changes. Currently, with the press comment today, Universal is the only studio contemplating a wholesale change to the status quo. Hence, this immediate communication in response."18:27ERYP ERYTECH Pharma receives FDA Fast Track Designation for eryaspase in second-line pancreatic cancer (8.29 +0.79)The FDA has granted eryaspase Fast Track Designation for the development of a second-line treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Eryaspase, ERYTECH's lead product candidate, is being evaluated in a Phase 3 trial (TRYbeCA-1) in second-line metastatic pancreatic cancer in 11 countries in Europe and the US.The company today provided an update on TRYbeCA-1. The independent data monitoring committee has reviewed the safety data for the first 320 patients enrolled and treated in the trial. In line with the two earlier safety reviews, no safety issues were identified, and the IDMC recommended to continue the trial as planned. To date, more than 75% of the approx. 500 patients to be enrolled in the trial have been randomized.Through March 2020, new patient enrollment continued as planned notwithstanding the increasing difficulties experienced by the hospitals to organize the proper treatment and follow-up.Over the past two weeks, ERYTECH has observed a reduction in enrollment rate due to the COVID-19 pandemic and now believes new patient enrollment will be below plan in the coming months. The Company currently expects a delay of 3 to 4 months in completion of patient enrollment, bringing the time of complete enrollment to the fourth quarter of this year.The company now expects to report the interim analysis around year-end 2020 and the final analysis in the second half of 2021.18:06SIMO Silicon Motion beats by $0.12, beats on revs; guides Q2 revs above consensus, declines to provide full year 2020 guidance (44.38 -0.39)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.80 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.12 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.68; revenues rose 40.2% year/year to $132.77 mln vs the $130.93 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The company anticipates continuing a regular quarterly dividend in the future.Commentary: "Since mid-March, when shelter-in-place mandates began expanding across the country, total demand has increased year over year driven by customer orders for highly consumable COVID response items. However, given the worldwide constrained availability of many of these products, our backlog has also increased substantially as we were unable to fulfill many of these orders which would have mitigated other softness in the market. As a result, we recorded low double-digit revenue declines during the closing weeks of the quarter which now appear to have stabilized at approximately 20% in April. We anticipate that we will be able to ship a portion of this backlog in the second quarter as visibility into our supply chain and product lead times has improved."17:05SUPN Supernus Pharma to acquire central nervous system portfolio from US WorldMeds for total consideration of $530 mln (19.49 -0.09)Supernus Pharmaceuticals announced that the company entered into a definitive agreement under which Supernus will acquire the central nervous system (CNS) portfolio of US WorldMeds, a privately-held biopharmaceutical company.

Vaccine recipients demonstrated strong antibody and T cell immune responses after 2 or 3 doses with 0.6 mg of INO-4700, a DNA vaccine that targets the MERS-CoV Spike (S) glycoprotein, delivered with intradermal CELLECTRA device. The vaccination regimen was well-tolerated with no vaccine-associated severe adverse events.Overall, for those receiving 0.6 mg of INO-4700, 88% demonstrated seroconversion after a 2 dose regimen at 0 and 8 weeks, while for those receiving a 3 dose regimen given at 0, 4 and 12 weeks, 84% seroverted after 2 doses and 100% after 3 doses, as measured by a binding antibody assay against the full-length S protein. Additionally, 92% of the vaccine recipients in both groups displayed the ability to neutralize the virus using a neutralization assay. Robust T cell responses were observed in 60% of vaccine recipients after the 2 dose regimen and 84% of those in the 3 dose group. A single dose of 0.6 mg of INO-4700 intradermal vaccination resulted in 74% binding antibody response rate and 48% neutralization antibody response rate. These results were selected for an oral presentation at the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy (ASGCT) Conference, to be held virtually from May 12-15.INOVIO is planning to advance INO-4700 into a Phase 2 clinical trial in the Middle East with a previously announced funding of $56 mln by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.16:31AMD Advanced Micro reports EPS in-line, revs in-line; guides Q2 revs in-line; guides FY20 revs in-line (55.51 -0.98)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.18 per share, excluding non-recurring items, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.18; revenues rose 40.4% year/year to $1.79 bln vs the $1.79 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus and company guidance of $1.75-1.85 bln.Gross margin 46% versus 41% in prior-year period.

Oil demand has significantly deteriorated as a result. The unparalleled demand destruction has resulted in lower spending by customers and reduced demand for the company's products and services. There is significant uncertainty as to the duration of this disruption.As a critical supplier to the global energy infrastructure and an essential business, the company has remained operational with no closures to any facilities. MRC has had four confirmed illnesses reported, and all have recovered. MRC Global has also implemented various safety measures for employees working in the company's facilities and implemented remote working for those whose jobs permit it. MRC Global is committed to a safe working environment for all employees.From a supply chain perspective, the effects have moved around the globe as the virus has spread. Given the company's inventory position and the reduced demand, the company has fulfilled orders with little disruption.

Large-cap technology and health care stocks lagged, while reopening enthusiasm continued to flow into the small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%) and S&P MidCap 400 (+1.0%). The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.4%.The day started with broad gains that lifted the S&P 500 as much as 1.5% shortly after the open, as part of the reopening momentum from Monday. That broad momentum quickly dissipated, presumably due to valuation concerns, but lingered in areas of the market that had underperformed when the shutdown angst was rampant.Some of those included the small-cap and mid-cap stocks, as previously noted, but also the cyclical S&P 500 energy (+2.2%), materials (+2.0%), industrials (+1.8%), and financials (+0.9%) sectors.Conversely, the large-cap stocks that were deemed as relatively safe, and thus outperformed over the past few months, lost some of their appeal today and heavily dragged on the broader market. Those were found in the health care (-2.1%), communication services (-1.9%), and information technology (-1.4%) sectors.The health care space also had some negative catalysts despite the reported progress on the coronavirus front. For instance, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 151.39, -2.90, -1.9%) was downgraded to Neutral from Buy at UBS, while Pfizer (PFE 37.91, -0.42, -1.1%) and Merck (MRK 81.18, -2.80, -3.3%) declined after reporting earnings.In other earnings news, shares of Caterpillar (CAT 115.46, +0.26, +0.2%), 3M (MMM 157.61, +3.96, +2.6%), and PepsiCo (PEP 136.32, +1.4%) finished higher, even after the companies withdrew full-year guidance, while shares of UPS (UPS 96.43, -6.12, -6.0%) faltered after the company missed profit estimates.U.S. Treasuries reclaimed most of yesterday's losses, driving yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined three basis points to 0.20%, and the 10-yr yield declined five basis points to 0.61%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 99.88. WTI crude declined 4.6%, or $0.60, to $12.37/bbl, although it was down as much as 22% at one point during the session.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data:The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for April plunged to 86.9 (Briefing.com consensus 86.5) from a downwardly revised 118.8 (from 120.0) for March. The April reading is the lowest since June 2014.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers, while thinking positively about things reopening again, are still less optimistic about their financial prospects, which could be a headwind for spending activity during the recovery phase.The advance goods trade deficit totaled $64.2 bln in March after a $59.9 bln deficit in February. Advance retail inventories declined 1.3% in March after decreasing 0.3% in February. Advance wholesale inventories decreased 1.0% in March after decreasing 0.7% in February.The S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for February increased 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.7%).Looking ahead, investors will receive the advance estimate for Q1 GDP, Pending Home Sales for March, and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite -4.1% YTDS&P 500 -11.4% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -15.6% YTDRussell 2000 -22.0% YTD16:20CHRW C.H.

Our Braun, Vicks, PUR and Honeywell products are supporting consumer health at a time of extreme need, and our OXO products are providing convenience, comfort and solutions as families spend unprecedented amounts of time at home. We are working around the clock to meet as much of the ongoing demand for thermometers, humidifiers, air purifiers and water purifiers as possible. We are also working with suppliers and retailers to provide consumers with OXO kitchen, cleaning and storage products, as well as volumizers in Beauty, where demand is high in channels that are open. While encouraging, we do expect to see a net adverse impact to our results for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2021. Although still very early, we are making plans to continue selectively investing in the key Phase II initiatives once the economic situation allows. With our diversified portfolio of leading, trusted brands, a strong balance sheet with low net leverage, and a corporate culture driven to rise to the challenge, we believe Helen of Troy is well positioned to navigate the current unprecedented situation and emerge strong."Due to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and the related business uncertainty, the Company is not providing an Outlook for fiscal 2021 at this time. In order to reduce costs and preserve cash flow, the Company has implemented a number of measures that will remain in place until there is greater certainty, a reopening of retail customer brick and mortar stores and improved consumer demand, which include the following: A graduated salary reduction for all associates, including named executive officers and the other members of the Company's executive leadership team; A reduction in the cash compensation of the Company's Board of Directors; Suspension of merit increases, promotions and new associate hiring until further notice; The furlough of associates in specific areas directly tied to sales volume, with assistance to maintain health insurance coverage, as well as a reduction of external temporary labor and reduced work hours; Reduction or deferral of marketing expense. The Company will lean into brands with strong current demand and reduce investment in other key brands without sacrificing brand awareness; Limited reduction of investment in new product development and launches, in anticipation of more normalized economic activity; Elimination of travel expense in the short term, with a significant reduction planned for the second half of fiscal 2021; and Reduction of consulting fees and capital expenditures for projects that are not critical.16:17MET MetLife increases quarterly common stock dividend to $0.46/share from $0.44/share (35.18 +0.76)16:15TENB Tenable beats by $0.10, beats on revs; guides Q2 EPS above consensus, revs below consensus (24.70 -0.12)Reports Q1 (Mar) loss of $0.09 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.10 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.19); revenues rose 27.8% year/year to $102.6 mln vs the $100.07 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

"April 2020 freight demand has held up fairly well so far, with some expected gradual weakening given that many parts of the U.S. economy are shut down or have been significantly curtailed.

Because PAYC charges clients on a per-employee basis for certain services it provides, fluctuations in headcount at its clients will impact results of operations in future periods.Significantly lower average interest rates in 2020, as well as slower growth in the average funds held for clients balance due to lower employee headcount at its clients and clients electing the Social Security tax deferral under the CARES Act, will have a negative effect on recurring revenue growth in future periods.16:13DVAX Dynavax reported immunogenicity and safety data from an interim analysis of the ongoing clinical trial evaluating HEPLISAV-B (3.85 -0.04)Demonstrated seroprotection rate of 86.4% at week 20 after 4 standard doses of HEPLISAV-BSafety data showed HEPLISAV-B was well toleratedCompany to host webinar review of data Thursday, April 30, 2020 at 1:00 p.m. ET/10:00 a.m. PT16:13WW WW beats by $0.12, reports revs in-line; withdraws FY 20 outlook (23.22 +1.22)Reports Q1 (Mar) loss of $0.09 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.12 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.21); revenues rose 10.2% year/year to $400.4 mln vs the $402.72 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Service Revenues in Q1 2020 were $324.7 million.

Strong portfolio performance was offset by about $600 million from increased credit-loss reserves, and higher depreciation on off-lease vehicles awaiting sale and anticipated operating lease defaults -- all reflecting estimated impact of the coronavirus in future periods.In March, the company withdrew guidance for 2020 financial performance it had given in early February. That outlook excluded possible implications of the coronavirus, which at the time had not yet reached pandemic stage.

The Nasdaq Composite (+3.6%) and Russell 2000 (+4.9%) pull ahead of the benchmark index, while Dow Jones Industrial Average (+2.6%) follows behind.All 11 S&P 500 sectors are trading higher, led by the energy (+5.9%), communication services (+5.2%), and information technology (+3.9%) sectors. The consumer staples sector is up just 0.3% and is the only sector up less than 1.0%.Gilead Sciences (GILD 83.90, +5.25, +6.7%) provided sentiment a boost this morning when it affirmed that its remdesivir drug met its primary endpoint in an NIAID placebo-controlled study. The official statement has put to rest prior conflicting reports on the potential therapeutic and has supported the market's reopening optimism.Throw in a 30% spike in WTI crude futures ($15.95, +3.60, +29.3%) and bullish reactions to earnings reports from Alphabet (GOOG 1343.92, +110.25, +8.9%), MasterCard (MA 282.13, +17.52, +6.6%), and Boeing (BA 143.68, +12.38, +9.4%), and the market has now nearly forgotten the GDP data.Briefly, the advance estimate for Q1 GDP declined at an annualized rate of 4.8% (Briefing.com consensus -4.3%). Most expect Q2 to be worse, but the market is thinking a revival in economic activity will buoy the Q3 figure. Of course, there's no telling what Q4 would look like, but the market is leaning on the side of optimism.Separately, Starbucks (SBUX 77.64, -1.05, -1.3%), General Electric (GE 6.72, -0.08, -1.1%), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 54.09, -1.42, -2.5%) are bucking the broader trend following their earnings reports.Coming up next in this busy news day is the Fed's policy directive at 2:00 p.m. ET and Fed Chair Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET. U.S. Treasuries are holding steady in the meantime, ignoring the enthusiasm in the stock market. The 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 0.60%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 99.72.Reviewing today's economic data:First quarter GDP declined at an annualized rate of 4.8% (Briefing.com consensus -4.3%) while the GDP Price Deflator was 1.3% (Briefing.com consensus 1.1%). This was the largest decline in GDP since the fourth quarter of 2008.The key takeaway from the report is that it hints at how ugly the Advance Q2 GDP report will be given that shutdown measures in the U.S. didn't start to gain steam until the latter half of March.Pending Home Sales dropped 20.8% in March after increasing a revised 2.3% in February (from +2.4%).The weekly Mortgage Applications Index declined 3.3% following a 0.3% decline in the prior week.12:49SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: GILD (43.13 mln +6.81%), INO (27.17 mln +1.02%)Industrials: GE (110.51 mln -0.74%), LUV (69.84 mln +5.65%), AAL (65.93 mln +12.43%), HTZ (61.27 mln -14.4%), DAL (50.14 mln +11.74%), BA (33.25 mln +9.4%), UAL (30.21 mln +11.57%)Consumer Discretionary: F (70.33 mln +0.41%), CCL (64.78 mln +14.11%), NIO (64.22 mln +12.28%), NCLH (33.06 mln +20.85%)Information Technology: AMD (64.32 mln -2.9%)Financials: SQQQ (38.29 mln -9.62%), BAC (37.93 mln +4.57%)Energy: OXY (32.6 mln +7.05%), OAS (31.79 mln +7.24%), RIG (25.42 mln +12.22%)Consumer Staples: ABEV (27.62 mln +3.05%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: SIEN (2.37x +42.82%)Industrials: LUV (5.09x +5.65%), HTZ (3.59x -14.4%), TGI (2.48x +13.26%)Consumer Discretionary: IRBT (2.12x -3.53%), EAT (2.07x +28.21%)Information Technology: RPD (3.64x -4%), XELA (3.57x +8.85%), CALX (2.71x +13.01%), AKAM (2.34x -5.9%)Energy: MMLP (3.98x -13.68%), LBRT (2.44x +31.2%), BTE (2x +11.54%), NBR (1.87x +13.24%), SM (1.84x +42.33%)Consumer Staples: COTY (2.36x -4.65%), FDP (2.1x -16.08%)12:48SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: SIEN (2.59 +42.82%), TXMD (1.24 +24.91%)Materials: RYAM (1.76 +30.37%)Industrials: MRC (5.82 +30.09%), CMPR (78.22 +23.77%)Consumer Discretionary: CPS (14.29 +31.22%), SAH (24.24 +29.42%), EAT (24.54 +28.21%), CAL (8.04 +27.22%), DIN (47.23 +26.18%), HOME (2.81 +26.03%), LOVE (14.09 +24.54%)Energy: SM (2.69 +42.33%), LBRT (4.71 +31.2%), PVAC (5.79 +31.18%), NR (1.41 +30.09%), MTDR (6.12 +24.14%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: ALKS (14.63 -9.13%), NVAX (18.67 -9.13%), LIVN (52.42 -7.01%), KNSA (19.45 -6.63%), RDUS (15.58 -5.35%), TBIO (13.73 -4.65%), CYH (3.52 -4.48%)Industrials: HTZ (4.28 -14.4%)Information Technology: AKAM (95.91 -5.9%)Financials: SQQQ (11.75 -9.62%)Energy: MMLP (3.03 -13.68%), STNG (22.78 -13.22%), FRO (9.43 -9.98%), DHT (7.47 -7.55%), TK (3.92 -7.01%), EURN (11.27 -5.29%), APY (10.39 -4.68%)Consumer Staples: FDP (29.48 -16.08%), UNFI (10.94 -7.33%), COTY (5.54 -4.65%)12:37QCOM Qualcomm to report this evening (77.93 +2.64)Qualcomm (QCOM 77.93, +2.64, +3.5%) will report its Q2 results after today's closing bell, followed by the management's conference call at 16:45 ET.The Capital IQ consensus expects the chipmaker to report a 2.6% yr/yr increase in EPS to $0.79 on a 3.3% yr/yr increase in revenue to $5.044 bln.

Revs increased +4% sequentially, driven by a +$21 mln increase in the US gas utilities sector. Sales were negatively impacted by decreasing demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Co is taking steps to reduce its operating costs by $80 mln and to reduce its inventory by $140 mln or more relative to 2019 amid demand weakness. Co expects to generate over $200 mln in cash flow from operations in 2020. Energy sector stocks generally outperform amid improvement in oil prices.EAT (24.45 +27.72%): Topped consensus for Q3 EPS and revs. Co commented that its decision in recent years to enhance its off-premise business, including through online ordering and third-party delivery services, has enabled it to conveniently serve a "significantly higher" volume of off-premise customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Comp sales trends for the quarter were generally positive as of March 8, prior to the impact of COVID-19. Commenting on the weeks subsequent to the end of Q3, co noted that off-premise sales have grown each week since the pandemic began and have captured 57% of prior year total restaurant sales during the week ended April 22, adjusted to exclude an acquisition. SAH (23.84 +27.28%): Reported upside Q1 EPS and revs. EchoPark revs increased +33% yr/yr to $331.7 mln. Co's stores, deemed essential, have remained open during the pandemic, but since mid-March, co has experienced a significant decrease yr/yr in overall vehicle sales volumes and service department revs due principally to demand softness connected to COVID-19. Co recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $268.0 mln in the quarter related to its franchised dealerships reporting unit as a result of a decrease in co's market value due to the pandemic. Total liquidity was approx. $418.4 mln as of April 28.Small Cap LosersFDP (29.47 -16.11%): Missed estimates for Q1 EPS. Co's global operations were challenged by COVID-19 in Q1; beginning in January in Asia and ramping further in March, sales were impacted across all of co's markets; near-term demand and sales in co's foodservice distribution channel for higher price point products like pineapples, avocados, and fresh-cut vegetables and fruits, said co, remains "challenging." Adj. gross profit declined yr/yr to $76.5 mln from $95.1 mln, impacted by lower gross profit in co's fresh and value-added and banana business segments. Co expects Q2's results to continue to be pressured. Co also declared an interim cash dividend of $0.05/share, halved from co's prior dividend. The stock drops away from one-month highs.NAT (6.39 -13.01%): Pulls back after spiking yesterday to new three-year highs; at yesterday's close, the stock had netted an advance of circa +82% since mid-April.

The WTI contract for June delivery is up 32% to $16.26/bbl.One missing, and notable, element is a sell-off in the Treasury market. Despite the rally in stocks, the 10-yr note yield is down one basis point at 0.60% ahead of today's FOMC announcement at 2:00 p.m. ET.The Russell 2000 is up 3.7%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 3.1%; the S&P 500 is up 2.5%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 2.2%.11:05SOXX Industry Briefing: Chipmakers (239.62 +7.02)The PHLX Semiconductor Index (+3.2%) represents a pocket of relative strength in the early going of today's session. The high-beta group is now up 3.9% for the week versus a 3.2% week-to-date gain in the S&P 500 (+2.3%) and a 2.6% week-to-date gain in the Nasdaq Composite (+2.9%).Almost every component of the SOX index trades ahead of the broader market, reflecting a belief that chipmakers are well positioned for a recovery from coronavirus-related shutdowns.

AMD (AMD 53.99, -1.52, -2.7%): weakest performer in the group after in-line Q1 results and cautious guidance for Q2.10:44LK Luckin Coffee delays filing of annual report for the year ended December 31, 2019 (stock remains halted)Luckin Coffee is furnishing this current report to indicate its reliance on the order (Release No. 34-88465) issued by the SEC on March 25 providing conditional relief to public companies that are unable to meet a filing deadline as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.The company's business, operating subsidiaries, and employees are located in China, where the Chinese government has imposed nationwide quarantine control and travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 outbreak since January 2020.

The study demonstrated that patients receiving a 10-day treatment course of remdesivir achieved similar improvement in clinical status compared with those taking a 5-day treatment course (Odds Ratio: 0.75 [95% CI 0.51 - 1.12] on Day 14). No new safety signals were identified with remdesivir across either treatment group. Gilead plans to submit the full data for publication in a peer-reviewed journal in the coming weeks.This study sought to determine whether a shorter, 5-day course of remdesivir would achieve similar efficacy results as the 10-day treatment regimen used in multiple ongoing studies of remdesivir. Secondary objectives included rates of adverse events and additional measures of clinical response in both treatment groups. Patients were required to have evidence of pneumonia and reduced oxygen levels that did not require mechanical ventilation at the time of study entry. Clinical improvement was defined as an improvement of two or more points from baseline on a predefined seven-point scale, ranging from hospital discharge to increasing levels of oxygen support to death. Patients achieved clinical recovery if they no longer required oxygen support and medical care or were discharged from the hospital.In this study, the time to clinical improvement for 50% of patients was 10 days in the 5-day treatment group and 11 days in the 10-day treatment group. More than half of patients in both treatment groups were discharged from the hospital by Day 14 (5-day: 60.0%, n=120/200 vs.10-day: 52.3% n=103/197; p=0.14). At Day 14, 64.5% (n=129/200) of patients in the 5-day treatment group and 53.8% (n=106/197) of patients in the 10-day treatment group achieved clinical recovery. Clinical outcomes varied by geography. Outside of Italy, the overall mortality rate at Day 14 was 7% (n=23/320) across both treatment groups, with 64% (n=205/320) of patients experiencing clinical improvement at Day 14 and 61% (n=196/320) of patients discharged from the hospital.In an exploratory analysis, patients in the study who received remdesivir within 10 days of symptom onset had improved outcomes compared with those treated after more than 10 days of symptoms. Pooling data across treatment arms, by Day 14, 62% of patients treated early were able to be discharged from the hospital compared with 49% of patients who were treated late. Remdesivir was generally well-tolerated in both the 5-day and 10-day treatment groups. The most common adverse events occurring in more than 10% of patients in either group were nausea (5-day: 10.0%, n=20/200 vs. 10-day: 8.6%, n=17/197) and acute respiratory failure (5-day: 6.0%, n=12/200 vs. 10-day: 10.7%, n= 21/197). Grade 3 or higher liver enzyme (ALT) elevations occurred in 7.3% (n=28/385) of patients, with 3.0% (n=12/397) of patients discontinuing remdesivir treatment due to elevated liver tests.A second SIMPLE trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir administered intravenously in patients with moderate manifestations of COVID-19, compared with standard of care. The results from the first 600 patients of this study are expected at the end of May.08:35WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +58.40.

The company states, "We understand that the trial has met its primary endpoint and that NIAID will provide detailed information at an upcoming briefing.""Remdesivir is not yet licensed or approved anywhere globally and has not yet been demonstrated to be safe or effective for the treatment of COVID-19. Gilead will share additional remdesivir data from the company's open-label Phase 3 SIMPLE trial in patients with severe COVID-19 disease shortly. This study will provide information on whether a shorter, 5-day duration of therapy may have similar efficacy and safety as the 10-day treatment course evaluated in the NIAID trial and other ongoing trials. Gilead expects data at the end of May from the second SIMPLE study evaluating the 5- and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir in patients with moderate COVID-19 disease.""Gilead will continue to discuss with regulatory authorities the growing data set regarding remdesivir as a potential treatment for COVID-19."08:22BYSI BeyondSpring changes primary endpoint for its Study 106 Phase 3 superiority clinical trial with first-in-class lead asset, Plinabulin, for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia prevention (12.64 )For more than 20 years, the standard primary endpoint for CIN trials has been the duration of severe (Grade 4) neutropenia (DSN). The new primary endpoint will be the rate of the prevention of Grade 4 neutropenia -- a more clinically meaningful and trial-sensitive endpoint -- and will be used to establish superiority of the Plinabulin-G-CSF combination over G-CSF alone.A robust plan will be submitted to the FDA to prospectively validate this new primary endpoint against clinical outcome measures. If successful, Plinabulin could provide clinicians and cancer patients with powerful tools to fight cancer.08:22LM Legg Mason beats by $0.17, beats on revs (49.69 )Reports Q4 (Mar) earnings of $1.02 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.17 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.85; revenues rose 3.9% year/year to $719.6 mln vs the $702.81 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Assets Under Management were $730.8 billion at March 31, 2020 compared with $803.5 billion at December 31, 2019, reflecting $64.2 billion in negative market performance and other, long-term outflows of $12.1 billion, negative foreign exchange of $7.8 billion and realizations of $0.2 billion, partially offset by liquidity inflows of $11.6 billion.08:20SKT Tanger Factory finalizes extension of contract for Steven B.

The patent is directed to methods for inhibiting the enzyme Sphingosine kinase 1 in patients using the company's proprietary compound SK1-I and related Sphingosine kinase 1 inhibitors.In February, Enzo reported the publication of work demonstrating that drug candidate SK1-I decreased Interferon (IFN) signature, pDC activation, and glomerulonephritis, the inflammation of the filtration units of the kidney, in a chemically induced mouse model of lupus. In more detail, that work demonstrated that SK1-I reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines including Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and Interferon-alpha and -beta in the animal model. Significantly, elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6, are reported to be associated with the development of respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. Based on the results obtained in the lupus model and prior work demonstrating the anti-inflammatory activity of SK1-I in animal models of other immune disorders and on isolated human blood cells, the company is exploring avenues for the development of SK1-I as a potential treatment for COVID-19.08:13CMPR Cimpress reports prelim Q3 results; Apollo Global Management (APO) confirms agreement to provide a $300 million secured note to Cimpress (63.20 )Co reports prelim Q3 revs of ~$598 mln vs $608.9 mln S&P Capital IQ two analyst estimate; Adjusted EBITDA of ~$71 mln, a year-over-year decline of 20%.

Much of this can be attributed to the bounce in crude oil, which is up 14% and trading over the $14 area.

AMC's remarks include the following: "Universal stated it only pursued a direct-to-home entertainment release for 'Trolls World Tour' because theaters were closed and Universal was committed to a lucrative toy licensing deal. We had our doubts that this was wholly Universal's motivations [...]. Nonetheless, we accepted this action as an exception to our longstanding business practices in these unprecedented times.""In [the] Wall Street Journal, Jeff Shell is quoted as saying that: 'The results for 'Trolls World Tour' have exceeded our expectations and demonstrated the viability of PVOD [...]. As soon as theaters reopen, we expect to release movies on both formats.' This radical change by Universal to the business model that currently exists between our two companies represents nothing but downside for us and is categorically unacceptable to AMC Entertainment.""Going forward, AMC will not license any Universal movies in any of our 1,000 theatres globally on these terms.""Accordingly, we want to be absolutely clear, so that there is no ambiguity of any kind. AMC believes that with this proposed action to go to the home and theatres simultaneously, Universal is breaking the business model and dealings between our two companies. It assumes that we will meekly accept a reshaped view of how studios and exhibitors should interact, with zero concern on Universal's part as to how its actions affect us. It also presumes that Universal in fact can have its cake and eat it too, that Universal film product can be released to the home and theatres at the same time, without modification to the current economic arrangements between us." "It is disappointing to us, but Jeff's comments as to Universal's unilateral actions and intentions have left us with no choice. Therefore, effectively immediately AMC will no longer play any Universal movies in any of our theatres in the United States, Europe or the Middle East. This policy affects any and all Universal movies per se, goes into effect today and as our theatres reopen, and is not some hollow or ill-considered threat. Incidentally, this policy is not aimed solely at Universal out of pique or to be punitive in any way, it also extends to any movie maker who unilaterally abandons current windowing practices absent good faith negotiations between us, so that they as distributor and we as exhibitor both benefit and neither are hurt from such changes. Currently, with the press comment today, Universal is the only studio contemplating a wholesale change to the status quo. Hence, this immediate communication in response."18:27ERYP ERYTECH Pharma receives FDA Fast Track Designation for eryaspase in second-line pancreatic cancer (8.29 +0.79)The FDA has granted eryaspase Fast Track Designation for the development of a second-line treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

However, given the worldwide constrained availability of many of these products, our backlog has also increased substantially as we were unable to fulfill many of these orders which would have mitigated other softness in the market. As a result, we recorded low double-digit revenue declines during the closing weeks of the quarter which now appear to have stabilized at approximately 20% in April. We anticipate that we will be able to ship a portion of this backlog in the second quarter as visibility into our supply chain and product lead times has improved."17:05SUPN Supernus Pharma to acquire central nervous system portfolio from US WorldMeds for total consideration of $530 mln (19.49 -0.09)Supernus Pharmaceuticals announced that the company entered into a definitive agreement under which Supernus will acquire the central nervous system (CNS) portfolio of US WorldMeds, a privately-held biopharmaceutical company.

The new preclinical program targets MHC class I related proteins A (MICA) and B (MICB) and is supported by an exclusive license from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute to intellectual property covering novel antibody fragments binding MICA/B for iPSC-derived cellular therapeutics. MICA and MICB are stress proteins that are selectively expressed at high levels on many solid tumors."[W]e are pleased that our engineered iPSC-derived CAR-MICA/B NK cells have shown potent anti-tumor activity in preclinical studies," said Scott Wolchko, President and CEO of Fate Therapeutics. "Importantly, since the shedding of MICA/B is a common escape mechanism deployed by many tumors to evade immune cell recognition, we are encouraged that our novel CAR design, which uniquely targets the a3 domain of MICA/B, prevents protein shedding and promotes NK and T cell-mediated tumor immunity."16:52CRSP CRISPR Therapeutics misses by $0.11, misses on revs (52.52 -2.48)Reports Q1 (Mar) loss of $1.15 per share, $0.11 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($1.04); revenues fell 52.1% year/year to $0.16 mln vs the $3.04 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Hilton, chairman and chief executive officer of Meritage Homes. "Though our net earnings for the first quarter more than doubled and every key operating metric showed significant year-over-year growth, we are expecting much weaker results for at least the next couple of quarters due to large parts of the economy being shut down, causing record job losses, fear and uncertainty about the future. Our hearts go out to all those impacted directly and indirectly."...He explained, "With shelter-in-place orders in effect across most of our markets, we are seeing customers either virtually or by appointment in our sales offices and Studio M design centers. Those we see tend to be serious buyers ready to commit to a new home purchase, so while our traffic has understandably decreased, our conversion rates on the traffic we do see have increased."16:33MKSI MKS Instruments beats by $0.30, beats on revs; guides Q2 EPS in-line, revs in-line (97.75 +1.67)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $1.54 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.30 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.24; revenues rose 15.6% year/year to $535.7 mln vs the $508.65 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Vaccine recipients demonstrated strong antibody and T cell immune responses after 2 or 3 doses with 0.6 mg of INO-4700, a DNA vaccine that targets the MERS-CoV Spike (S) glycoprotein, delivered with intradermal CELLECTRA device. The vaccination regimen was well-tolerated with no vaccine-associated severe adverse events.Overall, for those receiving 0.6 mg of INO-4700, 88% demonstrated seroconversion after a 2 dose regimen at 0 and 8 weeks, while for those receiving a 3 dose regimen given at 0, 4 and 12 weeks, 84% seroverted after 2 doses and 100% after 3 doses, as measured by a binding antibody assay against the full-length S protein. Additionally, 92% of the vaccine recipients in both groups displayed the ability to neutralize the virus using a neutralization assay. Robust T cell responses were observed in 60% of vaccine recipients after the 2 dose regimen and 84% of those in the 3 dose group. A single dose of 0.6 mg of INO-4700 intradermal vaccination resulted in 74% binding antibody response rate and 48% neutralization antibody response rate. These results were selected for an oral presentation at the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy (ASGCT) Conference, to be held virtually from May 12-15.INOVIO is planning to advance INO-4700 into a Phase 2 clinical trial in the Middle East with a previously announced funding of $56 mln by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.16:31AMD Advanced Micro reports EPS in-line, revs in-line; guides Q2 revs in-line; guides FY20 revs in-line (55.51 -0.98)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.18 per share, excluding non-recurring items, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.18; revenues rose 40.4% year/year to $1.79 bln vs the $1.79 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus and company guidance of $1.75-1.85 bln.Gross margin 46% versus 41% in prior-year period.

There is significant uncertainty as to the duration of this disruption.As a critical supplier to the global energy infrastructure and an essential business, the company has remained operational with no closures to any facilities. MRC has had four confirmed illnesses reported, and all have recovered. MRC Global has also implemented various safety measures for employees working in the company's facilities and implemented remote working for those whose jobs permit it.

JNPR expects to see sequential volume driven improvements in margin during the June quarter to be offset by certain strategic insertion opportunities in addition to increased logistics and other supply chain-related costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Commentary: "While we are seeing uncertainty in our business due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect to see sequential revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth in Q2. Confidence in our forecast is driven by strong backlog and healthy momentum with our Service Provider and Cloud customers. We believe these factors should help offset increased uncertainty in certain segments of the Enterprise market.

Large-cap technology and health care stocks lagged, while reopening enthusiasm continued to flow into the small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%) and S&P MidCap 400 (+1.0%). The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.4%.The day started with broad gains that lifted the S&P 500 as much as 1.5% shortly after the open, as part of the reopening momentum from Monday. That broad momentum quickly dissipated, presumably due to valuation concerns, but lingered in areas of the market that had underperformed when the shutdown angst was rampant.Some of those included the small-cap and mid-cap stocks, as previously noted, but also the cyclical S&P 500 energy (+2.2%), materials (+2.0%), industrials (+1.8%), and financials (+0.9%) sectors.Conversely, the large-cap stocks that were deemed as relatively safe, and thus outperformed over the past few months, lost some of their appeal today and heavily dragged on the broader market. Those were found in the health care (-2.1%), communication services (-1.9%), and information technology (-1.4%) sectors.The health care space also had some negative catalysts despite the reported progress on the coronavirus front. For instance, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 151.39, -2.90, -1.9%) was downgraded to Neutral from Buy at UBS, while Pfizer (PFE 37.91, -0.42, -1.1%) and Merck (MRK 81.18, -2.80, -3.3%) declined after reporting earnings.In other earnings news, shares of Caterpillar (CAT 115.46, +0.26, +0.2%), 3M (MMM 157.61, +3.96, +2.6%), and PepsiCo (PEP 136.32, +1.4%) finished higher, even after the companies withdrew full-year guidance, while shares of UPS (UPS 96.43, -6.12, -6.0%) faltered after the company missed profit estimates.U.S. Treasuries reclaimed most of yesterday's losses, driving yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined three basis points to 0.20%, and the 10-yr yield declined five basis points to 0.61%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 99.88. WTI crude declined 4.6%, or $0.60, to $12.37/bbl, although it was down as much as 22% at one point during the session.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data:The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for April plunged to 86.9 (Briefing.com consensus 86.5) from a downwardly revised 118.8 (from 120.0) for March. The April reading is the lowest since June 2014.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers, while thinking positively about things reopening again, are still less optimistic about their financial prospects, which could be a headwind for spending activity during the recovery phase.The advance goods trade deficit totaled $64.2 bln in March after a $59.9 bln deficit in February. Advance retail inventories declined 1.3% in March after decreasing 0.3% in February. Advance wholesale inventories decreased 1.0% in March after decreasing 0.7% in February.The S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for February increased 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.7%).Looking ahead, investors will receive the advance estimate for Q1 GDP, Pending Home Sales for March, and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite -4.1% YTDS&P 500 -11.4% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -15.6% YTDRussell 2000 -22.0% YTD16:20CHRW C.H.

Our Braun, Vicks, PUR and Honeywell products are supporting consumer health at a time of extreme need, and our OXO products are providing convenience, comfort and solutions as families spend unprecedented amounts of time at home. We are working around the clock to meet as much of the ongoing demand for thermometers, humidifiers, air purifiers and water purifiers as possible. We are also working with suppliers and retailers to provide consumers with OXO kitchen, cleaning and storage products, as well as volumizers in Beauty, where demand is high in channels that are open. While encouraging, we do expect to see a net adverse impact to our results for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2021. Although still very early, we are making plans to continue selectively investing in the key Phase II initiatives once the economic situation allows. With our diversified portfolio of leading, trusted brands, a strong balance sheet with low net leverage, and a corporate culture driven to rise to the challenge, we believe Helen of Troy is well positioned to navigate the current unprecedented situation and emerge strong."Due to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and the related business uncertainty, the Company is not providing an Outlook for fiscal 2021 at this time. In order to reduce costs and preserve cash flow, the Company has implemented a number of measures that will remain in place until there is greater certainty, a reopening of retail customer brick and mortar stores and improved consumer demand, which include the following: A graduated salary reduction for all associates, including named executive officers and the other members of the Company's executive leadership team; A reduction in the cash compensation of the Company's Board of Directors; Suspension of merit increases, promotions and new associate hiring until further notice; The furlough of associates in specific areas directly tied to sales volume, with assistance to maintain health insurance coverage, as well as a reduction of external temporary labor and reduced work hours; Reduction or deferral of marketing expense. The Company will lean into brands with strong current demand and reduce investment in other key brands without sacrificing brand awareness; Limited reduction of investment in new product development and launches, in anticipation of more normalized economic activity; Elimination of travel expense in the short term, with a significant reduction planned for the second half of fiscal 2021; and Reduction of consulting fees and capital expenditures for projects that are not critical.16:17MET MetLife increases quarterly common stock dividend to $0.46/share from $0.44/share (35.18 +0.76)16:15TENB Tenable beats by $0.10, beats on revs; guides Q2 EPS above consensus, revs below consensus (24.70 -0.12)Reports Q1 (Mar) loss of $0.09 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.10 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.19); revenues rose 27.8% year/year to $102.6 mln vs the $100.07 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

These charges are primarily cash-based, and are expected to be recognized in the second quarter of 2020. The actions associated with the restructuring plan are expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2020.16:04AKAM Akamai Tech beats by $0.04, beats on revs (101.93 -1.14)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $1.20 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.16 and versus company guidance of $1.13-1.18; revenues rose 8.2% year/year to $764.3 mln vs the $749.75 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus and company guidance of $741-755 mln.16:03MPWR Monolithic Power beats by $0.01, beats on revs; guides Q2 revs above consensus (191.31 -2.56)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.95 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.01 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.94; revenues rose 17.2% year/year to $165.78 mln vs the $161.15 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Non-GAAP (1) gross margin was 55.5% for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, excluding the impact of $0.6 million for stock-based compensation expense and $0.1 million for deferred compensation plan income, compared with 55.6% for the quarter ended March 31, 2019, excluding the impact of $0.5 million for stock-based compensation expense and $0.1 million for the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.Co issues upside guidance for Q2, sees Q2 revs of $167-173 mln vs. $164.01 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.16:03LSCC Lattice Semi beats by $0.01, misses on revs; guides Q2 revs in-line (19.55 +0.02)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.15 per share, $0.01 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.14; revenues fell 0.8% year/year to $97.32 mln vs the $98.29 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Gross margin increased to 59.8% from 58.6% one yr ago.Co issues in-line guidance for Q2, sees Q2 revs of $95 mln to $105 mln vs. $100.88 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Gross margin expected between 59% and 61%.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: April 29, 2020End of Document

Some possible recovery impediments include: 1) the path the virus takes 2) the possibility of damage to the productive capacity of the economy (i.e. workers facing long-term unemployment and unnecessary insolvencies for businesses) and 3) the global dimension of the COVID-19 impact.14:43ECONX Fed Chair Powell says legislators should embrace policies that protect against avoidable insolvenciesAdds such policies will have a hefty price tag but that they would help ensure we come out of this situation with less long term damage.Notes monetary policy position is right where it should be for now to help avoid deflationary spiral.14:39SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Saia (SAIA) gains following upside first quarter results -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersNCLH (15.59 +19.1%): Rises to its highest levels in a month on close to 2x average volume. Stocks representing industries that have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, including co and various cruise line peers, rise amid a rebound in the broader market bolstered by hopes for further economic reopening and the latest results from Gilead Sciences' (GILD) trial of antiviral remdesivir in treating COVID-19.SAIA (101.77 +19.07%): Posted upside Q1 EPS and revs (+8.7% yr/yr to $446.4 mln). Co's operating ratio improved by 170 bps yr/yr; co reported that it saw improved productivity across its operations derived from focus on pricing and mix management. LTL shipments per workday rose +2.3% yr/yr. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, co experienced a downturn in volumes across its network in March following a "strong" start to the month; co responded with cost adjustments. Rises to two-month highs. LSCC (22.29 +14.02%): Topped consensus for Q1 EPS while missing on revs. Gross margin expanded to 59.8% from 58.6% in the prior year quarter, benefiting from actions taken to expand gross margin and profitability; cash flow from operations was $21 mln. Issued in-line guidance for Q2 revs. Price target raised to $27 from $24 at Cowen, which comments positively on co's June quarter guidance as well as co's on-track product roadmap and gross margin progress. Climbs to three-month highs, outpacing gains for the broader semiconductor sector.Mid Cap LosersFRO (9.2 -12.13%): Tanker and oil shipping industry names generally fall in contrast with rebounding oil prices, which may indicate a shift in the demand landscape for oil cargo storage providers. ALKS (14.67 -8.91%): Posted upside results for Q1 on the top and bottom lines. Net sales for VIVITROL grew approx. +14% yr/yr to $78.8 mln; ARISTADA sales rose approx. +68% to $51.0 mln. Owing to the uncertainties and disruptions created in the healthcare system by COVID-19, co is withdrawing its 2020 expectations at this time. COVID-19 has impacted timelines on certain of co's clinical trials. VIR (30.4 -7.08%): Sees volatility alongside various names in the COVID-19 treatment and therapy space, which today processes results from Gilead Sciences' (GILD) Phase 3 SIMPLE trial evaluating antiviral remdesivir in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19.14:38ECONX Fed Chair Powell notes Fed has slowed pace of asset purchases in recent weeks due to improvement in market conditionsSays depth and duration of downturn are significantly uncertain and that severity is dependent on the government's response.Reiterates that Fed is committed to using full range of its policy tools.Stresses that low rates don't help if there isn't a flow through to financial markets and businesses and consumers can't get access to credit.Q&A portion of press conference now beginning.14:33COMDX Energy Settlement PricesJun Crude Oil futures rose $2.85 (23.1%) to $15.19/barrel Jun Natural Gas $0.06 lower (-3.23%) at $1.885/MMBtu Jun RBOB Gasoline settled $0.06 higher (8.24%) at $0.762/gallon Jun Heating oil futures settled $0.07 higher (10.48%) at $0.7853/gallon14:27TSN Tyson Foods 'is now offering $120 million in 'thank you bonuses' for 116,000 U.S. frontline workers and truckers, up from the $60 million announced in early April' (63.46 +0.66)Tyson Foods is also increasing short-term disability coverage to 90% of normal pay until June 30, 2020, for team members who are unable to work due to illness.14:23TALKX Market Briefing: Muted response to FOMC directive as participants wait to hear from PowellThe stock market had already moved off its best levels of the day leading up to the FOMC announcement at 2:00 p.m. ET. The FOMC news didn't change much, partly because the FOMC view didn't change.In a unanimous vote, the target range for the fed funds rate was maintained at 0.00-0.25%. It was noted that the target range is expected to remain there "until [the Fed] is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals."In other words, the target range is going to remain where it is for a long time considering where the unemployment rate is headed with 26 million+ unemployment claims in the last five weeks and assuming it is unlikely to return to its current level (4.4%) anytime soon.The muted response to the directive isn't surprising. Market participants are focused on what Fed Chair Powell says at his press conference, which begins at 2:30 p.m. ET. Most are hoping for additional context on what would motivate the Fed to do more (such as maybe buying stocks?) or encourage it to do less.The Russell 2000 is up 4.9%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 3.3%; the S&P 500 is up 2.6%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 2.3%.14:14MCD McDonald's: Earnings Preview -- We get our first look at how MCD is adapting to the pandemic (188.43 +2.47)McDonald's (MCD) is set to report Q1 results tomorrow before the open with a call to follow at 8:30am ET. The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for Q1 non-GAAP EPS is $1.55 and for revenue it's $4.66 bln. The company has already withdrawn 2020 guidance.MCD breaks down its sales into several segments: US (its largest segment), International Operated Markets (IOM) which is comprised of wholly-owned markets, or countries in which MCD operates restaurants, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Russia, Spain and the UK, and International Developmental Licensed Markets (IDL) which is comprised of the remaining markets in the McDonald's system.Global comps are always a key metric for MCD, although MCD has already disclosed Q1 comps, so this will not be new information. Global comps in Q1 were -3.4%. US comps were +0.1%, IOM comps were -6.9%, IDL comps were -4.3%.This will be our first look at how MCD is adapting to the pandemic as substantially all its US restaurants are operating Drive-thru, Delivery, & Take-away only. However, China has resumed operations in 98% of its restaurants. The good news is that the stock has bounced nicely off its mid-March lows as it's clear investors feel MCD will be able to adapt. It makes sense as most of MCD's restaurants already have drive-thru capabilities which is kind of tailor-made for off-premise dining. Also, a chain like Chipotle (CMG) has been able to do well and it has only a limited number of drive-thru locations. It's focusing more on free delivery. We think with comps already having been reported for Q1, investors will be focusing on the Q2 outlook. We are unlikely to get specific guidance, but it would help to see how comps are performing in April.14:07KPTI Karyopharm Therapeutics presents results from Phase 3 BOSTON study (23.72 -0.38)In addition to the BOSTON abstract, four additional abstracts were selected for presentation during the virtual program, including two poster presentations highlighting updated results from Darzalex (daratumumab) and Kyprolis (carfilzomib) arms of the ongoing Phase 1b/2 STOMP study evaluating XPOVIO in combination with backbone therapies in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The two remaining selected abstracts include a trial-in-progress (TIP) poster describing the ongoing Phase 3 SIENDO study evaluating XPOVIO as a maintenance therapy in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer following one prior platinum-based treatment, and a poster describing molecular predictors of selinexor response in recurrent glioblastoma.14:03MDT Medtronic: FDA grants marketing authorization to CARPEDIEM device for continuous dialysis therapy for use in pediatric patients with certain kidney conditions (100.37 +2.33)The FDA today granted marketing authorization for a new device indicated to provide continuous hemodialysis or hemofiltration therapy to critically ill pediatric patients weighing between 5.5 to 22 pounds. Continuous hemodialysis or hemofiltration therapy -- known as continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) -- involves using a dialysis machine and a special filter, or dialyzer, to continuously clean a patient's blood for an extended period of time, without stopping, instead of the more traditional three times a week therapy session. CRRT is typically performed in intensive care unit settings. The CARPEDIEM System is the first CRRT device intended for a lower weight-specific pediatric patient population 5.5 to 22 pounds who have a sudden or temporary loss of kidney function (acute kidney injury) or have too much water in their bodies because their kidneys are not functioning properly (fluid overload). The FDA granted marketing authorization of the CARPEDIEM System to Medtronic.14:00ECONX Fed statement from April meetingThe Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals.The coronavirus outbreak is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. The virus and the measures taken to protect public health are inducing sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses. Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices are holding down consumer price inflation. The disruptions to economic activity here and abroad have significantly affected financial conditions and have impaired the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. In light of these developments, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information related to public health, as well as global developments and muted inflation pressures, and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, the Federal Reserve will continue to purchase Treasury securities and agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. In addition, the Open Market Desk will continue to offer large-scale overnight and term repurchase agreement operations. The Committee will closely monitor market conditions and is prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate.Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michelle W. Bowman; Lael Brainard; Richard H. Clarida; Patrick Harker; Robert S. Kaplan; Neel Kashkari; Loretta J. Mester; and Randal K. Quarles.13:34COMDX Metals Settlement PricesJun gold settled today's session down $9.40 (0.55%) at $1712.8/oz Jul silver settled today's session $0.01 lower (0.05%) at $15.32/oz Jul copper settled $0.03 higher (1.13%) at $2.372/lb13:23OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:KHC May 31 calls are seeing interest ahead of earnings tomorrow before the open (volume: 2310, open int: 310, implied vol: ~112%, prev day implied vol: 90%).CAKE May 25 calls (volume: 4350, open int: 1280, implied vol: ~100%, prev day implied vol: 85%).

Advertising company reported better-than-expected earnings before Tuesday's open.12:56WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stocks rally on remdesivir news; investors await FedThe S&P 500 has rallied 3.0% today, as a positive remdesivir update feeds into the market's bullish bias and helps dismiss a weak Q1 GDP print. The Nasdaq Composite (+3.6%) and Russell 2000 (+4.9%) pull ahead of the benchmark index, while Dow Jones Industrial Average (+2.6%) follows behind.All 11 S&P 500 sectors are trading higher, led by the energy (+5.9%), communication services (+5.2%), and information technology (+3.9%) sectors. The consumer staples sector is up just 0.3% and is the only sector up less than 1.0%.Gilead Sciences (GILD 83.90, +5.25, +6.7%) provided sentiment a boost this morning when it affirmed that its remdesivir drug met its primary endpoint in an NIAID placebo-controlled study. The official statement has put to rest prior conflicting reports on the potential therapeutic and has supported the market's reopening optimism.Throw in a 30% spike in WTI crude futures ($15.95, +3.60, +29.3%) and bullish reactions to earnings reports from Alphabet (GOOG 1343.92, +110.25, +8.9%), MasterCard (MA 282.13, +17.52, +6.6%), and Boeing (BA 143.68, +12.38, +9.4%), and the market has now nearly forgotten the GDP data.Briefly, the advance estimate for Q1 GDP declined at an annualized rate of 4.8% (Briefing.com consensus -4.3%). Most expect Q2 to be worse, but the market is thinking a revival in economic activity will buoy the Q3 figure. Of course, there's no telling what Q4 would look like, but the market is leaning on the side of optimism.Separately, Starbucks (SBUX 77.64, -1.05, -1.3%), General Electric (GE 6.72, -0.08, -1.1%), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 54.09, -1.42, -2.5%) are bucking the broader trend following their earnings reports.Coming up next in this busy news day is the Fed's policy directive at 2:00 p.m. ET and Fed Chair Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET. U.S. Treasuries are holding steady in the meantime, ignoring the enthusiasm in the stock market. The 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 0.60%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 99.72.Reviewing today's economic data:First quarter GDP declined at an annualized rate of 4.8% (Briefing.com consensus -4.3%) while the GDP Price Deflator was 1.3% (Briefing.com consensus 1.1%). This was the largest decline in GDP since the fourth quarter of 2008.The key takeaway from the report is that it hints at how ugly the Advance Q2 GDP report will be given that shutdown measures in the U.S. didn't start to gain steam until the latter half of March.Pending Home Sales dropped 20.8% in March after increasing a revised 2.3% in February (from +2.4%).The weekly Mortgage Applications Index declined 3.3% following a 0.3% decline in the prior week.12:49SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: GILD (43.13 mln +6.81%), INO (27.17 mln +1.02%)Industrials: GE (110.51 mln -0.74%), LUV (69.84 mln +5.65%), AAL (65.93 mln +12.43%), HTZ (61.27 mln -14.4%), DAL (50.14 mln +11.74%), BA (33.25 mln +9.4%), UAL (30.21 mln +11.57%)Consumer Discretionary: F (70.33 mln +0.41%), CCL (64.78 mln +14.11%), NIO (64.22 mln +12.28%), NCLH (33.06 mln +20.85%)Information Technology: AMD (64.32 mln -2.9%)Financials: SQQQ (38.29 mln -9.62%), BAC (37.93 mln +4.57%)Energy: OXY (32.6 mln +7.05%), OAS (31.79 mln +7.24%), RIG (25.42 mln +12.22%)Consumer Staples: ABEV (27.62 mln +3.05%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: SIEN (2.37x +42.82%)Industrials: LUV (5.09x +5.65%), HTZ (3.59x -14.4%), TGI (2.48x +13.26%)Consumer Discretionary: IRBT (2.12x -3.53%), EAT (2.07x +28.21%)Information Technology: RPD (3.64x -4%), XELA (3.57x +8.85%), CALX (2.71x +13.01%), AKAM (2.34x -5.9%)Energy: MMLP (3.98x -13.68%), LBRT (2.44x +31.2%), BTE (2x +11.54%), NBR (1.87x +13.24%), SM (1.84x +42.33%)Consumer Staples: COTY (2.36x -4.65%), FDP (2.1x -16.08%)12:48SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: SIEN (2.59 +42.82%), TXMD (1.24 +24.91%)Materials: RYAM (1.76 +30.37%)Industrials: MRC (5.82 +30.09%), CMPR (78.22 +23.77%)Consumer Discretionary: CPS (14.29 +31.22%), SAH (24.24 +29.42%), EAT (24.54 +28.21%), CAL (8.04 +27.22%), DIN (47.23 +26.18%), HOME (2.81 +26.03%), LOVE (14.09 +24.54%)Energy: SM (2.69 +42.33%), LBRT (4.71 +31.2%), PVAC (5.79 +31.18%), NR (1.41 +30.09%), MTDR (6.12 +24.14%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: ALKS (14.63 -9.13%), NVAX (18.67 -9.13%), LIVN (52.42 -7.01%), KNSA (19.45 -6.63%), RDUS (15.58 -5.35%), TBIO (13.73 -4.65%), CYH (3.52 -4.48%)Industrials: HTZ (4.28 -14.4%)Information Technology: AKAM (95.91 -5.9%)Financials: SQQQ (11.75 -9.62%)Energy: MMLP (3.03 -13.68%), STNG (22.78 -13.22%), FRO (9.43 -9.98%), DHT (7.47 -7.55%), TK (3.92 -7.01%), EURN (11.27 -5.29%), APY (10.39 -4.68%)Consumer Staples: FDP (29.48 -16.08%), UNFI (10.94 -7.33%), COTY (5.54 -4.65%)12:37QCOM Qualcomm to report this evening (77.93 +2.64)Qualcomm (QCOM 77.93, +2.64, +3.5%) will report its Q2 results after today's closing bell, followed by the management's conference call at 16:45 ET.The Capital IQ consensus expects the chipmaker to report a 2.6% yr/yr increase in EPS to $0.79 on a 3.3% yr/yr increase in revenue to $5.044 bln. The company guided for Q2 EPS between $0.80 and $0.95 and revenue between $4.90 bln and $5.70 when it reported Q1 results on February 5. Shares of QCOM trade about 20% below their high from early January going into the report.

Revs increased +4% sequentially, driven by a +$21 mln increase in the US gas utilities sector. Sales were negatively impacted by decreasing demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Co is taking steps to reduce its operating costs by $80 mln and to reduce its inventory by $140 mln or more relative to 2019 amid demand weakness. Co expects to generate over $200 mln in cash flow from operations in 2020. Energy sector stocks generally outperform amid improvement in oil prices.EAT (24.45 +27.72%): Topped consensus for Q3 EPS and revs. Co commented that its decision in recent years to enhance its off-premise business, including through online ordering and third-party delivery services, has enabled it to conveniently serve a "significantly higher" volume of off-premise customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Comp sales trends for the quarter were generally positive as of March 8, prior to the impact of COVID-19. Commenting on the weeks subsequent to the end of Q3, co noted that off-premise sales have grown each week since the pandemic began and have captured 57% of prior year total restaurant sales during the week ended April 22, adjusted to exclude an acquisition. SAH (23.84 +27.28%): Reported upside Q1 EPS and revs. EchoPark revs increased +33% yr/yr to $331.7 mln. Co's stores, deemed essential, have remained open during the pandemic, but since mid-March, co has experienced a significant decrease yr/yr in overall vehicle sales volumes and service department revs due principally to demand softness connected to COVID-19. Co recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $268.0 mln in the quarter related to its franchised dealerships reporting unit as a result of a decrease in co's market value due to the pandemic. Total liquidity was approx. $418.4 mln as of April 28.Small Cap LosersFDP (29.47 -16.11%): Missed estimates for Q1 EPS. Co's global operations were challenged by COVID-19 in Q1; beginning in January in Asia and ramping further in March, sales were impacted across all of co's markets; near-term demand and sales in co's foodservice distribution channel for higher price point products like pineapples, avocados, and fresh-cut vegetables and fruits, said co, remains "challenging." Adj. gross profit declined yr/yr to $76.5 mln from $95.1 mln, impacted by lower gross profit in co's fresh and value-added and banana business segments. Co expects Q2's results to continue to be pressured. Co also declared an interim cash dividend of $0.05/share, halved from co's prior dividend. The stock drops away from one-month highs.NAT (6.39 -13.01%): Pulls back after spiking yesterday to new three-year highs; at yesterday's close, the stock had netted an advance of circa +82% since mid-April.

The WTI contract for June delivery is up 32% to $16.26/bbl.One missing, and notable, element is a sell-off in the Treasury market. Despite the rally in stocks, the 10-yr note yield is down one basis point at 0.60% ahead of today's FOMC announcement at 2:00 p.m. ET.The Russell 2000 is up 3.7%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 3.1%; the S&P 500 is up 2.5%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 2.2%.11:05SOXX Industry Briefing: Chipmakers (239.62 +7.02)The PHLX Semiconductor Index (+3.2%) represents a pocket of relative strength in the early going of today's session. The high-beta group is now up 3.9% for the week versus a 3.2% week-to-date gain in the S&P 500 (+2.3%) and a 2.6% week-to-date gain in the Nasdaq Composite (+2.9%).Almost every component of the SOX index trades ahead of the broader market, reflecting a belief that chipmakers are well positioned for a recovery from coronavirus-related shutdowns.

AMD (AMD 53.99, -1.52, -2.7%): weakest performer in the group after in-line Q1 results and cautious guidance for Q2.10:44LK Luckin Coffee delays filing of annual report for the year ended December 31, 2019 (stock remains halted)Luckin Coffee is furnishing this current report to indicate its reliance on the order (Release No. 34-88465) issued by the SEC on March 25 providing conditional relief to public companies that are unable to meet a filing deadline as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.The company's business, operating subsidiaries, and employees are located in China, where the Chinese government has imposed nationwide quarantine control and travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 outbreak since January 2020.

The study demonstrated that patients receiving a 10-day treatment course of remdesivir achieved similar improvement in clinical status compared with those taking a 5-day treatment course (Odds Ratio: 0.75 [95% CI 0.51 - 1.12] on Day 14). No new safety signals were identified with remdesivir across either treatment group. Gilead plans to submit the full data for publication in a peer-reviewed journal in the coming weeks.This study sought to determine whether a shorter, 5-day course of remdesivir would achieve similar efficacy results as the 10-day treatment regimen used in multiple ongoing studies of remdesivir. Secondary objectives included rates of adverse events and additional measures of clinical response in both treatment groups. Patients were required to have evidence of pneumonia and reduced oxygen levels that did not require mechanical ventilation at the time of study entry. Clinical improvement was defined as an improvement of two or more points from baseline on a predefined seven-point scale, ranging from hospital discharge to increasing levels of oxygen support to death. Patients achieved clinical recovery if they no longer required oxygen support and medical care or were discharged from the hospital.In this study, the time to clinical improvement for 50% of patients was 10 days in the 5-day treatment group and 11 days in the 10-day treatment group. More than half of patients in both treatment groups were discharged from the hospital by Day 14 (5-day: 60.0%, n=120/200 vs.10-day: 52.3% n=103/197; p=0.14). At Day 14, 64.5% (n=129/200) of patients in the 5-day treatment group and 53.8% (n=106/197) of patients in the 10-day treatment group achieved clinical recovery. Clinical outcomes varied by geography. Outside of Italy, the overall mortality rate at Day 14 was 7% (n=23/320) across both treatment groups, with 64% (n=205/320) of patients experiencing clinical improvement at Day 14 and 61% (n=196/320) of patients discharged from the hospital.In an exploratory analysis, patients in the study who received remdesivir within 10 days of symptom onset had improved outcomes compared with those treated after more than 10 days of symptoms. Pooling data across treatment arms, by Day 14, 62% of patients treated early were able to be discharged from the hospital compared with 49% of patients who were treated late. Remdesivir was generally well-tolerated in both the 5-day and 10-day treatment groups. The most common adverse events occurring in more than 10% of patients in either group were nausea (5-day: 10.0%, n=20/200 vs. 10-day: 8.6%, n=17/197) and acute respiratory failure (5-day: 6.0%, n=12/200 vs. 10-day: 10.7%, n= 21/197). Grade 3 or higher liver enzyme (ALT) elevations occurred in 7.3% (n=28/385) of patients, with 3.0% (n=12/397) of patients discontinuing remdesivir treatment due to elevated liver tests.A second SIMPLE trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir administered intravenously in patients with moderate manifestations of COVID-19, compared with standard of care. The results from the first 600 patients of this study are expected at the end of May.08:35WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +58.40.

The company states, "We understand that the trial has met its primary endpoint and that NIAID will provide detailed information at an upcoming briefing.""Remdesivir is not yet licensed or approved anywhere globally and has not yet been demonstrated to be safe or effective for the treatment of COVID-19. Gilead will share additional remdesivir data from the company's open-label Phase 3 SIMPLE trial in patients with severe COVID-19 disease shortly. This study will provide information on whether a shorter, 5-day duration of therapy may have similar efficacy and safety as the 10-day treatment course evaluated in the NIAID trial and other ongoing trials. Gilead expects data at the end of May from the second SIMPLE study evaluating the 5- and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir in patients with moderate COVID-19 disease.""Gilead will continue to discuss with regulatory authorities the growing data set regarding remdesivir as a potential treatment for COVID-19."08:22BYSI BeyondSpring changes primary endpoint for its Study 106 Phase 3 superiority clinical trial with first-in-class lead asset, Plinabulin, for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia prevention (12.64 )For more than 20 years, the standard primary endpoint for CIN trials has been the duration of severe (Grade 4) neutropenia (DSN). The new primary endpoint will be the rate of the prevention of Grade 4 neutropenia -- a more clinically meaningful and trial-sensitive endpoint -- and will be used to establish superiority of the Plinabulin-G-CSF combination over G-CSF alone.A robust plan will be submitted to the FDA to prospectively validate this new primary endpoint against clinical outcome measures. If successful, Plinabulin could provide clinicians and cancer patients with powerful tools to fight cancer.08:22LM Legg Mason beats by $0.17, beats on revs (49.69 )Reports Q4 (Mar) earnings of $1.02 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.17 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.85; revenues rose 3.9% year/year to $719.6 mln vs the $702.81 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Assets Under Management were $730.8 billion at March 31, 2020 compared with $803.5 billion at December 31, 2019, reflecting $64.2 billion in negative market performance and other, long-term outflows of $12.1 billion, negative foreign exchange of $7.8 billion and realizations of $0.2 billion, partially offset by liquidity inflows of $11.6 billion.08:20SKT Tanger Factory finalizes extension of contract for Steven B.

The patent is directed to methods for inhibiting the enzyme Sphingosine kinase 1 in patients using the company's proprietary compound SK1-I and related Sphingosine kinase 1 inhibitors.In February, Enzo reported the publication of work demonstrating that drug candidate SK1-I decreased Interferon (IFN) signature, pDC activation, and glomerulonephritis, the inflammation of the filtration units of the kidney, in a chemically induced mouse model of lupus. In more detail, that work demonstrated that SK1-I reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines including Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and Interferon-alpha and -beta in the animal model. Significantly, elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6, are reported to be associated with the development of respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. Based on the results obtained in the lupus model and prior work demonstrating the anti-inflammatory activity of SK1-I in animal models of other immune disorders and on isolated human blood cells, the company is exploring avenues for the development of SK1-I as a potential treatment for COVID-19.08:13CMPR Cimpress reports prelim Q3 results; Apollo Global Management (APO) confirms agreement to provide a $300 million secured note to Cimpress (63.20 )Co reports prelim Q3 revs of ~$598 mln vs $608.9 mln S&P Capital IQ two analyst estimate; Adjusted EBITDA of ~$71 mln, a year-over-year decline of 20%.

Much of this can be attributed to the bounce in crude oil, which is up 14% and trading over the $14 area.

AMC's remarks include the following: "Universal stated it only pursued a direct-to-home entertainment release for 'Trolls World Tour' because theaters were closed and Universal was committed to a lucrative toy licensing deal. We had our doubts that this was wholly Universal's motivations [...]. Nonetheless, we accepted this action as an exception to our longstanding business practices in these unprecedented times.""In [the] Wall Street Journal, Jeff Shell is quoted as saying that: 'The results for 'Trolls World Tour' have exceeded our expectations and demonstrated the viability of PVOD [...]. As soon as theaters reopen, we expect to release movies on both formats.' This radical change by Universal to the business model that currently exists between our two companies represents nothing but downside for us and is categorically unacceptable to AMC Entertainment.""Going forward, AMC will not license any Universal movies in any of our 1,000 theatres globally on these terms.""Accordingly, we want to be absolutely clear, so that there is no ambiguity of any kind. AMC believes that with this proposed action to go to the home and theatres simultaneously, Universal is breaking the business model and dealings between our two companies. It assumes that we will meekly accept a reshaped view of how studios and exhibitors should interact, with zero concern on Universal's part as to how its actions affect us. It also presumes that Universal in fact can have its cake and eat it too, that Universal film product can be released to the home and theatres at the same time, without modification to the current economic arrangements between us." "It is disappointing to us, but Jeff's comments as to Universal's unilateral actions and intentions have left us with no choice. Therefore, effectively immediately AMC will no longer play any Universal movies in any of our theatres in the United States, Europe or the Middle East. This policy affects any and all Universal movies per se, goes into effect today and as our theatres reopen, and is not some hollow or ill-considered threat. Incidentally, this policy is not aimed solely at Universal out of pique or to be punitive in any way, it also extends to any movie maker who unilaterally abandons current windowing practices absent good faith negotiations between us, so that they as distributor and we as exhibitor both benefit and neither are hurt from such changes. Currently, with the press comment today, Universal is the only studio contemplating a wholesale change to the status quo. Hence, this immediate communication in response."18:27ERYP ERYTECH Pharma receives FDA Fast Track Designation for eryaspase in second-line pancreatic cancer (8.29 +0.79)The FDA has granted eryaspase Fast Track Designation for the development of a second-line treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

However, given the worldwide constrained availability of many of these products, our backlog has also increased substantially as we were unable to fulfill many of these orders which would have mitigated other softness in the market. As a result, we recorded low double-digit revenue declines during the closing weeks of the quarter which now appear to have stabilized at approximately 20% in April. We anticipate that we will be able to ship a portion of this backlog in the second quarter as visibility into our supply chain and product lead times has improved."17:05SUPN Supernus Pharma to acquire central nervous system portfolio from US WorldMeds for total consideration of $530 mln (19.49 -0.09)Supernus Pharmaceuticals announced that the company entered into a definitive agreement under which Supernus will acquire the central nervous system (CNS) portfolio of US WorldMeds, a privately-held biopharmaceutical company.

The new preclinical program targets MHC class I related proteins A (MICA) and B (MICB) and is supported by an exclusive license from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute to intellectual property covering novel antibody fragments binding MICA/B for iPSC-derived cellular therapeutics. MICA and MICB are stress proteins that are selectively expressed at high levels on many solid tumors."[W]e are pleased that our engineered iPSC-derived CAR-MICA/B NK cells have shown potent anti-tumor activity in preclinical studies," said Scott Wolchko, President and CEO of Fate Therapeutics. "Importantly, since the shedding of MICA/B is a common escape mechanism deployed by many tumors to evade immune cell recognition, we are encouraged that our novel CAR design, which uniquely targets the a3 domain of MICA/B, prevents protein shedding and promotes NK and T cell-mediated tumor immunity."16:52CRSP CRISPR Therapeutics misses by $0.11, misses on revs (52.52 -2.48)Reports Q1 (Mar) loss of $1.15 per share, $0.11 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($1.04); revenues fell 52.1% year/year to $0.16 mln vs the $3.04 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Hilton, chairman and chief executive officer of Meritage Homes. "Though our net earnings for the first quarter more than doubled and every key operating metric showed significant year-over-year growth, we are expecting much weaker results for at least the next couple of quarters due to large parts of the economy being shut down, causing record job losses, fear and uncertainty about the future. Our hearts go out to all those impacted directly and indirectly."...He explained, "With shelter-in-place orders in effect across most of our markets, we are seeing customers either virtually or by appointment in our sales offices and Studio M design centers. Those we see tend to be serious buyers ready to commit to a new home purchase, so while our traffic has understandably decreased, our conversion rates on the traffic we do see have increased."16:33MKSI MKS Instruments beats by $0.30, beats on revs; guides Q2 EPS in-line, revs in-line (97.75 +1.67)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $1.54 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.30 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.24; revenues rose 15.6% year/year to $535.7 mln vs the $508.65 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Vaccine recipients demonstrated strong antibody and T cell immune responses after 2 or 3 doses with 0.6 mg of INO-4700, a DNA vaccine that targets the MERS-CoV Spike (S) glycoprotein, delivered with intradermal CELLECTRA device. The vaccination regimen was well-tolerated with no vaccine-associated severe adverse events.Overall, for those receiving 0.6 mg of INO-4700, 88% demonstrated seroconversion after a 2 dose regimen at 0 and 8 weeks, while for those receiving a 3 dose regimen given at 0, 4 and 12 weeks, 84% seroverted after 2 doses and 100% after 3 doses, as measured by a binding antibody assay against the full-length S protein. Additionally, 92% of the vaccine recipients in both groups displayed the ability to neutralize the virus using a neutralization assay. Robust T cell responses were observed in 60% of vaccine recipients after the 2 dose regimen and 84% of those in the 3 dose group. A single dose of 0.6 mg of INO-4700 intradermal vaccination resulted in 74% binding antibody response rate and 48% neutralization antibody response rate. These results were selected for an oral presentation at the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy (ASGCT) Conference, to be held virtually from May 12-15.INOVIO is planning to advance INO-4700 into a Phase 2 clinical trial in the Middle East with a previously announced funding of $56 mln by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.16:31AMD Advanced Micro reports EPS in-line, revs in-line; guides Q2 revs in-line; guides FY20 revs in-line (55.51 -0.98)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.18 per share, excluding non-recurring items, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.18; revenues rose 40.4% year/year to $1.79 bln vs the $1.79 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus and company guidance of $1.75-1.85 bln.Gross margin 46% versus 41% in prior-year period.

There is significant uncertainty as to the duration of this disruption.As a critical supplier to the global energy infrastructure and an essential business, the company has remained operational with no closures to any facilities. MRC has had four confirmed illnesses reported, and all have recovered. MRC Global has also implemented various safety measures for employees working in the company's facilities and implemented remote working for those whose jobs permit it.

JNPR expects to see sequential volume driven improvements in margin during the June quarter to be offset by certain strategic insertion opportunities in addition to increased logistics and other supply chain-related costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Commentary: "While we are seeing uncertainty in our business due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect to see sequential revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth in Q2. Confidence in our forecast is driven by strong backlog and healthy momentum with our Service Provider and Cloud customers. We believe these factors should help offset increased uncertainty in certain segments of the Enterprise market.

Large-cap technology and health care stocks lagged, while reopening enthusiasm continued to flow into the small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%) and S&P MidCap 400 (+1.0%). The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.4%.The day started with broad gains that lifted the S&P 500 as much as 1.5% shortly after the open, as part of the reopening momentum from Monday. That broad momentum quickly dissipated, presumably due to valuation concerns, but lingered in areas of the market that had underperformed when the shutdown angst was rampant.Some of those included the small-cap and mid-cap stocks, as previously noted, but also the cyclical S&P 500 energy (+2.2%), materials (+2.0%), industrials (+1.8%), and financials (+0.9%) sectors.Conversely, the large-cap stocks that were deemed as relatively safe, and thus outperformed over the past few months, lost some of their appeal today and heavily dragged on the broader market. Those were found in the health care (-2.1%), communication services (-1.9%), and information technology (-1.4%) sectors.The health care space also had some negative catalysts despite the reported progress on the coronavirus front. For instance, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 151.39, -2.90, -1.9%) was downgraded to Neutral from Buy at UBS, while Pfizer (PFE 37.91, -0.42, -1.1%) and Merck (MRK 81.18, -2.80, -3.3%) declined after reporting earnings.In other earnings news, shares of Caterpillar (CAT 115.46, +0.26, +0.2%), 3M (MMM 157.61, +3.96, +2.6%), and PepsiCo (PEP 136.32, +1.4%) finished higher, even after the companies withdrew full-year guidance, while shares of UPS (UPS 96.43, -6.12, -6.0%) faltered after the company missed profit estimates.U.S. Treasuries reclaimed most of yesterday's losses, driving yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined three basis points to 0.20%, and the 10-yr yield declined five basis points to 0.61%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 99.88. WTI crude declined 4.6%, or $0.60, to $12.37/bbl, although it was down as much as 22% at one point during the session.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data:The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for April plunged to 86.9 (Briefing.com consensus 86.5) from a downwardly revised 118.8 (from 120.0) for March. The April reading is the lowest since June 2014.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers, while thinking positively about things reopening again, are still less optimistic about their financial prospects, which could be a headwind for spending activity during the recovery phase.The advance goods trade deficit totaled $64.2 bln in March after a $59.9 bln deficit in February. Advance retail inventories declined 1.3% in March after decreasing 0.3% in February. Advance wholesale inventories decreased 1.0% in March after decreasing 0.7% in February.The S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for February increased 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.7%).Looking ahead, investors will receive the advance estimate for Q1 GDP, Pending Home Sales for March, and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite -4.1% YTDS&P 500 -11.4% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -15.6% YTDRussell 2000 -22.0% YTD16:20CHRW C.H.

Our Braun, Vicks, PUR and Honeywell products are supporting consumer health at a time of extreme need, and our OXO products are providing convenience, comfort and solutions as families spend unprecedented amounts of time at home. We are working around the clock to meet as much of the ongoing demand for thermometers, humidifiers, air purifiers and water purifiers as possible. We are also working with suppliers and retailers to provide consumers with OXO kitchen, cleaning and storage products, as well as volumizers in Beauty, where demand is high in channels that are open. While encouraging, we do expect to see a net adverse impact to our results for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2021. Although still very early, we are making plans to continue selectively investing in the key Phase II initiatives once the economic situation allows. With our diversified portfolio of leading, trusted brands, a strong balance sheet with low net leverage, and a corporate culture driven to rise to the challenge, we believe Helen of Troy is well positioned to navigate the current unprecedented situation and emerge strong."Due to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and the related business uncertainty, the Company is not providing an Outlook for fiscal 2021 at this time. In order to reduce costs and preserve cash flow, the Company has implemented a number of measures that will remain in place until there is greater certainty, a reopening of retail customer brick and mortar stores and improved consumer demand, which include the following: A graduated salary reduction for all associates, including named executive officers and the other members of the Company's executive leadership team; A reduction in the cash compensation of the Company's Board of Directors; Suspension of merit increases, promotions and new associate hiring until further notice; The furlough of associates in specific areas directly tied to sales volume, with assistance to maintain health insurance coverage, as well as a reduction of external temporary labor and reduced work hours; Reduction or deferral of marketing expense. The Company will lean into brands with strong current demand and reduce investment in other key brands without sacrificing brand awareness; Limited reduction of investment in new product development and launches, in anticipation of more normalized economic activity; Elimination of travel expense in the short term, with a significant reduction planned for the second half of fiscal 2021; and Reduction of consulting fees and capital expenditures for projects that are not critical.16:17MET MetLife increases quarterly common stock dividend to $0.46/share from $0.44/share (35.18 +0.76)16:15TENB Tenable beats by $0.10, beats on revs; guides Q2 EPS above consensus, revs below consensus (24.70 -0.12)Reports Q1 (Mar) loss of $0.09 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.10 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.19); revenues rose 27.8% year/year to $102.6 mln vs the $100.07 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

TrendForce Presents Latest Analysis (Updated March 2020) of COVID-19 Pandemic's Impact on Global High-Tech IndustriesBusiness WireMarch 30, 2020 Monday 10:00 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 3003 wordsDateline: TAIPEI, Taiwan BodyAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to accelerate and cause damage to the global economy and consumers' purchasing power, TrendForce has compiled its latest report on the statuses of key electronics component and downstream industries, with data last updated on March 26, 2020. The report provides a deep dive into the pandemic's influences on several high-tech industries.SemiconductorsMost clients of the global IC design companies placed orders ahead of time, with some of the orders having been fulfilled and shipped already. As such, IC design revenue is not expected to decrease by a considerable amount in 1Q20 despite being somewhat affected by the pandemic. The expanding pandemic has, however, lowered device manufacturers' demand for IC design. More specifically, IC designers for smartphones and other consumer electronics have felt the greatest impact. These companies will potentially see the diminished demand reflected in their 2Q20 revenues. As well, the U.S. government has not changed its stance on the entity list policy. Against the twin hindrances of the pandemic and the entity list, the IC design industry is unlikely to return to a state of growth in 2020.Wafer suppliers such as foundries and IDMs are able to maintain their manufacturing operations due to their high degree of industrial automation. In addition, their major expansion plans are projected to take place after making some strategic adjustments. But as the pandemic persists, regions such as Taiwan, South Korea, Europe, the U.S., and Japan are attempting to curb the spread by restricting border entry or adopting telework arrangements. These efforts, along with the health of the European, American, and Japanese supply chains of key equipment and raw materials, will be factors determining foundry operations in the future.With regards to the demand side, foundries are able to maintain their capacity utilization rate by fulfilling orders from 4Q19 and by their clients' restocking demands. In contrast with the IC design or OSAT industries, the foundry industry's revenue in 1Q20 has felt less impact from the pandemic. But the rapid global spread of the pandemic is projected to affect not only the global economy, but also personal and corporate purchasing power, to be potentially reflected in foundry revenue performances from 2Q20 onwards.The packaging and testing, or outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT), industry previously suffered major declines due to the China-U.S. trade war; the pandemic's current effect on the industry thus appears relatively minor in comparison. TrendForce expects OSAT revenue in 1Q20 to trend either flat or upwards YoY, while the industry's performance in 2Q20 and later will depend on client demand.Memory ProductsDespite the apparent slowdown of the pandemic in China, the virus is now rapidly multiplying across major economies, which poses dire, system-wide risks for the global economy. The memory market may take a turn for the worse and go into a slump earlier than expected. Regarding market demand, the pandemic's rapid proliferation will severely diminish consumer purchasing power. Smartphone production in particular will undergo the greatest magnitude of cutbacks, since smartphones account for the greatest share of consumer purchases compared to other memory products. Waning purchasing power will lead to lowered demand for electronic products and subsequently impact the demand for upstream memory products.Given the 13% and 32% YoY growth in DRAM and NAND Flash bit supply for 2020, in addition to the mostly low inventory levels maintained by DRAM and NAND Flash clients in early-2020, TrendForce initially forecasted a probable constant growth for DRAM and NAND Flash prices up to the end of the year. Nevertheless, as structural changes occur in the supply and demand of memory products, DRAM and NAND Flash clients will exhibit weakened purchasing demand, reflecting a similar weakened demand in the end-product markets. There is now a greater likelihood in 2020 for memory product ASP to increase to a lesser degree than previously expected or even undergo a price drop, especially for NAND Flash, since the shortage of NAND Flash memory was not a significant amount.PanelsIn terms of the COVID-19 pandemic's effect on the production of large-size panels, the pandemic has hurt back-end module shipment far more than it did to that of highly-automated front-end manufacturing. With regards to the February shipment performance of TV panels, which are generally shipped in open cell format, the gap between the actual and forecasted shipments was only 9.8%. In comparison, monitor and notebook computer panels were usually shipped out in module formats. Also in February, the gaps between actual and forecasted shipments for monitors and notebook panels were as much as 25.5% and 29.9%, respectively. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic has diminished the shipment of IT panels far more than it did to that of TV panels. As the pandemic has seemingly slowed down in China, panel supply has seen a gradual ramp-up. Actual panel supply is projected to reach above 85% of previously planned levels in March and exceed 90% in April.In terms of yearly shipment, as TV panel prices steadily rebound, manufacturers will become more and more willing to produce TV panels in 2020. However, Korean panel manufacturers are continuing to reduce their production capacities. Thus, TV panel shipment in 2020 is expected to decline by 4% YoY. As IT panel supply gradually recovers, the industry's supply chain (including OEMs) in 2Q20 and 3Q20 is expected to aggressively make up for the shipment gap caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in 1Q20. In 2020, monitor panel shipment and notebook panel shipment are each projected to grow by 3.4% and 0.4% YoY, respectively.CommunicationsIn terms of optical fibers and fiber-optic cables, over 50% of the global R&D and supply is located in Wuhan, China. Products related to optical fibers include optical communication components, optical transceivers, and 5G components. Given that most key component suppliers of 5G base stations are located in Hubei (whose capital is Wuhan), the pandemic's impact on the optical communications industry is likely to have serious repercussions for the development of 5G infrastructure and the rollout of 5G services in 1H20.The construction of 5G base stations places a high demand on the quality and quantity of fiber-optic cables. For instance, the deployment of UDN, or ultra-dense networks, has galvanized a corresponding demand on fiber-optic cables. The 5G transition requires more than double the total of fiber-optic cables used in today's 4G infrastructure. Aside from the sheer quantity of fiber-optic cables required, the transition will also bring about other changes, such as increased bandwidth demand, adoption of flat networks, and network connections between data centers. All of the aforementioned changes will challenge the resilience of the internet backbone.Communications companies such as Fiberhome, YOFC, and HTGD are making a proactive effort at work resumption and manufacturing resumption. However, transportation and logistics remain key aspects of optical communications equipment production. With many interprovincial and intercity roads still blocked and international flights canceled, the industry is seeing greatly reduced logistical capacity and therefore shipment. Should the pandemic manifest uncontained in 2Q20, it will greatly hinder the infrastructure build-out of global 5G networks and data centers. On the other hand, given the pandemic's influence on the global economy, which in turn sees weakened consumer confidence and demand for end-devices, deferred 5G infrastructure construction and constricted smartphone replacement demand will lead to a slowdown in 5G smartphone sales in 2020.LEDLED chip manufacturers did not stop operations across the board during the Lunar New Year; some personnel still remained at the factories, which manufactured small batches. Therefore, their work resumption has been relatively smooth. However, due to concerns about possible shortage of upstream raw materials, especially the sapphire substrate, manufacturers have raised their capacity utilization rate of LED epitaxy process in March to above 70%, so as to increase their inventory in response to the impact of price hikes. In contrast, the work resumption rate of LED chip segment has been relatively low, mainly because the current LED chip inventory level is high, and the demand from clients has not increased significantly. Currently, in addition to the slight increase in prices of a small number of low-end LED chips, the rest of the LED chip prices remain unchanged.The LED packaging industry places a high demand on manpower. Although the Chinese government has issued a request for manufacturing sites to fully resume work, many people in the affected areas are currently unable to return to the factories. Even workers returning from areas unaffected by the pandemic need to be quarantined for a period of time before they may enter production lines, once these people have arrived at the factories. Thus, work resumption rate in March has been sitting at about 50-60%. However, due to the weak demand for end products, LED suppliers have enough inventory to supply market needs, with a few exceptions, which are applications requiring precise specifications.In terms of the peripheral materials, sapphire substrate factories place a high demand on manpower, so they are also facing the issue of work resumption. Thus, the current supply of sapphire substrate is slightly tight. Because long-term sapphire substrate prices have been sluggish, many suppliers hope to take advantage of the tight supply by increasing prices. In terms of chemical gases and liquids, the biggest challenge facing LED manufacturers is the delivery of chemical materials needed for manufacturing. However, transportation problems have been gradually resolved, at the Chinese government's strong insistence on work resumption.PhotovoltaicsThe initial concerns about supply chain disruptions and shortages are gradually subsiding as an increasing number of employees are returning to work in China. The work resumption rate of the overall supply chain has increased from 30% in February to 50% in March, which was well on its way to normalcy. The logistics efficiency has also started to improve. Nevertheless, it has yet to return to normal.Other regional markets, on the other hand, have implemented city- or nationwide shutdown, which will impact the markets with grid-connection deadlines to a certain extent. Some markets, including Taiwan, have announced the extensions of grid connection deadlines. However, the demand that is supposed to emerge in the first half of 2020 will largely arise only in the second half of the year. It is currently estimated that the total demand for the whole year has not changed much. It is estimated to range from 110 to 130 GW.End Products1. TVThe COVID-19 pandemic damaged the TV industry starting from the Chinese market. China began to put cities under lockdown, disallowed some stores to open, postponed work resumption schedules, and limited transportation by land, air, and water from February. These measurements reduced TV set demand in China, and indirectly caused labor and material shortages in the TV supply chain in China. Although the pandemic has seen signs of gradual containment in China in March, its spread is accelerating in Europe and the U.S. Outside of China, more cities or countries are steadily put under lockdown. In addition, the stock market crash in many countries have taken a heavy toll on the financial markets while impairing consumer confidence.The TV industry currently faces pressure on both the production side and demand side. TrendForce has reduced its projection of global TV shipment for 1Q20 to 44.6 million units, down by 8.6% from the pre-COVID-19 prediction of 48.8 million units. A similar drop is expected in 2Q20, from the pre-pandemic forecast of 47.6 million units to 44.1 million units, a 7.3% decrease.Moreover, both UEFA EURO 2020 and 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games have been postponed to 2021, in turn further weakening the demand for TVs. TrendForce has therefore lowered 2020 TV shipment forecast to 205.2 million units, a 5.8% decrease YoY. This figure is also 6.7% lower than TrendForce's pre-pandemic forecast. With the possibility of the pandemic escalating in North America and emerging Asian regions, TrendForce may decrease the TV shipment forecast even further in the future.2. Notebook ComputersDue to the pandemic, the top six notebook OEMs, most of which are based in China, suffered damages to their production capacity in February. Hence, TrendForce has decreased its projected 1Q20 notebook shipment from the pre-pandemic level of 35 million units to 27.9 million units, down by 20.3%. After China saw a stabilization in the spread of the pandemic, OEMs aggressively pursued labor and materials, while ramping up their capacity utilization rate to 70% within one month. Meanwhile, upstream material manufacturers are expected to return to normal supply levels before May.Although demand stemming from educational-use ChromeBook bids and work-from-home commercial notebooks surfaced in late-March, the pandemic began to accelerate in March in Europe and the U.S., markets accounting for more than 50% of notebook sales. The pandemic's blow to consumer confidence is unlikely to be erased in the short-term. Not only is demand sluggish in the short term, the weakened willingness to purchase may persist well into the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays in 2H20. Considering the uncertainty of future demand, TrendForce has reduced its 2020 notebook shipment forecast from pre-pandemic levels of 162.4 million units to 156.7 million units, down by 3.5%.3. SmartphonesWith the global economy being battered by the coronavirus pandemic, the overall demand for consumer electronics is expected to decline sharply as well. Currently, the impact of the pandemic on the smartphone market is mainly on the demand side. Consumers worldwide will most likely defer purchasing new smartphones this year, thereby lengthening the device replacement cycle and pushing down the overall ASP. Furthermore, rising costs across the supply chain (such as labor cost, cost in connection to a change in the exchange rate, etc.) will weaken the profitability of smartphone brands. Dramatic shifts in performances among brands could also lead to a reshuffling of the industry in terms of market share. Considering that the scale of the pandemic continues to grow, the forecast of this year's smartphone production has again been revised. The total worldwide smartphone production volume in 2020 is now projected to reach 1.29 billion units, a drop of 7.8% from 2019. The downward correction is attributed to the recession that follows the pandemic as well as the downgrade in shipments (sell-ins) in Europe and North America, which are now the most hard-hit regions of the world.The current financial crisis that accompanies the pandemic has produced a lot of uncertainties and could surpass the Financial Crisis of 2007-2008 in scale. Hence, the general economic outlook for 2H20 could become even gloomier as the pandemic is not expected to be brought under control in the short term. TrendForce is not discounting the possibility of further contractions in smartphone demand.4. AutomobilesThe pandemic has now caused further damages to the auto industry. Previously, it primarily affected non-China markets by causing material shortages. Case in point, several factories in South Korea, Japan, and Europe halted operations due to a lack of materials. More recently, the pandemic has rapidly spread throughout Europe and North America after work resumption gradually took place in China. The rapid spread of the pandemic has brought about a corresponding spread of material shortages - along with plant shutdowns and similar large-scale impacts - for automobile suppliers globally.As Italy and Spain went into lockdown, other European countries and the U.S. have begun to follow suit, with many auto manufacturers closing factory operations in Europe and North America starting from March 16. Most of these shutdowns are one to two weeks long, during which manufacturers will decide on future developments.Owing to the pandemic's impact and the recent stock market crash triggered by the Russia-Saudi Arabia oil price war, characteristics peculiar to the automobile industry, namely the need for customers to make purchase in person and the high retail price of automobiles, are expected to result in deferred or even eliminated market demand. As such, global auto sales in 1Q20 are expected to decline by 24% YoY. Because many countries other than China are still experiencing peak pandemic activity, their auto markets will likely face considerable impact from the pandemic as well, in turn deferring most of the market demand to 2H20.For further details of this press release, along with the table showing the shipment forecast of various end products, please visit:https://press.trendforce.com/press/20200330-3347.htmlAbout TrendForce ( www.trendforce.com )TrendForce is a global provider of market intelligence on the technology industries.

Chinese City Evicted Scores Of Africans From Their Homes As WHO Accused Taiwan Of Stoking RacismThe Daily CallerApril 10, 2020 Friday 06:37 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: DAILY-CALLER-NEWS-FOUNDATION; worldLength: 677 wordsByline: Andrew Kerr, Investigative Reporter, akerr@dailycallernewsfoundation.orgBodyLink to ImageAs the Chinese-backed head of the World Health Organization accused Taiwan of stoking racism on Wednesday, scores of Africans living in the Chinese city of Guangzhou were being evicted from their homes over claims they were importing coronavirus into the city.“We have no house, no food, no hotel,” an unnamed Nigerian student living in Guangzhou told the BBC on Thursday. “There are up to 100 people still on the streets. People want to go back to our countries.”“I don't know what the problem is with China,” the student said. “Everywhere that Africans live they are pushing us away.”The forced evictions were predicated by online rumors that coronavirus was spreading among Africans living in Guangzhou, which has one of the largest African communities in China, the BBC reported. VIDEO: While the world has adopted various measures to combat #Coronavirus, Chinese authorities are beginning to eject Africans from their homes and hotels over claims that they were importing the virus into the country.           #COVID19           pic.twitter.com/x78SZhhSMO - Sahara Reporters (@SaharaReporters)            April 7, 2020Reacting to the evictions, the All African Association of Guangzhou issued an open letter this week calling on authorities to cease the “inhuman treatment, hatred and outright discrimination of Africans that is currently going on in Guangzhou.”The evictions in Guangzhou also caught the attention of Nigerian Foreign Affairs Minister Geoffrey Onyeama, who tweeted on Wednesday that he would “urgently” engage the Chinese government about the treatment of Nigerian citizens in the country.Onyeama tweeted Thursday that he had invited the Chinese ambassador to Nigeria to communicate his “extreme concern at allegations of maltreatment of Nigerians in Guangzhou,” and request for immediate Chinese government intervention. Invited the Chinese Ambassador to Nigeria, Mr Zhou Pingjian to communicate @NigeriaGov's extreme concern at allegations of maltreatment of Nigerians in Guangzhou,            #China and called for immediate Chinese Govt. intervention. ????????????????           #StayHomeSaveLives           #COVID19           @DigiCommsNG           @NigeriaMFA           pic.twitter.com/OXhbkXoQWf - Geoffrey Onyeama (@GeoffreyOnyeama)            April 9, 2020It's unclear if Onyeama has since met with the Chinese ambassador. The Nigerian embassy in Washington, D.C., did not immediately return a request for comment.The Nigerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement Thursday saying the country would “provide necessary airlift assistance to stranded Nigerian Nationals abroad who require emergency evacuation.” The statement did not address China or Guangzhou directly.The evictions of Africans in Guangzhou began one day before WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who won his post in 2017 with China's backing, said he had been            subjected to racist insults and death threats from Taiwan. (RELATED: Top WHO Official Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus Won Election With China's Help. Now He's Running Interference For China On Coronavirus)“Three months ago, this attack came from Taiwan. We need to be honest. I will be straight today. From Taiwan,” Tedros said Wednesday. “And Taiwan, the Foreign Ministry also, they know the campaign. They didn't disassociate themselves. They even started criticizing me in the middle of all that insult and slur, but I didn't care.”Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen called Tedros's comments “baseless” and demanded an immediate apology.The Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs added in a statement Thursday: “Such slander is irresponsible, and the government of Taiwan demands that the Director-General immediately correct his trumped-up claims, issue a clarification, and apologize to the people of Taiwan.”Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Scott Tipton, R-Colorado, issued the following statement:Congressman Scott Tipton (CO-03) cosponsored legislation to ban the download of the popular TikTok app on government devices. Like many social media apps, TikTok collects large amounts of personal data from users and requires access to contacts, location data, the cameras and the microphone on a user's device. The relationship between TikTok's parent company and China's Communist Party (CCP) has risen red flags for intelligence agencies and Congress. Tipton, who has repeatedly called out the regime's long lists of human rights abuse, intellectual property theft and corruption, released the following statement upon introduction of the bill:* * *"TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, has openly worked with the CCP to distribute propaganda and censor content the regime finds threatening such as the Hong Kong freedom demonstrators--a complete violation of freedoms the regime falsely says it protects. Now, the US intelligence community continues to investigate TikTok amidst reports that the company is transferring sensitive information from US users to the Chinese Government."It is critically important that this app not be allowed on government devices where it can provide an easy avenue for the CCP to spy. This bill is an important effort to keep Chinese intelligence out of American government and protect the national security interests of the American people."The legislation, H.R. 6896, has a total of 29 total bipartisan cosponsors.

Artificial Intelligence in BusinessCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 5, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1227 wordsBodyArtificial Intelligence in BusinessPedro Valencia2020-03-05Reading: 5 minutesArtificial Intelligence (AI) is born as a sci-fi dream of man, which has gradually become a reality; which is based on mathematics, and contrary to what many believe that it was born in 1936 with the British Alan Turing,its true origin dates from 1854 to the mathematician George Boole,who is the first to believe that logical reasoning could be systematized.But beyond history, what is Artificial Intelligence?, I would simply say that it is the ability of a machine to learn and reason like humans. This capability is supported by other technologies that enable intangible storage of information (cloud), access to huge amounts of data (big data), deep learning, processing huge amounts of data (quantum computation), among others.It is normal that we believe that AI is only used in robots or scientific laboratories, but the truth is that we take it every day and we do not realize, for example, our cell phone we unlock it by facial recognition, we talk to an application to that you are looking for an address that we want to reach, we interact by instant messaging with a trade to contract a service or product without knowing that we are responding to a learning algorithm (ChatBot). We also make use of an on-demand video or music service that puts the content of our interest on the screen based on our preferences; but the truth is that AI goes much further than these "simple" uses.For example, the Chinese company Ping An was transformed from a traditional financial and insurance services company into a cloud technology business that provides services for the technology and medical finance sectors, using Artificial, its annual revenue sits above $9.6 billion per year, representing nearly a 34% increase from 2013 to 2018.This is not surprising since according to the "Global AI Survey" published by The McKinsey &Company;, 63% of companies that adopted AI in their areas have achieved a 10% increase in their revenue and 44% in cost reduction.According to the article Artificial Intelligence in the United States government(Nikolas Sicilia),the United States is the leading country in AI for four reasons:1. For American innovation: they use transformative technologies that are improving growing lives and industries, and empower workers.2. AI for American industry: aims to create a national climate where scientists and technologists successfully develop their inventions.3. AI for the American Worker: Is allowing U.S. companies to concentrate resources and higher-value jobs.4. American-valued AI: The AI technologies they develop must also reflect American core values and their devotion to helping people.In this sense, Russia is another country that has also invested in AI in recent years and positions itself as a leader in the field. Unlike the United States, Russia has been able to exploit AI in more specific areas such as business and telephony. One of the projects in Russia is to use AI for driving vehicles on the streets of Moscow, the project is pioneering and is in testing, but its main goal is to reduce road deaths because the software would respect the traffic signs and notdistracting.Vladimir Putin has also called for banks to also participate in technological innovation, mainly in AI applied in algorithms for customer and portfolio prediction. Other examples of AI use in Russia are: robots, robotic pets, machines that function as miners to reach risk yes for people and robots they use to transport objects.Another country that is also making rapid progress in the use of AI is China. The Asian country has pioneered AI in communications and health issues, specifically in facial recognition and robot use. China's government is emphatically on the need to invest large amounts of money in technological innovation and telecommunications.One of the criticisms of the Chinese government in the use of AI is that they use it to control their citizens. In 2019, news was published that the Chinese government was developing smart school uniforms with the aim of controlling student attendance and whereabouts, using facial recognition and a system to detect when the student is out of school without permission or if they try to remove their uniform, the above with a voice alarm that is automatically activated.Another aspect of why China also leads the AI market is that more than 85% of its companies use AI in economic, health and security (national and public) issues. Both AI and information analysis are two fundamental elements for the Chinese government in its technological advancement. Almost the entire country has advanced facial recognition cameras that the government has advocated arguing that it decreases the incidence of criminality by the ability to recognize someone and detect their exact location in just minutes. In addition, Artificial Intelligence has been applied to reduce traffic in several cities classified as chaotic, due to the location of cameras and an efficient system of traffic lights and signals.The United States, Russia and China are the three most developed countries in the use of AI for the amount of money they invest in technological innovation and telecommunications. Many of the countries in Europe want to follow in the footsteps of these three big examples, and recently France and Germany have developed AI strategies for their governments.On the other hand, in Latin America there are high expectations in the use of AI and one of the countries that promises to be a leader in the region is Mexico. It has been mentioned that the country could exploit the use of AI in economic and health issues if it is decided to invest a considerable amount of money in technological innovation, as to date it is still lagging behind in the uses of disruptive technologies.Today medium and large companies have turned their attention to AI and information analysis, some examples of its application in the country are Banco Azteca, which through WhatsApp managed to get about 5 million customers to open new accounts, or Aeromexico that by through its chatbots has managed to serve its customers and increase their sales.As for the government, it is in the health sector that the use of AI can be more promising, since if it is applied in the prediction of conditions, chronic-degenerative diseases such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, etc., the which are the cause of the Mexican state's increased health spending.Recently, the Government of Mexico announced Microsoft's investment of more than $1 billion in the country's technological transformation, with which some of that amount is expected to be invested in technological innovation in AI, Big Data and Cloud, which let's hope they serve to make the use of AI viable and affordable.References:~McKinsey &Company;, "Global AI Survey: AI provides its worth, but few scale impact", (2019).The White House, "Artificial Intelligence for American People".Liu Caiyu, "Chinese schools monitor students activities, targeting truancy with 'intelligent uniforms'", Global Times (2018/12/20)."Russia leads the implementation of artificial intelligence in business", RT (2019/10/07).Category Digital Business Opinion Tags Big Data Chatbot Science and Technology Cloud Computation Quantum Deep Learning Artificial Intelligence Robots Disruptive TechnologyLoad-Date: March 6, 2020End of Document

'WHAT ARE THEY TRYING TO HIDE?' UYGHURS ASK OF CHINA'S MEDIA CURBS IN XINJIANGStates News ServiceMay 2, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1043 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:China's tightening curbs on media and speech freedoms compound the hardships of Uyghurs in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), where authorities stop at nothing to prevent reporting on the close to two million people who have disappeared into internment camps, Uyghur and press advocates said.World Press Freedom Day on May 3 has brought fresh global scrutiny of China's record as a top jailer of journalists and bloggers, its heavy censorship of media, and its extensive cyber surveillance methods. While harsh all across China, these restrictions are often more severe in ethnic regions like the XUAR and Tibet."China's state and privately-owned media are now under the Communist Party's close control while foreign reporters trying to work in China are encountering more and more obstacles in the field," Paris-based Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said."More than 100 journalists and bloggers are currently detained in conditions that pose a threat to their lives," added RSF. The group ranked China 177th out of 180 countries above only Eritrea, Turkmenistan and North Korea in an annual global press freedom index issued last month.These are not abstract numbers to Uyghurs, says the Uyghur Human Rights Project, a Washington-based advocacy group."Reporting on conditions in East Turkistan has long been a red line for the Chinese government," the UHRP said in a statement for World Press Freedom Day."However, conditions are becoming even more challenging," the group said, noting the recent expulsions by China of a group of reports from reporters from the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post."All three of these newspapers have published groundbreaking stories bringing to light critical facts about the crackdown in East Turkistan, including reports on forced labor, the high-tech police state, and the effect of internment camps on the region," the UHRP said, using the Uyghurs' name for the XUAR.'What are they trying to hide?'Since April 2017, authorities in the XUAR are believed to have held up to 1.8 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities accused of harboring "strong religious views" and "politically incorrect" in some 1,300 internment camps throughout the region.As reports of the camp system started to reach a global audience, China began describing the facilities as "boarding schools" that provide vocational training for Uyghurs, discourage radicalization, and help combat terrorism.But reporting by RFA and other media outlets, drawing on testimonies from camp survivors and leaks of official documents, shows that those in the camps are detained against their will and subjected to political indoctrination, rough treatment, poor diets and unhygienic conditions in crowded facilities"The Chinese government has been making it increasingly difficult to report from the region for years now -- and now, it's virtually impossible," UHRP project manager Nicole Morgret told RFA's Uyghur Service."The behavior of the CCP's central and regional authorities is ample evidence that they are conducting a cover-up," said UHRP Executive Director Omer Kanat in a statement on press freedom."As the Chinese government ramps up disinformation efforts in response to reporting on their human rights abuses in East Turkestan, international audiences should ask themselves, 'What are they trying to hide?'"A 2019 report by the Foreign Correspondents Club of China, based on a poll of members' experiences the previous year found that journalists who travelled to the XUAR were followed, physically blocked from moving and pressured to delete their notes and photos."There is a risk that even foreign media will shy away from stories that are perceived as too troublesome, or costly, to tell in China," then FCCC President Hanna Sahlberg said in the report.Biggest jailer of journalists and bloggersAlso in the run up to World Press Freedom Day, Democratic Rep. James McGovern and U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, the Chair and Cochair, of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), sent a letter to President Donald Trump expressing concern about draconian press controls in China."The many restrictions currently in effect limit not only what the world knows about China, but what the Chinese people know about their own government and its policies," they wrote."There are more journalists and bloggers detained in China than anywhere else in the world," the lawmakers said, appealing to Trump to press for the release of jailed writers and intellectuals, including two Uyghurs jailed for life for separatism."A disproportionate number of the journalists imprisoned in China are of a Uyghur background, and that number has only gone up during this most recent crackdown," Morgret of the UHRP told RFAMcGovern and Rubio called for the release of Ilham Tohti, winner of the European Parliament's 2019 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, who was sentenced to life in prison for "separatism" in 2014, despite having worked for decades to foster dialogue between Uyghurs and Han Chinese."My father was just practicing his fundamental rights," Jewher Ilham, Tohti's daughter, told RFA."Without free speech, how is it possible for people to gain understandings between each other? Without a free press, how do people learn the truth?"Gulmira Imin, a Uyghur website administrator, who was jailed for life in 2019 on charges of "splittism, leaking state secrets, and organizing an illegal demonstration" and suffered torture in custody, should also be released, the lawmakers' letter to Trump said.The U.S. State Department's annual human rights report for 2019, released in March, noted the arrest the previous year of the Xinjiang Daily deputy editor-in-chief Ilham Weli, directors Memtimin Obul and Juret Haji of that paper, and Mirkami Ablimit, the head of the Xinjiang Farmer's Daily.The journalists were all arrested for publishing "two-faced" articles in the newspaper's Uyghur language section, the report said, adding the "two-faced" is "adopted by the Chinese authorities to accuse those who allegedly secretly oppose government policies."Reported by Nuriman Abdurashid and Alim Seytoff for RFA's Uyghur Service.

Reps. Buck and Correa Introduce Bipartisan Bill to Ban TikTok on Government DevicesTargeted News ServiceMay 15, 2020 Friday 7:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 736 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Ken Buck, R-Colorado, issued the following news release:Reps. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) and Lou Correa (D-Calif.) introduced bipartisan legislation to ban the Chinese-controlled TikTok app on all United States government devices. The Departments of Defense, State, and Homeland Security have already restricted TikTok because of the cyber and surveillance threats the app presents.The No TikTok on Government Devices Act (H.R. 6896) serves as companion legislation to Sen. Josh Hawley's (R-Mo.) Senate bill introduced in March 2020.Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.)"TikTok is a Chinese owned company and is required by law to share whatever information the Chinese Communist Party wants whenever it wants. Because of this, several federal agencies have already taken steps to restrict the spyware app on government devices. Our bill takes it a step further, banning TikTok on all government-owned devices in the interest of national security. TikTok is a cybersecurity threat to our country. We cannot allow China's parasitic spyware app to collect data from United States government officials," Rep. Ken Buck said.Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.)"TikTok's questionable link to the Chinese government puts our individual privacy and our national security at risk. With the growing sophistication of cyber attacks, we must be proactive to protect our government networks from intrusion. Banning the use of TikTok on government devices is critical to ensure our networks remain secure," Rep. Correa said.Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)"TikTok is owned by a Chinese company that includes Chinese Communist Party members on its board, and it is required by law to share user data with Beijing. The company even admitted it collects user data while their app is running in the background - including the messages people send, pictures they share, their keystrokes and location data, you name it. As many of our federal agencies have already recognized, TikTok is a major security risk to the United States, and it has no place on government devices," Sen. Hawley said.Ranking Member Michael McCaul (R-Texas)"Technology and data are key to the CCP's growing malign efforts. Americans must recognize the inherent risks of using CCP platforms, like TikTok, that jeopardize security and privacy. This legislation will prevent TikTok from being downloaded on government devices. I applaud Congressman Buck for his leadership on this legislation," Rep. McCaul, Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said.Bill text is available here https://buck.house.gov/sites/buck.house.gov/files/wysiwyg_uploaded/No%20TikTok%20on%20Government%20Devices.pdf.BackgroundTikTok has been upfront about the high volume of data it collects from users and shares with the Chinese government. Lawfare summarized the dangers of TikTok's privacy policy for U.S. residents:"We automatically collect certain information from you when you use the Platform, including internet or other network activity information such as your IP address, geolocation-related data (as described below), unique device identifiers, browsing and search history (including content you have viewed in the Platform), and Cookies (as defined below)."It notes further that "[w]e also collect information you share with us from third-party social network providers, and technical and behavioral information about your use of the Platform," such as, potentially, contact lists on other social media services. This type of data collection can especially implicate national security--geolocations or internet search histories of federal employees can reveal quite sensitive information, such as the location of secret government facilities, details about events relevant to the government about which those employees are seeking publicly available information, and personal activities that could potentially be used to build files for blackmail."As Samm Sacks recently wrote, "Nothing is black and white, particularly when it comes to government access to data. Ultimately the Chinese government can compel companies to turn over their data, but this does not always happen." In some cases, companies can and do push back against government requests, as they "have their own commercial interests to protect." There are real risks of government access to data, and this does happen, but it's not as clear-cut in practice as many might assume.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7116642 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: May 19, 2020End of Document

Princeton University-Woodrow Wilson School Reacts: China's Response to COVID-19Targeted News ServiceApril 28, 2020 Tuesday 8:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 641 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: PRINCETON, New Jersey BodyPrinceton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs issued the following news release:As the rest of the world struggles to combat Covid-19, China, where the virus originated in late 2019, appears to have made significant strides to quell the virus. As a result, researchers, health care professionals, and policymakers around the world are looking for the lessons learned from China's experience.We asked faculty expert Rory Truex, assistant professor of politics and public affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, to share his thoughts on China's response to Covid-19, measures the country put in place to contain the virus and avoid a resurgence, the economic impact of the disease on the country, and the future of U.S.-China relations once the pandemic is over.Truex studies comparative politics, focusing on Chinese politics and non-democratic regimes.Q. How has the Covid-19 outbreak affected China's political stability?Truex: In the initial stages of the outbreak, there was a lot of commentary from Western observers that the outbreak spelled the end of the Communist Party of China (CCP) regime. In my research on Chinese policymaking I've argued that the Chinese government tends to come out with rapid, visible policy responses in the face of a crisis to show the population that it is doing something. This strategy, combined with propaganda, censorship, and the repression of critical voices has allowed it to weather a lot of storms over the years, and that's basically what happened with Covid-19 in the initial weeks. There was a lot of outrage online, especially about the death of the whistleblower Dr. Li Wenliang, but nothing that visibly threatened the regime.At this point, I would say that if anything, the Covid-19 outbreak has bolstered the standing of the CCP, the ruling regime. The party's political narrative is on the idea that the authoritarian system produces superior leaders, and that the regime is effective in handling crises, maintaining stability, and promoting economic growth. The party bungled the initial phases of the outbreak but appears to have succeeded in "flattening the curve." The fact that the United States has had arguably a more severe outbreak despite a two-month head start has played right into the party narrative.Conspiracy also plays a role in this. On social media, a popular rumor in China is that Covid-19 was somehow planted by the U.S. government and originated in a U.S. military institution. This conspiracy theory was actually pushed by Chinese diplomat Zhao Lijian, but was later disavowed by China's ambassador Cui Tiankai. So, many Chinese citizens blame the United States for the virus, rather than their own government.Q. How might U.S.-China relations change after this pandemic is over?Truex: I expect the coronavirus will cement the more confrontational turn we've seen in U.S.-China relations in the past five years. President Donald Trump has made "standing up to China" a cornerstone of his presidency. His administration has tried to pin the Covid-19 outbreak on the Chinese government in an effort to deflect blame from his own incompetence -- labeling the virus the "Chinese virus" is the simplest example of this. Because of this, my sense is that many Americans are angry at China, and there is little political room in either party for a more moderate China policy centered on engagement on global issues like health, the environment, terrorism, and so forth. The relationship has deteriorated quite rapidly, and the Covid-19 outbreak has only accelerated that deterioration. I do not expect a Joe Biden administration to be more conciliatory towards China -- his campaign is making efforts to paint him as tough on Beijing.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7097544 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: April 28, 2020End of Document

Trump's surgeon general got dragged for suggesting South Korea is an 'authoritarian nation' while discussing coronavirusBusiness Insider USMarch 16, 2020 Monday 02:17 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 855 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (John Haltiwanger)Highlight: South Korea is a democratic country and a key ally of the US, and has been for decades. It's been widely praised for its response to coronavirus.BodyAlex Brandon/AP• US Surgeon General Jerome Adams on Monday incorrectly suggested South Korea is an "authoritarian nation" while discussing its response to coronavirus.• "We are not an authoritarian nation, so we have to be careful when we say, 'Let's do what China did. Let's do what South Korea did,'" Adams said. • South Korea has been widely applauded over its response to the coronavirus pandemic, and the robust system of testing it set up to quell the spread of the virus. • The US is far behind other countries in testing. • Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.US Surgeon General Jerome Adams on Monday wrongly suggested South Korea is an "authoritarian nation" as he equated it to China during a discussion on the coronavirus pandemic with "Fox & Friends.""We are not an authoritarian nation, so we have to be careful when we say, 'Let's do what China did. Let's do what South Korea did,'" Adams said. "A lot of our public health authority lies in the state and local level, and I have worked for a local health department and a state health department," Adams added. "And what we're seeing now is that these state and local health departments are saying, 'Give us guidance. Give us more cover. We want you to come in and tell us what we should be doing to protect ourselves.'"South Korea is a democratic country and a key ally of the US, and has been for decades. The South Korean government has been widely applauded for its response to the coronavirus pandemic, particularly in terms of the speed and scale of its testing for the virus.Along these lines, Adams - who leads the US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and is one of the federal government's top public health officials - was widely criticized on social media. Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1239540112859561984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw Trump-appointed Surgeon General claims South Korea is an "authoritarian nation" https://t.co/LkgakZpE86Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1239550204396761088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw South Korea isn't an authoritarian nation.

And he applauded South Korea for its success in quelling the spread of the virus, warning that the US does not want to become Italy, which has been hit especially hard by the pandemic. Unlike South Korea, which has set up a robust system of testing for the virus, the US is far behind other countries in testing and getting a clear picture of the scale of the outbreak within its borders. "People, we are where Italy was two weeks ago in terms of our numbers, and we have a choice to make as a nation: Do we want to go the direction of South Korea, and really be aggressive and lower our mortality rates, or do we want to go the direction of Italy?"Adams went on to say, "And when you look at the projections, there's every chance that we could be Italy, but there's every hope that we will be South Korea." The novel coronavirus, which causes the disease COVID-19, originated in Wuhan, China. The Chinese government has faced criticism over efforts to suppress information on the scale of the outbreak, but through extreme measures and restrictions on daily life has seemingly been            successfully in slowing a rise in new infections.Alluding to this, Adams said, "China really leaned into this, and we saw that it was about a couple months that they were able to see cases go down significantly. Same thing in South Korea. We're hopeful that if we lean into this, then maybe in about six to eight weeks, we'll get over the majority of the pain, we will have flattened the curve, and we can start to slowly get back to life as normal."Over 3,800 people have tested positive for the novel coronavirus in the US as of Monday afternoon, and at least 67 people have died from it. Globally, the death toll surpassed            6,500 on Monday, per CNN. NOW WATCH: Extremists turned a frog meme into a hate symbol, but Hong Kong protesters revived it as an emblem of hopeSee Also:• All the times Trump risked exposing himself to coronavirus as his advisers urge people his age to be extremely cautious• Supreme Court postpones oral arguments for the first time in over a century because of coronavirus• Biotech company fighting coronavirus shoots down the idea of reportedly giving US exclusive rights to vaccineLoad-Date: March 16, 2020End of Document

CHINESE LAWYERS SUE U.S. OVER 'CORONAVIRUS COVER-UP'States News ServiceMarch 26, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 973 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Two state-backed Chinese lawyers have brought lawsuits against the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other U.S. departments, alleging that they "covered up" the emergence of the coronavirus.The claims are in line with Beijing's attempt to change the narrative internationally about how the pandemic started.Wuhan lawyer Liang Xuguang filed one lawsuit with the Wuhan Intermediate People's Court against the U.S. Government, CDC, the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Armed Forces Sports Council claiming damages of 200,000 yuan (around U.S.$28,000).The lawsuit alleges that the defendants were responsible for lost wages and emotional harm because they "covered up" the alleged emergence of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 on U.S. soil."From Sept. 2019 to Mar. 2020, the U.S. Government and the CDC knowingly disclosed the wrong public health information in the name of "influenza" when some of the influenza patients were actually infected with some undetermined type of virus (which was later proved to be COVID-19)," the lawsuit, translated by the China Justice Observer (CJO) website, said.The "cover-up" resulted in the global COVID-19 pandemic, in which Wuhan was one of the worst-hit regions, the lawsuit claimed.Lawyers at the China Justice Observer said the case would likely be effectively referred to the Supreme People's Court in Beijing for a ruling, because sovereign states are generally immune from prosecution.Beijing lawyer Chen Yueqin filed a similar lawsuit at the Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court on Tuesday, calling for compensation for reputational damage done by President Donald Trump's use of the phrase "the Chinese virus" to describe the coronavirus.'Too many clowns'Rights lawyer Sui Muqing said the lawsuits are clearly serving the ruling Chinese Communist Party's agenda, regardless of the reasoning behind them."There are too many clowns in the legal profession," Sui said. "I don't know whether [Chen] is acting for someone powerful or simply showing patriotism.""The main aim of the Chinese government in picking these fights is to make the Chinese people believe in them," he said.Two lawsuits have also been filed against the Chinese government in the U.S., but China will enjoy sovereign immunity in that case too, according to an article by the CJO's Zheng Sophia Tang and Zhengxin Huo.News of the lawsuits circulated on social media as Chinese premier Li Keqiang warned people to "seek truth from facts" when discussing the pandemic.Warning of the peril of "chasing patient zero" while ignoring the potential danger of false negative testing, Li called for a "more sustainable mental attitude" when dealing with the coronavirus. His comments were carried on the front page of the ruling Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper, the People's Daily.The authorities have also been blocking social media reports of a "patient zero" alleged to be a U.S. soldier, suggesting Beijing may be moving to distance itself from the conspiracy theories.Social media reports continued to circulate of an alleged patient zero in northern Italy, however.The post cited an Italian doctor, Giuseppe Remuzzi, who later said his comments had been taken out of context.No doubt about WuhanRemuzzi said that the virus had first appeared in Wuhan, "beyond a shadow of a doubt."Chinese health officials reported 67 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Thursday, which they said were all imported from overseas.In worst-hit Wuhan, residents are skeptical that the figure of some 2,500 deaths in the city to date are accurate.Wuhan resident Sun Linan said relatives of those who died are now forming long lines outside funeral homes to collect their loved ones' ashes."It has already begun," Sun said. "There were people lining up in Biandanshan Cemetery yesterday, and a lot of people forming lines today at Hankou Funeral Home."A resident surnamed Zhang confirmed the report, saying families began receiving notification on Monday.Wuhan resident Chen Yaohui told RFA that city officials have been handing out 3,000 yuan in "funeral allowances" to the families of the dead in exchange for their silence."There have been a lot of funerals in the past few days, and the authorities are handing out 3,000 yuan in hush money to families who get their loved ones' remains laid to rest ahead of Qing Ming," he said, in a reference to the traditional grave-tending festival on April 5."It's to stop them keening [a traditional expression of grief]; nobody's allowed to keen after Qing Ming has passed," Chen said.Too many funeralsThe son of deceased COVID-10 patient Hu Aizhen said he had been told to collect his mother's ashes by the local neighborhood committee."The local committee told me they are now handling funerals, but I don't want to do it right now," the man, surnamed Ding, told RFA."There are too many people doing it right now."Wuhan resident Chen Yaohui said nobody in the city believes the official death toll."The official number of deaths was 2,500 people ... but before the epidemic began, the city's crematoriums typically cremated around 220 people a day," he said."But during the epidemic, they transferred cremation workers from around China to Wuhan keep cremate bodies around the clock," he said.A resident surnamed Gao said the city's seven crematoriums should have a capacity of around 2,000 bodies a day if they worked around the clock."Anyone looking at that figure will realize, anyone with any ability to think," Gao said. "What are they talking about 2,805 people?""Seven crematoriums could get through more than that [in a single day]."Reported by Ng Yik-tung, Ho Shan and Sing Man for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Qiao Long for the Mandarin Service.

AUSTRALIAN UNIVERSITY SETS EXPULSION HEARING DATE FOR STUDENT CRITICAL OF CHINA'S COMMUNIST PARTYStates News ServiceMay 5, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1199 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:An Australian student threatened with expulsion after he was highly critical of Beijing has been warned that he could also be removed from the University of Queensland (UQ)'s student senate later this month, as the university authorities set a date for his expulsion hearing."It is almost certain there will be an attempt to remove me from the UQ Senate on May 13th," UQ student Drew Pavlou said via his Twitter account. "I was elected by a majority of students on a platform supporting Hong Kong and opposing the Confucius Institute."Pavlou said that if he is removed, a candidate supportive of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) would likely replace him.Meanwhile, a Change.org petition in Pavlou's support had garnered more than 25,000 signatures by 2.00 p.m. GMT on Tuesday.Pavlou said via Facebook that he also faces an expulsion hearing via video link on May 20.Ali Amin, National Welfare Officer of the National Union of Students (Australia), tweeted: "This is some of the worst attacks on political organizing and freedom of speech I've ever seen from a university and sends a dangerous signal to the student union movement.""If what they've alleged ... is expulsion worthy then the majority of the student union movement would be facing expulsion hearings," Amin said.The university is taking disciplinary action against Pavlou, 20, for harming its reputation, engaging in intimidating and disrespectful conduct, and disrupting the running of the university, among other charges.Pavlou -- who suffers from depression -- faces 11 allegations of misconduct, including activities that the authorities say breached its integrity and harassment policies and the student charter.The authorities have presented as "evidence" of his alleged misconduct social media comments he made regarding the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, in which he claimed to be speaking "on behalf of the university" following his election as student representative to the university senate.Physically attackedPavlou has also reported being physically attacked by Chinese Communist Party supporters during a campus brawl at UQ sparked by Chinese students' opposition to a Hong Kong protest-related activity.According to UQ, Pavlou also allegedly placed a sign on the UQ Confucius Institute -- a cultural organization embedded in campuses around the world and directly staffed and controlled by the Chinese government -- in March, declaring it was a "biohazard" amid the coronavirus epidemic, according to a post he made on Facebook.Pavlou says he is being singled out because of his specific criticisms of UQ's relationship with China, as well as his support for the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement and for the Turkic Uyghur ethnic group, who have been subjected to mass incarceration in "re-education" camps by the CCP.Pavlou also burned a copy of the collected works of Chinese President Xi Jinping outside the Chinese consulate in Brisbane.Xu Jie, the Chinese Consul General in Brisbane, has previously accused Pavlou of engaging in "anti-China separatist activities." China's Global Times tabloid newspaper, published by Communist Party paper the People's Daily, has made similar claims.Xu was awarded the post of visiting professor by UQ vice president Peter Hoj on July 12, 2019, a move which also drew criticism from Pavlou at the time.'Using anything they can'Feng Chongyi, a political researcher at the University of Technology in Sydney, said UQ authorities are likely trying to use anything they can find in the rulebook to expel Pavlou."This is exactly the same way that China suppresses freedom of speech and attacks rights activists," Feng said. "They won't make direct political accusations, but they will accuse them of something inexplicable, like picking quarrels and stirring up trouble."He said the proceedings against Pavlou were likely a direct result of the CCP's United Front strategy to export its model of government and boost Beijing's influence overseas."The principal is very pro-CCP indeed, and the CCP regime has many agents in place overseas," Feng said. "A lot of Australian universities have undertaken joint research programs with [Chinese state-backed institutions] and opened Confucius Institutes when they lack funding.""But the benefit of this increased income comes at the cost of silencing any voices that speak out against the CCP's dictatorial regime," he said.Wu Lebao, an international student at the Australian National University, said there had been cases in recent years of Australian teachers and lecturers being forced to apologize to China after referring to Taiwan as a country -- an idea that is anathema to Beijing -- and sparking angry protests from Chinese students."There have been a lot of these cases in the past few years, where teachers touch on topics sensitive to mainland China in the classroom," Wu said."Fewer and fewer teachers in Australia are willing to touch on these sensitive topics at all now," he said.Public opinion shiftingPublic opinion may be shifting to a warier position, however, as Australian media have repeatedly reported that Chinese companies and individuals under the aegis of the CCP's United Front shipped crucial personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies to China from Australia at the start of the coronavirus pandemic in central China.Australian author and professor of public ethics Clive Hamilton's book, Silent Invasion: China's Influence in Australia, was initially turned down by three publishers citing fears of reprisals from Beijing.Finally published in February 2018, Silent Invasion argues that Australia's elites, and parts of the country's large Chinese-Australian diaspora, have been mobilized by Beijing to gain access to politicians, limit academic freedom, intimidate critics, gather information for Chinese intelligence agencies, and organize protests against Australian government policy.According to Reuters, the Chinese Communist Party was behind a massive cyber attack on the Australian national parliament ahead of May's general election.The agency cited the country's cyber intelligence agency, the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), as saying that Beijing was responsible for the attack on the parliament and the three largest political parties, and that it had originated with the Ministry of State Security in Beijing. The findings were initially kept secret to avoid damaging trade ties.Canberra last year said it would crack down on suspected Chinese Communist Party influencers in the country following the introduction of new laws targeting activities by lobbyists and agents of foreign governments in June 2018, and later denied a passport to a top Chinese businessman.In February 2019, the authorities rejected the citizenship application of a prominent Chinese billionaire and revoked his permanent residency there over concerns about his ties to Beijing.Huang Xiangmo had made donations of nearly U.S. $1.9 million to political parties in Australia over the five years prior to lodging his application.Reported by Gao Feng for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by the Cantonese Service.

Chinese Insurer Sues Korean Firm Over Failed Deal for 15 U.S. Luxury HotelsRealMoneyApril 29, 2020 Wednesday 8:30 AM EDTCopyright 2020 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 984 wordsByline: Alex Frew McMillanHighlight: The global nature of the Covid-19 crisis is clear in a filing in Delaware chancery court, as financing for flashy real estate deals has dried up.BodyYou know people in Asia expect an end to a crisis when they start shopping for property. And that's what's happening in Hong Kong.Reports from online property portals Spacious and squarefoot.com.hk made their way into my inbox here on Wednesday, indicating buyers are showing increased purchasing appetite as prices fall. We've had many days now of zero or near-zero new Covid-19 cases, so it must be time to look at apartment listings.I can vouch for that. I have an apartment tentatively on the market, and this week I got my first call in months from a broker with a potential buyer. I have a history of particularly bad timing for putting properties on the market, by the way. I listed my home for sale one month before Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008. I held out and got the price I wanted when values bounced back in 2009. I'll hold again with this investment property.The bargain hunters are keen to capitalize on distress when owners are forced to sell, and we already are seeing major real estate deals collapse that were struck in pre-virus times.The troubled Chinese insurer Anbang Insurance sued South Korea-based Mirae Asset Global Investments this week in a Delaware state court for reneging on a deal. Mirae agreed last year to pay US$5.8 billion for a portfolio of 15 high-end U.S. hotels, but the Covid-19 crisis has frozen its financing.Anbang's successor, Dajia Insurance, which was formed after the Chinese government seized Anbang, filed suit in the Delaware Court of Chancery on Monday after the deal failed to close.Posh hotels, indeed The properties include the J.W. Marriott Essex House in Manhattan, the Westin St. Francis in San Francisco, the InterContinental hotels in Chicago and Miami, and the Four Seasons in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Anbang acquired them in 2016 in its US$5.5 billion deal to buy Strategic Hotels & Resorts from Blackstone Group  .Anbang had been a "crocodile," one of China's most aggressive purchasers of overseas properties and companies. But the croc bit off more than it could chew. Now the Chinese government is looking to flog off its expensively acquired assets.The Anbang unit is seeking an order for the defendants, which include various Mirae affiliates, to "specifically perform their obligations" in the sale.Mirae paid a 10% deposit on the portfolio of hotels in September but it did not go through with the deal, which was supposed to close on April 17. A Mirae spokesman told Reuters that certain conditions had not been met by Anbang. Mirae also said it is still pursuing the deal and coordinating with the seller.Mirae is suffering from buyer's remorse after a spate of hotel closures caused by the pandemic, according to Bloomberg, which cites sources saying Mirae also has been unable to secure financing on favorable terms. Mirae officials asked for more time to close the deal because the debt financing they required was no longer available.Plenty of room at the inn Occupancy rates plunged to 8.8% in the week of April 11 for U.S. luxury hotels, the hardest-hit segment of the hotel sector, according to market intelligence specialists STR. That compares to overall U.S. hotel occupancy of 66.1% in 2019.Anbang was nationalized in 2018 by the Chinese government after overextending itself and with its chairman jailed for fraud. The government then set up a new company, Dajia Insurance Group, to take over its assets, with an identical structure as Anbang. Dajia means "everyone" in Chinese.Anbang hit the headlines when it bought the Waldorf Astoria in 2014 for US$1.95 billion. It then lodged a massive bid in 2016 to buy Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide for US$15.5 billion. But its flurry of high-profile deals worried Communist Party officials, who started scrutinizing its source of funds. Anbang then withdrew the bid for Starwood, which ultimately was bought by Marriott International  .Chairman Wu Xiaohui started Anbang in 1994 as a regional seller of car insurance. At its peak in 2017 it held 1.97 trillion yuan (US$278 billion) in assets. But its fall was swifter than its rise.Chinese regulators decided that its high-yield "universal life insurance" wealth-management products flouted rules against risky investment products. They also found the company had diverted insurance premiums into dicey investment deals. Wu, whose third marriage was to former paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's granddaughter Deng Zhuorui, was sentenced in 2018 to 18 years in prison for fraud and embezzlement said to total US$12 billion.Deal dollars dry up The potential collapse of the Mirae deal spells trouble for Anbang, which is still paying off the borrowings used to finance its initial 2016 purchase of Strategic Hotels. Anbang is likely desperate to get the hotels off its books, but will struggle to line up an equally deep-pocketed buyer.Lenders in the hospitality sector are largely focused on providing financing for the hotels they have backed to stay in business. Keeping hotel groups afloat is of greater concern than underwriting big-ticket deals.The preferred outcome for both parties may be for them to renegotiate on the price and timing of the deal. Anbang has also run aground in its US$1 billion bid to revamp the Waldorf Astoria and convert it into luxury apartments. The refurbishment has had to stop during New York's lockdown, and the sales office is currently closed.South Korea's economy so far has been far less affected by the coronavirus than you might expect, considering its proximity across the Yellow Sea from China and as site of the first big outbreak of Covid-19 outside China. But its export-oriented companies are braced for slumping sales in the months to come as demand globally dries up.State-owned South Korean banks have offered the country's two main air carriers, Korean Air and Asiana, up to 2.9 trillion won (US$2.4 billion) as a bailout package to protect jobs at the airlines.Load-Date: April 30, 2020End of Document

BEIJING HITS BACK AFTER TRUMP TWEETS ABOUT 'THE CHINESE VIRUS'States News ServiceMarch 17, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 904 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Washington and Beijing escalated their war of words over the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic on Tuesday, with China voicing "strong anger" after repeated comments by U.S. President Donald Trump referring to the pathogen as "the Chinese virus."Trump had said via his Twitter account Tuesday morning that "Some [U.S. states] are being hit hard by the Chinese Virus, some are being hit practically not at all."He had earlier referred to "the Chinese Virus" in a tweet on Monday in which he promised government support to industries affected by the pandemic, including airlines.China, which has been at pains to emphasize that the origins of the coronavirus remain unconfirmed, said it was "strongly indignant" about the phrasing of the U.S. president's tweet."Some politicians in the U.S. associated the coronavirus with China, and smeared China," foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular news briefing in Beijing on Tuesday."China expresses its strong anger and opposition to that. We call on the U.S. to stop finger pointing at China," Geng said, calling on Washington to "immediately stop its unjustified accusations against China."Trump later defended his comments at a news conference."It did come from China, so I think it's very accurate," he said, adding that he used the expression to hit back at China's disinformation campaign blaming the U.S. military for the virus."China was putting out information which was false," he said."I didn't appreciate the fact that China was saying that our military gave it to them. Our military did not give it to anybody."'Racist and xenophobic names'State-run news agency Xinhua weighed in, saying in a commentary that using "racist and xenophobic names to cast blame for the outbreak on other countries can only reveal politicians' irresponsibility and incompetence which will intensify virus fears."The renewed spat came after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke by phone with Chinese Politburo member Yang Jiechi, objecting strongly to attempts by Chinese officials to "shift blame for COVID-19 to the United States.""The Secretary stressed that this is not the time to spread disinformation and outlandish rumors, but rather a time for all nations to come together to fight this common threat," Spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said in a statement.Trump's comments were also criticized inside the U.S. by New York city mayor Bill de Blasio."Our Asian-American communities -- people YOU serve -- are already suffering. They don't need you fueling more bigotry," de Blasio tweeted.Chinese health officials initially said they had traced the newly detected coronavirus to the now-shuttered Huanan Seafood Market in the central city of Wuhan, where the epidemic first emerged in December.But the ruling Chinese Communist Party's propaganda machine has ordered officials to start questioning the narrative that the virus came from China.Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian tweeted last week that "patient zero" in the global pandemic may have come from the United States."It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation," Zhao wrote.'Wuhan virus'Pompeo has meanwhile repeatedly referred to the coronavirus as the "Wuhan virus" in spite of advice from the World Health Organization (WHO) not to stigmatize particular locations.According to Xinhua's account of the phone call between Yang and Pompeo, Yang warned the U.S. that "any scheme to smear China will be doomed to fail.""Some US politicians have frequently slandered China and its anti-epidemic efforts and stigmatised the country, which has enraged the Chinese people," the agency quoted Yang as saying.Beijing has launched an overseas propaganda offensive in recent weeks, questioning whether the coronavirus originated in the country.The diplomatic and media campaign has two main aims: to play down the cover-up of the emerging coronavirus outbreak by party chiefs in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, and to push forward the narrative that the virus may not have originated in China at all, according to an expose published by the Catholic French language newspaper La Croix.Chinese ambassadors around the world have been ordered to publicly question the idea that the coronavirus originated in Wuhan, the paper said.Chinese government censors, usually quick to delete accounts sending out information about the epidemic not previously approved by the ruling party, appear to be turning a blind eye to growing conspiracy theories that the virus originated in the United States and was covered up by the Trump administration.Meanwhile, officials are now putting out the line that the epidemic at home is under control, and that China stands ready to lend a hand to foreign countries more recently hit by the epidemic, suggesting that less authoritarian regimes than its own may not be able to implement the same draconian lockdowns that left tens of millions of Chinese people confined to their homes for nearly two months in a bid to halt the disease's advance.Political analysts have told RFA that the ruling party's Central Propaganda Department is behind a number of recent international statements from Chinese diplomats on the coronavirus.Reported by Fong Tak-ho and Pan Jiaqing for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by the Mandarin Service.

China censored people who spoke out about the coronavirus, but there's reason to believe the country's numbers are still trustworthyBusiness Insider USMarch 24, 2020 Tuesday 06:56 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1743 wordsByline: awoodward@businessinsider.com,  (Aylin Woodward)Highlight: Because China was secretive about SARS and has censored whistleblowers, some still think its coronavirus numbers aren't trustworthy.BodyManuel Balce Ceneta/AP• As the coronavirus has spread around the world, people have looked to data - case counts, death tolls, tallies of people tested - to help predict the outbreak's trajectory, plan responses, and make policy decisions.• Because China was initially secretive during the SARS outbreak and censored some whistleblowers and citizen journalists as the new coronavirus spread, many people have wondered whether to trust the country's numbers.• But here's why China's data may indeed be trustworthy, and how the country's transparency compares to the US's approach.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.As the Grand Princess cruise ship approached the California coast earlier this month, carrying at least 21 passengers with the coronavirus, President Donald Trump said he was hesitant to let them disembark - he said he didn't "need to have the numbers double because of one ship."At the time, the number of coronavirus cases in the US hovered around 300. (In the weeks hence, that number has skyrocketed to more than 53,000.) The irony is that the US' "numbers" of confirmed coronavirus cases have not always been easy to find and track. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website has a coronavirus landing page that should, in theory, give an accurate snapshot of how many cases are in the US, which states or counties those patients are in, and how many tests have been administered.But it doesn't.  The CDC is no longer reporting how many people in the US have been tested for the coronavirus (the statistic has been repeatedly removed and re-added to the landing page). Currently, it says: "State and local public health departments are now testing and publicly reporting their cases. In the event of a discrepancy between CDC cases and cases reported by state and local public health officials, data reported by states should be considered the most up to date."Associated Press/Alex BrandonIn China, by comparison, the National Health Commission (NHC) has been aggregating all of its coronavirus information on its website and releasing predictable, daily updates            since February 3.China still has the highest number of coronavirus cases in the world - about 81,500 - but the number of new cases reported per day has declined significantly. In the past two weeks, the country has reported less the 50 new coronavirus cases each day, suggesting China has gotten its outbreak under control.Many people have not been inclined to trust the data coming out of China throughout this pandemic, given the Chinese Communist Party's track record of censoring whistleblowers and citizen journalists. The country's documented obfuscation and secrecy during the SARS pandemic 18 years ago doesn't help, either - during that outbreak, China delayed informing the World Health Organization for months.  But this time around, there's good evidence that we should be believe China's numbers.China's past (and present) mistakesIn 2002 and 2003, as the SARS coronavirus spread worldwide, China did not report the outbreak to the WHO until four months after the first case. Government officials ordered healthcare workers to obfuscate the state of the outbreak, hiding patients from WHO officials. Mike Cassese/ReutersDuring the current outbreak, at least five people in China have disappeared, gotten arrested, or been silenced after speaking out about the coronavirus. Wuhan police forced Li Wenliang, a 34-year-old doctor who warned his colleagues about the outbreak on December 30, to sign a letter stating he was making "false comments." He died five weeks later from the virus. This censorship, paired with the legacy of China's SARS response, has raised questions about the legitimacy of its coronavirus data. On February 15, a senior administration official told CNBC that the White House does "not have high confidence in the information coming out of China."But Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, told Business Insider that said it's in China's best interest to report accurate numbers during this outbreak. That's what allows officials to respond effectively."Science-based, evidence-based decision-making is certainly not unique to democracy," he said.Huang also wrote in a CFR blog that "the SARS crisis has forced the Chinese leaders to take steps to be more open and transparent in disease reporting and information sharing."Why China's data may be trustworthyHuang said that although the numbers coming out of China for the first few weeks after the earliest cases were reported were "probably not trustworthy," a turning point came on January 20, when president Xi Jinping publicly spoke about the virus and ordered "resolute efforts" to bring the outbreak under control.There are five pieces of evidence that suggest China's coronavirus data has been trustworthy since then. First, Huang said, compare Chinese data to the numbers coming out of South Korea now: South Korea has reported a case fatality rate of less than 1%, which matches fatality rates outside China's Hubei province. According to Liang Wannian, a top Chinese health official, the fatality rate in Hubei was between 3% and 4% because the province's healthcare system was overwhelmed by the            number of cases, and doctors didn't know how to best treat the virus at the start of the outbreak.The Central Hospital of Wuhan via Weibo/ReutersSecond, the Hubei province has been releasing daily case and death numbers online at a predictable time every day throughout the outbreak. China's other provinces have been similarly diligent. Those numbers are all funneled into the National Health Commission's daily coronavirus briefings, which list China's total case counts, the locations of those cases, and the number of suspected cases broken down by province.Third, although China has changed the way it counted cases several times, this was done transparently. On February 13, China's case count seemed to spike - 15,000 new cases were reported in 24 hours. But the Hubei Health Commission publicly announced that it had started including diagnoses made via CT scans of patients' lungs in its case total, rather than just patients with confirmed lab-test results. That change in diagnosis method allowed hospitals to identify the patients and isolate them faster, the commission said, according to            Reuters. Even though it meant the numbers jumped dramatically, China was forthcoming about this change.Fabrice Coffrini / AFP via Getty ImagesFourth, the Chinese CDC and members of the WHO released a comprehensive report on February 28 that detailed the state of the outbreak in China after a nine-day exploration of the situation on the ground. An analysis of some 56,000 cases revealed critical information about what age brackets were at the greatest risk, how patients contracted the virus, and how, when, and where the virus had spread.Fifth, Chinese government and health officials reported the coronavirus outbreak to the WHO within days of the first cluster of cases cropping up in Wuhan. Chinese researchers also quickly mapped the coronavirus' genetic sequence shared it worldwide within weeks of the first case.Lingering questions about coronavirus numbers in the USIn the US, by contrast, it's much harder to find data and information about the outbreak.To start, the CDC divides the number of US cases into two categories: stateside and repatriated cases, which can create confusion about how many sick Americans are actually being quarantined and treated.Elaine Thompson/APSecond, as the number of confirmed US cases started to climb in the last week of February, the CDC did not update case numbers regularly on its site. A state-by-state map was only added March 1, after the number of coronavirus cases quadrupled over 10 days. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease, said on March 2 that those who wanted to know how many cases were in their state should look up "state case counts, which are more up-to-date than CDC counts."Data about how many tests have been done in the US isn't listed on the CDC website, either. The agency's official test count - which had previously been updated daily - was stripped from the site on February 29, re-added the following week, and then taken off again on March 10. It's still missing.Estimates of testing numbers differ depending on which government agency you ask. For example, the CDC reported that 1,707 patients had been tested on March 8, but the day prior, US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn suggested the number was about 5,800, according to CNN (though he said the federal government didn't know how many Americans had been tested).Jim Urquhart/ReutersAccording to the COVID Tracking Project, a test-tracking resource            from two journalists at The Atlantic and the founder of a medical-data startup, 359,000 tests have been run in the US as of Tuesday. They noted, however, that those figures may be incomplete because of different states' policies on reporting negative tests.'China's experience is not replicable' in the USChina has tested hundreds of thousands of people for the coronavirus - the joint Chinese CDC-WHO report revealed that 320,000 tests were performed in the province of Guangdong alone            between January 30 and February 16. Part of China's incentive to test so broadly and report accurate numbers, Huang said, is that it helps structure appropriate policy in a time of crisis and helps show the government is functioning well.Huang says the US' testing numbers shouldn't be compared to China's, however.Thomas Peter/Reuters"China is a totalist state. The government can do everything, and immobilize society easily," he said, adding: "In the US, even though we want to test every case, that is impossible. China's experience is not replicable here, but that doesn't make it ok for the CDC to be making these mistakes."NOW WATCH: Pathologists debunk 13 myths about the coronavirus, including why masks won't helpSee Also:• Coronavirus live updates: Nearly 418,000 have been infected worldwide, 18,600-plus are dead, and the US is the third-worst-hit country• A comprehensive timeline of the new coronavirus pandemic, from China's first COVID-19 case to the present• 'You are not immune or safe:' Many young Americans aren't taking the coronavirus seriously, says the top US infectious disease expertLoad-Date: March 24, 2020End of Document

PORTMAN, CARPER APPLAUD DOJ EFFORTS TO COMBAT CHINESE ESPIONAGE, PROTECT U.S. TELECOM INFRASTRUCTUREStates News ServiceApril 9, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 427 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Ohio Senator Rob Portman:China Telecom Americas, which is owned and controlled by the People's Republic of China, has had a FCC license to provide telecommunication services in the United States since 2002. DOJ's recommendation highlights the substantial and serious national security and law enforcement risks associated with China Telecom Americas' domestic operations, particularly in light of China's intelligence collection and espionage efforts against the United States."As demonstrated in recent investigations by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, China regularly exploits the American education and scientific research sectors to further its national interest," said Senator Portman. "DOJ's recommendation demonstrates that it's the same story with our telecommunications industry. China regularly uses China Telecom Americas' authority to provide telecommunications services in the United States to further its intelligence collection and espionage efforts. This is unacceptable and should not be allowed to continue. I am pleased to see DOJ exercising its oversight responsibilities, and I encourage the FCC to use its enforcement authority to ensure our communications networks are secure for all Americans.""The Chinese government has moved aggressively in recent years to launch cyber-attacks against our businesses and government agencies and get ahead militarily and economically with stolen American research and intellectual property. These activities have left our nation no choice but to act," said Senator Carper. "The Department of Justice's decision to recommend that the FCC revoke a Chinese government-owned telecommunications firm's license to operate in the United States is likely a necessary step in our ongoing efforts to protect our national security against foreign spies and hackers."NOTE : DOJ's recommendation to revoke the license for China Telecom Americas follows a 2019 recommendation made by DOJ and other Executive Branch agencies regarding another Chinese state-owned telecommunications carrier, China Mobile USA. In May 2019, the FCC denied China Mobile USA's application to provide international telecommunications services from the United States, citing national security and law enforcement concerns related to China Mobile USA's ownership and control by the Chinese government. The FCC's May 2019 decision marked the first instance in which Executive Branch agencies recommended that the FCC deny an application on national security and law enforcement grounds.Load-Date: April 9, 2020End of Document

US adds new sanction on Chinese tech giant HuaweiAssociated Press State & LocalMay 16, 2020 Saturday 7:10 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 718 wordsByline: By FRANK BAJAK, Associated PressDateline: BOSTON BodyBOSTON (AP) - The U.S. government has imposed new restrictions on Chinese tech giant Huawei's ability to use American technology, stepping up a conflict with Beijing over industry development and security.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Friday that Washington wants to prevent Huawei from evading sanctions imposed earlier on its use of American technology to design and produce semiconductors abroad."There has been a very highly technical loophole through which Huawei has been able to in effect use U.S. technology," Ross told Fox Business. "We never intended that loophole to be there."Huawei Technologies Ltd., China's first global tech brand and a maker of network equipment and smartphones, is at the center of U.S.-Chinese conflict over Beijing's technology ambitions. American officials say Huawei is a security risk, which the company denies. China's government has accused Washington of misusing security warnings to harm a rising competitor to U.S. technology companies.Under the new rules, foreign semiconductor makers must obtain a U.S. license to ship Huawei-designed semiconductors to the Chinese company that were produced using U.S. technology.The move "looks like a victory for the people who really want to drive the nail, or what they think will be the nail, in Huawei's coffin," said Adam Segal, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.China threatened retaliation against U.S. companies.Chip design and manufacturing equipment used in the world's semiconductor plants is mostly U.S.-made, so the new rule affects foreign producers that sell to Huawei and affiliates including HiSilicon, which makes chips for supercomputers with scientific and military uses. The Commerce Department said foreign foundries would be granted a 120-day grace period for chips already in production.Last year, the Trump administration barred U.S. firms from using Huawei technology or providing technology to the Chinese firm without government approval, deeming it a national security risk. The Commerce Department exempted a narrow list of products and services and has extended that waiver to reduce the impact on U.S. wireless carriers that use Huawei technology. This week, it added another 90 days.Huawei responded by removing U.S. components from its core products. The company reported global sales rose 18% to $121 billion last year despite the restrictions, though it said smartphone sales suffered after it was blocked from preinstalling music, maps and other services provided by U.S.-based Google.The new restrictions are separate from those exemptions, but loopholes have allowed U.S. companies to supply Huawei with chips made outside the U.S.The Commerce Department said Friday the new restrictions would "narrowly and strategically" target Huawei's acquisition of semiconductors that it designs built in overseas foundries that use U.S. software and technology.Kevin Wolf, an attorney at Akin Gump who oversaw export administration at the Commerce Department during the Obama administration, noted the narrow scope of the rules."If a foreign foundry makes a chip based on a Huawei design and U.S. equipment is used to make a chip then it's controlled, but if a chip is not made from a Huawei design then it is not controlled," he said.Huawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But China's official Global Times newspaper threatened countermeasures on Friday. It said Beijing that could include restrictions on U.S. companies including Qualcomm, Cisco and Apple. It also threatened to suspend purchases of Boeing aircraft.Global Times noted that the new rules would block companies such as TSMC, a Taiwainese chip maker, from providing semiconductors to Huawei.TSMC said it was "following the U.S. export rule change closely." The company said the semiconductor supply chain is "extremely complex" and TSMC was working with lawyers to "conduct legal analysis and ensure a comprehensive examination and interpretation of these rules."TSMC announced plans this week to build a chip plant in Arizona."It seems the U.S. is ratcheting up efforts to pinch China's high-tech companies," the Global Times said. It called the move an element of President Donald Trump's reelection strategy. "U.S. suppression has become the No. 1 challenge to China's development."Load-Date: May 17, 2020End of Document

Administration Warns China Is Seeking To Hack COVID-19 ResearchThe FrontrunnerMay 14, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 674 wordsBodyUSA Today (5/13, Johnson, 10.31M) reports that the Administration "warned Wednesday that the Chinese government is seeking to hijack U.S. research aimed at the COVID-19 pandemic and urged organizations to tighten cyber-security defenses." A public caution from the Justice Department "indicated that the FBI had opened an investigation into suspected targeting by hackers linked to the PRC." The DOJ bulletin said, "These actors have been observed attempting to identify and illicitly obtain valuable intellectual property... and public health data related to vaccines, treatments, and testing from networks and personnel affiliated with COVID-19-related research. ... The potential theft of this information jeopardizes the delivery of secure, effective, and efficient treatment options." The Wall Street Journal (5/13, Lubold, Volz, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports that according US officials, Chinese and Iranian hackers have launched cyberattacks against US firms and institutions working on a vaccine. These officials said that some officials have suggested the cyberattacks could be seen by the Trump Administration as a direct attack on US public health and akin to an act of war.CQ Roll Call (5/13, Ratnam, 154K) reports that the FBI and the DHS Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency said Wednesday that "they were probing attempts by Chinese government-aided hackers and others to target U.S. organizations conducting research on vaccines, treatments, and testing related to the COVID-19 pandemic." The FBI and CISA "warned that all U.S. institutions engaged in the work on COVID-19 should assume they're being targeted by foreign hackers looking to take valuable information." The AP (5/13, Fox) says neither agency "released names of any specific institutions that had been targeted. The Department of Justice said institutions that have received media attention for their efforts related to COVID-19...should assume that they would be targeted and should take precautions." The CBS Evening News (5/13, story 8, 1:50, Brennan, 5.3M) reported that "in a statement, Chinese officials said the accusations were without evidence."Richard Engel reported on NBC Nightly News (5/13, story 7, 1:45, Holt, 7.08M), "The UK, where Oxford researchers say they hope to have a vaccine ready by September, is also seeing attempted hacks. I had a rare interview with the head of the cybersecurity division of GCHQ, the British equivalent of the NSA." Ciaran Martin, National Cyber Security Centre CEO: "They are attacking different targets. So the nation's states are moving away from perhaps things like energy companies towards strategic healthcare targets, towards researchers and to COVID vaccines." Engel: "The Trump Administration is singling out China, specifically, by name. You are not going there. You're not saying China, per se." Martin: "The UK and the US share a common picture, a common assessment of the threat."Republicans: House Panel Should Probe Response To Pandemic From China, WHO.Bloomberg (5/13, 4.73M) reports House Republicans "want a new congressional panel created to monitor coronavirus dollars to also investigate 'the actions and inactions' of the World Health Organization [and] China." Bloomberg says that last week, House Republicans "created a China Task Force to investigate the origins of the coronavirus and how the WHO handled reports of the initial outbreak."Poll: 69% Of Americans Blame China For Pandemic.The Washington Free Beacon (5/13, Kakutani, 78K) reports that according to a new YouGov poll commissioned by the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, "more than two-thirds of Americans say that the Chinese government is at least partially to blame for the pandemic." The poll "found that 69 percent of Americans agree that the Chinese government is either 'somewhat' or 'very' responsible for the spread of the coronavirus." In addition, "51 percent of the respondents said China should pay compensation to countries affected by the virus, while only 17 percent opposed such reparations."Load-Date: May 14, 2020End of Document

CHINA: FREE COVID-19 ACTIVISTS, 'CITIZEN JOURNALISTS'States News ServiceApril 27, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 636 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Arbitrary Detentions, 'Disappearances,' for Sharing Coronavirus InformationThe Chinese authorities should immediately and unconditionally release five activists and citizen journalists for publicly reporting on the Covid-19 outbreak, Human Rights Watch said today.The government is arbitrarily detaining three Beijing-based activists, who operated a webpage to collect censored Covid-19 articles and social media posts, and citizen journalists Chen Qiushi and Fang Bin, who were forcibly disappeared in Wuhan in February 2020 for reporting independently on the pandemic."While Beijing is ramping up its global propaganda extolling its 'success' in containing Covid-19, it is also forcibly disappearing those independently reporting on the pandemic," said Yaqiu Wang, China researcher at Human Rights Watch. "So much about the coronavirus in China will never become known because the Chinese government has muzzled those trying to share critical information."On April 19, the Beijing police detained Chen Mei, Cai Wei, and Cai's partner, a woman surnamed Tang. Authorities accused Cai and Tang of "picking quarrels and provoking trouble" and placed them under "residential surveillance in a designated location," a form of enforced disappearance in which police can hold individuals in undisclosed locations for up to six months. Chen's whereabouts or condition are unclear.Cai Wei and Chen Mei, 27, are volunteers for Terminus 2049, a crowd-sourced project that archives materials published on Chinese media outlets and social media platforms that have been removed by censors. Since the Covid-19 outbreak, Cai and Chen posted news articles, interviews, and personal accounts related to the coronavirus. Access to Terminus 2049's page appeared to have been blocked in mainland China after the three were detained.Terminus 2049 is hosted on Github, the world's largest open-source code sharing and publishing site. Github in recent years has become a space where Chinese netizens publish and preserve information that is prohibited on the Chinese internet, as it is not blocked by China's Great Firewall. There are other archives on Github that gather censored coronavirus-related information. The Chinese government briefly blocked Github in 2013, and the site suffered cyberattacks in 2015 that later were traced back to the Chinese state telecom giant China Unicom.Cai and Chen have been active in volunteer groups providing social services, and were members of Liren, a group that provided summer camps and libraries for rural youth. Authorities shut down Liren in 2014, and detained its founder, Li Yingqiang, for eight months in 2019.On February 7, authorities in Wuhan, where Covid-19 was first identified, took into custody lawyer and citizen journalist Chen Qiushi. Chen, 34, had gone to the city to report on the coronavirus situation. Fang Bin, a 47-year-old Wuhan businessman who had been posting videos filming city hospitals, was taken into custody by authorities two days later. The two have not been heard from since and are considered to be forcibly disappeared. Li Zehua, 25, another citizen journalist who had gone to report in Wuhan, reemerged in April after going missing for almost two months. Li said he had been taken by the police to be "quarantined." Under international human rights law, a forced disappearance occurs when government officials take a person into custody and the state refuses to acknowledge the person's fate or whereabouts, placing them outside the protection of the law."The lack of free flow of information about Covid-19 in China has contributed to a global pandemic," Wang said. "Governments around the world should press Beijing to release the wrongfully detained activists and citizen journalists immediately."Load-Date: April 28, 2020End of Document

US: Chinese hackers target virus investigationCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 13, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 493 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- Hackers working for the Chinese government are trying to steal valuable research on vaccines and treatments against coronavirus from U.S. health care, pharmaceutical and research organizations, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security warned Wednesday.China's efforts to target these sectors pose a significant threat to our nation's response to COVID-19," the FBI and the DHS Cyber Security Agency said in a joint statement.Agencies said that "potential theft of this information jeopardizes the delivery of safe, effective and efficient treatment options."The announcement represents an escalation in U.S. efforts to combat Chinese espionage and cyberattacks. It is when President Donald Trump tries to blame the Chinese government for doing no more to prevent the global spread of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 80,000 people in the United States and devastated the economy.The alert does not explain whether the alleged goal of Chinese hackers was to only steal data about treatments for coronavirus that are in development or also interfere with U.S. efforts to create a vaccine, disrupting or disabling computer networks. The alert also does not say whether any hacking attacks have been successful.The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Career for vaccinesCountries and companies are competing to develop vaccines and treatments for coronavirus. Those who succeed are likely to reap a tremendous economic and political advantage."The FBI is investigating the goal and commitment of U.S. organizations conducting COVID-19-related investigations by CYBER actors affiliated with the CPR and non-traditional collectors," according to Wednesday's alert, referring to the People's Republic of China. "It has been observed that these actors are attempting to unlawfully identify and obtain valuable intellectual property (IP) and public health data related to vaccines, network treatments and testing, and COVID-19-related research-affiliated personnel."Agencies said additional technical details about the threat will be released in the coming days.The United States and the United Kingdom jointly announced this month that the two countries were investigating piracy incidents against pharmaceutical companies, medical groups and universities involved in coronavirus-related research.Beyond accusations of piracy, State Department and U.S. Justice officials have accused China of spreading misinformation about the pandemic.For decades, the United States has accused China of extensive economic espionage and theft of intellectual property, including espionage from pharmaceutical companies. This led to a 2015 U.S.-China deal banning such theft for financial gain, which the Trump administration accused China of violating. China has denied that it participates in such practices.Original Note:U.S. Warns That Chinese Hackers Are Targeting Virus Research (1)©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: May 14, 2020End of Document

Continue reading Chinese digital spying is becoming more aggressive, researchers sayIt traced malicious activity to Chinese government contractors.FireEye, a US cybersecurity firm, says that it has seen a concerning spike in activity from what appears to be a Chinese hacking group called APT41. The attacks are being deployed against companies in the US, Canada, the UK and several other counties, which is atypical of Chinese hackers  typical strategy of focusing on a few particular targets. According to FireEye s report, the group is exploiting software flaws in applications and hardware developed by Cisco, Citrix and others to gain access to target companies  networks and download files via FTP, among other strategies. According to the firm, the attacks began on January 20th, dipped during the Chinese New Year celebrations and COVID-19 quarantine measures and are now back at full scale, affecting 75 of FireEye s customers.Cisco and Citrix both told Reuters that they have patched the vulnerabilities that were being exploited by APT41. Citrix is also coordinating with FireEye to find  potential compromises.  Reuters reached out to Dell Technologies  cybersecurity arm, Secureworks, which stated that the company has also seen increased activity from Chinese hackers  over the last few weeks. Chinese government contractors carrying out cyber attacks is nothing new, but the scope of these current initiatives is concerning. Companies in about 20 countries are being targeted, and APT41 is carrying out subsequent attacks frequently:  This activity is one of the most widespread campaigns we have seen from China-nexus espionage actors in recent years,  says FireEye.  This new activity from this group shows how resourceful and how quickly they can leverage newly disclosed vulnerabilities to their advantage.  Whether the attackers are purposely taking advantage of a reduced cybersecurity workforce during the coronavirus pandemic or the timing is just a coincidence remains to be determined.See Campaign:https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-10-equifax-hack-china-justice-department-indictment.htmlContact Information:Marc DeAngelisTags:, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: March 27, 2020End of Document

FIREWALL Internet Cafe Gives Glimpse of Repressive Chinese CensorshipThe Circle: Marist CollegeMarch 3, 2020 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HOME; Pg. 1Length: 619 wordsByline: Raphael Beretta & Tara GuaimanoBodyStudents in the lounge of Fusco Hall got a glimpse of the repressive censorship felt in China on Wednesday night.Joyce Yu-Jean Lee, Assistant Professor of Digital Media, recreated her "FIREWALL Internet Cafe" art installation in pop-up form at Marist. The exhibit's mission is to draw attention to the lack of freedom Chinese web-surfers endure.FIREWALL grants visitors the opportunity to search for content through Google images and Baidu, the most prominent search engine in China, side by side. A chrome plugin allows the language entered in the search bar to be translated directly into Chinese. The juxtaposition of the results one would expect with censored Baidu findings is jarring."Art actually has the power to intimidate authority," Lee said.Lee started the project after taking a group of artists from America to Beijing on an artist residency. After a few years of raising money and developing the technology, the exhibit premiered near Chinatown of New York City in 2016. Since then, it has been shown in Michigan, Norway, Austria, and recently Hong Kong."Art actually has the power to intimidate authority,"- Professor Joyce LeeLee and her team faced pressure from Chinese officials following the opening of FIREWALL. A human rights lawyer who won two cases against the Chinese government for malpractice over the single-child policy was set to speak at a panel Lee was organizing.The panel was focused on how feminists in China were able to use technology as a form of activism. Lee knew she had to be careful in involving this particular lawyer, as she found out about her work through Amnesty International, but she "never thought [this] project would be the tipping point."Members of the Chinese government forced the lawyer to refrain from participating in the panel by threatening her employer. Lee had removed any evidence of this participation from the internet and reached out to those in China that had posted about the event on social media to remove their posts."Authorities, especially authoritarian governments are actively trying to censor [art]. Our project, which was about censorship, is actually actively being censored," Lee said.Lee presented the exhibit at Marist in collaboration with a lecture from Buzzfeed International Correspondent Megha Rajagopalan. The two met at the Oslo Freedom Forum in 2017 and connected over their shared interests in internet freedom and curtailing government oppression.Rajagopalan worked as a journalist in China for six years, and won the Human Rights Press Award in 2018 after shedding light on an internment camp for Uighur Muslims.Rajagopalan found that people were being sent to these camps in the far western region of China for seemingly minor offenses, such as having too many foreign phone numbers or banned apps like WhatsApp on their phones. Inside, innocent people were beaten, sexually abused, and subjected to 24-hour surveillance.Rajagopalan currently covers threats to mass surveillance in the Middle East, at the intersection of human rights and technology."Surveillance and our privacy in digital spaces is something that all of us think a lot about, whether it relates to issues around social media and advertising companies to government surveillance," Rajagopalan said. "I'm hoping to sort of shed some light on how those issues impact not just Americans, but people who live in different parts of World."Marist students were able to become a part of this project from their own campus. If anyone missed the event, they can access an audio recording of the lecture from the library's archive and can interact with FIREWALL at https://firewallcafe.com/. The lecture was presented through Marist's Strategic Initiative Funding .Load-Date: March 4, 2020End of Document

Briefing With Senior State Department Official on PRC's Military-Civil Fusion StrategyTargeted News ServiceMarch 13, 2020 Friday 8:33 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3262 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Department of State issued the following special briefing on March 12 by a senior State Department official on China's military-civil fusion strategy:MODERATOR: Everybody, this is on background, attribution to a senior State Department Official. We're joined by [Senior State Department Official], and [Senior State Department Official] is here to talk about a concept called "military-civilian[1] fusion." So I'll just hand it off to you and let you go ahead.SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Great. Thank you very much. Thank you. Apologies, I'm not going to shake anyone's hands. (Laughter.) I'm practicing social distancing to the extent that we can in this room. So I appreciate everyone who called in. So I will just read out my prepared remarks, and then answer some questions.So I'm here to talk about an issue that has serious ramifications for our National Security Strategy that the People's Republic of China calls "military-civil fusion," or MCF for short. Secretary Pompeo said in January to the Silicon Valley Leadership Council, military-civil fusion is a technical term for a very simple idea. The People's Republic of China is targeting emerging and advanced technologies to develop the most technologically advanced military in the world. Its efforts include outright technology theft, the obfuscation of true intentions in collaborative research and development, and a diversion of technology acquired through civil trade to military programs.PRC's acquiring and diverting foreign technologies, specifically advanced and emerging technologies, and particularly those related to artificial intelligence to incorporate them into its next-generation military capabilities. It is doing so through a strategy that eliminates the barriers between China's defense industrial complex and the civilian economy. It is a strategy that they call military-civil fusion.In practice, this means that private companies and research and academic institutions anywhere in the world that engage in joint R&D with the People's Republic of China are at risk of unwittingly contributing to the development of PRC's military capabilities. China-based partners in joint ventures are required under penalty of law to share useful technologies with the PLA. The Chinese Government is also persuading individuals and entities of multiple nationalities - not just individuals of Chinese citizenship or descent - to participate in its military-civil fusion efforts. It is doing so through a host of incentives and inducements while also often masking the fact that technologies will be diverted to military end-use.The Chinese Communist Party recognizes that the world is on the cusp of a technology revolution, and that AI-enabled technologies will deeply impact the development of future military capabilities. Under MCF, the Chinese Communist Party is determined to be the first to weaponize these technologies, and it is targeting international collaborations to do so.Now, many countries, including the United States, leverage the talents of the civilian sector and academia for military modernization. However, there is a huge difference between our approach and the PRC's approach. The United States and our partners around the world have made commitments to transparency and provided assurances through international agreements and norms that dual-use technologies will not be diverted to military end-use. But with MCF, the PRC flouts these norms and is in fact explicitly working to divert dual-use technology to military end-uses, and often without the knowledge of all the parties involved.A central component of MCF is a diversion of dual-use technology towards military ends. And here at the State Department we are working to address the risks that MCF poses to our national security, and we remain committed to supporting fair and reciprocal trade, the free flow of capital, and a collaborative exchange of ideas through our global research enterprise. We all benefit from open collaboration among our most talented scientists, scholars, and innovators, and Secretary Pompeo has been very clear that any concerns we have are with the CCP, not the Chinese people.That said, openness requires reciprocity, respect, and trust, and military-civil fusion violates that trust and exploits the openness on which our open market economy and academic research depends. These are the challenges that we are grappling with right now, as are many other advanced technology-producing countries around the world.That is why I'm glad to have this opportunity to be here with you today and to talk about MCF and the risk it poses in more detail, and I look forward to your questions.MODERATOR: Matt.QUESTION: Yeah, so you know this is happening, you seem to think it's a threat, but why - so why are you still studying the potential threat, and what are you going to do about it? That's - I guess that's the main thing.SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Yeah. So we've undertaken a lot of actions as a government to do something about it. We have certainly looked at our export controls in more - with a more jaundiced eye towards this. We have expanded our investment screening processes. Cases of IP theft are being prioritized. We are also engaging diplomatically with countries. Again, it's a global economy; it's a global supply chain. And so we have to work with our partners internationally to try to get ahold of this challenge. So we have been engaged diplomatically, both bilaterally and multilaterally as well.QUESTION: There was a recent - I think maybe last week - that the investment board rejected Chinese purchase of something. Is that related to this?SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Are you talking about the CFIUS case?QUESTION: Yeah.SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: I'm not familiar with that particular case; I think there's been a few. But in general, I think that as a government we are now looking at this diversion in a way that we haven't in the past.MODERATOR: Humeyra.QUESTION: Hi. When you say we're also engaging with countries diplomatically, does that mean you're telling some of your allies and you're discouraging them to go into partnerships as such with the Chinese private companies?SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: I think how I would characterize it is, just based on our experience, our eyes are open to what China's doing in a way that our eyes weren't open to before. It was a process of learning for us to get to this point of awareness. And so now we're working with our partners internationally to try to help them open their eyes as well.QUESTION: Who would be the main countries that you're working with on this?SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: We don't really reject any country from working with us. This is part of our regular diplomacy. I'm not going to name any particular countries, but of course producers of advanced technologies are critical.MODERATOR: Yeah, Carol.QUESTION: Why are you bringing this up now, because we're in the midst of this coronavirus crisis with China? Is this part of some grander scheme or strategy? And do you know how many Chinese students are studying at American universities? Are you going to try and get them to cut back even more?SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Thank you for that. The reason we're talking about this now has nothing to do with the coronavirus. This is an issue that, like I said earlier, our eyes have been slow in opening, but now they are and now we're taking action. We are - Secretary Pompeo gave a speech on this topic maybe a month ago, or a month and a half or so, in Silicon Valley. He followed up with a second speech to some - Governors Association. So it is part of our awareness raising. Again, this is subterfuge for practical purposes and we're trying to make people aware.Regarding the question of how many Chinese students are in the United States, I do not know the number off the top of my head. The intent here is not to cut off our interactions with China, whether it's trade or research. That's not what we're trying to do. One, it's a fool's errand to try to do that. Two, we benefit greatly from both our economic exchanges, our business exchanges with China, as well as our research with China. But my responsibility is for national security, and we have to look out for that aspect of it as well, and so that's what we're trying to do.MODERATOR: Okay. Said.QUESTION: Thank you. In your response to Matt's question on retaliatory measures, what can be done about it - could you explain that again? What measures are you taking now to counter this? And is that part of any particular institution in China, like the army or any other governmental institution?SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: So I wouldn't - I would take exception to you characterizing as retaliatory. This is not retaliatory.QUESTION: Okay. I mean countermeasures.SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: This is - these are steps that we are taking to protect or safeguard our national security, our foreign policy interests. Every country has a right to revise and review its export controls and investment screening procedures. So that's what we're doing. Your second question was?QUESTION: My second question: With this military-civil fusion, is it part of, let's say, the Chinese army, part of - which government institution?SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: This is a - this is a strategy that the Chinese, as I understand it, they started in 2009. They elevated it to a national-level strategy under a very high direction in about 2014. And it was - the objective of this - of military-civil fusion strategy is twofold: develop the Chinese military capability at the same time as you develop the Chinese civil sector, high-tech sector. The idea is that you create a way for these two sectors to comingle and to leverage each other's capability.In so doing, the aim is for China to have - I'm trying to make sure I use the right word here - to have maybe dominance of certain high-tech sectors, and they have timeframes to do this. There's a program called China 2025 that everybody should probably know about. It's out in the open; I'm not making any of this up. Chinese military, for their purposes, have a desire to have a very advanced military capability by, I think, 2050 or 2049 is their target date. So they created a system where both sectors feed off of each other. That is a significant concern to us for the reasons I stated. It fundamentally violates the norms of international trade, the assurances that countries supply and provide in terms of where dual-use technology is going to end up.QUESTION: Can you give us, like, a down-to-Earth example of where we see this?SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Yeah, so I'll give you one example, and this is a company called CGNP[2], which stands for Chinese[3] General Nuclear Power Corporation, I believe. This is a company that was indicted - I want to say maybe in 2016 or so - for stealing nuclear-related trade stuff. This same company is currently working on a project that - it's a small modular reactor, and without getting overly technical, in essence it's a nuclear power reactor that you can scale up or down to suit the size or the purpose you need, right. You can scale it way, way, way down and put it, for example, on a floating nuclear power plant in the South China Sea. You could scale it even more down and put it on a submarine. You could scale it up and put it on a land base. So there's many things that you can do with this technology.This was a technology that the Chinese military was working on that they gave the project over to CGNP[4] so that then they could develop it. They are the civilian experts on this, and this company is now going out there looking for international partners to help develop this. So that is one down-to-Earth example of how this works and what the potential national security ramifications and foreign policy concerns would be.Yeah, Michele.QUESTION: Question from the phone?MODERATOR: Michele, and then we'll turn to the phone.QUESTION: Just going back to Carol's question, I wonder if this extra scrutiny over research cooperation with the Chinese is affecting at all U.S.-Chinese cooperation on health issues, like dealing with coronavirus.SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: I - so that's not my remit. I don't do health issues. I would go back to the point that I made earlier, though, that our - again, our intention is not to not have any collaboration or cooperation with the Chinese Government. It's a multifaceted relationship. It's a very complex relationship. Where our interests converge, we are more than willing to work together.QUESTION: So but in biotech and this kind of stuff, those are obviously also --SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Yeah, they're --QUESTION: -- might touch into things that you're focused on.SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: They are dual-use, and again, to your specific point here, if it's a biotech technology, it's a biotech transfer that we have national security concerns with, we're going to try to do something about it.MODERATOR: On the phone.QUESTION: Hey, it's Lara Jakes. So I was wondering if maybe another example of this would be Huawei, and this - because it kind of - from where I'm sitting, it sounds like a veiled warning to allies against using Huawei. And I was wondering, relatedly, if there's - what evidence, if any, is there that Huawei is a branch of the PLA? I know that was something that's been alleged in the past, although I don't think the NSA ever found evidence of it as part of Operation Shotgiant.And I was also wondering if you could speak to Unit 61398 and whether it's been moved out of the military and into the intel channel, and if so, if that's had any impact on what you're seeing. And I'm going to put you guys back on mute so you don't have to listen to my home background noise.SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: So on Huawei and is it a part of the Chinese military - so on their MCF there are two laws in China, a national security law and a national intelligence law. The combination of those laws compel any Chinese person or entity to collaborate with Chinese security and intelligence services. They're compelled by law. They have to do it if the Chinese Government seeks that cooperation. So is there a commander in Huawei and does he have a platoon? No, I don't know that. I don't think they're that type of integrated, but Huawei cannot escape Chinese law, and if the Chinese Government and if their security service ask Huawei to provide them access to data or information, then Huawei is compelled to provide that data and information.And regarding your other question, I don't want to get into it because I'm not exactly sure what it is that that unit does or what you're referring to.QUESTION: That's the unit that was responsible for the OPM hack, I think, and then later, relatedly, to the Marriott and the Equifax hack. And then before I put you back on mute, do you dispute the assumption that some of these issues that you're talking about would relate to Huawei or would serve as kind of a warning to allies against using Huawei? Thanks.SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: I would not dispute that.MODERATOR: Yeah, Nike.QUESTION: And then the OPM unit, since I gave you that clarity?SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Yeah, no. Yeah, that's not in my wheelhouse. That sounds more like a counterintelligence thing and that's not what I do.QUESTION: Got it. Thank you.QUESTION: Thank you for this. Is there any personnel change or rearrangement in U.S. consuls or embassies in China to respond and to counter the dual technology being used by - for Chinese military? Meaning - the reason I ask is because if I'm correct, in past years there was more personnel in charge of the commercial and business ties, to promote bilateral business. Are there now more personnel or diplomats or more employees from the U.S. Intelligence Community working in the embassies and consulates in China to respond to such?SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: So I - I'm not going to comment on Chinese intelligence or American intelligence postures, but I will say that, again, our intent here is not to not do business with China. Our intent is to make sure that sensitive technologies are not diverted to military purposes. And so we're not necessarily changing the amount of personnel, but we are engaged in this military-civil fusion awareness raising, and I would assume that a lot of representatives in China at the embassies are aware of military-civil fusion and are probably accounting for that as they do their engagements.MODERATOR: Next? Yeah, Courtney.QUESTION: Thanks. You talked about the diplomatic engagement with allies to make sure that they are similarly aware of this military-civil fusion issue. What kind of reception are you getting from allies, particularly those high-tech-producing countries you mentioned?SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: So I think I can say that everyone has concerns with this. These are fundamental nation-state concerns - the diversion of advanced technologies to military purposes going to countries that don't necessarily share your same national security and foreign policy objectives. So from that perspective I think a lot of the countries we've engaged have understood what's going on.I would say, not to be repetitive, but it took us a while to fully open our eyes. So I think it would be premature to expect all of our partners to have their eyes just snap open suddenly and know what to do. So it's a process of engagement, awareness raising, followed by more engagement followed by more awareness raising.QUESTION: Is there a - sorry, is there pressure that the U.S. is applying? I think that has been the impression from a lot of allies on the Huawei issue, so for this --SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: So I would - I guess I understand how the Huawei thing is kind of fitting into this. Just keep in mind that Huawei was indicted for racketeering. They have been put on the entity list for evading sanctions. The Huawei issue - just on its own apart from military-civil fusion it's a significant issue, and we're addressing that using tools that we have available. That is slightly different than the broader military-civil fusion challenge.(Chatter.)That is different from the military-civil fusion challenge, which I view as a little bit kind of broader, more strategic, in a sense.MODERATOR: Yeah. One more, anyone? Jennifer.QUESTION: Can you talk about any guidance you've given to research institutions about the threat or if there's been any warning that if they continue with certain projects, they could lose federal funding, for example? Any sort of countermeasures you're taking within the research institute community?SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: I kind of talked just generally about it, not in that much detail, but we have been engaging with research organizations and universities at a pretty extensive clip. We also do this internationally, by the way, as part of our multilateral and bilateral engagements. The - a lot of these emerging and sensitive technologies are being produced at labs, whether they're private labs or whether universities. So it's incumbent, I think, upon governments to reach out to that community as well, and we have been doing that and a lot of our other partners have been as well.MODERATOR: Cool. Thanks.QUESTION: Thank you.SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Thank you, guys.[1] civil[2] CGNPC[3] China[4] CGNPCCopyright Targeted News Servicesnull-7052589 T40-MgEditorLoad-Date: March 13, 2020End of Document

Previous headline: Why new diseases keep appearing in China.”It is not exactly clear why Vox edited the headline. The website did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Vox video, published March 6, detailed how China's communist system encouraged the growth of open wildlife markets, such as one in Wuhan, where the novel coronavirus is believed to have started in mid-November. (RELATED: A Comprehensive Timeline Of The Novel Coronavirus)Farmers at the markets sell a variety of wildlife, including birds, reptiles, bats and exotic animals.WATCH:Link to VideoInfectious disease experts have long noted that China is a hotbed for potential viral outbreaks because of its high population density mixed with its wildlife markets. The SARS pandemic of 2002-2004 is also believed to have originated at a wildlife market - known as a “wet market” - in China's Guangdong province.“I think this is a dangerous practice where it happens,” Dr. Michael Osterholm, a world-renowned epidemiologist said on the Joe Rogan podcast earlier this month.“That's one of the challenges we have China,” he continued. “We know that this is going to happen. It's going to occur.”The coronavirus that came out of Wuhan is believed to have originated in a bat before spreading to a person.Some health experts have accused the Chinese government of lying about how widely coronavirus had spread within the country. Chinese officials did not acknowledge to world health officials that an outbreak was underway until late December, more than five weeks after the outbreak began.The World Health Organization adopted the Chinese government's slant on coronavirus, declaring on Jan. 14 that there was no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of coronavirus.The virus has since spread around the globe, with nearly 330,000 cases of human-to-human transmission registered in the world; 31,000 of those in the U.S.The Chinese government's role in allowing the spread of coronavirus has devolved into a debate over whether it is racist to use the terms “Chinese coronavirus” or “Wuhan virus.” President Donald Trump has sometimes called it the “Chinese virus.”Vox has been among the liberal outlets accusing Trump of racism for noting the geographic origins of the virus.“Trump's new fixation on using a racist name for the coronavirus is dangerous,” reads a March 18 article at the site.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

CONNECTING PACIFIC PODCAST EPISODE 1States News ServiceApril 22, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 3162 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: ANN ARBOR, Mich. BodyThe following information was released by the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor:Hans Anderson: This is connecting Pacific. A podcast from the University of Michigan of personal stories and perspectives about the changing relationship between China and the United States. I'm Hans Anderson.[Music]We spoke to a group of U of M students and faculty from China to hear their perspective and how the recent Hong Kong protest started. They took us back 23 years to Tuesday, July 1st. 1997. Britain had just handed Hong Kong over to China after 156 years of colonial rule. The terms of the handover included the understanding of one country, two systems where for at least 50 years, certain economic and political rights would be preserved in Hong Kong, distinct from the laws and rights granted by the people's Republic of China on the mainland.[Sound]Anderson: Nicole Wu is currently a PhD student at the University of Michigan from Hong Kong. We asked her to share her memory of that day in 1997.Nicole Wu: I was six when that happened. So to be very honest, because I was six, I cannot claim to have remembered things from that day. I do see a lot of footage just from July 1st 1997 as I was growing up. One thing that I could observe as a kid was that in my first year of elementary school. I used to have religious sisters and in my school, because I went to a Catholic school, and then the next year all of them are gone, including my supervisor, the school supervisor, sister Sheila, and I don't know why exactly they, they've left. And I think that's not totally unusual.Back in the 90s of course, of course everyone leaves Hong Kong for their own individual reasons, but then it could have been a bigger part of the migration wave that existed in Hong Kong in the 80s but more so in the 90s so I think it was mostly because of like the Tiananmen incident in 1989 and all the negotiation that surrounded.That period of time in which Hong Kong is supposed to return to China under one country, two systems, and people are having a lot of uncertainty about what two systems mean. Does it mean that we still keep our capitalist way of living? Does it mean that we still keep our limited freedoms that we have at that time?Do people still get to do whatever they do on a daily basis and people get worried and many people left if they could. So my family members have left too.Edgar Chung is another U of M student from Hong Kong, and he shared how people in his family also fled Hong Kong after the handover, fearing that they would lose their rights and their way of life.Edgar Chung: People uncertain about what the future of Hong Kong has and I have friends whose parents have immigrated to the States. I think that my aunt also immigrated because of this.Anderson: Xiaohong Xu is an assistant professor of sociology here at the University of Michigan and he's from mainland China.And we talk with him about what it looked like from that perspective, seeing the handover.Xiaohong Xu: I was in Beijing, I was in my late teens just starting my college. I mean, I was like average late teens, you were more like, you know, interested in finding yourself. And I think that was time I was very skeptical of following official scripts about state fact.So I wasn't really following closely, but of course I was patriotic, but I don't think that following the official line would be a cool thing to do. Right. So I caught a glimpse of the Hanover ceremony on TV, but I don't remember anything like any feeding beyond that. But I have to say that I grew up with a lot of Hong Kong pop culture.So I, at the time, you know, I enjoy the music of Beyond. Steven Chow was like a comedian. I remember that time I really liked Stephen Chow, but all my classmates thought it was not a good idea. Because he is pretty crazy.[Sound]Anderson: After the handover, a lot of Hong Kongers had mixed feelings about this new Chinese identity. Two things happened in 2008 that moved people's sentiment towards a more positive view of being Chinese.Chung: And 2008, Beijing Olympics right, The Hong Kong people are actually very proud of China's achievements.And like many of them identified themselves as Chinese. I think it's like around 40% of people in Hong Kong identify themselves as Chinese not just 10% today. And then you in the same year when there was an earthquake happening in China. The public of Hong Kong, they raised like a 1.7 billion us dollars to help with the disaster.So the identification of being a Chinese and also very strong, and also I think like back in 2008 many Hong Kongers actually agreed that Hong Kong is a part of China. My country is China. We came from China. I am a Chinese.Anderson: In 2012 Hong Kongers saw some developments in mainland China.That made them feel a little more hesitant about being Chinese, which many people would say led them to the protests that we saw in 2019.Chung: We have a couple of events that eventually changed the cultural identity of Hong Kongers. For example, you know, in 2012, the Hong Kong Education Bureau proposed the moral and national education curriculum for grade school, middle school, and high school. So that curriculum is basically like propaganda for Chinese communist party. So people back then didn't really like that because Hong Kong was supposed to enjoy all sorts of freedom and free of censorship.They didn't really like the idea of the Chinese government implementing this curriculum into our school system.Anderson: In 2014 Hong Kong citizens felt further betrayed by mainland China. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress issued a legal decision saying that, well, Hong Kongers could vote, the party was going to pick the chief executive.Chung: Well, what happened in 2014 was that the Chinese government suddenly announced that you are not actually allowed to vote for your chief executive. Yeah, sure. You can vote for your chief executive, but we, the Chinese government will be choosing the candidates.So that is what triggered the umbrella movement in 2014 and you know, people have been occupying the streets[Sound]Wu: So one of my professors was actually one of the three organizers of this thing, but he did not organize the umbrella movement. He organized the occupy central movement, and at the time I thought that's not how I imagined him to be. Because he's a sociology professor.He's the guy who would go to China all the time to negotiate with Chinese officials. He's the guy who would go to China to talk about NGO, like nongovernmental organization development. So he's always in this position of being a moderate who's open to dialogue and then comes 2010s and then he's like hosting these round tables in the city and talking about how we would occupy central, which is part of the central business district in Hong Kong. And that's how I thought he was like being super radical. And people of course would look back and think that like, that is not radical at all.Anderson: So what happened to him?Wu: He's now in jail. In fact, one of my student's dad was also one of the organizers of this, and I think he's just got out of jail.He's in jail in Hong Kong and he knew that's going to happen to him. And I guess it's like the occupy central slogan, part of the slogan was like you used to love and peace. So like, it's not the type of political campaign that you usually think about. And I think it became umbrella movement because the police responded to the crowds using tear gas, a lot of tear gas. I would say it was one of the first times in Hong Kong history and people responded to that by using umbrellas to block off some of these, like attacks from the police.And that became the umbrella movement. But that was not part of their original plan of what's going to happen in Hong Kong .Anderson: The umbrella movement ended on December 15th, 2014 after 79 days of occupation, 955 people were arrested during the movement. Their aim of democratic reform was frustrated.[Sound]The 2019 protest began his opposition to a bill that would allow extradition to mainland China. Even when the chief executive of Hong Kong suspended the bill for a time, the demands for democracy escalated, almost as though they were picking up where the 2014 protests left off.Wu: Also feel like when I talk to like say like my hairdresser or like just like really random people that like, and their tones.I do feel like they talk about this incident a little bit differently. So for example, back in like say the occupy, but the umbrella movement in 2014 you can imagine it to be like Hong Kong people are demanding something that we don't already have that's promised to us, but we don't already have that.Versus for the extradition bill is like, we already enjoy a good legal system and now you're trying to do something that would destroy it. So it's more like protecting something that you have and people feel more strongly about protecting.Anderson: There's another factor that fueled the rapid escalation of the 2019 protests. We have to look back to June 4th, 1989 the Tiananmen square massacre. The people of Hong Kong commemorate Tiananmen square every year, and last year was the 30th anniversary of the massacre.[Sound]The moderate nonviolent protesters in Hong Kong joined forces with radical militants. We talked to professor Xu about how these opposing ideologies have come together and joined forces.Xu: So one of the most interesting dimensions to understand this is from the relationship between the radicals and the moderates.Typically for scholars who study social movements, that's an important tension that people would observe, often coming down to a strategic choice that they have to make. For example, between Martin Luther King and Black Panthers. This happens to all social movements. After the umbrella movement in 2014, there was a huge spread between the moderates and radicals in terms of strategic choices, and there was a lot of fighting going on. In the years after that by 2019 all of them, the leaders in both wings ended up in jail. And so when the movement against the bill emerged, the two sides had to find a way to coordinate. 2019 movement, start with the initiative with the moderates who had 1 million people demonstrate on the street to stop the bill.That was June 9th. They didn't achieve that goal. The government announced that they're going to push ahead a bill on June 12th. That was the time that they said they'd have the third read of the bill. The morning on that day. Then you had radicals, thousands of young people, as well as some mid age people gathering in front of the parliament having an illegal "picnic" because they know it's illegal, but they had to.They were trying to stop the bill and that led to the confrontation with the police, the police shot tear gases onto them and it was a huge turmoil to the effect that a meeting was suspended. And then later. Two days later, the government said they were going to suspend the bill indefinitely.And that event on the one hand, causes many radicals to be arrested, and those people who aren't the radical they want to escalate the action to sort of exonerate their friends. And for the moderates, they felt they had a big victory because the bill was stopped but was not because of that peaceful death demonstration three days before, but it was because of the violent confrontation. And they feel they owe the radical something and they are also on board with pushing the government to exonerate the radicals who, many of them were arrested during the event. So that was the moment that sealed the solidarity between the two sides.Wu: According to a recent public opinion survey post by the Chinese University of Hong Kong, we actually do see a clear consensus and what people want, so wanted to demand that nearly 70% of people think that the Hong Kong police force should be restructured.Close to three quarters of people think that the chief executive Carrie Lam should step down.Anderson: Well, why didn't China just send tanks into Hong Kong like they did in Tiananmen square.Chung: Hong Kong was actually a very special place economically in terms of trading with China. So because Hong Kong enjoys judicial independence and also all sorts of different freedom, a lot of countries are willing to trade with Hong Kong.And it's also because Hong Kong is so close to (mainland) China, a lot of Chinese businessmen and actually doing business through Hong Kong to the rest of the world. This is like I suppose in mainland China because that's like the opposite case because if they don't have a clear judicial system, so people are just hesitant to do business through mainland China.So this is the reason why China, you know, as mainland China is trying to keep Hong Kong the way it is.Anderson: What do people from mainland China think about the Hong Kong protests? Let's hear from professor Xu.Xu: I would summarize as confusion, bewilderment, and anger. More sympathetic people would say that they would agree with the goal of the movement, but they would disagree with the way Hong Kong people tried to do so.Particularly they were concerned about some of the violent confrontations without trying to understand why that confrontation came from. But the bigger picture is that many of the mainland Chinese, particularly from a middle-class background, felt a sense of betrayal by Hong Kong people.And that not only is about betrayal of their beloved homeland China, but more importantly is about the betrayal from Hong Kong that they understood to be there. And that was Hong Kong, it was only interested in business, consumerism, shopping and entertainment and avoiding any kind of politics, because that's the direction that China has been through since Tiananmen.And so there was a sense now, suddenly, Hong Kong people have become so politicized and they felt that Hong Kong people have betrayed the Hong Kong that they tried to emulate in the last two decades.Chung: I think Chinese people are kind of wrong about the Hong Kong protesters because in China the news is censored, like all the media, as being what the information that they're given is controlled by the government.And there was a student who said I wasn't able to access any other news source and back in China. And then the only thing that they're saying is that this whole movement in Hong Kong is something that's organized by the US government as a leverage in trade war.They also asked if there's any other new source that I should read or any other sources that you recommend us to look at. We wouldn't actually be having this conversation if it were to happen in China or something.Wu: I agree. Definitely agree with this point that it seems to be a perception in mainland China that protesters are getting paid essentially to destroy Hong Kong and also to seek independence from China, which has, I don't think it's the mainstream rhetoric you hear in Hong Kong at all.I would say that in fact, if you look at and like look at the things that are happening 10 years ago. It's not like people from Hong Kong don't have a sense of belonging to China. It's just that recent events heightened the differences that we feel between Hong Kong and China. So I feel like when people ask me if I'm Chinese, I've never denied that I'm Chinese.But then when people ask me where I'm from. My answer would always be Hong Kong, and that's because I feel like the label Hong Kong conveys additional information. That's just like it'd be asked people, are you like, where are you from in the US if someone's from New York, that person would very probably say that they're from New York.And it's because that label carries important distinctions between you and people, maybe from the rest of the country. But it doesn't mean that you don't think that you are from that country.Anderson: Here at University of Michigan, we have roughly 4,000 Chinese speaking students. Edgar and Nicole share their experience of being from Hong Kong in interacting with Chinese students from the mainland.Chung: I do have some friends from mainland China at U of M, like all three of my roommates are from mainland China, but I think like the general approach of whether there is a conflict between us, which was just not talking about the issue. I think it's not a healthy way to do this, but like in general, I just avoid a sort of argument with them and talking about politics stuff.Wu: I do have friends from mainland China while I was in Hong Kong. While it is here, one of my former housemates is from mainland China and there is another housemate who is from Taiwan. And then one who's like American Taiwanese. And then the first day we moved into our house, the Chinese roommate put out a big Chinese flag in our living room.And I was like, I would rather you not, but I'm also not offended by it. The Taiwanese roommate was lit it, when she saw it and the Taiwanese American friend didn't care. At the end, what we hve on our wall was a LGBTQ flag. That was the compromise that we struck.But yeah, I do discus like issues with her. So like we drove to Ohio together. That was like a five hour drive and then it's just the two of us and we just talk about Hong Kong and China. I feel like it's a very healthy relationship we don't shy away from talking about these issues and try to understand where the other person's coming from? I and I do learn a lot and I think that she did learn like from a different perspective as well.Anderson: At the University of Michigan, is it a good environment to promote this kind of conversation and relationship?Wu: Yeah. Like, I mean, as long as people come with an open mind, it's like you can do it anywhere.And I think that like in our school, we have a very strong China center. Like that always provides an Avenue for people to discuss issues like that. But just on a day to day basis, like you interact with friends. You don't come off as accusing the other of like holding a specific to and usually people are very happy to chat with me about what's on their minds.Wu: Now in April, 2020 there are still assemblies and protests here and there, but you can't imagine how many are staying home instead of marching on the streets alongside with hundreds of thousands of people. That being said, reputable polls show that public opinion has largely remained unchanged. The public is still very much dissatisfied with the government and law enforcement.And you may think that major crisis, like a pandemic would create a rallying around the flag effect, but in fact, the majority of Hong Kong people think that the administration, mishandled the crisis and seven-tenth(70%) would credit the people themselves are doing a good job and slowing the spread of COVID-19.Anderson: I am Hans Anderson. This has been connecting Pacific. Thanks to Laura and Bernie for making this happen and thank you to my crew, Justin, Debing, and Siyin. Thanks to all of you for listening.Load-Date: April 23, 2020End of Document

Global Voices: China and Australia Brawl Over Call for Independent Investigation of COVID-19 OriginsTargeted News ServiceMay 5, 2020 Tuesday 8:41 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 925 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: AMSTERDAM, Netherlands BodyGlobal Voices issued the following story:The Australian government has triggered a major clash with Beijing by questioning the origin of COVID-19 -- Prime Minister Scott Morrison and some of his senior cabinet members have publicly called for an independent inquiry into the coronavirus.Although it has been seen by some as a thinly disguised attack on China, there has been considerable support down under. Morrison has called on Australia's allies to reform the World Health Organization and conduct an investigation of the coronavirus source.Australia already faced a bleak future in its economic relations with China as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. The shutdown of travel in early March was an early cause of strain between the countries. The lack of Australian government support for temporary visa holders such as international students and graduates has threatened the university sector.The Chinese ambassador Cheng Jingye's response was swift. He suggested that Chinese consumers and international students boycott Australian goods and services -- especially the trade, tourism and education sectors, which have been vital to Australia's prosperity in recent decades.A political and diplomatic brawl followed, with the Chinese embassy releasing alleged details of a conversation with Frances Adamson, the head of Australia's Foreign Affairs and Trade department (DFAT). The release was contentious for two reasons. It was meant to show that the Australian government was backing off. It also breached customary diplomatic protocols.The Chinese embassy claimed that:She also admitted it is not the time to commence the review now and Australia has no details of the proposal. She further said that Australia does not want the matter to have any impact on the Australia-China relationship.DFAT neither confirmed nor denied the claim:The department will not respond by itself breaching the long standing diplomatic courtesies and professional practices to which it will continue to adhere.This tweet was a typical reaction: https://globalvoices.org/2020/05/04/china-and-australia-brawl-over-call-for-independent-investigation-of-covid-19-origins/The editor of Chinese state media Global Times, Hu Xijin, added fuel to the controversy on Chinese social media platform Weibo:Australia is always there, making trouble. It is a bit like chewing gum stuck on the sole of China's shoes. Sometimes you have to find a stone to rub it off.This brought an angry response from many Australians online:This tweet was mild compared with some social media posts that displayed open racism and sinophobia [fear or dislike of China]. This advanced Twitter search covers the immediate period after Hu Xijin's comments were publicised.In contrast, others questioned the benefits of Australia's close ties with the United States government:Retired Australian diplomat Bruce Haig called for diplomacy rather than chest-thumping from Australian politicians:In terms of our relationship with China and America, the boat must be balanced if Australia is to get through the uncharted and rough waters ahead.At The Conversation, Tony Walker argued that Australia's economic over-dependence on China needs to be reassessed to give itself a few more options to avoid political blackmail:...it affords the Chinese what Australian policymakers should recognise as an unacceptable level of leverage, even a stranglehold, in times of stress....It is hard to escape the conclusion that Australia's China policy is in the hands of amateurs, or ideologues, or both.Some of the contentious issues between the two countries were summarised in a Global Voices story in late 2019. However, recent research at the Australian National University questions whether these squabbles have had any long-lasting economic consequences:Meanwhile, there was some commentary by Chinese citizens on Weibo. Some, including Tong Da Huan, supported an independent inquiry:The origin of the virus is a scientific question. Tracing the origin can help blocking future outbreaks and inform the science sector on how to combat new viruses. They are saying that the virus comes from the US too? We must have an investigation to clear things up.There was some mockery in reply to Tong's post:If someone else wants to investigate if your wife is having an affair, would you accept that?There were also some comments reflecting the Chinese government's position, such as this one referring to the 2019-20 bushfire disasters in Australia:Your country is in no position to investigate the origin of the virus in China. If you are allowed to investigate, China should investigate the fires in Australia and ask it for compensation over negligence that leads to global environmental disaster. [Global warming] may lead to the release of an ancient virus in the Arctic and we could ask for your compensation?In a bizarre episode, Australian iron ore billionaire Andrew 'Twiggy' Forrest embarrassed Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt at a joint media conference about the mining magnate's sourcing of 10 million virus test kits. Forrest invited China's Victoria Consul General Long Zhou to the presser -- without telling Hunt -- and copped a hammering on social media for it. This tweet summed up the responses:For a timeline of the unfolding story, please see: 'Chewing gum stuck on the sole of our shoes': the China-Australia war of words.We may have to wait until after the pandemic to see if this is more than just a war of words.[Category: International]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7103583 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: May 5, 2020End of Document

In July 2017, Lewis entered into a contract of employment with the People's Republic of China through its "Global Experts 1000 Talents Plan." China's Thousand Talents Plan is one of the most prominent Chinese Talent recruit plans that are designed to attract, recruit, and cultivate high-level scientific talent in furtherance of China's scientific development, economic prosperity and national security. These talent programs seek to lure overseas talent and foreign experts to bring their knowledge and experience to China and reward individuals for stealing proprietary information."Lewis defrauded a public university into giving him leave, so that he could satisfy his competing obligations to a Chinese institution, which he hid from the school," said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers. "I applaud the increased focus of the academic community to detect conflicts of interest and conflicts of commitment. Only with more transparency will we stem the tide of covert ties to Chinese institutions and programs, ties meant by the Chinese government to result in the transfer of intellectual property from the United States. ""This case represents an attempt to serve China to the detriment of West Virginia University and the United States. Academia is a prime target for these activities and we will remain committed to prosecuting such fraud wherever it is found. I want to thank the FBI, the IRS and our prosecution team for a job well done," said U.S Attorney Bill Powell, Northern District of West Virginia."The FBI knows the Chinese government intentionally targets the advanced technologies and technical expertise developed in the U.S. to give themselves a competitive advantage in the world marketplace," said FBI Pittsburgh Special Agent in Charge Robert Jones. "Participation in a talent plan like the one Dr. Lewis was part of it is not illegal. But FBI investigations have revealed participants are often incentivized to transfer proprietary information or research conducted in the U.S. to China. This remains a significant threat and a high priority threat for the FBI. We are dedicated to making sure foreign governments know U.S. trade secrets cannot and will not be bought."According to Lewis's contract, the Chinese Academy of Sciences agreed to employ Lewis as a professor for at least three years. In return, Lewis agreed to maintain an active research program that yielded publications in high quality, peer-reviewed journals, and to provide research training and experience for Chinese Academy of Sciences students.As a part of the program, Lewis was promised benefits, including a living subsidy of 1 million Yuan (approximately $143,000), a research subsidy of 4 million Yuan (approximately $573,000), and a salary of 600,000 Yuan (approximately $86,000). To receive the benefits, Lewis would have to work full time in China for three consecutive years, for no less than nine months per year, and would have to begin work no later than Aug. 8, 2018.In March 2018, Lewis submitted a request to WVU for an alternate/parental work assignment, requesting to be released from his teaching duties for the fall 2018 semester in order to serve as the primary caregiver for a child he and his wife were expecting in June 2018. In fact, however, Lewis knew this request was fraudulent. Rather than caring for his newborn child, Lewis planned to work in China during the fall 2018 semester as a part of his agreement with the "1000 Talents Plan." Based on the false justification Lewis offered, WVU granted his request.In the fall of 2018, Lewis spent all but three weeks of the semester in China while his newborn child remained in the United States. During this period, Lewis received his full salary from WVU pursuant to his alternate/parental work assignment. Lewis's scheme allowed him to fraudulently obtain $20,189 from WVU.As a part of the plea agreement, Lewis has agreed to pay restitution in the amount of $20,189 in full to WVU. Lewis is no longer employed by WVU, having resigned in August 2019.Lewis faces up to 10 years incarceration and a fine of up to $250,000. Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, the actual sentence imposed will be based upon the seriousness of the offenses and the prior criminal history, if any, of the defendant.Assistant U.S. Attorney Jarod J. Douglas and Trial Attorney Evan N. Turgeon with the Department of Justice's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, National Security Division, are prosecuting the case on behalf of the government. The FBI and the Internal Revenue Service investigated. WVU cooperated in the investigation of this case.U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael John Aloi presided.

EXECUTIVE ORDER ON PREVENTING ONLINE CENSORSHIPUS Fed NewsMay 29, 2020 Friday 4:16 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 2567 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, May 29 -- The White House Office of Management & Budget issued the following public release:By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:Section 1. Policy. Free speech is the bedrock of American democracy. Our Founding Fathers protected this sacred right with the First Amendment to the Constitution. The freedom to express and debate ideas is the foundation for all of our rights as a free people.In a country that has long cherished the freedom of expression, we cannot allow a limited number of online platforms to hand pick the speech that Americans may access and convey on the internet. This practice is fundamentally un-American and anti-democratic. When large, powerful social media companies censor opinions with which they disagree, they exercise a dangerous power. They cease functioning as passive bulletin boards, and ought to be viewed and treated as content creators.The growth of online platforms in recent years raises important questions about applying the ideals of the First Amendment to modern communications technology. Today, many Americans follow the news, stay in touch with friends and family, and share their views on current events through social media and other online platforms. As a result, these platforms function in many ways as a 21st century equivalent of the public square.Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube wield immense, if not unprecedented, power to shape the interpretation of public events; to censor, delete, or disappear information; and to control what people see or do not see.As President, I have made clear my commitment to free and open debate on the internet. Such debate is just as important online as it is in our universities, our town halls, and our homes. It is essential to sustaining our democracy.Online platforms are engaging in selective censorship that is harming our national discourse. Tens of thousands of Americans have reported, among other troubling behaviors, online platforms "flagging" content as inappropriate, even though it does not violate any stated terms of service; making unannounced and unexplained changes to company policies that have the effect of disfavoring certain viewpoints; and deleting content and entire accounts with no warning, no rationale, and no recourse.Twitter now selectively decides to place a warning label on certain tweets in a manner that clearly reflects political bias. As has been reported, Twitter seems never to have placed such a label on another politician's tweet. As recently as last week, Representative Adam Schiff was continuing to mislead his followers by peddling the long-disproved Russian Collusion Hoax, and Twitter did not flag those tweets. Unsurprisingly, its officer in charge of so-called 'Site Integrity' has flaunted his political bias in his own tweets.At the same time online platforms are invoking inconsistent, irrational, and groundless justifications to censor or otherwise restrict Americans' speech here at home, several online platforms are profiting from and promoting the aggression and disinformation spread by foreign governments like China. One United States company, for example, created a search engine for the Chinese Communist Party that would have blacklisted searches for "human rights," hid data unfavorable to the Chinese Communist Party, and tracked users determined appropriate for surveillance. It also established research partnerships in China that provide direct benefits to the Chinese military. Other companies have accepted advertisements paid for by the Chinese government that spread false information about China's mass imprisonment of religious minorities, thereby enabling these abuses of human rights. They have also amplified China's propaganda abroad, including by allowing Chinese government officials to use their platforms to spread misinformation regarding the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to undermine pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.As a Nation, we must foster and protect diverse viewpoints in today's digital communications environment where all Americans can and should have a voice. We must seek transparency and accountability from online platforms, and encourage standards and tools to protect and preserve the integrity and openness of American discourse and freedom of expression.Sec. 2 Protections Against Online Censorship. (a) It is the policy of the United States to foster clear ground rules promoting free and open debate on the internet. Prominent among the ground rules governing that debate is the immunity from liability created by section 230(c) of the Communications Decency Act (section 230(c)). 47 U.S.C. 230(c). It is the policy of the United States that the scope of that immunity should be clarified: the immunity should not extend beyond its text and purpose to provide protection for those who purport to provide users a forum for free and open speech, but in reality use their power over a vital means of communication to engage in deceptive or pretextual actions stifling free and open debate by censoring certain viewpoints.Section 230(c) was designed to address early court decisions holding that, if an online platform restricted access to some content posted by others, it would thereby become a "publisher" of all the content posted on its site for purposes of torts such as defamation. As the title of section 230(c) makes clear, the provision provides limited liability "protection" to a provider of an interactive computer service (such as an online platform) that engages in "'Good Samaritan' blocking" of harmful content. In particular, the Congress sought to provide protections for online platforms that attempted to protect minors from harmful content and intended to ensure that such providers would not be discouraged from taking down harmful material. The provision was also intended to further the express vision of the Congress that the internet is a "forum for a true diversity of political discourse." 47 U.S.C. 230(a)(3).The limited protections provided by the statute should be construed with these purposes in mind.In particular, subparagraph (c)(2) expressly addresses protections from "civil liability" and specifies that an interactive computer service provider may not be made liable "on account of" its decision in "good faith" to restrict access to content that it considers to be "obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing or otherwise objectionable. It is the policy of the United States to ensure that, to the maximum extent permissible under the law, this provision is not distorted to provide liability protection for online platforms that - far from acting in "good faith" to remove objectionable content - instead engage in deceptive or pretextual actions (often contrary to their stated terms of service) to stifle viewpoints with which they disagree. Section 230 was not intended to allow a handful of companies to grow into titans controlling vital avenues for our national discourse under the guise of promoting open forums for debate, and then to provide those behemoths blanket immunity when they use their power to censor content and silence viewpoints that they dislike. When an interactive computer service provider removes or restricts access to content and its actions do not meet the criteria of subparagraph (c)(2)(A), it is engaged in editorial conduct. It is the policy of the United States that such a provider should properly lose the limited liability shield of subparagraph (c)(2)(A) and be exposed to liability like any traditional editor and publisher that is not an online provider.(b) To advance the policy described in subsection (a) of this section, all executive departments and agencies should ensure that their application of section 230(c) properly reflects the narrow purpose of the section and take all appropriate actions in this regard. In addition, within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary), in consultation with the Attorney General, and acting through the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), shall file a petition for rulemaking with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requesting that the FCC expeditiously propose regulations to clarify:(i) the interaction between subparagraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of section 230, in particular to clarify and determine the circumstances under which a provider of an interactive computer service that restricts access to content in a manner not specifically protected by subparagraph (c)(2)(A) may also not be able to claim protection under subparagraph (c)(1), which merely states that a provider shall not be treated as a publisher or speaker for making third-party content available and does not address the provider's responsibility for its own editorial decisions;(ii) the conditions under which an action restricting access to or availability of material is not "taken in good faith" within the meaning of subparagraph (c)(2)(A) of section 230, particularly whether actions can be "taken in good faith" if they are:(A) deceptive, pretextual, or inconsistent with a provider's terms of service; or(B) taken after failing to provide adequate notice, reasoned explanation, or a meaningful opportunity to be heard; and(iii) any other proposed regulations that the NTIA concludes may be appropriate to advance the policy described in subsection (a) of this section.Sec. 3. Protecting Federal Taxpayer Dollars from Financing Online Platforms That Restrict Free Speech. (a) The head of each executive department and agency (agency) shall review its agency's Federal spending on advertising and marketing paid to online platforms. Such review shall include the amount of money spent, the online platforms that receive Federal dollars, and the statutory authorities available to restrict their receipt of advertising dollars.(b) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall report its findings to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.(c) The Department of Justice shall review the viewpoint-based speech restrictions imposed by each online platform identified in the report described in subsection (b) of this section and assess whether any online platforms are problematic vehicles for government speech due to viewpoint discrimination, deception to consumers, or other bad practices.Sec. 4. Federal Review of Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices. (a) It is the policy of the United States that large online platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, as the critical means of promoting the free flow of speech and ideas today, should not restrict protected speech. The Supreme Court has noted that social media sites, as the modern public square, "can provide perhaps the most powerful mechanisms available to a private citizen to make his or her voice heard." Packingham v. North Carolina, 137 S. Ct. 1730, 1737 (2017). Communication through these channels has become important for meaningful participation in American democracy, including to petition elected leaders. These sites are providing an important forum to the public for others to engage in free expression and debate. Cf. PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74, 85-89 (1980).(b) In May of 2019, the White House launched a Tech Bias Reporting tool to allow Americans to report incidents of online censorship. In just weeks, the White House received over 16,000 complaints of online platforms censoring or otherwise taking action against users based on their political viewpoints. The White House will submit such complaints received to the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).(c) The FTC shall consider taking action, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, pursuant to section 45 of title 15, United States Code. Such unfair or deceptive acts or practice may include practices by entities covered by section 230 that restrict speech in ways that do not align with those entities' public representations about those practices.(d) For large online platforms that are vast arenas for public debate, including the social media platform Twitter, the FTC shall also, consistent with its legal authority, consider whether complaints allege violations of law that implicate the policies set forth in section 4(a) of this order. The FTC shall consider developing a report describing such complaints and making the report publicly available, consistent with applicable law.Sec. 5. State Review of Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices and Anti-Discrimination Laws. (a) The Attorney General shall establish a working group regarding the potential enforcement of State statutes that prohibit online platforms from engaging in unfair or deceptive acts or practices. The working group shall also develop model legislation for consideration by legislatures in States where existing statutes do not protect Americans from such unfair and deceptive acts and practices. The working group shall invite State Attorneys General for discussion and consultation, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law.(b) Complaints described in section 4(b) of this order will be shared with the working group, consistent with applicable law. The working group shall also collect publicly available information regarding the following:(i) increased scrutiny of users based on the other users they choose to follow, or their interactions with other users;(ii) algorithms to suppress content or users based on indications of political alignment or viewpoint;(iii) differential policies allowing for otherwise impermissible behavior, when committed by accounts associated with the Chinese Communist Party or other anti-democratic associations or governments;(iv) reliance on third-party entities, including contractors, media organizations, and individuals, with indicia of bias to review content; and(v) acts that limit the ability of users with particular viewpoints to earn money on the platform compared with other users similarly situated.Sec. 6.Legislation. The Attorney General shall develop a proposal for Federal legislation that would be useful to promote the policy objectives of this order.Sec. 7. Definition. For purposes of this order, the term "online platform" means any website or application that allows users to create and share content or engage in social networking, or any general search engine.Sec. 8. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

CHINESE UNDERMINING DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS IN CENTRAL EUROPE, EURASIA: REPORTStates News ServiceMay 6, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 702 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:By Joshua LipesChina's foreign policy has increasingly weakened democratic institutions in at least 20 countries throughout Central Europe and Central Asia, weakening oversight and bolstering the power of authoritarian leaders, a new U.S. think tank report said Wednesday."While China's international engagement is often less directly confrontational ... it nevertheless has an insidious effect on the development and functioning of democratic institutions in the region," Washington-based Freedom House said in its Nations in Transit 2020, an annual report on democratic governance in 29 countries spanning Central Europe, the Balkans, and Eurasia.According to Freedom House, the ruling Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) influence campaign is focused on the twin goals of expanding China's influence abroad and promoting a positive image of the country globally.In doing so, China's diplomatic corps "tailors its approach to each individual country," the report said, exploiting institutional weaknesses and "surreptitiously embedding itself into corrupt political and economic structures.""The aggregate impact of these measures is the further degradation of good governance, transparency, and the rule of law, and the creation of additional avenues for predatory, local political elites to remain in power and further bend the system to their advantage," it said.In particular, Freedom House highlighted China's focus on technology and surveillance, noting that Chinese tech giant Huawei has signed a "Safe City Agreement" with governments in 10 of Nations in Transit's 29 countrieseach of which suffers from poor governance and serious corruption.Tajikistan and Uzbekistan have rolled out around 1,000 cameras in public spaces to monitor events, while in Serbiawhich uses Huawei's facial and license-plate recognition systemspolice officers have taken part in joint exercises with Chinese counterparts to learn how to "disable terrorists.""These partnerships raise concerns that China's increasing reach could strengthen authoritarian-minded leaders, contributing to repression and diminishing democratic governance and active civil society," the report said."Even in democracies, experts point to vulnerabilities that can be exploited by the Chinese authorities, as Chinese technologies are integrated into the surveillance sector."Media and 'debt diplomacy'Freedom House also noted that China is also expanding its influence in the region through the media, with Chinese authorities intervening to promote the CCP's preferred narratives, suppress critical viewpoints, and manage content delivery systems."In Central and Eastern European countries, Chinese diplomats have been given free rein to publish misleading op-eds that push a pro-China narrative," the report said.Lastly, China has worked to gain influence in the region through a strategy of what Freedom House called "debt diplomacy," or providing funds to impoverished and infrastructurally weak countries through methods that create political dependency."China's advantage in the region is its ability to grant loans with few strings attachedas compared to the EU, which has more stringent guidelines for loaning and paying back financial support," the report said."As a result, foreign-held debt in the region is increasingly found in the hands of the Chinese government."Freedom House noted that Tajikistan, Montenegro, and North Macedonia owe 41, 39, and 20 percent of their debt, respectively, to China. In April 2020, Kyrgyzstanwhich owes as much as two-fifths of its foreign debt to China's Eximbankwas forced to ask for debt relief amidst fallout from the coronavirus pandemic."All of these strategies weaken avenues for democratic oversight, and provide authoritarians and authoritarians-to-be with tools and incentives to overstay their time in power," the report said of China's tactics in the region."[China's] corrosive influence can and should be countered, but financial investment and political deals only go so far. Ultimately, its sharp power will only have less potential to penetrate if democratic stakeholders focus on backstopping the region's democratic institutions."Load-Date: May 6, 2020End of Document

US SLASHES STAFF NUMBERS AT CHINESE STATE MEDIA ORGANIZATIONSStates News ServiceMarch 2, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 832 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Washington on Monday ordered several U.S.-based media organizations run by the Chinese government to cut their staff numbers, hitting out at Beijing's "long-standing intimidation and harassment of journalists."U.S. based employees of China's Xinhua News Agency, China Global Television Network, China Radio International and China Daily Distribution Corp., which last month were designated foreign agents by the State Department, will need to be reduced from 160 to just 100 by March 13 , official said.The move was in direct response to Beijing's treatment of journalists, which was highlighted in an annual report released by the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China (FCCC) on Monday .The report found that 82 percent of members who responded to its survey had experienced interference, harassment or violence while reporting in China, while 44 percent said digital and physical surveillance concerns had affected their ability to carry out reporting activities, including contacting sources and doing interviews.Forty-four percent said their Chinese colleagues had experienced harassment at least once during 2019, while 51 percent said they were obstructed by police or other officials while trying to do their jobs.The report said it had built up "a detailed picture of sustained attacks by the Chinese state on the foreign press, a worsening reality that should be cause for global concern.""As China reaches new heights of economic influence, it has shown a growing willingness to use its considerable state power to suppress factual reporting that does not fit with the global image it seeks to present," the report said."For the second consecutive year, not a single correspondent said conditions improved," it said.'Visas as weapons'Citing the expulsion from China of three Wall Street Journal reporters last month, the FCCC said Chinese authorities are now "using visas as weapons against the foreign press," either refusing to renew work visas as in the case of the Journal's Chun Han Wong in August, or issuing "severely truncated visas" to resident journalists.It said since President Xi Jinping took power in 2013, China has forced nine foreign journalists to leave the country, either through outright expulsion or non-renewal of visas."Twenty-two percent of respondents faced difficulty renewing their credentials, up from 13 percent the year before," the report found. "Almost all of them believed this was related to their reporting."Meanwhile, Chinese employees at international media organizations continued to face intensifying intimidation and harassment, including being detained, interrogated and threatened, the FCCC found.China's ever-expanding surveillance network, which employs facial recognition technology and physical monitoring, as well as evidence of the hacking of e-mail and encrypted messaging apps is making journalists' jobs harder still, it said."For years, the government of the People's Republic of China has imposed increasingly harsh surveillance, harassment, and intimidation against American and other foreign journalists operating in China," U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement announcing the staffing cuts to Chinese media organizations.Reciprocity soughtOne U.S. official told Reuters: "We've been imploring the Chinese for years and years now to improve their treatment of journalists in China. So, this is not linked to any one particular incident."The U.S. official said it was hoped that the restrictions on Chinese media organizations would "spur Beijing to adopt a more fair and reciprocal approach.""If in fact they decide to take this in a further negative direction however of course...all options would be on the table. I can't tell you what in particular we would do, but we'd sit down review the circumstances and then consider all of our options," said the official in comments reported by Reuters.While the U.S. isn't expelling any individuals, some of the staff members may be forced to leave due to the fact that their visas depend on their ability to work in the U.S.The move drew criticism from the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), however, which called on Washington to immediately suspend the plan."China and the United States need to pull back from this dangerous cycle of tit-for-tat retaliation that threatens the free flow of information in both countries--especially during a global health crisis," CPJ Asia program coordinator Steven Butler said in a statement on the group's website."As a democracy with a strong constitutional guarantee of freedom of the press, the U.S. in particular must show leadership in the area of press freedom, rather than adopting Beijing's authoritarian tactics," Butler said.China is the world's worst jailer of journalists, with at least 48 journalists behind bars at the end of 2019, the CPJ said.Reported by RFA's Mandarin and Cantonese Services.

China censored the publication of studies on the origin of coronavirusCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 13, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 823 wordsBodyAn investigation by the British newspaper The Guardian revealed that China is taking "strong action" against the publication of academic research into the origins of the new coronavirus. According to the paper, it is a strategy of Xi Jingping's regime to control the narrative surrounding the pandemic.The Guardian accessed documents initially published on the official websites of Chinese universities and hospitals that were eventually deleted from the internet.  Two websites of major Chinese universities recently published and then deleted reports that refer to a new policy requiring academic documents related to Covid-19 to undergo "additional background research" before being published."Research on the origins of the virus is particularly sensitive and subject to verification by government officials," was reported on the websites of Fudan University and the Chinese University of Geosciences (Wuhan). Those communications were then deleted but The Guardian, however, accessed both deleted pages from "the caches" online, the tool to view a kind of photo of the latest posted before being deleted.Professor Steve Tsang, director of the China SOAS Institute in London, said the Chinese government has focused heavily on how the evolution and management of the virus is perceived since the early days of the outbreak. "In terms of priority, storytelling control is more important than public health or economic consequences," he warned. "It does not mean that the economy and public health are not important. But narrative is paramount."Since the virus has infected more than a million people worldwide and caused numerous victims, particularly in Europe and the United States, details about its origin and Chinese management of the first few weeks of the pandemic - when local authorities were reopened - are considered particularly sensitive. "If these documents are authentic, the government really wants to control very strictly the narrative about the origins of Covid-19," Tsang warned.In another example released by the Guardian, the University of Geosciences of China (Wuhan) also published and then removed the new requirements for academic documents dealing with the origins of the virus. The procedure, they explained, is as follows: first the university's academic committee reviews the research "with an emphasis on verifying the accuracy of the thesis, as well as whether it is eligible for publication" and then, "when the checks have been completed", the University must inform the Ministry of Science and Technology for final approval".The British media also had access to a document from the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University which also warns experts that any research on the origins of the Covid-19 needs government approval.Another notice, published on 9 April by Fudan University's school of information science and technology in Shanghai, requires "strict and serious" management of documents investigating the origin of the outbreak. Moreover, an internal memo warned that documents may only be published after approval by a special office. Nowhere does it say that this "Special Office" depends on the government but the email, names and telephone numbers provided in the notice belong to a unit of the Chinese Ministry of Education.The regime has been bleak in its Reports on the Wuhan-based virus from the outset. China not only lied about the outbreak, but "disappeared"doctors and other health experts who worked on it and alerted the world to what they knew.Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province and epicenter of the outbreak of new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China (ALY SONG/)Allegations against the regime began to infuriate the population, after details of how the Chinese Communist Party armed doctors who had warned of the dangerous outbreak that reminded them of the SARS that hit the same country in 2002. The highest point of outrage was born when the death of doctor Li Wenliang was known, who had sent a chat notice to his colleagues on 30 December and a few days later police made him sign a compromise that he would stop "making comments that disturbed public order." On 6 February, he was finally infected with COVID-19."People in China have lived under government censorship for many years, but now many people are questioning how censorship may have delayed effective action on the virus outbreak and put many lives at risk," Amnesty International said.Mistrust is not only in response to the Chinese Communist Party's attitude to the epidemic. The authorities have a long history of lies and suppression of information on industrial and natural disasters, toxic products and health crises.MORE ON THIS TOPIC:China's deception of the world was worse: evidence shows that the coronavirus already existed since before December and the regime hid itA documentary about the origin of the coronavirus says the Chinese Communist Party concealed that it is synthetic and leaked from a labLoad-Date: April 14, 2020End of Document

China asked US to end "crackdown" on HuaweiCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 16, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 404 wordsBodyChina urged the United States to end the "irrational crackdown on Huawei and Chinese companies," after Washington announced new export controls to limit Chinese giants' access to semiconductor technology."The Chinese government will strongly defend the legitimate and legal rights and interests of Chinese companies," the Foreign Ministry said Saturday in a statement."We urge the United States to immediately cease its irrational crackdown on Huawei and Chinese companies," he said.The ministry said Donald Trump's administration's initiatives "destroyed global manufacturing, supply and value chains."On Friday, the Trump administration announced a series of measures that seek to leave Huawei out of the global semiconductor market, seen by Washington as a threat to national security.You may be interested: Italy will reopen its borders to tourists from the European Union from 3 JuneThe U.S. Department of Commerce said these measures block "Huawei's efforts to circumvent U.S. export controls."According to U.S. officials, China's telecommunications giant has managed to circumvent previous Washington sanctions by turning to chip and component suppliers in other parts of the world, but manufactured with U.S. technology.The Chinese company has been under extreme pressure from Washington, which with its lobbying has got allies around the world to avoid equipment developed by Huawei in the name of security, in a context of trade war between China and the United States.U.S. officials have repeatedly accused China's tech giant of stealing U.S. trade secrets and supporting China's espionage efforts.This situation can further stoke tensions between Washington and Beijing. Their relations are already very conflicting because of the covid-19 pandemic, which began in China, which Trump again reproached the Chinese government on Friday.The eve had threatened to break off all relationships with the Asian giant and assured that he no longer wanted to speak "for the time being" with his president.China threatened retaliatory action against Washington, especially by imposing restrictions on large U.S. companies and enrolling them in a "list of unreliable entities," according to an anonymous government source cited Friday in the Communist Party's Global Times, a tabloid.American tech giants Apple, Cisco, Qualcomm and Boeing aeronautical are part of the companies that could be affected, according to the newspaper.Load-Date: May 17, 2020End of Document

Committee to Protect Journalists: China Expels at Least 13 US Journalists in Retaliatory MoveTargeted News ServiceMarch 19, 2020 Thursday 9:10 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 794 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: TAIPEI, Taiwan BodyThe Committee to Protect Journalists issued the following news on March 18:Chinese authorities should immediately suspend efforts to expel American journalists, cease retaliatory measures against U.S. media operations, and resolve differences with the United States through negotiations rather than attacks on the press, the Committee to Protect Journalists said.The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced yesterday that all U.S. citizens working as journalists at The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post whose press credentials end in 2020 would be required to surrender those credentials within 10 days, effectively forcing them to leave the country. The Foreign Correspondents Club of China, in a statement posted on Facebook, said that at least 13 U.S. correspondents would be affected, depending on how China enforces the decision.Chinese authorities will also require the three outlets' China-based branches, along with Time magazine and the U.S. Congress-funded broadcaster Voice of America, to produce written reports concerning their staff, financing, operations, and real estate in the country, according to the announcement.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs statement said the move was in retaliation for measures taken by the U.S. government earlier in March, which designated five Chinese state media organizations--Xinhua, CGTN, China Radio, China Daily, and The People's Daily--as foreign missions and imposed a limit of 100 on U.S. visas for Chinese citizens at those outlets, forcing up to 60 to leave the U.S., as CPJ documented at the time."China's expulsion of U.S. journalists may enhance its ability to block investigative reporting into human right abuses in Xinjiang or its earlier mishandling of the coronavirus crisis, but at the terrible expense of accurate, fact-based reports badly needed during a global pandemic," said Steven Butler, CPJ's Asia program coordinator, in Washington, D.C. "It is unfortunate that U.S. moves to restrict Chinese media operations gave China the perfect cover to suppress reporting that it has always complained about, under the phony banner of taking 'reciprocal' measures."The Ministry of Foreign Affairs statement also said that the expelled journalists would not be able to report from the special administrative regions of Hong Kong or Macao. The Foreign Correspondents Club of Hong Kong said in a statement that it was "concerned by reports that they will be banned from working as journalists in Hong Kong, given that Hong Kong has its own system under which press freedom is a right according to the law."CPJ issued a report in December documenting the steady erosion of press freedom in Hong Kong.The Macau Portuguese and English Press Association also issued a statement raising concerns about the decision and its impact on press freedom in the former colony.On February 18, the U.S. State Department designated the five Chinese media organizations as "foreign missions," as CPJ documented. The next day, China announced that three Wall Street Journal correspondents would be expelled from the country, allegedly over a racist op-ed headline. On March 2, the U.S. said it would limit visas for Chinese journalists.After the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued its notice yesterday, Chinese state media ramped up attacks on the U.S. and its media. The Xinhua news agency published a report citing discrimination against Chinese journalists operating in the United States, and the Global Times daily accused The New York Times of attacking the Chinese political system and smearing China's efforts to combat the coronavirus.The Global Times quoted a professor in U.S. studies who accused the five U.S. media outlets of "ideological bias against China, cooking up fake news under the disguise of press freedom and breaches of journalism ethics."In a statement, Wall Street Journal editor-in-chief Matt Murray said that the newspaper opposes government interference and that the expulsion is an "unprecedented attack on freedom of the press."Dean Baquet, executive editor of The New York Times, released a statement condemning Chinese authorities' decision, calling it "especially irresponsible at a time when the world needs the free and open flow of credible information about the coronavirus pandemic."Martin Baron, the editor of The Washington Post, condemned the action and said "the Chinese government's decision is particularly regrettable because it comes in the midst of an unprecedented global crisis, when clear and reliable information about the international response to covid-19 is essential."China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not reply to an email from CPJ requesting comment.[Category: Media]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7059862 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 19, 2020End of Document

CYBERSECURITY FIRM LINKS CHINESE GROUP TO CYBER ESPIONAGE IN SOUTHEAST ASIAStates News ServiceMay 8, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 799 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A China-based group has quietly carried out cyber espionage against Southeast Asian governments during the past few years, collecting "specific documents," among other data, from infected computers, a cybersecurity company said in a report.Naikon, a group of hackers, deployed a software called Aria-body to target government agencies and technology firms in Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, Myanmar and Brunei, and even in Australia, according to a report released Thursday by Check Point Research, an Israeli security company."In this campaign, we uncovered the latest iteration of what seems to be a long-running Chinese-based operation against various government entities," Check Point said in its extensive report available online. "Throughout our research, we witnessed several different infection chains being used to deliver the Aria-body backdoor.""This includes not only locating and collecting specific documents from infected computers and networks within government departments, but also extracting data from removable drives, taking screenshots and keylogging, and of course harvesting the stolen data for espionage," it said.Check Point Research did not say if Naikon was backed by the Chinese government.But a September 2015 report from cyber intelligence companies Defense Group and ThreatConnect, both U.S.-based firms, identified Naikon as "associated" with China's People's Liberation Army (PLA).The two companies said they fused "technical analysis with Chinese language research and expertise" to document the sophisticated cyber espionage campaign by the PLA unit "with interests in the South China Sea."An email sent by BenarNews. an RFA-affiliated online news service, to the media relations officer of the Chinese embassy in Washington on Friday was not immediately returned.Meanwhile in Jakarta, Anton Setiawan, spokesman for Indonesia's National Cyber and Cryptography Agency, acknowledged awareness of the report by Check Point."We will discuss this internally first," he told BenarNews on Friday.In Bangkok, a staff member of the Thai government's IT security watchdog THAICERT also told BenarNews that its members would probe the allegations in the report."We have a team to investigate this matter, based on the report, to see if it is true or not. If it is true, we will alert agencies who might have been affected by the hackers to be careful," said the staff member, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media.The nations that were allegedly hacked except for Australia, Thailand and Myanmar have overlapping territorial claims in the South China Sea, where about U.S. $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes through each year. China claims most of the resource-rich region on historical grounds."The Naikon group has been running a longstanding operation, during which it has updated its new cyberweapon time and time again, built an extensive offensive infrastructure and worked to penetrate many governments across Asia and the Pacific," Lotem Finkelstein, head of the cyber-threat intelligence group at Check Point, said in a statement."In operations following the original 2015 report, we have observed the use of a backdoor named Aria-body against several national governments, including Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar and Brunei," Check Point said, referring to the study by the two U.S. security firms five years ago.Aria-body, the intrusive new tool used by the hackers, has alarmed security researchers because it could infiltrate a government agency using an ordinary Word document to penetrate any computer from which data from the attacked state department would flow into the servers used by the hackers, according to Check Point.After Naikon was investigated by the two American cybersecurity companies five years ago, it "slipped off the radar," according to Check Point. But the firm said it had recently discovered that the hacking group had actually been active during the past 10 years, but only "accelerated its cyber espionage activities in 2019" and the first quarter of this year."By comparing with previously reported activity, we can conclude that the Naikon APT group has been persistently targeting the same region in the last decade," Check Point said in a statement.The targeted government entities include foreign affairs, science and technology ministries, as well as government-owned companies, it said."Given the characteristics of the victims and capabilities presented by the group, it is evident that the group's purpose is to gather intelligence and spy on the countries whose Governments it has targeted," Check Point said.Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Load-Date: May 9, 2020End of Document

$3.7 million US grant to lab in China?USA TODAYMay 5, 2020 TuesdayFIRST EDITIONCopyright 2020 Gannett Company, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 6ALength: 1120 wordsByline: Matthew Brown and Kim Hjelmgaard, USA TODAYBodyThe origins of the coronavirus have become an increasingly hot-button issue, allowing conspiracy theories to gain traction online and among high-profile officials.Claims that the U.S. government helped fund research into coronaviruses spread after the Daily Mail reported  it obtained documents that "show the Wuhan Institute of Virology undertook coronavirus experiments on mammals captured more than 1,000 miles away in Yunnan - funded by a $3.7 million grant from the US government."The report gained traction on social media, and the claim was  repeated by political figures."For years, the US government has been funding cruel animal experiments at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which may have contributed to the global spread of COVID-19," Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., tweeted April 13. Gaetz praised President Donald Trump on Fox News for "committing to end this America Last grant given to labs in Wuhan by the Obama administration!"During a news conference April 17, a Newsmax reporter asked Trump about the grant money. "We will end that grant very quickly," Trump said. "It was made a number of years ago. Who was president then, I wonder?"Social media posts insinuated that research was linked to the pandemic."We are discovering that the US government unconstitutionally provided a $3.7 million grant to the #Wuhan lab in #China that many are pointing to as the source of the current virus scamdemic," an April 13 Instagram post from @freedom_faction reads.In an April 21 op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., accused the Chinese government of covering up its involvement in the virus's origins. "This evidence is circumstantial, to be sure, but it all points toward the Wuhan labs," the senator wrote."Why did the US (NIH) in 2017 give $3.7m to the Wuhan Lab in China? Such grants were prohibited in 2014," former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani tweeted April 26.The claims that the Obama administration funded coronavirus research may be referring to a grant provided by the National Institutes of Health to EcoHealth Alliance, a research group that tracks emerging diseases. The grant is directly overseen by the NIH, and it continued under the Trump administration until it was recently rescinded.EcoHealth AllianceThe EcoHealth Alliance is a nongovernmental research group that focuses on emerging diseases caused by human and animal interactions. The National Institutes of Health has consistently funded the organization for projects since at least 2002.In 2014, the NIH approved a grant to EcoHealth Alliance designated for research into "Understanding the Risk of Bat Coronavirus Emergence." The project involved collaborating with researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology to study coronaviruses in bats and the risk of potential transfer to humans.The original five-year grant was reapproved by the Trump administration in July 2019. In total, $3,378,896 in NIH funding was directed from the government to the project.The project, which was established "to understand what factors allow coronaviruses, including close relatives to SARS, to evolve and jump into the human population," yielded 20 scientific reports on how zoonotic diseases may transfer from bats to humans.Over the course of the two grants approved by the NIH for EcoHealth Alliance, the Wuhan Institute received about $600,000 from the NIH, according to Robert Kessler, a spokesperson for EcoHealth Alliance. The funding was a fee for the collection and analysis of viral samples.In the grant approved in 2014, about $133,000 was sent to the institute in the first four years and about $66,000 in the past year. In the second grant approved in 2019, about $76,000 was budgeted for the Wuhan Institute, though no money was sent before the grant's termination."It's hard to do this work in other countries. Very complicated. It requires a lot of traveling. It would be so convenient if we could do it in our own backyards," Peter Daszak, president of the EcoHealth Alliance, told USA TODAY. "The viruses that are a high risk to public health are not in the U.S., they are in China. If we want to know anything about the next pandemic, we need to be working in the countries where these viruses are."On April 23, the NIH informed EcoHealth Alliance that it would no longer receive funding from the agency and that the remainder of its grant had been rescinded.The agency cited a statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that the intelligence community was continuing to investigate the origins of COVID-19."The U.S. federal government checks whether it is OK to work with places like the Wuhan Institute of Virology. We never work with any lab or organization unless it has been preapproved by the U.S. government and/or its agencies," Daszak told USA TODAY.It is not uncommon for the United States to fund research projects in other countries. The NIH annually grants more than $32 billion in biomedical research funding to organizations around the world.The National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, the subset of the NIH that handles disease research, funds 8,598 active projectstotaling $5,927,849,026. Many of those projects, which vary in their research goals, take place in more than a dozen countries outside the USA, in addition to thousands within the country.The Wuhan Institute of Virology is a state-controlled research institute in Wuhan, China, the city where SARS-CoV-2 probably originated. Established in 2015, the laboratory was China's first Level 4 biosafety facility, the highest standard meant to handle highly infectious or otherwise deadly pathogens.Controversy around the institute's possible involvement in the origins of the coronavirus continue at the highest levels of the American and Chinese governments. There is no known evidence that funding directed by the U.S. government to the Wuhan Institute of Virology helped lead to the pandemic.The projects funded by the Obama and Trump administrations produced research that highlighted the risk of an outbreak like SARS-CoV-2 in southern China. The abstract proposal for the project cited concerns that a disease like SARS-CoV, or the earlier SARS outbreak, would arise from the region.Our ruling: Partly falseWe rate this claim PARTLY FALSE because some of it was not supported by our research. It is misleading to claim that the Obama administration gave funding to a Chinese research institute. It is true that funds were provided to a project where an American research group worked alongside a Chinese organization. Claims that the funding helped produce the pandemic are unsubstantiated. A total of $3.7 million was not given to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, only about $600,000. Load-Date: May 5, 2020End of Document

Trump Says He Is 'Very Disappointed' In China, But Won't Talk Retaliation; Will there be consequences?The Daily CallerMay 19, 2020 Tuesday 08:57 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 518 wordsByline: Anders Hagstrom, White House Correspondent, anders@dailycaller.comBodyLink to ImagePresident Donald Trump is “very disappointed” in China for its handling of coronavirus, but he is not ready to discuss retaliation, the president said at a cabinet meeting Tuesday.The comments come after weeks of messaging from the White House and Republicans condemning the Chinese government's response to the disease. Trump said in April that China should face consequences if it is found to have “knowingly” contributed to the spread of COVID-19. U.S. intelligence has concluded China            falsified its data on coronavirus cases and deaths in Wuhan and that Chinese Leader Xi Jinping personally asked the World Health Organization (WHO) to            delay declaring the disease a pandemic.“It was blocked very effectively from leaving [Wuhan] and going into China, but it went out to the rest of the world,” Trump said. “Why didn't they let us go in and help them fix it? So I'm very disappointed in China.” (RELATED: Democratic Witness In House Coronavirus Hearing Pleaded Guilty In 2019 Sex Abuse Case)When a reporter followed up to ask whether the administration had decided to pursue any punitive measures, the president declined to comment.“I don't talk about retaliation,” he said.Link to ImageWASHINGTON, DC - MAY 08: (L-R) White House Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, President Donald Trump and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) (Photo by Anna Moneymaker-Pool/Getty Images)Several Republican senators have pushed the envelope in holding China accountable for the pandemic, including Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse and Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley.Sasse and a group of Republicans introduced legislation to rename the Chinese Embassy's street in Washington, D.C after Dr. Li Wenliang, one of the first whistleblowers to alert the public to the disease in Wuhan.The Trump administration also accused Chinese-backed hackers of attempting to steal research on a coronavirus vaccine from U.S.-based companies last week, which Sasse also criticizes harshly. (RELATED: One Of Trump's Personal Valets Reportedly Tests Positive For Coronavirus)Chairman Xi is an arsonist who wants to steal a firetruck and play the hero,” he said in a statement to the Daily Caller. “The Chinese Communist Party will do whatever it takes to beat the United States to the vaccine, and it has nothing to do with saving lives and everything to do with selling propaganda. The Chinese Communist Party's domestic legitimacy and international clout depend on telling a phony story where China is the hero. It's the same reason they're lying about numbers, promoting conspiracy theories, and disappearing whistleblowers.”Hawley has also introduced legislation that would create a State Department task force to lead an international investigation into China, as well as allow American citizens to sue the Chinese government for damages incurred by the virus.“There is overwhelming evidence that the Chinese Communist Party's lies, deceit, and incompetence caused COVID-19 to transform from a local disease outbreak into a global pandemic,” Hawley said in a statement.Graphic President Trump at a cabinet meeting.

Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. Happy day to you.I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, May 28th.Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.U.S.-China tensions are rising once again. Beijing has approved a security law that completely strips freedoms from the people of Hong Kong. This after the U.S. State Department declared Hong Kong no longer autonomous from China. A bill calling for sanctions against China over human rights violations is headed to the President's desk his morning.And a grim milestone to report coronavirus deaths here in America surpassed 100,000.Today, another look at the economic impact of this pandemic. Jobless claims for the last week will be out in an hour-and-a-half. Also the second read on first quarter GDP is out. All coming at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. We will have the numbers and the market impact.Plus reaction this morning from U.S. Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia. He will join me live at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. Don't miss it.Ahead of the numbers, markets are mixed. Take a look at futures this morning indicating a mixed opening with the Dow Jones Industrial average higher and the S&P fractionally higher but the Nasdaq lower. As you can see, the Dow futures up 116 points right now.This on top of a big surge yesterday. Yesterday the Dow closed above 25,000 for the first time since March 10th. It was the winner of the day with the Dow up 553 points, the Nasdaq up 72, and the S&P up 44 at 4:00 on Wall Street.President Trump versus social media. The White House reportedly set to take executive action to hold companies responsible for stifling free speech.Plus major travel destinations are returning slowly but surely. Las Vegas resorts ready to welcome back guests. Disney World theme parks to reopen gates in mid-July. It might look like a whole new world inside however.Plus SeaWorld ready to make a splash in a couple of weeks.

It still needs the backing of a 27-member state commission, all 27 member states need to buy-in there.In Asia overnight markets were mixed. Investors are balancing on the one hand optimism over economies reopening but on the others and concerns over China clamping down on Hong Kong's freedom and the worsening relations between the U.S. and China.Joining the conversation this morning is Dagen McDowell, Cabot Phillips and Mark Tepper. And it is great to see everybody this morning.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Great to see you.MARK TEPPER, STRATEGIC WEALTH PARTNERS: Good morning.CABOT PHILLIPS, CAMPUSREFORM.ORG: Good morning.BARTIROMO: Some of the top stories that we are watching this morning.More than 100,000 Americans have now died from COVID-19. Recoveries in the United States have topped 391,000 people as more states have announced new steps to reopen.Beginning tomorrow Washington, D.C. will reopen outdoor dining as well as hair salons and barber shops in Washington. Residents in some Pennsylvania counties will also be able to eat inside restaurants beginning tomorrow. And in Maryland, outdoor dining, youth sports, even outdoor pools could reopen tomorrow as well.Six feet between people may not be enough to prevent the spread of COVID-19 indoors. Three experts now writing in the "Journal of Science" say small droplets of the deadly virus can still be carried in the air further than previously thought and can remain in the air for hours. That finding contradicting guidance from the World Health Organization which recommended six feet of social distance. Experts adding it highlights the importance of wearing a mask and widespread testing as well.Protests over the death of George Floyd turning violent overnight. One man was killed in Minneapolis as outraged Americans demand justice for the killing of the unarmed black man. Protesters seen in social media videos burning and looting businesses, officers using tear gas and rubber bullets to break up the crowds.In Los Angeles hundreds of protesters stopped traffic on the 101 freeway then shattered the windows of several police cruisers, jumping on patrol cars as well.Officers claim Floyd was resisting arrest. But there is a new video that appears to contradict that, showing Floyd cooperating as he was escorted to the cruiser. He died after an officer was shown moments after with his knee on Floyd's neck. President Trump is calling on the FBI to investigate Floyd's death right now.The Senate Judiciary Committee meanwhile announcing former deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein will testify next Wednesday as part of the probe into the origins of the Russia investigation into the Trump campaign. Rosenstein is expected to talk about new revelations included in Inspector General Michael Horowitz's report on the surveillance of President Trump's former campaign aide, Carter Page.Meanwhile on Capitol Hill, the House adjourned without voting on FISA reforms after President Trump threatened to veto the bill. The DOJ says the proposed reforms will, quote, "weaken national security tools". The House is set to reconvene at 9:00 a.m. Eastern today to take it up once again.A simple gesture by a UPS driver on Memorial Day goes viral. Video captured in the Oklahoma homeowner's front door camera, shows the driver rolling up an American flag that was snagged on a pole. The homeowner posted the video on Facebook, saying that several people have reached out to her including a veteran who says the gesture brought him to tears. A beautiful gesture it was.U.S.-China tensions escalating. China approves the decision to force a controversial national security law on Hong Kong. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo certifying to Congress yesterday Hong Kong no longer enjoys a high degree of autonomy from China, a move that could result in the loss of Hong Kong's special trading status with the United States, threatening its standing as an international financial hub and lead to heightened military tensions as wellJoining me right now is Arizona Senator, member of the Senate Armed Services and Banking Committees, and the author of the new memoir, "Dare to Fly: Simple Lessons in Never Giving Up". Martha McSally is here.Senator -- it's great to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.SENATOR MARTHA MCSALLY (R), ARIZONA: Absolutely. Good morning, Maria.BARTIROMO: You've been a real hawk on the bad behavior coming out of China. Talk to us about what we're seeing this morning in Hong Kong.MCSALLY: Well, we tried to encourage them not to do this but it's no surprise. They're now trampling on Hong Kong's rights, going against their 1984 agreement and, you know, moving against their freedoms and the special status that they have.The certification yesterday by Secretary Pompeo was in accordance with the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Law that we passed last year. This is a very dangerous direction that China is going in.It's not surprising. But if anybody had any concerns about Communist China and how reckless they are and how we need to work together to stop them, this should wake them up. In addition to them unleashing the coronavirus, lying about it and now we have over 100,000 Americans dead.BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. So you had your legislation. There are 60 bills right now in Congress, whether it be moving the supply chains out of China or holding individuals accountable with sanctions or pulling visas from students.How are we supposed to have a partnership, a business partnership, with the second largest economy in the world if we can't trust what they say?MCSALLY: Well, it's not a partnership unfortunately -- Maria. And I'm on most of those bills and leading on several of them. China has been on the rise. They've wanted to replace us. They're lying. They're cheating. They're stealing. And they're trampling on the rights of people.And so it's time for the world to wake up, Americans to unite, for us to stop China. We have to use all of our tools -- diplomatic tools, all of our economic tools. The window is closing and this is going to be a key issue in our election coming up in November.BARTIROMO: Yes. It's also a key issue in your Arizona senate race which is heating up. Let's talk about that because -- Senator, according to the latest poll from OH Predictive Insights, you're 13 points behind Mark Kelly, the former astronaut and husband to former Arizona representative, Gabrielle Giffords. How are you fighting to close the gap? What can you tell us about where his stance is on China relative to yours?MCSALLY: Yes. The only poll that matters is on Election Day -- Maria. And a key issue in this race is going to be, who do you trust to hold China accountable. And we have very different records on this between me and my opponent.I've never trusted communists. I never will in the future. But my opponent decided to go into business with them. They invested in him. He's invested in them.And look, I have not problem with people making a living but you have to ask yourself, is Mark Kelly ever going to stand up to the people to whom he's financially beholden? Of course he's not. And by the way neither is Joe Biden. And this is going to be a key issue in this race.We have very different views of Communist China. I'm leading to hold them accountable. We need to bring our manufacturing home. We need to clamp down on their human rights behavior. And the next time you see them throwing people into concentration camps and trampling on Hong Kong, you have to ask yourself, who can we trust to stand up against China. Is it my opponent who is financially invested with them or me who is standing up to them right now and is actually being threatened by the Chinese Communist because of my leadership on this issue?BARTIROMO: Yes. Your name was mentioned along with Tom Cotton -- that they were going to get you back in China, the China Communist Party, for all that you have been saying about them.The problem is many people don't understand that the Chinese Communist Party pays for influence. I mean there's a reason that they invest in certain companies in the United States. They want that technology. They want to steal data. They're stealing intellectual property as we speak according to Tom Cotton.MCSALLY: Exactly. And they also have threatened to meddle in our election in November. So that should give anybody an indication of who should you be with. Do you want to be with someone standing up for America or somebody who is invested in China?And this is absolutely critical and they've been doing it in plain sight for a long time -- Maria, and we need to stop it. Yes.BARTIROMO: I want to ask you about Google and suing Google for spying. But let me get Cabot Phillips in here, real quick. Cabot -- go ahead.PHILLIPS: Senator -- Cabot Phillips here. We talk about holding China accountable. State Department, White House have both come out and potentially talked about revoking visas for Chinese international students that might have ties to the military.But of the 370,000 plus students that come here from China each year, essentially they're all beholden to the Chinese military, because if, you know, called upon to enact, you know, espionage efforts for the Chinese government, they have to do that. So how can you differentiate between who is connected to the Chinese military and who is not when it comes to students from there?MCSALLY: This is exactly the issue. I'm deeply troubled by it. Again, they've been in our research universities. They've used programs in our military as well, in order to get fast tracks to citizenship.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCSALLY: It's time for us to wake up. They're stealing it outright but then we're allowing them to come and be involved in our universities. And I'm on legislation with Rick Scott -- we need a full national security review of this. They are our adversary.BARTIROMO: yes.MCSALLY: We would not have been doing this with the Soviet Union during the Cold War. It's time to wake up.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, it's interesting because you don't know. It's hard to differentiate.But I want to move to another issue and that is the spying in the social media. The Arizona attorney general claims that technology giants violating users' privacy by collection location data. They're collecting location data even if they had turned off their digital tracking.So Senator -- what about Google? How should Arizona fight back to protect citizens' information here and privacy?MCSALLY: Well, this is a deeply troubling report but it's also not surprising -- these big tech giants that are just, again taking people's personal information. We've had multiple experiences of them violating that. All while they're deleting and in this case YouTube anything critical of the Chinese Communist Party.So we can work together with the state and at the federal level, as individual's privacies must be protected here in America.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean people did not realize the power that some of these companies have given their reach.Look, you're out with a new memoir, "Dare to Fly" where you tell your story about the struggles that you faced to become the first U.S. woman to fly a fighter jet in combat. And as a U.S. Senator -- you're in a man's world this whole time. What's the biggest take-away? Tell us about that -- operating in a man's world -- Senator?MCSALLY: Well, Maria, I bring everyone into the cockpit of an a-10 Warthog. They can take their first takeoff with me, first flight solo, no two- seaters, no simulators, and off into a canyon in Afghanistan for one of my most complex missions.And you may not be able to relate to fly in a fighter but we can all relate to fear. So what I do is I just share my journey from being emotion chick side, (INAUDIBLE) to being the first woman to fly a fighter in combat.And everybody I think can relate to right now adversity. How do you overcome adversity? How do you find your own courage? And so I've got nuggets of wisdom in there from my own journey and I hope to be a wingman to the reader. They can go daretofly.us, get their book and also share their stories with me. I could use some encouragement every day too.BARTIROMO: All right. We all need that empowerment -- Senator. Thank you so much. Thanks for getting up early for us --MCSALLY: Thanks -- Maria.BARTIROMO: -- Senator in Arizona. Senator Martha McSally joining us this morning. We'll see you soon.We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Working from home. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaking out on the company's announcement that it will allow many employees to permanently work from home after the COVID-19 pandemic in an interview with Fox News' Dana Perino. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: A lot of the tools that we have, whether it's video conferencing or chat are pretty transactional, right. If you want to host a meeting or send a note to someone you can do that.But we don't have great tools yet that basically enable people to just hang out together and simulate hanging out around the water cooler or the white board and just brainstorm and stuff.And I think that that stuff will all need to get built. So those are things that we're focused on doing at Facebook both for internal tools for our own company.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Dagen McDowell -- your reaction.MCDOWELL: I worked from home when I was living in San Francisco briefly as a writer and it was the most miserable experience of my life because you don't have that social interaction that leads to creative thinking.I suspect long-term once there's a vaccine for this virus that there is a larger percentage of people who are still going into the office, even in technology, even in Silicon Valley, than they assume will work from home or be in the office in the next year or so.I just think that there's something truly magical that happens when you get a group of people together. And, come on, like I miss -- we're on the air together every day but I miss you being here. It's not -- it's just not the same.BARTIROMO: I miss you.MCDOWELL: You know, it's just not --BARTIROMO: Yes. It's not the same.MCDOWELL: -- it's just like you're feeding off of someone's kind of intangible vibe. And I think that there's great value in that.BARTIROMO: Well, we do that a lot with each other, that's for sure.But what about the six-foot rules? I mean now we're hearing that six feet is not even enough in terms of not being exposed to deadly droplets.So this is new information that we're getting today. We thought six feet distancing was enough. Now it's not.MCDOWELL: Right. And remember that the CDC said that the virus can be transmitted on surfaces. It reversed that --BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: -- and now it's reversed that. And now it's saying that it can be transmitted on surfaces. So if you want to build up greater distrust of government and edicts from national health organizations, well, they're doing a great job of it and people just don't know.And with that kind of uncertainty, many people will not feel safe going into a large workplace until there's clarity and right now it's as murky as New England clam chowder.BARTIROMO: Yes. Mark Tepper -- what do you think about that? I mean going back to work now, knowing that you're unsure about the six feet, you're unsure about the surfaces.TEPPER: So I agree with Dagen. I would much rather go into the office every day than to be locked in my home office at home, not talking to anyone, not socializing, not having that human to human interaction.But in my opinion, work from home is not a transitory thing, it's permanent. And even with the economy reopening, we're not just going to completely scrap this transformation. It was happening slowly anyways. And the lockdown really gave small businesses, large businesses, the perfect excuse to test drive work from home on a risk-free basis --BARTIROMO: Yes.TEPPER: -- and the results have really exceeded expectations.BARTIROMO: Yes. So increasingly we may very well see this last longer than we think. We'll see. We'll keep watching that.We'll take a break.When we come back, safety meets style. How face masks are changing the fashion landscape now, bringing in some big revenue for struggling retailers. We'll check it out.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Well, masks-- the top trend amid the coronavirus pandemic. Big brands, even small businesses taking the opportunity to enter a new world of fashion while helping the community at the same time.Gerri Willis is covering the story right now. Good morning -- Gerri.GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Hey, good morning -- Maria. That's right.So face masks are the new fashion "it" item. You have to have one, right. And they've gone from specialty item to big business.Prada, Louis Vuitton and Dior are selling them exclusively for medical workers. And that's giving hundreds of younger mid=market brands like Made Well and Rent the Runway the opportunity to pounce.For the big players though it's not all about the bottom line. It's about Insta. Listen First Media tells us, quote, "For many top fashion brands, the need around face masks represents more than opportunity to generate goodwill as opposed to a huge new revenue stream."Still small and medium size businesses are jumping at the opportunity. Trevor George predicting that mask sales will rival apparel sales over the next 18 months. His company TrevCo (ph) said to be the largest manufacturer of licensed apparel online. He sells millions of t-shirts embossed with comic book superheroes every single year, and he's selling twice as many masks as t-shirts right now.Gina Quatrine in L.A. repurposing Hermes scarves and selling them on Etsy. Her business is booming. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GINA QUATRINE, STARTED FASHION FOCUSED FACE MASK BUSINESS: Seven weeks I've been doing it. And I'm almost to $30,000. The face mask is something that really is I think going to become almost a fashion trend in a way. I've had people -- I've had one woman ordered 12 from me and another one ordered 10.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIS: Another top accessory designer Lele Sadoughi is diving into the masks game. The Duchess of Cambridge has worn one of her head bands and now Ivanka Trump wearing Lele Sadoughi masks. She says masks are here to stay.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LELE SADOUGHI, FASHION DESIGNER: I think that we are going to be wearing masks. I think it's still not something that is registering to us because it's something new and it's something that has not been in our wardrobe.Going into a crowded elevator or going on an airplane, I feel like that this is the accessory that you're going to want to have with you.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIS: And that's good news, particularly for luxury goods makers whose revenues are expected to decline by up to 39 percent this year. Masks costing anywhere from $50 to $500 won't make up for that but it will help.I want to show you my mask from Petite Palu (ph). This Maria -- a child's clothing maker up here in the Berkshires. She is making masks. And she says guess what -- this is allowing me to make my mortgage every month -- Maria.BARTIROMO: I love that. You're seeing more fashionable looks. Yours is very fashionable with the colors. Are we going to see this on the runway -- Gerri?WILLIS: Oh, I think so. You know, you're seeing the big houses actually are giving away masks to people who really need them but this is going to become more and more commonplace. People in the flu season will be wearing them. Watch out for more masks -- Maria.BARTIROMO: Yes. But Gerri -- are they all safe? Because some masks are thicker than others. I mean you just have like an Hermes scarf like one of the people that you interviewed -- is that going to be enough to cover your nose and mouth effectively?WILLIS: Well, so ok, look at this. This is a very soft fabric that I have here. This is not medical grade and none of them claim to be medical grade, frankly.BARTIROMO: That's what I'm saying.WILLIS: You know, they're not going to protect you completely. But it's something. And you are protecting other people with this, I believe.BARTIROMO: Ok. Well, maybe wear one of these cotton masks that are more prevalent and then put your designer one on top so there's that idea too.WILLIS: All right, then.BARTIROMO: Gerri -- thank you. There you go. Looking good. Gerri Willis -- looking good. All right. We will see you soon.Coming up, I'll speak with the SeaWorld entertainment interim CEO Marc Swanson this morning as the park details its plans to reopen to the public.Stay with us.MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS HOST, MORNINGS WITH MARIA: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, May 28th.

It is now over. Cheryl Casone with the details. Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: That's right Maria. Peter Manfradonia was captured in Maryland after six days on the run. The University of Connecticut arrested near a gas station in Hagerstown last night. This happened just hours after he was spotted in a Pennsylvania convenience store near the Maryland border. A gun believed to be used in one murder was actually found nearby. Manfradonia had been evading capture since last Friday. He's accused of killing two people, including his own childhood friend.Well, Joe Biden is planning to announce his choice for Vice President by August 1st. The presumptive Democratic Presidential nominee speaking during an online fundraiser yesterday said that his campaign is in the process of deciding the basic cut. Biden, who has promised to pick a woman as his running mate, says his staff has interviewed candidates on his short list. This includes Senator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Amy Klobuchar and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.And here's a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com. The highest paid CEO's of 2019. Advanced Micro Devices' Lisa Su topping that list at $58.5 million. Coronavirus restrictions inspired Miami Botox drive through. Doctor Michael Salzhauer offers Botox, it's 300 bucks, you got to schedule an appointment. You can't have any coronavirus symptoms either. And then there's this, Tom Brady's customized Cadillac Escalade is on sale for $300,000 dollars. It's the 2018 ESV Edition. It's got reclining VIP seats. A 32 inch LCD screen. A mobile internet router, and well, look it's just, it's owned by Tom Brady, I mean, I actually buried the lead. It's just Tom Brady's car, so I'm wondering what it's going to go for. Thing's going to be a lot more than 300k. I'm just saying, look at that thing Maria. That's crazy. Wow.BARTIROMO: That is beautiful Cheryl.CASONE: It looks like the interior of an airplane. I feel like I'm flying.BARTIROMO: It's really nice. So big. That's funny. Cheryl, thank you.CASONE: You bet.BARTIROMO: Alright, we want to look at reopening America this morning. SeaWorld Entertainment detailing new guidelines and plans to get the Orlando park open once again. That will begin on June 11th. The rules were approved yesterday by a county task force in tandem with Disney World's tiered opening starting in July. But the plan still needs to get the Okay from Governor Ron DeSantis. Joining me right in a Fox Business exclusive, SeaWorld Entertainment interim CEO Marc Swanson. Mark, great to see you. Thanks so much for joining us. There are several steps and rules being put in place for all 12 SeaWorld parks. Can you walk us through them?MARC SWANSON, INTERIM CEO, SEAWORLD ENTERTAINMENT: Yeah, great to be here. Thanks for having me Maria. And we did have a great meeting yesterday in Orlando with Mayor Demings and the task force. And they did endorse our plan to open on June 11. And that will go to Governor DeSantis and I know he's a big fan of tourism and in fact we had him in town last week with Vice President Pence. And I think they were really supportive of getting the tourism industry here in Florida back open again. And it was great to see them. So, we've received wonderful support here in Florida at all levels. And then the Federal level has been great as well, and we'll continue to move forward in the other states as we move through those different phases of eventually getting reopened.BARTIROMO: You know that Governor DeSantis wants you to open. He just wants to make sure to do it safely. When I spoke with him a couple of weeks ago, he described the impact of things like SeaWorld as well as Disney being closed in terms of such an important industry of tourism. How significant is this damage for Sea World Parks longer term? Because throughout this, obviously, the company has had, you know, less of an ability to invest in new rides, new attractions, pent up demand for the theme park, certainly will be there, but are you seeing long term damage?SWANSON: Well the companies had a couple of really good years. 2018 and 2019 we really had strong growth overall. And the start to this year, was really strong as well through the first two months of February. And, you know, obviously the pandemic we had to shut down all our parks in mid- March. But I'm confident as we get to the other side of this, we're going to be able to get back, on executing the strategies that have made us grow the last couple of years, you know, marketing and communications, new rides and attractions, ticketing strategies. All those things, I think, can come back on the other side of this, and I think we'll continue to be the leader in the regional parks base of growing our business and continuing to provide great times for a lot of people.BARTIROMO: When would you see normalized activity? I mean, we know that, you know, once you open is not necessarily the green light for guests to feel comfortable again and start acting the way were acting. There are analysts out there, certainly at JP Morgan, who think normalized activity in the parks won't happen until late in 2021. Is that what you expect?SWANSON: Well we look at survey, and, you know, our surveys tell us people are anxious to get out. And I think, you know, you've seen that across the country. And people want to come and have a good time at theme parks. We can do it in a safe manner. We've been operating our parks for decades. And so, we're excited to welcome people. We know there's demand. And we know there's people who want to come out and have a good time with their family and friends. So, look, it's not going to be, you know, sold out right from the beginning. We know that, but I do think over time, people are going to get more comfortable. One thing about our parks that I think is important to know is, you know, the majority, the vast majority of our attendance, when you look across the company, comes from people who can actually drive to our parks. I think that's really going to help us as we get reopened. People will be able to drive. Come down to our parks and have a good time.BARTIROMO: Yeah, I think that's a really important point that you make. Because, there's a difference in terms of where you are, in terms of the ease with reopening. I mean, if you look at Orlando, or even San Antonio, people feel that it's easier to have a reopening with no incidence there versus other places where perhaps they're a little more stringent or have had more cases. Like, for example, San Diego, governments have detailed different reopening phases there. Can you characterize the different states, and which one would be poised to open soonest?SWANSON: Well certainly, you know, we've presented the plans in Florida for Orlando, and then we'll be, we'll also be presenting plans for our parks down in Tampa, I think some of you may not know we actually the Busch Gardens parks as well. And those are great parks, ones in Tampa, and ones in Virginia. And then in Texas we have a couple parks as well. And I think, you know, water parks there are going to be opening here this weekend, and you know, we'll see about getting our water park Aquatica open, and in SeaWorld hopefully sometime after will be continuing to have good conversations with the authorities there. Really in all the others states, you know California, Pennsylvania, Virginia, the other we're in, we just continue to have really good dialogue, really good conversations. And when its safe to do so, we look forward to getting open.BARTIROMO: Well, what about the social distancing issues, Marc. I mean, this morning we hear from the CDC that six feet between people may not be enough. That deadly droplets can stay in the air and you need a larger space between people than six feet. How do you deal with that at an amusement park?SWANSON: Well physical distancing at our parks, you know, our parks are largely outdoor experiences, so I think we can create that space and you're going to see markings and signage and things like that, that will remind people to keep that distance. And we'll have other measures as well. We'll have clear sanitation. We'll have masks. We'll have temperature screening. All those things that I think are important to make people feel safe. We feel good about our ability to be able to do that. If you think about just how big our parks are. Being able to walk around. Even coming in to see a show or presentation, we can stagger the seating's and people can get in there and really have a good time.BARTIROMO: How are you going to get out of this? Are you going to be raising prices once we get out of this?SWANSON: We've had a lot of work the last couple years on pricing strategies. I think people, you know, we'll continue to work on that. You know, there's a lot of different ways we offer value to people. I think our parks offer tremendous value with season pass, and multi day tickets, and we'll continue to employ strategies that provide a great value for our guests and allow them to come and have a good time. And hopefully come more than once.BARTIROMO: Alright, Marc, it's certainly a moment in time, where I know that its been challenged, but we wish you best. Marc, it's good to see you this morning. Thank you, sir.SWANSON: Thank you so much. It's good talking to you.BARTIROMO: Marc Swanson joining us from SeaWorld this morning. Coming up, getting back to work. I'll talk with the CEO of one charity organization going the extra mile in helping women re-enter the workforce. You'll want to hear this. And don't miss Fox Businesses America Works Together, Virtual Town Hall, hosted by Stuart Varney today. It all starts at 11 a.m. Eastern. Stuart will be answering your questions on managing finances for your small business amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Do join us, viewers can submit questions to investedinyou@foxbusiness.com Your question may very well be featured later today. Join us. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. More layoffs amid the COVID-19 economic downturn. American Airline says that it will be cutting 30 percent of management and administrative staff. That is about 5,000 jobs at American Airlines. Boeing announcing it is eliminating more than 12,000 jobs in the United States. The stock is surging this morning after the company says that it is resuming the 737 Max production. Up 5 1/4 percent, and of course that was a major problem, Mark, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, so Boeing has its work cut out for it.MARK TEPPER, PRESIDENT AND CEO, STRATEGIC WEALTH PARTNERS: Boeing definitely does, yeah. I mean, the 737 Max has been a problem for quite some time, and now, you add into the mix the fact that there are less people flying right now. You've got a bunch of aircraft sitting around not being used. They don't need repairs. Not a lot of airlines right now are looking to purchase new aircraft, because they're in the process of laying people off. You know, and most flights right are less than 50 percent full. If you're able to make a drive from one place to the next, I think more people are going to be more likely to do that. And with higher unemployment, will consumers pay for discretionary items like flights? I think these are all headwinds for that industry.BARTIROMO: Well also, the fact that the flights are going to be changed, you know, data from the most recent week of operation shows that the majority of US Airline flights are less than 50 percent full. So, some travelers are seeing high priced flights and more layovers, Cabot, so are you going to go and take a flight, putting the security concerns aside, just from the fact that you've got a big issue here. Not enough people are on flights. There are going to be more layovers. And there going to be more expensive.CABOT PHLLIPS, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, CAMPUSREFORM.ORG: Yeah, I think that's another part people aren't look at is the fact that it's not like people are going to be getting the same product that they were before all of this. So, in addition to the health concerns, they have to keep in mind, well I might have a three hour layover. So, now that end up not being as convenient as even driving, or just not having that trip. You bring up the discretionary spending element, and I think we might see certain industries be able to quickly bounce back from this. Restaurants I think, going to be getting up and running, we're seeing theme parks do the same.But when it comes to airlines, if there's anywhere that people are deathly afraid of getting sick, even before all of this people, you know, very aware of how dirty airplanes were and the potential for being stuck in all that stale air for a few hours. That's only going to magnify it after this. And I don't think that fear element of this is going to go away as quickly in the airline industry as it would for others. So, I think it's going to be some time before this ramps us and I think this might just be the first set in a whole round of future layoffs here.BARTIROMO: Dagen.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, having been seated next to a gentleman who had an open raging visible staph infection all over his body, that I had to force Delta to remove him from a flight.BARTIROMO: Oh my god.MCDOWELL: This was years ago. The airlines are in this vicious cycle where the more that they cut flights, the more crowded the aircraft that are in the air become. And that means that individuals are not going to get on a plane that's one, expensive, and two, packed to the brim. So, their cut back in capacity is going to discourage people from flying potentially. These airlines have a long way to go to prove to the American people and the flyer that they are safe when they board an aircraft.BARTIROMO: Yeah, alright, it's a good point. We'll take a break. When we come back. Getting back to work. I will speak with the CEO of one charity organization going the extra mile in helping women reenter the workforce. Right after this. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Women hit hardest by job losses during this pandemic. Data shows that the unemployment rate among women rose to 16.2 percent in the month of April. Nearly three percentage points higher than men. Dress for Success has been helping women get hired for more than two decades providing business attire and tools that they need to land the big job. Now they're pivoting to offer women virtual coaching, networking and workshops to help maintain financial stability, even in this uncertain time. Joining me right now is Dress for Success Worldwide CEO Joi Gordon. Joi, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for being here. Tell me about this program. How many of your clients have lost their jobs during this time and how is this new pivot resonating?JOI GORDON, CEO, DRESS FOR SUCCESS WORLDWIDE: What we've heard is that in Dress for Success is in over 150 cities, 25 countries around the world. And what we've heard is that over 53 percent of our women are facing food insecurities, and more than 77 percent are really struggling to figure out what their future looks like. So, the impact on our organization is really extraordinary right now.BARTIROMO: So, tell me about the virtual services that you're offering right now.GORDON: Well, what we did pretty quickly was to realize that closing our doors was not an option to the women we serve. We needed to pivot our programs and to operate in a virtual environment. And it wasn't just about providing her virtual coaches and career seminars and webinars and Zoom classes. But it was really to also combat isolation. What we didn't want her to be is isolated. So, we needed to bring a community of women together who were facing the same challenges and provide her with the tools she needed to succeed. And that's what we've been doing. We pretty much just shifted and pivoted almost instantly, and we did that around the world.BARTIROMO: Dagen, jump in.MCDOWELL: Joi, what do you need from people right now? I'm sitting here listening. I'm just going to go to my office and I'm going to box up all the clothes that I hope other women can use. That I can send to you. But for viewers, what do you need right now? And what do the women who you help need?GORDON: Well, thanks for asking that question, and yes, we often need the clothing from women like you who dress smart and have the outfits to be able to provide for Dress for Success. And so, we need that, but we first have to figure out how we can accept those clothing's and whether or not its safe to accept clothing. So, we ask you to hold on to your boxes of clothing right now. We really want to really ramp up our services and our virtual programs and so we need volunteers. We need people to reach out to us, maybe HR professionals, women like yourself, and even men, who care and are compassionate about the lives of the women who are out there.We have a record number of women and men in unemployment right now, and we want to make sure that we're upscaling these women. So, when the job market comes back that they're ready for the jobs that are out there for them. And so, we need coaches, we need classes, we just need support from all.BARTIROMO: Yeah, it's great. It's great advice and everybody needs that, by the way. Women and men. But we're happy that you're there sort of representing all women. Joi, great to see you. We will be watching the developments. Thanks so much. Smart pivot there.GORDON: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Joi Gordon joining us there. Dress for Success. Still ahead, I'll speak with former National Economic Council Director Gary Cohen on his expectations for economic recovery. Getting this economy back on track. That's next hour, right here. Mornings with Maria. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, May 28.

This after the State Department declared Hong Kong no longer is autonomous from China. A bill calls for sanctions against China over human rightsLoad-Date: May 28, 2020End of Document

Twitter disputes State Department claims China coordinated coronavirus disinformation accountsCNN.comMay 8, 2020 Friday 4:46 PM ESTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 922 wordsByline: By Jennifer Hansler, Donie O'Sullivan and Kylie Atwood, CNNBodyTwitter pushed back on an assertion from the US State Department Friday that it was "highly probable" that the Chinese government coordinated networks of Twitter accounts to disseminate disinformation related to the coronavirus outbreak, saying their initial review of the accounts in question does not support the government's claims.Lea Gabrielle, head of the State Department's Global Engagement Center (GEC) -- which works to coordinate efforts to expose foreign disinformation and propaganda -- said the US "has uncovered a new network of inauthentic Twitter accounts, which we assess were created with the intent to amplify Chinese propaganda and disinformation."However, an initial review from Twitter of more than 5,000 accounts turned over to them by the State Department cast doubt on the claims. According to Twitter, they have instead found that numerous accounts belong to government entities, nongovernmental organizations, and journalists. The review was ongoing, the company said, noting that it planned to follow up with the GEC on its findings.A State Department spokesperson told CNN that "the GEC provided Twitter with a small sample of the overall dataset that included nearly 250,000 accounts," adding that it was "was not surprising that there are authentic accounts in any sample.""Our overall analysis is based on a confluence of factors that drive our assessment, which we stand by," they said.Gabrielle said in a statement to CNN that "the GEC looks forward to further collaboration with Twitter on this latest example of inauthentic activity, as well as on future cases."The GEC's latest assertions come as China has faced serious criticism over its handling of the outbreak which originated in country. The State Department has led an aggressive campaign aimed at calling out Beijing for a lack of transparency and pushing disinformation.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has repeatedly accused China of withholding key information about the virus, particularly in its early stages, and has claimed without public evidence that it may have escaped from a lab in Wuhan."It is critical that like-minded countries and free societies call out Beijing's use of disinformation and propaganda during this crisis to prevent these behaviors becoming the norm for Beijing," Gabrielle told CNN.Friday was not the first time a Silicon Valley company has expressed skepticism about the GEC. In February the GEC claimed it had evidence linking coronavirus misinformation to Russia -- senior employees at Facebook and Twitter at the time publicly implored the State Department to share evidence to support the claims."We welcome the opportunity to collaborate with the government agencies and build on our joint efforts to address a shared threat. Twitter will continue its zero-tolerance approach to platform manipulation and any other attempts to undermine the integrity of our service," a Twitter spokesperson said Friday. "When we identify information operation campaigns that we can reliably attribute to state-backed activity ? either domestic or foreign-led ? we disclose them to the public."Gabrielle told reporters on a call Friday that the GEC made their assessment about the accounts based on their "characteristics, content and behavior." She also noted that they examine whether the "accounts are being created during and doing most of their activity during Beijing business hours," and said this was the case for the accounts she described."We also assess that this is a coordinated and interconnected effort. Nearly every diplomatic account shares at least one follower with every other account, with some instances of diplomatic accounts sharing more than 1,000 followers," she said.In a follow-up response to CNN, Gabrielle said that "a significant portion of these 'follower accounts' are newly created - and align with China's push to convince various global audiences of their global leadership.""Additionally, these accounts are pushing pro-CCP (Chinese Communist Party) narratives - praising China's fight against the virus, claims that China promptly reported the outbreak to WHO, and accusations the Western media of providing bad coverage of China," she said.Twitter also disputed this saying that some of the accounts provided by the State Department had actually tweeted opposition to Chinese positions.Gabrielle described China using these bot networks of automated accounts as a "one-way megaphone."

She confirmed State shared the accounts with Twitter.Beijing has overtly promoted some conspiracy theories, including amplification by Chinese Communist Party media of a false claims that a US Army reservist was responsible for the start of the pandemic.Earlier in March, the State Department summoned the Chinese ambassador in Washington over the promotion of conspiracy theories by a prominent Chinese official.Gabrielle told reporters that the GEC has seen continued convergence between Chinese and Russian disinformation. As one example, she said both Chinese and Russian proxies had recirculated "false narratives about US-funded biolabs in the former Soviet Union."She could not say whether there was active coordination between the two governments on disinformation. However, she said that even before the pandemic, "we saw some level of coordination between the PRC and Russia," citing agreements between Russian state news outlet Sputnik and Chinese state media outlets.Load-Date: May 8, 2020End of Document

China's Huawei warns more US pressure may spur retaliationAssociated Press Financial WireMarch 31, 2020 Tuesday 11:47 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 842 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Huawei's chairman warned Tuesday that more U.S. moves to increase pressure on the Chinese tech giant might trigger retaliation by Beijing that could damage its worldwide industry.Huawei Technologies Ltd., which makes smartphones and network equipment, reported that its 2019 sales rose by double digits despite curbs imposed in May on its access to U.S. components and technology. But the chairman, Eric Xu, said 2020 will be its "most difficult year" as Huawei struggles with the sanctions and the coronavirus pandemic.Huawei is at the center of tensions with Washington over China's technology ambitions and possible spying that helped to spark Trump's tariff war with Beijing in 2018.Xu said he couldn't confirm news reports President Donald Trump might try to extend controls to block access to foreign-made products that contain U.S. technology. Xu said Huawei can find other sources but warned more pressure might trigger Chinese retaliation against American companies."I think the Chinese government will not just stand by and watch Huawei be slaughtered," Xu said at a news conference in the southern city of Shenzhen. He said U.S. pressure on foreign suppliers "will be destructive to the global technology ecosystem.""If the Chinese government followed through with countermeasures, the impact on the global industry would be astonishing," Xu said. "It's not only going to be one company, Huawei, that could be destroyed."Huawei, China's first global tech brand, denies U.S. accusations the company is controlled by the ruling Communist Party or facilitates Chinese spying. The company says it is owned by the 104,572 members of its 194,000-member workforce who are Chinese citizens.Chinese officials say the Trump administration is abusing national security claims to restrain a rival to U.S. tech companies.Last year's sales rose 19.1% over 2018 to 858.8 billion yuan ($123 billion), in line with the previous year's 19.5% gain, the company reported. Profit increased 5.6% to 62.7 billion yuan ($9 billion), decelerating from 2018's 25% jump.Huawei had to spend heavily to replace American components in its products and find new suppliers after Trump on May 16 approved the sanctions that if fully enforced could cut off access to most U.S. components and technology. Washington has granted extensions for some products, but Huawei says it expects the barriers to be enforced.The company, the world's No. 2 smartphone brand behind Samsung, said 2019 handset sales rose 15% to 240 million units.Demand for Huawei smartphones in markets outside China weakened "very fast" after the May 16 order, Xu said. He said its consumer unit lost at least an estimated $10 billion in potential sales, but the business started to bounce back in the final quarter of 2019.Xu said it was impossible to forecast this year's handset sales until the spreading coronavirus pandemic is brought under control.Huawei phones can keep using Google's popular Android operating system, but future models are barred from using its music and other popular services. That undercuts Huawei's competitiveness versus Samsung and other Android-based phones.Huawei is creating its own services to replace Google and says its system had 400 million active users in 170 countries by the end of 2019. It needs to persuade developers to write applications for its new system, a challenge in an industry dominated by Android and Apple's iOS-based applications.Xu said Huawei hopes Google applications can run on the Chinese company's system and be distributed on the American company's online store.Huawei also is, along with Sweden's LM Ericsson and Nokia Corp. of Finland, a leading developer of fifth-generation, or 5G, technology. It is meant to expand networks to support self-driving cars, medical equipment and other futuristic applications, which makes the technology more intrusive and politically sensitive.The Trump administration wants European governments and other U.S. allies to avoid Huawei equipment when they upgrade to 5G. Australia, Taiwan and some other governments have imposed curbs on using Huawei technology, but Germany and some other nations say it will be allowed to bid on contracts.The company has unveiled its own processor chips and smartphone operating system, reducing its vulnerability to American export controls. The company issued its first smartphone phone last year, based on Huawei chips instead of U.S. technology.Huawei also is embroiled in legal conflicts with Washington.Its chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, who is Ren's daughter, is being held in Vancouver, Canada, for possible extradition to face U.S. charges related to accusations Huawei violated trade sanctions on Iran.Separately, U.S. prosecutors have charged Huawei with theft of trade secrets, accusations the company denies.The company, headquartered in the southern city of Shenzhen, also has filed lawsuits in American courts challenging government attempts to block phone carriers from purchasing its equipment.___Huawei Technologies Ltd.: www.huawei.comLoad-Date: April 1, 2020End of Document

Russia and China are manipulating information about coronavirus on social media around the worldCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 7, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1320 wordsBodyRussia and China are taking advantage of the coronavirus epidemic that spreads around the world for their political benefit. It is not new that these countries have enormous resources to manipulate information that is disseminated through social networks. Neither did they interfere in the US presidential election. But this time, they got into the health of millions of people. They're not the only ones, either. US President Donald Trump also made his contribution by spreading false information about the epidemic in television interviews and in their usual tweets. International politics exploits widespread fear of a virus that is advancing and killing to manipulate public opinion.US officials have been warning for weeks that through its huge network of hackers and trolls Russia is trying to impose the idea that the Covid-19 coronavirus "was developed by the CIA and 'planted' in China" or that "a secret laboratory of the The U.S. government had an accident and let out the virus they were developing to attack Moscow and Beijing." These and other examples were presented to a House committee by Lea Gabrielle, coordinator of the Global Engagement Center, the State Department's counter-propaganda office. He also revealed that nearly 2 million tweets over a three-week period fueled conspiracy theories related to coronavirus.Prevention by coronavirus at Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport. The Kremlin tries to impose on social media conspionitative theories such as that the virus was "fabricated" by the Bill Gates Foundation. REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov (MAXIM SHEMETOV/)Gabrielle said that messages linked to Russia, through "state-made websites" and fake online accounts, were part of an effort to "take advantage of a health crisis, where people are terrorized around the world, to try to impose their priorities." The previous week, State Department sources had already accused the Kremlin of using fake profiles on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to spread false rumors about the coronavirus, such as that the CIA had developed the virus as a weapon Biological. "By spreading disinformation about coronavirus, the 'Russian evil actors' once again choose to threaten public safety rather than focus on the global health response," Philip Reeker, Undersecretary of State for Europe and Eurasia.Those same Russian-based social media accounts released fake news during the last Democratic primary election: "Reminder, Biden and Bloomberg voters, #supertuesday's primaries were passed on to Wednesday because of the coronavirus epidemic. Please retweet to broadcast. #teambiden #teambloomberg." Others, taking advantage of the fact that coronavirus particularly affects older people, spread that "voters over the age of sixty should refrain from going to vote to avoid contagion." The interpretation of media analysts is that Vladimir Putin's administration was trying to shore up Bernie Sanders' candidacy as he did four years ago with Donald Trump's. An investigation by NBC correspondent Kevin Collier shows that the Facebook platform has already deployed a strategy to protect its users fromthe possibility that conspiracy theories about coronavirus or other false information about the spread of the disease could be used to deter voters from not going to the polls in the Democratic primary or the general election November. Facebook is also closely monitoring sick posts and advertisements on its platform. Among other things, they are showing "educational pop-ups" to all those looking for information about coronavirus and blocking ads that offer "magic products" to prevent contagion or those who sell "masks that give 100% protection."Prime Minister Boris Johnson visiting the Mologic Laboratory at Bedford Technology Park. Western governments try to counter propaganda issued by Russian hackers. Jack Hill/REUTERS. (POOL/)According to the Global Engagement Center, Russia uses to spread fake news about the disease the same accounts and platforms it used to spread "fake news" about the Syrian war, the revolt of France's Yellow Vests or the protests in Chile. One of the most "successful" messages from that hacking and troll machine is that blames the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for "developing the virus to be used as a biological weapon."China has also been using the Internet to control history for its own benefit. According to a report released this week by researchers from the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab entitled "Censored contagion: how coronavirus information is handled on Chinese social media," the Beijing government manipulates messages through censorship of keywords related to the topic on Chinese social media and platforms.The Livestreaming YY platform and the WeChat messaging service have been imposing pro-government censorship for months. And, he chose a set of keywords that could not be mentioned in his messages and stored them within the application itself. Canadian researchers reverse-engineered the application and found the full list, which includes Chinese characters for phrases such as "Wuhan's Unknown Pneumonia" and "Wuhan Seafood Market". As early as December 31, weeks before the Chinese government revealed the existence of the epidemic, censorship was underway.Russian hackers maintain an oiled computer machinery that allows them to launch fake news across networks for the benefit of Kremlin policies.WeChat, manipulated the messages through the company's own servers. This made it more difficult for Canadian computer scientists to find the keys that could not be mentioned, but they did so through extracting the content of the articles from the covers of a set of 31 news sources based in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong , including People's Daily, South China Morning Post, China National Radio and China Central Television. They then sent the texts to a group chatWeChat consists of three different test accounts: one registered in China and two registered in Canada. In this way they found that what could be read in the Chinese account was censored and that this censorship did not reach the Canadian servers. Every time it appeared in Chinese characters the combination of words such as "Epidemic + Pneumonia + Xi Jinping + Central Committee" or "Epidemic + President Xi + Unity" immediately disappeared from the network. Another group of censored keyword combinations are "Wuhan + CCP + Crisis + Beijing", "Wuhan + Virus + Human to Human Transmission", "Centers for Disease Control + United States + Coronavirus". Then, when the epidemic spread from Wuhan and ended up in quarantine for millions of people, messages containing the combination "Pneumonia + Virus + Quarentena + Disease Control + Travel Ban" were automatically deleted and then, " Barbijos + Taiwan + Export + Virus" or "Death + Pneumonia + Wuhan. The name of the late doctor Li Wenliang, who was the first to denounce the epidemic, also appeared to have been censored and harassed by government agents.Russia and China use the same weapons for online misinformation, although their targets are different. True to its style, Russia's approach to manipulation is more focused on influencing behavior and causing panic outside its own borders, while China's strict censorship of coronavirus-related content is primarily targeted to their own population, prevent panic and prevent citizens from pointing to the authorities as responsible. And beyond the Russian-Chinese goals, for international coexistence and the global struggle against an epidemic like that of Covid-19, the manipulations of both countries appear to be too dangerous for their populations and the rest of the world.MORE ON THIS THEME:Before the coronavirus, China handled another epidemic under absolute secrecyChinese scientists found two types of coronavirus, one more dangerous than the other: but the work raised more doubts than certaintiesEverything you need to know about the coronavirusLoad-Date: March 8, 2020End of Document

In favour of global health diplomacyCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 9, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1018 wordsBodyOne of the characteristics of an effective foreign policy is that it runs in the background, it is neither striking nor especially visible. Governments must urgently take this approach to stop the growing global panic caused by the coronavirus outbreak. The virus has spread to nearly half a hundred countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently declared the outbreak a global health emergency.For the moment, panic reigns. Global technology companies, such as Google, Apple, Facebook and Tesla, have temporarily suspended their operations in China and asked their employees to work from home. Many foreign airlines, automakers, retail and entertainment chains, and financial institutions have taken similar measures. And in the United States, asian citizens and students face a wave of xenophobic commentary on their food, culture and way of life.In addition, many countries have joined the United States in temporarily denying entry to foreigners who have recently travelled within China. However, leading global health experts argue that restrictive policies such as these, which are often reserved for life-threatening situations, are unlikely to stop the spread of what WHO has now dubbed Covid-19.Instead, these measures have stoked panic among investors. Most Chinese stocks on stock markets fell sharply when trading resumed after China's New Year's party, and some market indices suffered their biggest single-day falls in more than a decade. Because China is the world's second-largest economy, these financial losses will have a global impact. In addition, Covid-19's disruptive impact on labor markets, travel, and factory production will harm the operations of global companies that depend on China's manufacturing force and supply chains.The crisis is a reminder of why governments should regard health as an essential component of foreign policy. Indeed, much of the current panic could have been avoided if political leaders had gone after achieving global diplomacy.Strategies that are likely to be most effective in addressing this and future epidemics will require governments and other actors to cooperate more closelyIn the past, governments have recognized the role of health as a crucial instrument of foreign policy, including the 2007 Oslo Ministerial Declaration. However, the implementation of this idea has become increasingly difficult due to the global rise of far-right nationalism, which poses diplomats with the challenge of maintaining friendly relations with allies demonized by their own governments.Impulsive foreign policies aimed at addressing this crisis—such as a travel ban and the suspension of economic activities—are not only not supported by scientific evidence, but are likely to be harmful to long-term. Conversely, soft power, or a country's ability to shape the preferences of others through persuasion and diplomacy, is often much more effective.In fact, three of the strategies that are likely to be most effective in dealing with this and future epidemics will require governments and other actors to cooperate more closely, establish deep mutual trust, and develop platforms that promote the free dissemination of evidence-based scientific data.1. Health, a public goodGlobalFor a start, health should be considered a global public good. Countries with robust systems for collecting and disseminating scientific research should establish collaborative networks whereby low- and middle-income countries can report and publish information on outbreaks Infectious. Fortunately, major international medical journals, including The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine, are collecting data. This is critical, because the new coronavirus has not been the only outbreak that has spread globally in recent weeks; there is also an epidemic of misinformation, especially on social media.2. Avoid stigmasSecond, countries where potential outbreaks originate should not be stigmatized. Governments need to create formal and confidential channels through which officials can freely share information on new health risks or potential outbreaks.Covid-19 has spread so widely, partly because the Chinese government was politically embarrassed and initially suppressed the information when Wuhan doctors sounded the alarm about infectious cases. While countries have a variety of mechanisms in place to inform the public about health-related risks, more coordinated global health diplomacy could have mitigated the impact of the epidemic.3. Shared data managementThird, governments should invest in the creation of data management systems to track the spread of epidemics, preferably in real time. These might resemble the innovation dashboard created by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering to track the outbreak. This chart collects data from WHO, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and its European and Chinese counterparts, and China's National Health Commission, all in real time. This data is vital to help governments make informed decisions about how best to deal with the virus.In a globalized world, we cannot afford to ignore the health risks that arise in other countries. Therefore, the governments of rich countries in particular should not regard increased globalization and interdependence as a purely economic phenomenon that allows companies to establish manufacturing and supply chain operations in the middle- and low-income economies. Privileged countries also have a responsibility to establish support mechanisms to help others cope with new health threats.Faced with a global epidemic, political leaders must be guided by scientific evidence and compassion, not by anecdotes and xenophobia. An enlightened global health diplomacy could save countless lives.Junaid Nabi is a public health researcher at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston.English translation: Rocío L.

Chinese tourists overrun mountain as Beijing claims COVID-19 under controlUPIApril 6, 2020 Monday 9:49 AM ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 337 wordsByline: ELIZABETH SHIMDateline: April 6 BodyThrongs of Chinese vacationers are hiking in national parks despite official government warnings against gathering in crowds, according to multiple press reports.Chinese authorities eased restrictions against movement last month, when the government began to claim the epidemic that began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan was under control.According to Beijing's official data, there are less than 82,000 cases of the novel coronavirus in the country, and fewer than 3,400 deaths, a number lower than Iran, Britain, France or the United States.The Chinese government has warned against public gatherings, however, and the mixed messages could be encouraging the general public to take greater liberties following a nationwide shutdown.Authorities have promoted social distancing measures, but photos uploaded over the weekend on Chinese social media indicate tens of thousands of tourists are inundating popular attractions, according to South Korean news agency Yonhap's Beijing correspondent.On Weibo, Chinese users uploaded pictures and videos of crowds gathering at West Lake in Hangzhou. Others posted pictures of people hiking up Huangshan, a mountain range in Anhui Province in eastern China.The pictures quickly went viral and commenters were quick to condemn the people ignoring social distancing measures."Although the COVID-19 pandemic has stabilized in China, places are already full of tourists," one Chinese commenter said. "They appear to be wishing for the resurgence of the virus."In Anhui, visitors were encouraged to travel to sites by the provincial government, which had been granting free entry to 29 locations, the South China Morning Post reported.Before being admitted to parks, people were required to report their health status, wear masks and have their body temperature checked, according to the report.The provincial government decided to close the parks on Sunday.Chinese authorities may have been concerned extending restrictions against travel would have an impact on the local economy.Load-Date: April 6, 2020End of Document

CRU: Chinese EV Sales Hit by the Covid-19 OutbreakPR NewswireMarch 26, 2020 Thursday 7:45 AM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 572 wordsDateline: LONDON, March 26, 2020 BodyPR NewswireThe global outbreak of coronavirus Covid-19 has killed more than 15,000 people and has put millions into isolation. Notwithstanding the human cost, the effect on markets has been pronounced.The pandemic has hit the Chinese EV sector hard, and CRU believes that weak sales will last at least until early Q2 2020. Nonetheless, we continue to forecast Chinese EV sales growth in 2020 over 2019's total.EV sales in China dropped 75.2% y/y in February, with a decline of 79.1% for the whole Chinese auto industry. This was a far steeper fall than many expected but in line with our warnings in our previous analysis.CRU expects the Chinese EV market will remain becalmed until at least April. This is based on our market calls, analysis of the epidemic timeline and the review of the necessary measures the Chinese government has taken to fight Covid-19. Despite the steady decline of case numbers in China, many consumers continue to be wary of visiting dealerships. However, it is worth noting that the subdued sales in January had little to do with the virus outbreak as it was not until January 23 that the government announced the lockdown of Wuhan city and the Chinese New Year holidays followed the next day.Despite the disruptions to Q1 2020, we expect EV sales to grow slightly this year for the following reasons.-  Supportive government policies are expected to be implemented. President Xi mentioned the need for incentives targeting the automotive industry during the meeting of the Chinese Politburo Standing Committee, the highest decision-making body in China, on 3 February. The Ministry of Commerce and several local governments have also announced positive policies, with more likely to come this year. There is debate among decision makers about whether EV subsidy policies should remain at current levels or fall as was previously scheduled.-  Pent-up demand for electric vehicles is likely to emerge later this year once the Covid-19 outbreak has passed. Much of the sales lost in Q1 can be made up for later in the year. Automotive sales in January and February are typically low anyway and combined they generally account for less than one eighth of sales.Read the full story:https://www.crugroup.com/knowledge-and-insights/insights/2020/chinese-ev-sales-hit-by-the-covid-19-outbreak/ Read more about CRU:http://bit.ly/About_CRUAbout CRUCRU offers unrivalled business intelligence on the global metals, mining and fertilizer industries through market analysis, price assessments, consultancy and events.Since our foundation by Robert Perlman in 1969, we have consistently invested in primary research and robust methodologies, and developed expert teams in key locations worldwide, including in hard-to-reach markets such as China.CRU employs over 280 experts and has more than 11 offices around the world, in Europe, the Americas, China, Asia and Australia - our office in Beijing opened in 2004 and Singapore in 2018.When facing critical business decisions, you can rely on our first-hand knowledge to give you a complete view of a commodity market.

Does China hold patent on coronavirus drug?USA TODAYMay 18, 2020 MondayFIRST EDITIONCopyright 2020 Gannett Company, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 3DLength: 615 wordsByline: Matthew Brown, USA TODAYBodyThe origins, utility and ownership of potential coronavirus treatments are an increasingly discussed subject, making the topic a target for conspiracy theories.The drug remdesivir has emerged as a centerpiece of many theories claiming that various groups and individuals stand to benefit from the drug's use as a treatment for COVID-19."Isn't it just an interesting coincidence that Remdesivir is made by Gilead and is the 'CURE' for COVID-19 ... . And here's where it gets interesting China holds the patent on the drug through an agreement with Gilead's drug patent sharing subsidy branch called UNITAID who has an office near Wuhan," a graphic on Facebook shared more than 300 times reads."And you'll never guess who are the main financial investors in UNITAID...none other than George Soros, Bill & Melinda Gates, and WHO," the post continues.Remdesivir is an antiviral drug developed by the firm Gilead Sciences, which maintains the U.S. patent on the drug as a coronavirus treatment. No Chinese institution has a recognized patent for the drug.Remdesivir's patentsRemdesivir has been researched by Gilead as far back as 2009 as a treatment for viruses ranging from hepatitis C and respiratory syncytial virus to Ebola and now COVID-19. Gilead first received a patent for the drug as a treatment for Ebola in 2017. In fall 2015, Gilead applied for two patents for remdesivir, one for combating coronaviruses and another for filoviruses, the family of pathogens that includes Ebola. Both were approved in spring 2019.In April, a National Institutes of Health study found the drug to speed the recovery time of COVID-19 patients by  31%. Gilead has since said that, with federal assistance, it will deploy remdesivir to hospitals.Gilead Sciences remains the only organization in the world entitled to intellectual property rights over remdesivir as a treatment for COVID-19.In January, Chinese researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology filed for a patent to use remdesivir as a treatment against COVID-19. At the time, no research had been published showing that remdesivir was effective. Even so, the drug was already being deployed for clinical trials in Wuhan and elsewhere.In early February, the Chinese company BrightGene Bio-Medical Technology also said that it had been approved to produce remdesivir by the Chinese government, though regulators eventually said the company had not received approval from the government nor Gilead Sciences.The Chinese government has not approved a patent for the drug, a move that would likely draw further criticism from the United States and others concerned about Chinese violations of international norms regarding intellectual property.Unitaid is not a subsidiary of Gilead Sciences but rather a global health research initiative backed by the United Nations and World Health Organization to fund research projects combating a range of viruses.Founded by the French government in 2006, the group is headquartered in Geneva and funded by the governments of Brazil, Chile, France, Norway, South Korea, Spain and the United Kingdom, as well as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Unitaid has no financial ties to George Soros or the Open Society Foundations, which Soros founded and manages.Our ruling: FalseNo Chinese firm has an approved claim to a patent for remdesivir. No international groups - including the Gates Foundations, Unitaid, the Open Societies Foundation or WHO - hold patents for the  drug either. While there are efforts to pool patents for potential treatments, and  alter the financial incentives of the parties to such arrangements, the United States and China are not obligating their firms to join these movements. Load-Date: May 18, 2020End of Document

China is embracing a new brand of foreign policy. Here's what "wolf warrior" diplomacy meansCNN WireMay 29, 2020 Friday 00:16Invalid date found for VDI: 1590388043 XCEDOCID: 0 LNI: 6010-TCY1-DY7V-G014-00000-00. Date output 'as-is'.GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 840 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN) BodyHONG KONG (CNN) --  There is a new brand of diplomacy taking hold in Beijing and its chief architects have a suitably fierce nickname to match their aggressive style -- they are the "wolf warriors."It's a phrase that is now used widely in Chinese state-run media as well as Western publications, and it was made clear last weekend that its proponents have the full support of the country's top diplomat.Speaking at a press conference in Beijing Sunday, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that China would now push back against "deliberate insults.""We never pick a fight or bully others. But we have principals and guts. We will push back against any deliberate insult, resolutely defend our national honor and dignity, and we will refute all groundless slander with facts," said Wang, responding to a question from CNN.But what is "wolf warrior" diplomacy, what does the name mean and where did it originate? The "wolf warriors" represent a completely different type of diplomat to the famously bland Chinese foreign representatives of the past few decades.Instead of long, verbose statements, these Chinese officials are taking to Twitter and other social media platforms to hit back directly at any criticism of China or the ruling Communist Party."Wolf Warrior" is actually the title of a hugely-successful series of patriotic action films in China, featuring Rambo-like protagonists who fight enemies at home and abroad to defend Chinese interests. The first film was released in 2015 and made more than $76 million (545 million yuan) at the box office.It quickly spawned a sequel that became China's highest grossing film at the time when it was released in 2017. "Wolf Warrior 2"' was based around a squad of People's Liberation Army soldiers sent into an African country to rescue Chinese civilians. The film's tagline was, "Even though a thousand miles away, anyone who affronts China will pay."An early comparison between the film series and China's diplomats came in July 2019, when Zhao Lijian, then a counselor at the Chinese embassy in Pakistan, began to hit back hard against the US government on Twitter.In a controversial series of tweets, Zhao claimed the US had no right to criticize China on human rights abuses when it had problems with racism, income inequality and gun violence. Zhao alleged there were places in Washington DC where "the white (people)" never go. It provoked a furious reaction from former US President Barack Obama's National Security Adviser Susan Rice, who called Zhao a "racist disgrace." But one year later, Zhao's career has only blossomed, and he is now one of the three high-profile spokespeople who hold the Chinese Foreign Ministry's daily press conference.Not only that, but Chinese diplomats across the world have begun to mirror Zhao's aggressive tactics on Twitter, a platform long banned in China.Zhao's boss Hua Chunying, director general of the Foreign Ministry's Department of Information, has frequently lashed out at critics on her Twitter account, which she only opened in October 2019 and now boasts almost 500,000 followers."Some politicians ignore the basic facts and make up countless lies and conspiracy theories concerning China," Hua said on May 24 amid deteriorating relations between the US and China over the coronavirus pandemic.China's ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming has been another keen "wolf warrior," regularly using Twitter to hit back against critics of Beijing in Europe.Speaking to state media on Monday, Liu said that the term "wolf warrior" was a misunderstanding of China's foreign policy, which he said was an "independent foreign policy of peace," but added sometimes a strong hand was needed."Where there is a 'wolf,' there is a warrior," Liu said in an answer posted to his Twitter.Despite the comments by Foreign Minister Wang and the ambassador, there still appears to be a degree of indecision in the Chinese government and state media over whether or not to fully embrace the term.In April, the state-run tabloid Global Times published a story praising China's "wolf warrior" diplomats for taking the fight to the West, saying it was necessary as Western diplomats "resort to a hysterical hooligan style diplomacy."But one month later, on May 24, following Foreign Minister Wang's comments, the tabloid's editorial claimed it was the US who was actually running a "wolf warrior" foreign policy. "Labeling Chinese diplomacy as 'wolf warrior' reflects an extreme ideology," the paper said.Richard McGregor, an expert in the Chinese Communist Party and senior fellow at the Lowy Institute, said that there was currently a fierce debate inside China over how aggressive the country's foreign policy should be."There's clearly a split about how China should conduct its diplomacy. It might only be a tactical split, but at the moment, the 'wolves' seem to have the ascendancy," he said. "I'm not sure that will last."CNN's Steven Jiang in Beijing contributed to this article.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

What's your reaction?SEN. MARTHA MCSALLY: Well, I've said it many times, Stuart. I've never trusted communists. This shows again that Communist China is continuing to hack into our systems to try and steal our technology. This is just another example. They've been doing this all along but people are more mindful of their behavior with the coronavirus because of their lies and coverup but this is no surprise to those of us, I've been doing national security for a long time and we've been watching them steal and hack into our research and our technology for many decades. They need to be held accountable and it needs to stop.VARNEY: Now, I believe you've got a bill which would allow ordinary people, myself, yourself, other people, to sue directly, sue China and seek compensation in American courts. That is what you want, right?MCSALLY: Yes. They're responsible for the death of over 80,000 Americans. They, their coverup, their communist plot here for them to continue to have lies and disinformation. They destroyed samples, they've silenced doctors, they kicked out journalists. They are responsible for the deaths of Americans. So it's a very narrow exception to the Sovereign Immunities Act that will hold them accountable for those who have been harmed, which are many people in America who are mourning their loved ones right now. Both the loss of life and the loss of livelihood.VARNEY: So, do you have to make a special exception in this instance?MCSALLY: We do. This legislation is with Marsha Blackburn and it allows a very narrow exception for this instance, that they have unleashed this bio agent, again not saying it is manufactured, but they have unleashed it because of their lying and their coverup, their irresponsibility, their reckless endangerment. The UK study showed that if they acted three weeks earlier, there would be 95% less cases. They're responsible. They need to be held accountable. It is a very narrow exception.VARNEY: Does the State Department, Mike Pompeo and the President, do they approve of this because that branches right out into foreign policy?MCSALLY: Well, I think we need an all-of-the-above approach using all elements of national power to hold China accountable. This is one of them. It's a legislative approval, so we need to work it through that process. In addition, there's other things we can use in foreign policy, sanctions and other things, diplomatic, economic. I think we're entering a new Cold War in many ways, Stuart and the rest of the world needs to wake up to China's reckless behavior and the path they've been on to try and supplant us as the leader of the world and it needs to stop.VARNEY: Senator, you're from Arizona that is your state. Am I right this saying that the governor, Governor Ducey is telling sports teams, 'Hey, come to my state. You can return to the games on Saturday?' Is he opening up Arizona to professional sports?MCSALLY: Yes. He made the announcement yesterday. We've always been a great destination state. Come to Arizona. It is a great place to work and live. We love to host the sports teams there from any sports. There's nothing like baseball to unify Americans. People are tired of watching reruns of games where they already know the outcome. So I appreciate the decision by Governor Ducey. We welcome any team to come to our beautiful state and play.Background:On May 4, Senators McSally, Blackburn, and Daines introduced the the Stop China-Originated Viral Infectious Diseases (COVID) Act to ensure the Chinese Communist Party faces consequences for its role in spreading the coronavirus.On April 20, Sen.

OPINION: How China's oppression of Uyghurs is linked to economic convenienceThe Depaulia: DePaul UniversityMarch 25, 2020 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINIONS; Pg. 1Length: 1026 wordsBodyChina's northwest region of Xinjiang, also known as East Turkestan, home to 12 million Uyghur Muslims, is witnessing unprecedented violence in the form of ethnic cleansing. Detention camps and various hostile measures have been taken to secure Uyghur loyalty to the Communist Party and stimulate nationalist fervor. Oppression is fermented through politicizing the Uyghurs as well as forcing them to renounce Islam, sinister efforts motivated by the desire to combat "extremism." Victims of unspeakable terror, further dehumanization is warranted by forcing Uyghurs to consume alcohol, which is prohibited in Islam. Uyghur Muslims make up less than 1 percent of China's population, which is why oppressive policies are strategically deployed to force assimilation. Over a million Xinjiang residents are being detained and are under surveillance. Victor Gevers, a Dutch cybersecurity researcher, revealed a database with records on Xinjiang residents. "Earlier this month, Gevers discovered an insecure MongoDB database filled with records tracking the location and personal information of 2.6 million people located in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The records include individuals' national ID number, ethnicity, nationality, phone number, date of birth, home address, employer and photos," according to Danny O'Brien, director of strategy for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a platform dedicated to fostering cyberspace rights. The database was housed by SenseNets, a company that is notorious for facial recognition technology being utilized by Chinese authority. Although SenseNets has made partnership with Microsoft known, they deny any involvement. An article by Arjun Kharpal, a reporter for CNBC reads: "Microsoft is not involved in a partnership with SenseNets. We have been made aware SenseNets is using our logo on its website without our permission, and we have asked for it to be removed," a spokesperson for the company told CNBC.Over 20 countries have condemned China at the United Nations, advocating for the end of human rights abuses in Xinjiang and complicity plays a major role in the perpetration of violence at all levels. "Adidas AG, Hennes & Mauritz AB, Kraft Heinz Co., Coca-Cola Co. and Gap Inc. are among those at the end of the long, often opaque supply chains that travel through China's northwest region of Xinjiang. Residents there are routinely forced into training programs that feed workers to area factories," according to The Wall Street Journal. Outsourcing is the economic move, which also explains why 85% of China's cotton is grown in Xinjiang. These companies have not only escaped accountability, but have also veiled the unethical means that facilitate production. Oppressive measures against the Uyghurs is based on economic incentive, making ownership of labor a critical component of the hedonistic struggle. "I think money and land-especially land-play a crucial role in trying to maintain tight control over the region," said Aydin Anwar, a Uyghur American and Outreach director of the Save Uyghur campaign. "East Turkestan is an occupied nation with incredibly rich minerals and resources that the Chinese Communist Party has been exploiting since the latest occupation in 1949. The existence of Uyghurs, their culture, their faith threatens China's ability to maintain control of the land-because it's clear that the culture, language and presence of East Turkestan is in fact not Chinese."Anwar has lost contact with her family back home and deems 93 of her relatives missing. "China has claimed that we've always been a part of China. By erasing who we are as people and homogenizing all of China to essentially become Han Chinese is their way of supporting the claim that we're all one," she said. What does China's position as a leading manufacturer entail? World leaders proposing neutrality to maintain economic relationships, the difficulty of holding the Chinese government accountable and consequently banning products made in China. Oula Yassine, a Fashion major with a focus on Product Development at Columbia College, Chicago explains that mass consumption and mass production are interdependent, which is why it's increasingly difficult to refrain from purchasing products that are made in China. "I have gone back and forth on this topic [boycotting goods from China] because it would be difficult to completely eliminate goods in households that are made in China. One thing I do is research where my garments are made and although this is tedious, it's important for me to know to keep myself from [unknowingly] supporting unfair labor. Though I do think a boycott should be set in place because what's happening to Uyghur Muslims is unbelievable. More people need to be educated on this topic," she said. The ethnic cleansing of Uyghur Muslims reflects global anti-Muslim sentiment. Oppression of the global Muslim community, however, inevitably overpowers the dialogue and reality of economic incentive preceding discrimination. This is why the War on Terror is a pseudonym for the control of oil reserves, which was legitimized through control of Muslim-majority lands. The politically convenient narrative that Muslims are terrorists mitigates the threat of imperialistic policies and actions against Muslims. Similarly, the Chinese government's sinister attempts at curbing terrorism serves to downplay the violence against Muslims and, while their identities are reduced, their bodies provide labor against its own capacity and consent. The continuing economic structure shapes the need for discrimination, not the other way around. China's President Xi Jinping announced the One Belt One Road Initiative in 2013, an ambitious effort to establish trade routes linking China to the rest of Asia. "The OBOR initiative and the fact that much of it goes through East Turkestan also sheds light on the importance of the land. Economics and land play a huge role," says Anwar. A discreet approach to economic development reasonably minimizes global scrutiny. The rhetoric that frames this initiative only deepens the Uyghur Muslims' unending search for justice and for each other.• ChinaLoad-Date: March 26, 2020End of Document

This is expected to boost the company's audience reach, thereby fueling the financials.Read the full report:https://www.reportlinker.com/p05877815/?utm_source=PRN- The shifting trend from product-centric to customer-centric experience drives the market. The usage of the internet and an ever-expanding means of communication, consumption, and interaction has empowered consumers. Companies have been forced to rethink their branding and business models.- Customer engagement vendors are incorporating AI capabilities into their platforms, in order to enable end users to create scalable, individualized customer experiences without the need for manual programming or logic building. It is estimated that the increased revenue due to the adoption of AI in customer relationship management activities may cross USD 125 billion, in the United States alone, by 2021.- Increasing demand for smart devices across Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) drives the market. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) uses networked sensors and intelligent devices directly on the manufacturing floor, for collecting data to drive artificial intelligence and predictive analytics.- Industries use products, such as networking devices, sensors for temperature, pressure, and flow measurement, and connected devices in huge numbers. The initial cost of implementation and the internal rate of return (IRR) period are the major factors impacting the decisions related to the implementation of such products, services, and software associated with them.- However, complexity in the shift from traditional to advanced technology challenges the market to grow. The transition from the existing legacy system to SaaS platforms is an expensive process involving technical and non-technical resources and other challenges. Also, the lack of understanding of cloud computing migration leads to many migration failures in achieving organizational goals.Key Market TrendsSpeech/Voice is Expected to Register a Significant Growth- Speech analytics solutions are gaining popularity among enterprises across the world since the conventional text-based analytics solutions adopted by enterprises is no longer enough to handle complex business issues. Many organizations are deploying speech analytics through a combination of internally recorded data, social media data, and external syndicated data, mainly to have a better understanding of their customer requirements.- The growing advancement in voice assistant technologies, such as Amazon's Alexa, is fueling the adoption of speech analytics over the forecast period. In 2017, May 16, the US President Donald Trump "addressed" a conference in Tianjin from Washington, where he speaks flawless Chinese. This advanced voice assistance feature was developed by iFlytek Co Ltd.- Further, the e-commerce titan Alibaba joined the likes of Tencent Holdings and Baidu, in the race to develop AI that can enrich social media feeds and target ads and services, by using natural language processing. Moreover, NLP has been endorsed by the government as a part of its national-level plan that calls for the country to become the industry leader by 2030.- During the Global Shopping Festival 2017, organized by Alibaba, the company handled 95% of customer service inquiries through its self-developed virtual customer service chatbot. Additionally, the company launched a smart speaker system, Tmall Genie, which uses NLP and AliGenie voice assistant to receive customers' requests in Mandarin Chinese. Thus, the advent of such speakers in the market is also anticipated to drive the demand for NLP in the country.- Additionally, emerging companies, like Homebase has further developed new skills for voice assistants, which now can answer questions, such as what are the pool hours?, how much is my rent?, and what is the status of my maintenance ticket?, etc., which exhibit the advancements in AI-based assistants for NLP.- Further, North America is one of the major markets for natural language processing, owing to its dominance in AI and machine learning (ML) technologies. According to RichRelevance, online shoppers in the United States are more inclined to use Google Assistant than the other platforms. Additionally, the utilization of smart speakers to obtain results on diverse topics is gaining increasing popularity, which, in turn, is expected to compel the companies to invest in the technology.Asia-Pacific to Witness the Highest Market Growth- The Asia-Pacific region is one of the most potential markets for the NLP industry. The region is also witnessing an increasing rate of adoption of the AI and ML technologies, especially among SMEs in the region. The voice assistance market is also booming in Asia, and the region is home to many consumer electronics manufacturers, including smart speakers and smartphones.- In the present scenario, most of the AI development is done by large internet companies across the world. Apart from the United States, most of these companies are based in China. The Chinese government has also been very active in advancing its AI strategy. The growth of NLP in the country is mainly fueled by the governmental blueprint, which was outlined in 2017, in order to make the country the world's uncontested AI power in the next decade.- Further, the Indian government is creating policies and making investments, with an aim to encourage AI-based startups. The growing digital adoption among the regional SMEs may also expand the growth of the market studied. Deploying an NLP-enabled chatbot can bridge the language gap between the English speaking and non-English speaking population of India, by providing multi-language support.- Moreover, some of the prominent banks in India already deployed NLP and AI chatbots to enhance the customer-interaction process. For instance, HDFC Bank collaborated with Senseforth and launched 'EVA' (Electronic Virtual Assistant). The chatbot addressed 2.7 million queries in the first six months. These instances contributes to the growth of the market during forecast period.Competitive LandscapeThe natural language processing market is highly competitive and consists of several major players who are trying to gain larger shares. These major players with prominent shares in the market are focusing on expanding their customer base across foreign countries and are also providing new innovative solutions along with deals and mergers to increase their market shares and profitability. Key players are Google Inc., Microsoft Corporation, etc. Recent developments in the market are -- Oct 2019 - Google LLC was planning to augment its search engine with natural-language processing features that were expected to be equipped with the most significant update of the past five years. Google planned to add new NLP models to its search engine that uses a technique called Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, or BERT, to analyze user queries. The method allows artificial intelligence algorithms to interpret text more accurately by analyzing how the words in a sentence relate to one another.- Jan 2020 - NetBase announced the merger with Quid, which is one of the prominent companies in AI-driven text analytics. As a result of this merger, the combined company will have an enhanced portfolio in the next generation consumer and market intelligence solution.

US SENATOR PROPOSES TIKTOK BAN FOR GOVERNMENT WORKERSStates News ServiceMarch 5, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 174 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):A U.S. senator is introducing legislation that would ban government employees from using the social media app TikTok on their government devices.Josh Hawley, a Republican representing the state of Missouri, said at a hearing Wednesday the data the Chinese-owned app collects and the potential for it to be shared with China's government represent a "majority security risk for the American people."He said similar bans are in place at some of the biggest federal agencies, including the Department of Defense and the State Department.Hawley did not say exactly when he would introduce the bill.The effort is the latest security scrutiny of TikTok, which allows users to post and view short videos.The company has said any data from U.S. users is stored in the United States and not subject to any Chinese government jurisdiction.It says it understands the safety concerns, but thinks they are unfounded, and that it has reached out to lawmakers in order to explain its policies.Load-Date: March 5, 2020End of Document

U.S. HOUSE PASSES SPANBERGER'S LEGISLATION TO BAN TIKTOK ON TSA PHONES, PROTECT AIRPORT SECURITY PERSONNEL AND SYSTEMS FROM CHINESE SURVEILLANCEStates News ServiceMarch 5, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 747 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of Virginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger:A bipartisan majority of the U.S. House of Representatives today voted to pass U.S. Representative Abigail's Spanberger's legislation to ban the Chinese video app "TikTok" on Transportation Security Administration (TSA) phones.Last month, the TSA announced that it would prohibit its employees from using the TikTok app on federally issued devices following concerns from the U.S. intelligence community regarding the app's lack of transparency about potential security vulnerabilities. As a Chinese-owned company, TikTok is required by law in China to comply with information and data requests from the Chinese government.Spanberger's amendment would codify TSA's policy to prohibit employees from downloading or using TikTok on government-issued devices. The amendment was included as part of the bipartisan Rights for Transportation Security Officers Act, which Spanberger cosponsored.On the floor of the U.S. House today, Spanberger spoke in support of her legislation, and she highlighted the significant security risks TikTok poses to U.S. security systems, TSA personnel, and American travelers. Click here to watch and download her remarks. A full transcript of her remarks is below:---I'd like to begin by thanking Chairman Thompson for his leadership on this important legislation and for his commitment to the men and women who keep our airports and travelers safe.I am proud to cosponsor this bipartisan bill, because I share the Chairman's commitment to ensuring that the TSA workforce receives the rights that they've earned.I am also proud to lead this amendment, which would codify the administration's ban on TSA employees using or installing the app "TikTok" on their government-issued phones.While to some TikTok may seem like a harmless app, TikTok presents a significant counter-intelligence threat.Our intelligence experts are rightly concerned about the use of the TikTok app, especially on U.S. government-issued devices.As many of my colleagues know, TikTok, like other Chinese companies is required under Chinese law to share information with the government and its institutions.There are real concerns that this app could also collect information on users in the United States to advance Chinese counter-intelligence efforts. And because it could become a tool for surveilling U.S. citizens or federal personnel, TikTok has no business being on U.S. government-issued devices.While entrusted with keeping Americans safe, our security personnel should not use apps that could compromise federal government data.There is always the threat that TikTok could be used to compromise government devices, including those used in our airports and among our airport personnel. That is why this amendment is so important, and why we should pass it without delay.Recently, the TSA announced a prohibition on employees using or downloading TikTok on their government-issued work phonesand my amendment would make this ban law.Other government agencies and departments have instituted a prohibition on the use of TikTok on government-issued phonesincluding the U.S. Army, the State Department, and the Department of Homeland Security.TSA is right to institute this policy, especially as TikTok refuses to provide more transparency into some of its more controversial practices and use.I urge my colleagues to vote yes on my amendment and to keep our government devices and our airports safe from potential foreign surveillance.---The prohibition on TikTok would not apply to the personal phones of TSA personnel.The passage of Spanberger's legislation builds on her work to identify and combat threats posed by Chinese technologies to U.S. consumers and businesses. Yesterday, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed Spanberger's bipartisan legislation to build a national strategy to protect 5G telecommunications systems in the United States and among U.S. allies.The Spanberger-led Secure 5G and Beyond Act would require the administration to develop an unclassified, national strategy to protect U.S. consumers and assist allies in maximizing the security of their 5G telecommunications systems. This strategy would also identify additional ways to spur research and development by U.S. companies in a way that maintains reliable internet access. In January 2020, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 413 to 3 to pass the House version of Spanberger's Secure 5G and Beyond Act.###Load-Date: March 5, 2020End of Document

COLD WAR II? U.S.-CHINA WAR OF WORDS OVER CORONAVIRUS HEATS UP | THU, 14 MAY 2020 14:52 EDTStates News ServiceMay 14, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 684 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for the National Interest (former the Nixon Center):U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo slammed China for its "counterproductive actions" on coronavirus on Thursday, a day after Chinese state-run media threatened U.S. lawmakers and U.S. law enforcement accused China of coronavirus-related cyberattacks.The United States and China have portrayed each other as malign actors as both superpowers struggle to take charge of the global coronavirus response. But the events of Wednesday and Thursday could mark a shift from rhetoric to concrete action.Rep. Ro Khanna (DCalif.) told the National Interest that the United States should have a "proportionate response" if China targets U.S. lawmakers, but that "there's a lot we can do to ratchet down the tensions before then.""While the United States and our allies and partners are coordinating a collective, transparent response to save lives, the [People's Republic of China] continues to silence scientists, journalists, and citizens, and to spread disinformation, which has exacerbated the dangers of this health crisis," Pompeo said in his Thursday statement.He referred to a statement released by the FBI and U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday warning "organizations researching COVID-19 [coronavirus disease 2019] of likely targeting and network compromise by the People's Republic of China."China unleashed its own accusations of malign behavior on Wednesday."China is extremely dissatisfied with the abuse of litigation by the US against China over the COVID-19 epidemic and mulling punitive countermeasures against US individuals, entities and state officials," warned the Global Times, the English-language edition of the state-run People's Daily.The Global Times claimed that China will add at least four lawmakers and two U.S. "entities" to its sanctions list and "impose countermeasures that will make them feel painful," citing "analysts" and "sources close to the matter."The article pointed out several U.S. policymakers, but singled out Missouri's elected officials for special criticism."China could impose the countermeasures on the relevant states represented by those anti-China lawmakers, including measures targeting trade and exchanges," the Global Times wrote. "Some Missouri companies, for example, have long-term investments in China and are likely to feel severe consequences if China strikes back with punitive measures in response to the coronavirus lawsuit."Missouri attorney-general Eric Schmitt filed a lawsuit in April claiming that the Chinese government had "lied to the world about the danger and contagious nature of COVID-19," while Sen. Josh Hawley (RMo.) is proposing a bill to allow lawsuits against the Chinese Communist Party "for reckless actions like silencing whistleblowers and withholding critical information."Republican lawmakers and U.S. officials have implied that the coronavirus was the result of a lab accident covered by the Chinese government.Democrats have likewise called for investigations. They also voted unanimously in the Senate to push for Taiwana self-governing island that China considers its own territoryto have a separate seat at the World Health Organization."We need to get public opinion on our side, including public opinion within China," Khanna said, calling for an independent investigation that would not be perceived as political. "There are a lot of people within China who think the Chinese Communist Party mismanaged the response."But the Democratic camp is also skeptical about the lab accident theory, and warns rushing into a cold war with China is a dangerous distraction while the United States faces a serious domestic crisis."My point is that, while China bears much responsibility for this crisis, it was not inevitable that a hundred, two hundred thousand Americans had to die," Sen. Chris Murphy (DConn.) said in a recent interview with the National Interest. "The president has run an abysmal response to the virus, which has resulted in it being much worse in the United States than it had to be."Load-Date: May 15, 2020End of Document

'China Was Not Truthful': Ex-FDA Chief Scott Gottlieb Explains How Beijing Misled The World About CoronavirusThe Daily CallerApril 12, 2020 Sunday 04:28 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: DAILY-CALLER-NEWS-FOUNDATION; healthLength: 589 wordsByline: Chuck Ross, Investigative Reporter, chuck@dailycaller.comChuck Ross is a reporter at The Daily Caller.Author ImageBodyLink to ImageDr. Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, criticized the World Health Organization and the Chinese government on Sunday, saying that both stymied the global response to the novel coronavirus, likely allowing it to spread more dramatically across the globe.“China was not truthful with the world at the outset of this,” Gottlieb said in an interview on CBS's “Face the Nation.”“Had they been more truthful with the world, which would have enabled them to be more truthful with themselves, they might have actually been able to contain this entirely.”Gottlieb, who left the Trump administration last year, said that the Chinese government delayed sharing two vital pieces of information that would have allowed other nations to prevent the spread of coronavirus: evidence that coronavirus could transmit through human-to-human contact and live samples of the virus, which began spreading from a wet market in Wuhan in November 2019. (RELATED: Scott Gottlieb Has A Detailed Plan To Reopen The United States)“There is some growing evidence to suggest that as late as January 20th [Chinese officials] were still saying there was no human-to-human transmission, and the WHO was validating those claims on January 14th, sort of enabling the obfuscation of China,” Gottlieb said.Gottlieb expanded on that same point in a separate interview Friday.He told National Review's Rich Lowry that Chinese officials were tracking outbreaks of coronavirus in Wuhan in December 2019 and knew that the virus displayed human-to-human transmission. Had international officials known that the virus transmitted in that manner, they likely would have been better prepared for a possible pandemic.“If they would have instituted steps then and been more forthcoming about what was happening then, this might have been an entirely avoidable world event,” he told Lowry in a podcast interview.Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force coordinator, offered a similar critique of the Chinese government in a press conference on March 31.“The medical community interpreted the Chinese data as, this was serious, but smaller,” she said. “Because, I think, probably we were missing a significant amount of the data.”Gottlieb also said Beijing refused to share live strains of the virus, which delayed development of a test that could diagnose patients with COVID-19.“The WHO should have made them do that,” Gottlieb said. “Had they done that earlier, we could have developed a diagnostic test earlier.”Gottlieb called on WHO to produce an after-action report examining “what China did or didn't tell the world, and how that stymied the global responses.”Despite that litany of grievances, Gottlieb said that he does not believe that the U.S. government should stop funding the WHO. President Donald Trump said last week that he is considering pulling funding for the organization. The U.S. contributes 15% of WHO's budget, the largest by far of any country.“I don't think this is a time to defund the WHO, given the fact that I think this is going to become epidemic in the southern hemisphere,” said Gottlieb. He said that the WHO would be useful in helping nations in the southern hemisphere that don't have the resources to deal with a pandemic.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Pro-China trolls are doing their best to stoke tensions for Taiwan by amplifying racist claims and spreading misinformation about California leaving the USBusiness Insider USApril 24, 2020 Friday 01:37 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 739 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (James Pasley)Highlight: Maria Repnikova, a political scientist at Georgia State University, told the Sydney Morning Herald the trolling was "bottom-up cyber nationalism."BodyFabrice Coffrini / AFP / Getty• Chinese trolls have been harassing news outlets like the BBC and The Wall Street Journal, stoking tensions for Taiwan and helping Iranian trolls spread misinformation about California leaving the US, according to a new report.• In April, the trolls allegedly tried to bolster a claim made by World Health Organisation Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus that he was subjected to online racism by Taiwan's government.• They've also reportedly backed activity from Iran-based trolls trying to spread information about California seeking to leave the US.• Political scientist Maria Repnikova told the Sydney Morning Herald: "As Chinese citizens (including overseas Chinese students) have become increasingly nationalistic, this movement has taken on a shape of its own. And that's going to be something for the international community to reckon with in the years to come."• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more storiesA network of bloggers in China have been attacking news outlets like The Wall Street Journal and the BBC, and trying to increase international political tensions for Taiwan, according to a new report.The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) released a report on April 23 about trolls from China, who don't appear to be linked to the government, which said although Chinese trolling is not new: "the main campaign appears to have picked up steam around mid-March as a loose network of Twitter accounts designed to mimic and harass Western media."According to the report by ASPI researchers Elise Thomas and Albert Zhang, an analysis of the words used by the trolls found that the accounts were made by people who spoke mainland Chinese.The trolls appear to have made accounts that looked like the Chinese-language versions of outlets including The Journal and the BBC, and the report said it was unlikely the accounts were "genuinely attempting to fool anyone; instead, the goal appears to be to troll and irritate Western media outlets and possibly to confuse readers."The report also claimed that it was unlikely to be a coincidence "that this coordinated harassment of Western media organisations took off within days of the decision by China to expel journalists from three US newspapers."China expelled three journalists from The Journal after the newspaper published an op-ed titled:" China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia," which the Chinese government said was racist. Another activity the trolls were believed to be behind was trying to bolster a claim made by World Health Organisation Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus who said that he was subjected to online racism by Taiwan's government on April 9. About 65 troll accounts retweeted "apologies" as they tried to keep the story alive and stir more tension.The report claimed the Chinese trolls didn't stick to national issues. Since April, the report said they've also backed activity coming from Iran, which supports an outsized claim of California seeking independence from the US. The trolls have allegedly created their own "pro-Californian-independence content," and posed as Taiwanese users.The point of this was probably to try hurt the relationship between the US and Taiwan, the report said. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, these sorts of Twitter impersonations were "pioneered by Reddit users and exploited by Russian trolls," but the latest developments show how pro-China propaganda has developed in recent times. Maria Repnikova, a political scientist at Georgia State University, told the Sydney Morning Herald the trolling was: "bottom-up cyber nationalism."She said: "As Chinese citizens (including overseas Chinese students) have become increasingly nationalistic, this movement has taken on a shape of its own. And that's going to be something for the international community to reckon with in the years to come."NOW WATCH: What makes 'Parasite' so shocking is the twist that happens in a 10-minute sequenceSee Also:• Check out the Raiders' sleek, $2 billion stadium that's close to completion in Las Vegas• 15 email etiquette rules every professional should know• Facebook is making a $6 billion bet on a company owned by India's richest man.

U.S. Senate passed a bill that could ban Chinese companies from trading on the stock exchangeCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 20, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 520 wordsBodyThe U.S. Senate passed a bill on Wednesday that could exclude Chinese companies from the U.S. Stock Exchange. The legislation could also prohibit such companies from raising money from American investors without complying with Washington's regulatory and auditing standards.The bill, pushed by Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy, and co-sponsored by Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen (Maryland) and Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer, North Dakota, requires companies to certify that they are "not owned or controlled by a foreign government."In addition, they would be required to undergo an audit that can be reviewed by the Public Enterprises Accounting Oversight Board, a body that oversees audits of all U.S. companies.While this legislation, which was unanimously passed, applies to any foreign company, US lawmakers say it targets mainly Chinese companies, amid tensions between Washington and Beijing."I don't want to get into a new cold war," Kennedy said in the Senate. "All I want, and I think everyone else wants, is for China to abide by the rules."Republican Senator John Kennedy said the Chinese Communist Party "cheats" (Caroline Brehman/Pool via REUTERS) (POOL/)On Tuesday, in dialogue with Fox Business Network, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow expressed support for tighter oversight of Chinese companies: "We need to protect investors and protect national security. Many of these companies, by the way, have already had scandals and cost investors a lot of money because they were not transparent in their reports. The Chinese government prohibits such transparency.""The Chinese Communist Party cheats, and the Foreign Business Accountability Act would prevent them from cheating on U.S. stock exchanges (...) We can't let foreign threats to Americans' retirement funds take root in our bags," Kennedy wrote Tuesday afternoon on his Twitter account, hours before the Vote in the Senate."Let's hope this is a wake-up call to China to be in line with the rest of the world and allow transparency in the audits of its companies," Clete Willems, a former Trump administration trade adviser and Akin Gump partner, added to the CNBC network.China has refused to allow its companies to follow U.S. securities law, arguing that Chinese law prohibits auditors' work from being transferred out of the country, Harris Bricken's Steve Dickinson recalled. "Put more directly, unlike companies in the United States and Europe, and anywhere else in the world, Chinese companies listed on the U.S. stock exchanges are exempt from meaningful financial oversight," the lawyer said.In 2019, some 165 Chinese companies traded on the U.S. Stock Exchange, including Alibaba, the e-commerce giant, which saw its shares fall by 2%.Following senate approval, the bill will now pass to the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives before reaching President Trump's desk for enactment.MORE ON THIS TOPIC:China provided loansbillions of dollars to poor countries that can no longer pay off: what will happen to those debtsTrump: "It was China's incompetence and nothing else that caused this massive global slaughter"Load-Date: May 21, 2020End of Document

THE BEAUTY AND THE SORROW THAT I WITNESSED IN XINJIANG: INTERVIEWStates News ServiceMay 21, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1743 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Abu is a young man from Taiwan. In 2019, he rode on his bicycle to Xinjiang, traveled around the province for almost two months, and shared on social media what he saw and heard. In a video taken in Kashgar's Old Town in southern Xinjiang, he shared details of his conversations with locals about what really happens in Xinjiang's re-education camps, and this sparked further discussions online. Below is RFA reporter Jane Tang's interview with Abu:RFA: The videos you took in Xinjiang have generated a lot of response online. Now that you are back in Taiwan, can you tell us prompted you to visit Xinjiang?Abu: I had just left my job in China, and had thought about riding my bicycle from the coastal province of Guangdong all the way to Europe. I particularly wanted to visit Xinjiang. In China, public opinion about China's Xinjiang policy is polarized. I was hoping that I could learn more about the issue with my own eyes and ears, rather than from hearsay or the news.According to my original itinerary, after leaving Xinjiang, I would have continued my trip until I reached Europe. However, several things happened, so I called the trip off early and returned to Taiwan.RFA: Many journalists have been put under surveillance while in Xinjiang. What was your experience there?Abu: In Xinjiang, there are security check points in every small town. My name was taken, and I was searched, so it was not difficult [for police] to track me down. I was searched about ten times. I entered Xinjiang in late June of 2019, and left in the middle of August, so stayed there for about one and a half months.Each police search took more than hour. I had to put every one of my personal belongings on the ground for them to check. I felt like a street vendor. The police would check the pictures I took, too.I had some strange encounters with the police. Sometimes, in the middle of the night, the police would come and announce that I could not stay in the hotel and demanded that I check out of the hotel immediately. At other times, when I camped out, the police would call to locate me and force me to leave.RFA: The location where you shot your video "The Beauty and Sorrow of Xinjiang" is full of stories, and you walked past many piles of rubble and numerous abandoned houses. What were these?Abu: Those are the Gaotai Dwellings, traditional Uyghur residential homes in Kashgar in south Xinjiang. I did some research prior to the trip, and I wanted to check out the rich culture there. It was not until I had almost reached Xinjiang that I heard that the residents of the Dwellings had been relocated and the Dwellings demolished. The residents were made to relocate after the Chinese government rolled out the Poverty Alleviation Policy.The Chinese government built a new "Ancient Town" nearby, but that is nothing compared to the Old Town. All the cultural and the ethnic historical sentiments have diminished with the demolition. Yes, everyone is entitled to a modern civilization, but I do not agree with this kind of comprehensive demolition and relocation.RFA: So you learned that the Gaotai Dwellings were abandoned, but how did you manage to get in to the Old Town?Abu: I still wanted to see the Old Town with my own eyes, so I scouted the area for a few days, hoping to find a manhole of some sort to sneak in, and I did. I found a secret entryway, and once I got in I made a few turns, climbed through a plank, and landed in the streets in the old town. I shared that information on Taiwan's Backpackers Forum.I chose to shoot the video and talk about the re-education camps in that location because of my experience in Urumqi, where I was stalked. I wanted to have the video taken in a place where there were no surveillance cameras.RFA: You talked with many locals about the changes that have occurred in Xinjiang over the past few years. What stories did they share with you?Abu: I met a herdsman whose livestock was taken away by the Chinese government in the name of Poverty Alleviation. The herdsman and his family were then forced to relocate from their grazing area to government-arranged housing. The Chinese government also arranged jobs for them, so they do earn a wage. As a result, their income level met the poverty alleviation standard, and they became just another number in the data. Meanwhile, the Chinese government placed their children in a centralized education setting, claiming this was intended to provide childcare for the working parents.Additionally, the ethnic minorities in the areanot just the Uyghurs, but everyone whose religion is Islamare never allowed to leave Xinjiang. If anyone applies for a passport, the Chinese government will not issue it. There are checkpoints everywhere at the stops leaving Xinjiang. And if an ID identifies the holder as an ethnic minority person, that person is not allowed to leave their town, to say nothing of leaving the country. It is almost as if these people in the region are in a lockdown.RFA: In the videos of Xijiang shot by China's official media outlets, Xinjiang residents praise China and thank the CCP. However, the outside world has also seen many reports and classified documents about the re-education camps in Xinjiang. What was the Xinjiang that you saw like?Abu: I would categorize the Xinjiang people in two groups. One group consists of those who may benefit from this policy. In some of the tourist spots, for example, the Xinjiang people there would shout "Thank you, Party! Thank you, our Country!" as soon as they saw me. Maybe they really felt grateful for the Chinese government, or maybe they did this to protect themselves. Nevertheless, other civilians that I came in touch with slowly revealed some more details. They felt too helpless, sad, or scared to say much about the re-education camps or the tight controls imposed on the ethnic minorities.One Xinjiang man told me that his brother was taken away and was never again seen again after the police found a copy of Koran in the house. In many situations, Xinjiang people are monitored, warned, taken away, or even jailed. And those prisoners turned silent when they got out. They would say "the Party is really good to me," but you could see that the way he spoke and his facial expressions were completely contradictory.RFA: What was the atmosphere like in Xinjiang?Abu: I felt very oppressed. I could walk in the main roads, but if I turned into any alleyway, there would be a check stop. Foreign tourists like us are not allowed in many areas.To see more around the Old Town, I used the cabs a lot. I would ask the cabbie to drive me to some place, and then I could chat with the driver. On one of these rides, my driver became infuriated during our conversation. He said, 'It is not free here at all. Even a dog would be happier here than humans.The humans want to leave town, but they are not allowed to.'It was as if the entire town had become a huge jail house. Everyone is trapped inside.RFA: Xijiang was not like this at all before. When did all these changes begin?Abu: The locals said it was after the July 2009 Urumqi Riots.RFA: What are the things that the Xinjiang civilians want the outside world to know?Abu: They want the world to know what the Chinese government is doing to them: the re-education camps, the random checks and surveillance, and the manipulating of ethnic minority groups to spy on one another.I could feel the sense of their helplessness from their body language and from their eyes. It was as if you were trying to hold still against a flood, but still got washed away. When I was in Xinjiang, the Muslims were celebrating Eid al-Adha, or the Festival of the Sacrifice. Eid al-Adha is an important Muslim holiday celebrated around the world. In China, Muslims in Qinghai or Gansu may be able to gather and celebrate, but not in Xinjiang. Here, the Muslims were told to return home once the celebration was over. They could not congregate on the streets, because no gatherings were allowed.On the morning of the holiday, people went onto the streets to celebrate, but the police then announced through a PA system that everyone should return home. That was it. The largest Mosque in Kashgar was also banned from holding any gatherings. I feel that the entire culture is being annihilated.One day, I saw a poster in an abandoned house. The content was even more disgusting. The poster was about the Chinese version of Dos and Don'ts with regards to the Islamic culture. For example, the Muslims eat Halal food, but the poster said that parents are forbidden to tell children to eat only Halal food. There are many prohibition orders like that in Xinjiang. These orders are forcibly destroying the Muslims' religious culture.RFA: Why did you end your trip early and return to Taiwan?Abu: My experience in the Kashgar Airport really spooked me. The airline agent tore up my flight ticket and would not let me board my flight. He asked me to return to the hotel that I had checked out from earlier. Luckily, I was able to book another flight right away, using my new "Mainland Travel Permit for Taiwan Residents" (MPT) number. My second attempt to leave the region was successful, and I managed to fly to Sichuan.However, as soon as I passed the border control, I was immediately taken to a small room. There were many video cameras pointing at me. The interrogator asked me what I was doing in China? What did I do on a specific date? All my belongings were tossed around and searched, all my memory cards confiscated. I probably would not have been able to make it back to Taiwan at all had I not synced all my videos to cloud storage in real time and burned all my video-containing memory cards before I left.I arrived at the airport in Sichuan in the early morning at 4 a.m. The search and interrogation there lasted for almost four hours, and I eventually caught a 9:00 flight to Macau. When I landed in Macau, I almost burst into tears. I no longer needed the MPT. From here on I could use my passport, issued by the Republic of China, Taiwan.RFA: What was the biggest impact this trip had on you?Abu: I did not expect that so many locals would share their information with me. They trusted me to tell their stories. I am now a firm believer in the idea that freedom is a birthright. I have seen so much beautiful scenery in Xinjiang, but the stories of its people are the sorrows that need to be told.Load-Date: May 22, 2020End of Document

Chengdu is Becoming the Engine Driving Development in ChinaPR NewswireMay 27, 2020 Wednesday 5:40 AM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 922 wordsDateline: CHEUNGDU, China, May 27, 2020 BodyPR NewswireOn April 28, the official website of Sichuan Provincial Government released the Reply and Approval from Sichuan Provincial People's Government for the Founding of the Eastern Chengdu New Area. According to the document, the Chengdu Eastern New Area will become a "new platform for the formation of the Chengdu-Chongqing Economic Circle".Chengdu and Chongqing are two neighboring megacities located in western China, and citizens of the two cities share similar customs and dining habits. In January this year, the term "Chengdu-Chongqing Economic Circle" was coined, which the Chinese government intends to position as "important growth pole for high-quality development".As one of the two core cities of the "Chengdu-Chongqing Economic Circle", Chengdu's expansion in recent years has garnered widespread attention across the globe. In October 2019, according to a ranking compiled by the Milken Institute, a think tank in the United States, which ranked 262 Chinese cities based on nine development indices, Chengdu even surpassed Shenzhen to top the list of Best-performing Chinese Cities."Data from the Best-performing Chinese Cities ranking sufficiently indicate that scientific and technological innovation is the cornerstone for the transformation of Chinese cities in the future." Huang Huayue, General Manager of the Research Department of the Milken Institute Asia Center and co-author of the report, pointed out that "Chengdu is building a hi-tech and modern industrial sphere with sound international reputation and increasing its economic clout in the development of China's western region, both of which fit the level of influence typical of a core city in a megalopolis."In order to stimulate industrial impetus and potential, incubate and cultivate local technological and innovative enterprises, and attract more technological and innovative firms to set up presence in the city, Chengdu created a "Unicorn Island" in Tianfu New Area in the south of the city, which also happens to be the world's first industrial complex primarily engaged in the incubation and cultivation of unicorn companies. At present, the main structure of the complex Exhibition and Convention Center will soon finish construction, while the whole project is anticipated to come to fruition by 2022.Other than the "Unicorn Island," the "Business and Innovation Centre for China-Europe Cooperation" is also rising fast into the limelight as the premier destination of choice in western China among technological and innovative companies around the globe. Currently, more than 50 world-famous organizations and corporations such as AWS Joint Innovation Center, Greater China HQ of Norwegian company Opera, French internet-of-things enterprise Sigfox and the Global Asia-Pacific HQ of U.K. firm Vertu.On January 16 this year, the Chengdu-Israel Science and Technology Innovation Center was formally launched at the Business and Innovation Centre for China-Europe Cooperation. Dedicated to services such as international finance, international commerce for the hi-tech industry and international scientific and technological research outcome transformation for the biomedicine industry, the Center aims to meet the needs among Chengdu's local technological and innovative projects to bolster global communication.The gathering and growth of enterprises bring along busier population and cargo traffic between cities and as the national central city closest to Europe, Chengdu's status as an international hub is also becoming increasingly apparent.Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport is the Chinese mainland's number four aviation hub, where 127 international (regional) routes provide access to five continents. The Tianfu International Airport now under construction is expected to put into operation in 2021, which will position Chengdu as the third city in the Chinese mainland behind Beijing and Shanghai to possess two of its own international airports.At the same time, Chengdu is also China's railway freight shipping center for access to Europe. The number of departure of the China-Europe Railway Express from Chengdu has maintained its top spot in the country for three straight years. Even under the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, in January and February this year Chengdu's China-Europe Railway Express still recorded 267 departures, actually equating to a stunning 88% jump compared with the same period last year.The city's crucial hub position is just as profound domestically. At present, the 280km-long Chengdu-Chongqing Hi-speed Railway Central Line, a third hi-speed rail between Chengdu and Chongqing, is being built, and upon completion the time required to travel between the two cities will drop from 90 minutes today to merely 50 minutes. This is yet another important measure beneficial to the formation of the "Chengdu-Chongqing Economic Circle" and the integration of the Chengdu-Chongqing City Cluster.Chengdu is using a "new area" to create the eastern gateway advantageous to the formation of the dual-city economic circle. Perhaps the "Chengdu-Chongqing Economic Circle" is going to become China's next Yangtze River Delta Megalopolis and the key driver that propels sustained and robust growth of the Chinese economy in the next several decades, and meanwhile Chengdu is the main engine that will provide the core driving force. View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chengdu-is-becoming-the-engine-driving-development-in-china-301065861.htmlSOURCE The Chengdu Eastern New AreaCONTACT: Ms. Hou, Tel: +86-10-63074558.Load-Date: May 27, 2020End of Document

#METOO IN THE LAND OF CENSORSHIPStates News ServiceMay 8, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 348 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:wo years since the #MeToo movement took off in China, Chinese feminists are battling headwinds in a political environment where the ruling Communist Party's control over the Internet, media and independent activism is tighter than it has been in 30 years.China's party-state has zero tolerance for collective actions, so the country's #MeToo movement has never been able to manifest in mass street protests. But individual victims have taken their cases to court, demonstrating extraordinary determination and resilience.Facing intense "slut-shaming" on Chinese social media platforms and censorship of discussions of her case, University of Minnesota student Liu Jingyao who is suing, in a Minnesota civil court, Chinese billionaire Liu Qiangdong for an alleged rape vowed to never settle or sign a nondisclosure agreement (prosecutors declined to charge him in the case, and he maintains that the sex was consensual). Similarly, screenwriter Zhou Xiaoxuan who is suing, in a Beijing court, famed state media anchor Zhu Jun for alleged sexual harassment and assault, which he denies said, "Even giving me 100 million [yuan], I wouldn't settle."Under pressure, the Chinese government has made limited improvements. In December 2018, the Supreme Court added sexual harassment to the list of "causes of action," making it easier for #MeToo victims to seek redress. Yet China still lacks robust laws against sexual harassment.Silenced in their home country, Chinese feminists have increasingly found footing overseas. Utilizing the relatively free and safe space in Western countries, #MeToo activists hold protests, discussions and trainings, and provide support to their counterparts inside China.In late 2019, authorities detained Huang Xueqin, a journalist and leading figure in China's #MeToo movement, for three months for unknown reasons. Upon release, Huang reportedly wrote: "This is Xueqin, and I'm back. ... One second of darkness doesn't make people blind."Amid the vast darkness, nevertheless, Chinese feminists persisted.Load-Date: May 9, 2020End of Document

However, it s taking things one step further. The social media company said it will stop using China-based moderators to screen content in any other country, and that more than 100 moderators will have to either find other jobs inside parent company Bytedance or leave. Teams local to given areas should take over within a few weeks, TikTok said.The move to region-oriented moderators theoretically reduces the chances that TikTok will censor political statements and other content the Chinese government doesn t like. It may also help with cultural understanding. While the existing moderators both speak the relevant languages and are familiar with the cultures they re moderating, people from the areas under moderation might have a better chance of understanding cultural nuances.As with earlier measures, TikTok isn t doing this entirely voluntarily. Politicians and regulators (particularly in the US) are worried not just that TikTok might be censoring material, but that it might pose a security threat. The reduced involvement of China-based staff theoretically shows that it s not an organ of the country s authoritarian government. Whether or not it helps isn t certain. Officials are still worried that the Communist Party could force TikTok to hand over data, and new moderators won t change that.See Campaign:https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-12-senators-want-to-ban-tiktok-from-government-phones.htmlContact Information:Jon FingasTags:, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: March 26, 2020End of Document

THE REAL REASON WHY CHINA'S J-31 STEALTH FIGHTER LOOKS LIKE THE F-35States News ServiceMay 27, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1342 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for the National Interest (former the Nixon Center):Chinese media reports are now referencing new photos of the emerging J-31 5th-Gen stealth fighter appearing on social media, ostensibly showing various design improvements to the new radar-evading multi-role aircraft.A May 5th report in the Global Times, an English Language Chinese newspaper, says the new photos show an .... "upgraded version with modifications made to its aerodynamic design just like the prototype that made its maiden flight in 2016, instead of the original version that made its public debut at Airshow China in 2014."Improvements or changes to the J-31 likely continue a long-standing pattern of China's apparent and somewhat visible effort to copy, steal or mirror designs used for the U.S. F-35. Virtually all photos and renderings of the J-31, since first unveiled, revealed a striking resemblance to the U.S. F-35. This does not come to the surprise of many in the U.S., given China's well-known and documented cyber espionage efforts. A 2014 "U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission" Congressional report specifically cites a Defense Science Board finding that Chinese cyber attacks resulted in the theft of significant specs and technical details of a range of U.S. weapons systemsincluding the F-35.At the same time, a 2018 Pentagon news story about DoD's annual China report mentions that apparent similarities between the F-35 and Chinese J-20 could very well be a result of espionage. A cursory look at the J-20 does appear to show some resemblance to the F-35, particularly the blended wing-body front end and internally built, conformal exhaust pipes. These similarities do appear, despite the apparent differences, as the J-20 has a wider and longer lower-body. However, available photos show an even larger measure of similarity between the F-35 and Chinese J-31 multi-role fighter.As recently as last year, another Global Times report said the J-31 showed design improvements at the 2019 Paris Air Show. Photos from the story reveal profound visual similarities between the F-35 and J-31. This is not without precedent, as the Chinese media itself has noted similarities between the two aircraft. Portions of a story from the Chinese government's "People's Daily Online" as far back as 2013 specifically cites design similarity between the emerging Chinese J-31 and the F-35, writing that the "J-31 and F-35 use the same DSI inlet (non-boundary layer-separated lane supersonic inlet)." The only major difference, the paper notes, is that the U.S. has an F-35B Short Take Off and Landing variant and that the J-31 uses two engines compared to the F-35's single engine propulsion configuration.The article's reference to a "non-boundary layer separated lane supersonic inlet" appears both interesting and significant, as it pertains to designs engineered to manage heat and air movement signatures demonstrated by the aerodynamic phenomenon of air flow surrounding supersonic flight. "Boundary layer" aerodynamics, referring to the air flow surrounding a weapon or platform as it transits, can greatly impact the flight stability and stealth characteristics of an aircraft.A pertinent comparison can be found in the Air Force Research Laboratories' current work on "boundary layer phenomenology" related to next-generation hypersonic weapons. Senior Air Force science and technology leaders and weapons developers told me at the Air Force Association symposium in 2019 that "boundary layer phenomenology" was figuring prominently in ongoing research and development regarding future weapons and platforms. Managing heat flow and temperature is, of course, vital to maintaining flight stability for hypersonic weapons traveling at speeds up to five-times the speed of sound. Developers seek to engineer configurations which will generate a "laminar" or smooth airflow as opposed to "turbulent" boundary layer to enable a weapon to sustain an accurate trajectory and manage excessive heat.Therefore, by extension, it seems apparent the same aerodynamic principles apply to stealth aircraft configurations which seek to manage the heat signatures and turbulence potentially generated in the air flow boundary layers of stealth jets flying at supersonic speeds. Accordingly, a "non-boundary layer separated lane" for airflow, (as cited by the article) which does not break up or radically change airflow trajectory, could not only ensure smoother flight at high speeds but also help manage temperature. Of course, there would be significant differences between the thermal management technical engineering needed for hypersonics and stealth aircraft, yet smother wing-body melded external designs, absent hard or protruding edges, clearly bring the added advantage of a smoother and cooler air flow boundary layer. Along these lines, the 2019 Global Times report details a few design changes to the 2019 J-31 which, according to the photographs, show a smoother, less-jagged exterior behind the cockpit as opposed to earlier models.The Chinese newspaper stops short of exploring a fully-detailed discussion of aerodynamic designs related to the aircraft, but does cite a Chinese Air Force test pilot expert as saying "the J-31's stealth aerodynamic design, stealth engine design and stealth coating design have all reached internationally advanced standards in stealth technology." (China's Air Force test pilot expert Xu Yongling.)However, external configuration and some elements of visible heat-signature management represent merely a few of many characteristics when it comes to stealth technology; stealth designs also often incorporate internally-built engines, radar absorbent coating materials and internal weapons bays, among other things. Along these lines, the People's Daily Online report makes the claim that the J-31 has a superior weapons payload capability compared with the F-35. However, available specs report that the J-31 travels with six external weapons hardpoints... the same number as the F-35.As for how the J-31 may be employed, Chinese and U.S. newspapers are filled with various kinds of speculation; some reports say the fighter is intended for export as a way to counter the reach and scope of the F-35, however other reports cite Chinese officials saying the J-31 is intended for domestic use and possibly could even fly off of Chinese aircraft carriers.Chinese' progress with the J-31 calls to mind several timely strategic calculations. A more recent Congressional report, the 2018 U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission, makes specific reference to concern regarding China's expansionist aims when it comes to projecting air, land and sea power. The text of the review points to dramatic upticks in "long-distance over-water training" exercises over new areas in recent years which, the study goes on to suggest, improves the PLA Air Force's capability to gather intelligence and "execute maritime missions against the U.S.""In November and December 2017, China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force conducted at least nine long-distance training flights over maritime areas along China's periphery, continuing a trend that began in 2015," stated the 2018 U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission.All of this pertains to the often and widely discussed recognition that China has long-since past its ambitions to operate as a dominant regional power and migrated aggressively toward positioning itself as a massive, leading global power.Kris Osborn is the new Defense Editor for the National Interest.

Briefing With Special Envoy Lea Gabrielle, Global Engagement Center On Disinformation and Propaganda Related to COVID-19Targeted News ServiceMarch 28, 2020 Saturday 4:17 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3681 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Department of State issued the following special briefing via teleconference on March 27 with Lea Gabrielle, special envoy and coordinator of the Global Engagement Center, on disinformation and propaganda related to coronavirus:MS ORTAGUS: Great. Okay, this record - excuse me, this phone call, this briefing is going to be on the record and embargoed until the end of the call, please. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the world has demonstrated to all of us the critical importance of timely, transparent, and honest information sharing. The United States has taken this mission to heart. Unfortunately, not all global actors have embraced that edict, choosing instead to engage in subterfuge, coverups, and finger-pointing. To help expand on this and explain the dynamic further, we have joining us for this on-the-record briefing Lea Gabrielle, the U.S. special envoy and coordinator of the State Department's Global Engagement Center. Lea will begin with some opening remarks and then we'll take a few questions. Please, again, text Ruben at the number that was provided.Just another reminder that this briefing is embargoed until the end of the call. Lea, go ahead with opening remarks, please.MS GABRIELLE: All right. Well, thank you so very much, Morgan, and good afternoon everyone. Thanks so much for taking the time to join the call today. As Morgan mentioned, we're going to be discussing foreign adversarial disinformation that's being spread about the COVID-19 virus.Before we get into that, I just want to ensure that you all have some general context about the State Department's Global Engagement Center, or the GEC, as we call it. When the GEC was originally started, it focused solely on the counterterrorism mission, and at the time it was primarily focused on countering the propaganda used by ISIS. Congress through the 2017 National Defense Authorization Bill actually expanded the GEC's mission that year to include countering disinformation spread by foreign countries that was intended to undermine the U.S. security or policies or that of our partners and our allies, and as you'd imagine, this is a huge expansion of our role and our mandate.So the GEC then established three new teams, one focused on Russian disinformation, one on Chinese disinformation, and one on Iranian disinformation. And the GEC also has a counterterrorism team that continues to execute our original counterterrorism mission. We also have an analytics and research team with around 25 data scientists, also analysts and subject matter experts, so that we can use data science and make sure that we are taking a data-driven approach to all of our work. And we also have a technology engagement team that conducts outreach to different technology capabilities so that we are convening the interagency and the U.S. Government on capabilities that are being developed and those capabilities can be assessed. We have an ability to do a deeper dive on assessments of technologies being developed through a technology test bed, and we also use our technology engagement team to do outreach and coordination with different technology platforms, including the social media platforms.So now that I've given you some very quick overview of what our team looks like, to get into the purpose of today's call of course about the disinformation we're seeing spread by foreign countries about the COVID-19 virus, I should first just let you know that since January the GEC has been tracking narratives promoted by Russian, Chinese, and Iranian-sponsored sites or different platforms related to the coronavirus. And one of our main responsibilities at the GEC is to keep the State Department leadership as well as the interagency and our partners informed so that they understand what we're seeing in the global information landscape. So this gives our leadership a fuller picture so that they can continue to make well-informed decisions as we're trying to tackle this issue.In this case, it also positions the GEC to take actions to expose adversarial false narratives publicly to help audiences understand the need to be vigilant about the threat of disinformation. Over a month ago the GEC alerted the global public to the widespread disinformation campaign that the Kremlin launched in late January focusing on COVID-19. So through information - and I'm sorry, I'm getting another call, so just let me pause and decline that one for a second. So - I'm sorry. As I was saying, a month ago the GEC alerted the global public to what we were seeing from the Kremlin, where it had launched a disinformation campaign around COVID-19. Through information that we provided to the fact-checking center at AFP, the GEC detailed how the full Russian ecosystem of official state media, proxy news sites, and social media personas have been pushing multiple disinformation narratives.Now, this Russian disinformation campaign is a known Russian tactic of perpetuating disinformation by capitalizing on the chaos and the uncertainty that health scares and pandemics engender, and we are still seeing the Kremlin continue its reckless attempts to propagate disinformation, endangering global health by undermining the efforts of governments; of health agencies and organizations that are in charge of disseminating accurate information about the virus, such as the World Health Organization. We're also seeing Russia's ecosystem promoting narratives advanced by China and Iran, often ones that were first advanced by Russia.And I think we all here are aware at this point that this isn't just a single act or issue. During the crisis, we've seen Russian, Chinese, and Iranian state disinformation and propaganda ecosystems all converge around some disinformation themes intended to promote their own agendas. So on China, over the course of the crisis we've monitored a couple of narrative tracks. One is malign disinformation to falsely blame the U.S. as the origin of the coronavirus and the second has been China's effort to turn the crisis into a news story highlighting supremacy of the Chinese Communist Party in handling the health crisis. What we've seen is the CCP mobilizing its global messaging apparatus, which includes state media as well as Chinese diplomats, to push out selected and localized versions of the same overarching false narratives.I will say that the information space is ever evolving. It's been very fluid and China's approach to it has been as well. And while we did see troubling remarks by Chinese officials, I want to stress my team has also recently seen initial indications of messaging refinement away from disinformation by Chinese officials on social media.Now, in terms of Iran, several news outlets affiliated with Iran have published malicious, false stories alleging that the United States has weaponized the coronavirus, and senior Iranian officials have echoed these false allegations.Now, just to tell you a little bit about the department's and the GEC's response. The State Department has alerted foreign audiences, as I mentioned, to the Russian COVID-19 disinformation campaign as well as others, and I had mentioned that through information provided to the fact-checking center AFP, the GEC detailed how that Russian disinformation ecosystem was operating.Meanwhile, to counteract other global false narratives coming from state actors, the U.S. Government launched a full spectrum of activities, including public messaging at home and overseas, diplomatic engagement, and promotion of fact-based information to local audiences. So the GEC, working with other State Department offices and private sector partners, is monitoring and tracking propaganda and disinformation in real time that's coming from state actors, and we've worked to ensure that overseas missions have access to information on trending narratives on COVID-19. The GEC also provides foundational knowledge about disinformation narratives for the Bureau of Global Public Affairs to develop its toolkit of responses for all missions around the world.So I think that that probably gives you a pretty good overview, and I'll stop there. I just wanted to give you a sense of what we're seeing as well as a big picture of some of our efforts to expose the disinformation campaigns. The COVID-19 crisis has really provided an opportunity for malign actors to exploit the information space for harmful purposes, and really been providing unnecessary distractions from the global communities focused on this crisis. I think the fact that we're seeing the Russian, Chinese, and the Iranian state information operations converging around the same disinformation narrative themes about COVID-19 is an important point. It's something that we'll be watching and that we're going to continue to assess.With that, I'm happy to answer your questions, and I'll turn it back over to Spokesperson Ortagus.MS ORTAGUS: Great. Thank you so much, Lea. That was excellent. Just to remind everyone to text Ruben if you have a question. Ruben, I'll go ahead and let you call them since you everyone. We do have a 3:00 briefing, so we'll try to get in - please try to ask one question if you can so we can get in as many as possible before we have to get on the other briefing.MR HARUTUNIAN: Thanks very much. Matt Lee has the first question.QUESTION: Hi there. Thank you. I got one question but it's like two parts, and that is: One, do you have a metric or an ability to tell how successful these disinformation campaigns' narratives are? And then whether you do or not, how concerned are you that these messages, this false narrative is taking hold? Thank you.MS GABRIELLE: Thank you for that question. The answer is yes, we do have the ability to assess the information space with a number of different data science capabilities that we have with our analytics and research team to be able to assess the disinformation environment, including how well false narratives are taking hold.So I just got some information from my team earlier that I think I can probably share. Specifically, we've seen some false narratives in Africa that were being used and were being pushed out by Chinese officials, and we've seen PRC officials shift from those narratives. We assessed that messaging, that the PRC officials messaging in Africa shows that they may have abandoned that disinformation campaign, specifically saying that coronavirus had originated in the U.S. Now those accusations that we were looking at, we looked at the space from March 13 to 15 on those and they received mostly negative reactions, and then they virtually died back down. So instead, PRC narratives seem to have shifted towards criticizing the U.S. for stigmatizing China and praising China's actions. But again, we are able to look at kind of how the information environment is changing and what narratives are taking hold through a number of different data science tools.And then how concerned am I about the messaging? I think that it is really sad to see state actors taking advantage of a global health crisis to try to push their own agendas. I think this is a time when the world is scared and when it's very inappropriate to be using false narratives to push the individual agendas of state actors. And so I am concerned, but I think that we can all do our part. And I think a very important part of decreasing the vulnerability of audiences is by making them aware of how a disinformation environment can be manipulated, and you all are doing a very important part of that by making the public more aware of how disinformation is being used around COVID-19.MR HARUTUNIAN: Shaun Tandon with the next question.QUESTION: Thanks. I was just going to ask if you give some more detail on what you said, which is quite interesting about China moving away from this narrative. You mentioned Africa. Do you see it throughout the world? Do you think that there has been a shift in China with what was alleged with the conspiracy theory of U.S. involvement? And do you still see that at all from the Chinese side? Do you still see it in some places, or has it completely gone? And why do you think it is? You said that perhaps they weren't getting the response they wanted. Is that the reason, or it was also U.S. pressure or U.S. - the U.S. summoning the ambassador, for example? Why do you think it is that they've moved with that? Thanks.MS GABRIELLE: So I'd really like to stick to what I can best answer to, and I - as far as what the reasons are, that would take a much broader analysis than I'd be able to give from my perspective. But what I can tell you is what we're seeing in the information space, and that we've seen in our most recent assessment China moving away from certain disinformation narratives and rather focusing on its global role in fighting COVID-19.So I mentioned Africa. The GEC collected and analyzed social media posts from dozens of official Chinese Government and diplomatic accounts in Africa, specifically looking between the 1st of January and the 18th of March. And initially these accounts were silent on COVID-19, but by the end of the reporting period, discussion of COVID-19 accounted for about 60 percent of all posts from those accounts. And then we had seen China focusing on four prominent narratives from our analysis. One was China's successful containment of the virus. A second was calls for international collaboration. A third was the World Health Organization's praise of China. And a fourth was China's economic resilience. Anti-U.S. tweets comprised a small subset, about .88 percent of the sample, and actually, as I mentioned, performed poorly as African audiences essentially rejected the claims that coronavirus had originated in the U.S., and that they also were rejecting claims that the term, quote, "Chinese virus" was a racist reference. They were rejecting that claim. So interestingly, we see that move away that I mentioned of messaging on disinformation, and rather, a refocus on praising China's actions.So we're also seeing something similar in the Western Hemisphere. I'd say almost the same picture as what we've seen in Africa. So COVID-19-related topics account for about half of the content pushed by official Chinese accounts since the outbreak in early January in the Western Hemisphere. And we've seen China - they are relying on essentially a unified messaging apparatus. The PRC officials that we saw in Africa shifting their narratives, we've also seen that happening in Italy as well. So PRC officials have become really active and are showing concerted effort to systematically cater their messages to global audiences using hashtags, increasing their social media followers to convince people that they're acting responsibly, rather, and providing aid.MR HARUTUNIAN: Okay. Ed Wong from New York Times has the next question.QUESTION: Hi, thank you. Thanks. So one question is what you're seeing - we're discussing the official counts and the very public statements that have come out and the shift in the narrative. What about more covert channels? Do you think that - there's been a lot written, obviously, about Russian trolls and Russian bots and accounts that are Russian in origin but disguised as something else. Would China be doing something similar? Like could they be shifting the official narrative, the public narrative, but then in sort of a more gray zone they're using disguised accounts to push the conspiracy theories or other narratives like that?MS GABRIELLE: So we are seeing essentially ecosystems being developed by the different state actors that we assess, and those ecosystems use a variety of accounts from the state-sponsored accounts to online platforms. China has used its entire information apparatus that I mentioned earlier on the call, including its - including China's ambassadors overseas, its state media, and then what we are seeing is this convergence of disinformation between different state actors. So a good example of this is we see Russia and Kremlin platforms pushing out false narratives, those false narratives being repeated by other state actors, including Beijing, and then Russia retweeting them again and pushing them out as though they originally came from those state actors. We saw that specifically - I've used an example in the past where Russia was quoting the head of the IRGC with a false narrative, but it's a false narrative that Russia had originally pushed out. So that's kind of how it's working. It's a convergence that we're seeing.MR HARUTUNIAN: Nick Wadhams has the next question.QUESTION: Thank you. My question is whether you see the convergence in narratives between separate countries - Russia, Iran, China - as an organic thing, or whether there's anything that leads you to believe there's actually high-level coordination between the governments of those three countries to push those narratives. Thanks.MS GABRIELLE: So I really want to just speak to the data that I'm seeing and the assessments that I've been able to see, and I can't - I can't give an explanation for why. I think that that would require a deeper analysis probably outside the space that I'm working in right now. What I can say is that I'm seeing certain narratives converge. So we've seen over the past several weeks a variety of different narratives, and then some become more prominent, and those really take hold and being pushed out by Russia, China, and Iran all around COVID-19.MR HARUTUNIAN: Okay, next question is Jennifer Hansler.QUESTION: Hey, thanks. How much are you working with private tech companies or private industry to try to combat these narratives? And then separately, we've seen Secretary Pompeo speak pretty extensively on China and somewhat on Iran, but less so on Russia. I was wondering if there's a reason behind that.MS GABRIELLE: Okay, so the first question was about our outreach with tech companies. So I mentioned earlier in the call we have a technology engagement team. We actually have a liaison that is out in Silicon Valley that can directly work with the different companies and social media platforms, but I would say our effort to connect is very robust. I do think that it's important to understand that in best practices in countering disinformation, it takes a variety of approaches. And I think sometimes this is confused. We - depending on the situation, there's just no cookie-cutter approach. We have to look at each situation individually and figure out what the best practices are. And so I think that there is a bit of misconception around this.Tech companies are looking at their specific platforms, and they have very smart people who have created algorithms and who understand exactly how their platforms work and can best see what's happening on their own platforms. But our data scientists are looking at the entire disinformation ecosystem, which goes across a number of different social media platforms and, as I've mentioned before, include official state platforms, proxy websites, as well as online false personas that cross the boundaries of social media platforms. So we're looking at the entire picture, but we are certainly working with tech companies as it makes sense to do so.And then I have to say I think for the second question you asked I (inaudible) --MS ORTAGUS: I can - yeah, I can answer that, Lea, you don't - yeah, I just don't think that that's based in facts. I think that he's - he talks about Russia every single time he talks about disinformation. Chinese Government and Iranian Government officials are the ones who have - who were in the past two weeks - their official governments were the ones that were making the most statements, which is probably why they garnered more attention, but there's never been an interview that I've sat in with him where he hasn't also mentioned Russia. So let's just make sure that we're dealing in facts.Okay. I think we have one last question.MR HARUTUNIAN: Last question from Nick Schifrin.QUESTION: Hey guys, thank you. Sorry (inaudible) mute. Thanks for doing this. Lea, I really appreciate this. Two quick ones, sorry. Derek Scissors is out with a accusation today, and we've heard it from elsewhere, but I want to (inaudible) specifically that China's deliberately not measuring the number of COVID patients or deaths. Do you believe that's true? And I just want to ask --MS ORTAGUS: That - sorry, Nick, that's outside her scope. She's not going to answer that. But you can try another question.QUESTION: Okay, fine. So the President, as we all saw, tweeted overnight after his conversation with Xi Jinping that "China has been through much and has developed a strong understanding of the virus"; they're "working closely together." So how should we see the ongoing efforts that you and others are making to call out Chinese propaganda and misinformation with the idea at least from this tweet that the United States and China are working together and that China has a strong understanding of the virus and is working with the U.S.? Thanks.MS ORTAGUS: So before Lea answers, you should know it's not the GEC's mission to call out Chinese or Iranian or Russian disinformation. That's my mission, that's the Secretary's mission. So that's not the purpose of the GEC or why the Congress authorized it. But go ahead, Lea, you can answer.MS GABRIELLE: So thank you, Morgan. And you're right, the GEC's mission is to counter foreign-state-sponsored propaganda and disinformation. And so countering takes a variety of different approaches, and sometimes the best approach for a specific disinformation narrative is, as Morgan just described, for herself or another U.S. Government official from an official platform to call it out. But sometimes publicly revealing what we're seeing is actually counterproductive to higher-level efforts being made to build cooperation, and sometimes it's a matter of making sure that our policy makers and our leaders are fully informed of what we're seeing.MS ORTAGUS: Great. Thanks, Lea.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7069894 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 29, 2020End of Document

US report finds widespread forced Uighur labor in ChinaAssociated Press InternationalMarch 12, 2020 Thursday 2:55 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICAL NEWSLength: 988 wordsByline: By BEN FOX, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - U.S. lawmakers pushed Wednesday for a ban on imports from a vast area of northwestern China because of the widespread use of forced labor in a region where the communist government has detained more than a million people in a campaign against ethnic minorities.The U.S. already bans imports made with forced labor, but a bipartisan group of lawmakers said virtually anything coming from Xinjiang, including goods sold by major American and global consumer brands, should be considered tainted by the mass detention and repression of Uighurs and other ethnic minorities."We know forced labor is widespread and systematic and exists both within and outside the mass internment camps," said Rep. Jim McGovern, referring to detention centers where the Chinese government is subjecting hundreds of thousands of Uighurs to abusive conditions, torture and political indoctrination.McGovern, a Democrat from Massachusetts, is co-chairman of the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which released a report that documented forced labor. It found it in the mass internment camps, on farms in Xinjiang, that produce cotton for the global market as well as factories elsewhere in the country.The report said major brands, including Coca-Cola, Patagonia and Nike, are suspected of directly or indirectly relying on forced labor. The commission relied on outside experts, satellite imagery, official reports and accounts from The Associated Press and other media organizations.Bipartisan legislation introduced Wednesday would treat all goods from Xianjiang, including clothing and electronic goods sold by major U.S. and global brands, as presumed to be banned unless they were certified by Customs and Border Protection."It shifts the burden of proof and the presumption that, given these practices and what's detailed in this report, we should assume that anything that is produced in this region is done so through forced labor," said Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who is the other co-chairman of the commission.It's not clear when Congress would take up the bill. Legislation that would more broadly address China's campaign against the Uighurs passed without opposition last year, but the House and Senate must still reconcile different versions and send it to the president.A report earlier this month from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute estimated that more than 80,000 Uighurs were transferred from Xinjiang to factories across China between 2017 and 2019. The report said it found "conditions that strongly suggest forced labor" consistent with International Labor Organization definitions.Separately, the AP reported last week that a sprawling Chinese factor that turns out computer screens, cameras and fingerprint scanners for global tech giants also appears to be holding Uighurs and other ethnic minorities under coercive conditions.Corporations mentioned in the report have had varied responses. Coca-Cola said in a statement it prohibits the use of all forms of forced labor and said its sugar supplier in Xinjiang passed an internal audit.In January 2019, Badger Sportswear, a leading supplier of T-shirts and other apparel to U.S. college bookstores, cut ties with a Chinese company after an AP investigation traced shipments from a factory inside an internment camp in Xinjiang.Nike said in a statement that it does not directly source any products in the Xinjiang region and has been reviewing suppliers outside the area "to identify and assess potential risks" to Uighurs and other minorities amid reports that some have been sent to other parts of China to work under repressive conditions."Nike is committed to upholding international labor standards and we are continuing to evaluate how to best monitor our compliance standards in light of the complexity of this situation," the company said.Patagonia said it works with the Fair Labor Association to ensure materials in its supply chain are not produced with forced labor and that none of its finished products comes from Xinjiang."We support the Fair Labor Association's call for an immediate end to forced labor and other human rights abuses against Uighurs in China," the company said in a statement. "We've been horrified by what we've read in the media regarding a systemic, planned effort to force the country's population of ethnic minorities into lives of factory work and a program to change their basic beliefs."A coalition of retailing and manufacturing groups said in a joint statement that they do not tolerate forced labor and that companies are working with experts to ensure the fair treatment of workers in their supply chains. It called on the U.S. government to create a working group that would find "constructive solutions" but did not directly address the proposed legislation."The conditions in Xinjiang and the treatment of ethnic minority workers from the region present profound challenges to the integrity of the global supply chain, including issues of transparency, access, and auditing," it said. "Accepting the status quo is not an option."China has long suspected that Uighurs, who are predominantly Muslim and culturally and ethnically distinct from the majority Han Chinese population, of harboring separatist tendencies. In recent years, though, it has dramatically escalated its campaign against them by detaining more than a million people in the internment camps and prisons.The Chinese government has dismissed international criticism of the campaign as meddling in its internal affairs and described the camps as vocational training centers. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang rejected the findings of the report and denied the use of forced labor."The legitimate labor rights and interests of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are protected according to law, and there is no such thing as forced labor as claimed by someone with ulterior motives," Geng told reporters.Load-Date: March 12, 2020End of Document

It also marks a shift from Tesla s initial plan to sell a more basic version of the Model 3 in China.The company updated its China website showing the standard-range-plus model   the first vehicle produced at the Shanghai factory   as well as the long-range RWD and performance versions of the Model 3. Bloomberg was the first to report the change. The long-range RWD version starts at 366,550 yuan, or about $52,000 after incentives. Deliveries of the long-range RWD version are expected to begin in June.The standard-range-plus model starts at 323,800 yuan, or about $46,000, before local subsidies.The standard-range-plus Model 3 can travel 276 miles on a single charge, according to Tesla s China website. The same website says the long-range RWD Model 3 has a range of 668 km, or 415 miles. Those range estimates are based on the New European Driving Cycle, a forgiving standard that Europe replaced several years ago with the WLTP. The real-word range is likely much lower.Image Credits:Tesla/screenshotTesla started producing a standard-range-plus rear-wheel-drive version of the Model 3 at its Shanghai factory late last year. The first deliveries began in early January. The March approval from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology gave Tesla permission to add another variant to its Chinese portfolio.Eventually, Tesla plans to manufacture the Model Y electric vehicle at the China factory.See Campaign:https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/06/tesla-gets-ok-to-produce-long-range-model-3-at-china-factory/Contact Information:Kirsten KorosecTags:, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: April 13, 2020End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 29 of 616China's Injection Molded Plastics Market Report 2020 with Leading Injection Molded Plastics Producer Profiles - ResearchAndMarkets.com  Page 32 of 616PBS Pulls Film Linked To Chinese Foreign Agent Over Editorial Concerns In Response To DCNF Report  Page 34 of 616ON FOX BUSINESS, PORTMAN HIGHLIGHTS UPCOMING BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION TO HELP END CHINA'S THEFT OF US TAXPAYER-FUNDED RESEARCH  Page 40 of 616Opinion | How China's fake news machine is rewriting the history of Covid-19, even as the pandemic unfolds  Page 42 of 616VOA STATEMENT ON EFFORTS TO RESTRICT U.S. MEDIA OPERATIONS IN CHINA  Page 45 of 616CECC CHAIRS MCGOVERN, RUBIO TO POTUS: ADVOCATE FOR DETAINED JOURNALISTS IN CHINA  Page 47 of 616China takes advantage of coronavirus to invade Philippines territorial sea  Page 50 of 616World distrusts China over its handling of coronavirus outbreak and Xi Jinping government responds aggressively  Page 53 of 616Neil Patel: Either We Heal As A Country Or We Are Going To Crumble  Page 56 of 616Trump Announces Punitive Action Against China - Terminates Relationship With WHO, Orders Barring Of Certain Chinese Students From Entering US  Page 69 of 616Weekly jobless claims expected to hit 5.25 million; Race for the White House: Senator Bernie Sanders exit all but confirms Biden/Trump in November; Zoom Backlas....  Page 72 of 616Chinese city discriminating against blacks  Page 76 of 616Global Government Cloud Industry; Government Cloud market worldwide is projected to grow by US$24. 4 Billion, driven by a compounded growth of 13. 6%.
