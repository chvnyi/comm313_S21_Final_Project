US to hit Huawei employees with visa bans for rights abusesAssociated Press Financial WireJuly 15, 2020 Wednesday 11:13 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; WASHINGTON DATELINE; POLITICAL NEWSLength: 593 wordsByline: MATTHEW LEE, AP Diplomatic WriterDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration said Wednesday it will impose travel bans on employees of the Chinese technology giant Huawei and other Chinese companies the U.S. determines are assisting authoritarian governments in cracking down on human rights, including in China's western Xinjiang province.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also said the administration is finalizing plans to minimize data theft from the popular Chinese video streaming app TikTok, although he stopped short of saying it would be banned outright.Pompeo made the announcements a day after the British government said it would ban Huawei from its 5G networks over concerns that sensitive data could be compromised by the Chinese Communist Party.Pompeo told reporters at a State Department news conference that Huawei employees found to be providing “material support to regimes engaging in human rights violations and abuses globally" would be hit with sanctions.“Companies impacted by today’s action include Huawei, an arm of the CCP’s surveillance state that censors political dissidents and enables mass internment camps in Xinjiang and the indentured servitude of its population shipped all over China,” he said. "Certain Huawei employees provide material support to the CCP regime that commits human rights abuses.“Telecommunications companies around the world should consider themselves on notice: If they are doing business with Huawei, they are doing business with human rights abusers,” Pompeo said.Huawei said it was “disappointed" in the decision, which it called “unfair.”“Huawei operates independent of the Chinese government,” it said in a statement. “We are a private, employee-owned firm. We are disappointed by this unfair and arbitrary action to restrict visas of our employees who work tirelessly to contribute to technological innovation in the U.S. and around the world.”At a later event sponsored by The Hill newspaper, Pompeo said the administration was also looking at how to prevent data theft from TikTok and other Chinese companies.“Whether it’s TikTok or any of the other Chinese communications platforms, apps, infrastructure, this administration has taken seriously the requirement to protect the American people from having their information end up in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he said. “And so we are working through a process where all the relevant agencies and the private sector are getting to say their piece. We hope to have a set of decisions shortly which will reflect this central understanding.”White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told reporters on Air Force One that administration officials are looking at the national security risks associated with TikTok, WeChat and other apps gathering information on American citizens. He said there is no deadline for action, but said it was likely weeks, not months.It is not clear how many Huawei employees would be affected. Huawei says on its website that it has more than 194,000 employees in more than 170 countries and regions.The U.S. has led a worldwide campaign to convince foreign governments, particularly those in allied nations, to bar Huawei from their advanced telecommunications networks, arguing that allowing them into those systems would lead to violations of their citizens' privacy.The U.S. has also threatened NATO and other allies with curtailments or suspensions in intelligence sharing and cooperation should they allow Huawei components or technology in their high-speed networks.___Associated Press staff writer Aamer Madhani contributed to this report.Load-Date: July 15, 2020End of Document

Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, June 17.Your top stories right now at 8:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.Coronavirus cases are spiking once again. Six states including Florida and Texas reporting record high number of cases. Meanwhile some good news on fighting the pandemic: a low cost steroid shows promise in treating patients.Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell on Capitol Hill. He says there are signs of a modest rebound. But he is also warning significant uncertainty remains and pushing Congress for more stimulus.Markets are higher this morning. Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading extending yesterday's big rally, now at the highs of the morning with the Dow futures up 98 points. The Nasdaq futures up 48. And the S&P futures up 10 points.Much stronger than expected retail sales fueled a rally yesterday. And markets finished up 526 points on the Dow. The Nasdaq was up 169.President Trump taking action on police reform. He signed an executive order pushing for higher standards for use of force, and de-escalation training. Also emphasizing the importance of police saying that without police there is chaos. Congress working on additional reforms set to be unveiled later today.U.S. companies given the green light to work with Huawei on setting 5G standards. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross telling me he is still opposed to the use of Huawei technology saying spying is a very real issue.Plus censorship on the Internet. Google forcing some conservative news sites to remove comments in order to keep lucrative Google ads.MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.Global markets this morning also higher. European indices higher across the board. FT is 100 up 27. The CAC 40 is up 49. And the DAX index in Germany up 61.Inflation showing in the Eurozone this morning. May consumer prices were down a tenth of a percent, month-over-month. So no real inflation.In Asia overnight, markets are mostly higher except for Japan. The Nikkei average was down. Japan reporting that exports in the month of May were down over 28 percent year-over-year. Meanwhile in China, Beijing is closing schools, blocking off some neighborhoods and canceling flights as it sees a spike in coronavirus cases.Joining the conversation this morning is Dagen McDowell, Alli McCartney and Mike Huckabee. Great to see everybody.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Great to see you.MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: Good morning.ALLI MCCARTNEY, MANAGING PARTNER, UBS: Good morning.BARTIROMO: Some of the top stories that we are watching this morning.In just a few hours, police reform will take center stage on Capitol Hill. Senator Tim Scott set to reveal the GOP's Justice Act today. Leading Senate Democrats already slamming the plan even before seeing it, claiming it falls short of meaningful reform. House Democrats unveiled their Justice and Policing Act last week.The GOP plan comes a day after President Trump signed an executive order on police reform banning chokeholds in all but the most extreme cases and improving information sharing to address mental health issues.The Fulton County, Georgia district attorney expected to announce whether to charge the officers involved in Rayshard Brooks' death. Three charges are being considered against now fired Atlanta officer Garrett Rolfe, including felony murder.Meanwhile Atlanta fire officials have released new photos of a woman that they believe was involved in setting a Wendy's on fire during protests over Brooks' death. They're offering a reward for information.Google is under scrutiny this morning after blocking the financial blog ZeroHedge from advertising on its platform over posts in its comments section. The technology giant also threatening to take that same step against "The Federalist" for violating its policies on dangerous or derogatory content. Google says "The Federalist" removed its comments section after it warned it could cut off the company's ad revenue.Senator Ted Cruz sending a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, saying that the company is abusing its monopoly power to censor political speech.And the Justice Department reportedly set to propose limits on legal protections for big tech firms like Twitter, Google and Facebook. According to "The Wall Street Journal" the proposed reforms could be announced as soon as today and are aimed at forcing Internet companies to crack down on illicit and illegal content on their sites.President Trump recently signed an executive order targeting legal protections of social media companies in response to concerns about alleged online censorship.Conservative censorship on the Web. NBC News' verification center forced to backtrack this morning after allegedly pushing Google to ban ads on a conservative Web site. The report says that the technology giant planned to demonetize both ZeroHedge and "The Federalist" over racist content in their comments section. Google viewed the issue and said that "The Federalist" was never demonetized because it removed comments on its site.Joining me right now is former White House press secretary and Fox News contributor Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Sarah -- it's great to see you again. Thanks so much for being here.SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Great to be with you. Thanks -- Maria.BARTIROMO: Well it's interesting that Google can force "The Federalist" to eliminate their comment section. It's not like "The Federalist" wrote the comments. These are comments from people who read articles on "The Federalist" and want to comment on them. And yet Google said if you don't remove that comments section we are going cut into your ad revenue.SANDERS: I think it's a very dangerous game for Google to start playing the censorship card particularly if they're going to focus all their efforts of censorships on conservative Web sites. And if they don't do the same on liberal Web sites I think it shows a very clear bias and sends a very clear message about where they are leaning and where they are pushing people to go,I think that is a very dangerous road for them to go down. Just like the media shouldn't take a role in elections, Google and other big tech companies shouldn't either. They need to put information out there and let Americans decide for themselves where they are going to go.I have seen some pretty outrageous comments on a lot of liberal Web sites about the President and people in his administration, myself included, that have never been taken down, never been asked to be removed by companies like Google.And I think this is a very dangerous road and one they should think very carefully about before they travel down it.BARTIROMO: It's probably one of the reasons that there are real questions about new legislation that will remove any protections that these social media companies have in terms of not getting sued because they are not content creators. In fact Devin Nunes says that is exactly what they are -- content creators.SANDERS: That is certainly what they are becoming. And they're moving more into that space.And again I think that that is a difficult place for them to travel down. Particularly we have seen so much intensity focused on censorship of conservatives but not that same level of scrutiny placed on liberal web sites. I think that they are putting themselves in a very bad position. And not a very good one I think moving forward over the -- as we particularly get closer to the election. And something I think they should take a big step back from and that's across the board for big tech and social media platforms.BARTIROMO: Yes. Dagen.MCDOWELL: Sarah -- so many people in the media are upset with, and you experienced this firsthand, President Trump and the treatment of the media by people within the administration.However, I will point out to quote Sean Davis, the co-founder of "The Federalist" that it is in fact NBC News that is interfering in the coverage of an election. Here is what Sean Davis wrote on Twitter. "NBC News is in a lot of trouble given that they conspired with a secretive foreign outfit -- he's referring to the U.K. Center for Countering Digital Hate -- to defame 'the Federalist' and seek to interfere in U.S. elections by trying to get publications banned and de-platformed in the middle of the 2020 election."So remember, some members of the media clearly need to hold up a mirror and look in it if they want to talk about the destruction of our constitutional protections of freedom of speech and the destruction of trust in the media.SANDERS: Absolutely. I think one of the things that we have seen a significant amount of, particularly over the last several years, is Democrats and liberals are all for freedom of speech as long as what you are saying is what they also believe.If you don't, then they want to shut that down. They want to censor it. They want to close you down. And I think that we see that more and more through the big tech companies. I think again, they have got to take some real steps to correct this and make sure that they are not playing content creation but they're simply providing a platform for other people to put information out there. Otherwise, I think they are going to find themselves in a lot of hot water moving forward.BARTIROMO: Yes. Let me ask you about John Bolton, former national security adviser. John Bolton now being sued by the Trump administration over the release of his new book.So the department of Justice says that the memoir still contains classified any information that could compromise national security and should be blocked from release next week. The book's publisher says Bolton has fully cooperated with security guidelines -- Sarah. Your reaction.SANDERS: Look, I have not read the book so it's hard to comment on specifics. But what I do know is I was in the room with the President far more than John Bolton over the last three years. And based on what I am hearing about the book, in my experience what I saw was a president who loves this country, spent every day trying to make it better.John Bolton echoed that message of the President and publicly said a lot of very nice things about the President, right up until the moment he got fired.I find that to be extremely interesting. He had a moment that he could have testified under oath if he thought that there were impeachable offenses. He didn't. He often had an agenda that ran contrary to the President's.And I think what we are seeing right now is an effort to sell more books by John Bolton.BARTIROMO: Yes.SANDERS: And I think it is a sad thing and a bad thing for the country, that he has chosen to go down this road.BARTIROMO: All right. Let's talk Father's Day -- just around the corner this upcoming Sunday -- Sarah. We've got your father with us on the panel today. What do you have planned for Sunday -- Sarah?SANDERS: Unfortunately I'm not going to get to be with my dad. But we have been able to spend some time together, and you, know I used to think that I was a pretty big deal to my dad. And then I had my own kids and I quickly learned that I didn't matter anymore. And it was all about the grandkids which is perfectly fine.And they've had a great time, getting to spend some time with their Papa and hopefully we will have many home made cards from them for him on Sunday.BARTIROMO: What about it -- Governor. You must be so proud.HUCKABEE: I would say "Sarah who?" You know, I have these six wonderful grandchildren -- three by Sarah, three by my other son. I don't even recognize her except when I see her on television.BARTIROMO: I don't believe you.SANDERS: It's a sad day. It's a sad day.BARTIROMO: Too bad you're not going to see each other on Father's Day. Yes. And we see your posts and your beautiful family -- Sarah. Congrats to you.SANDERS: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Great to see you this morning -- Sarah. Sarah Sanders. Governor Huckabee -- great to have you all morning long with us. We've got a lot to talk about this morning.Coming up, I'll be speaking with Mr. Equity Partners founder chairman and CEO Robert Smith on diversity in small business funding. Don't miss that.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Retail's record jump. Futures are up this morning. Investors optimistic over record consumer spending. Yesterday we saw the May sales report seeing the largest increase on record. Retail sales were up 17.7 percent in the month May. Overall sales are still down 8 percent from February.Joining me right now is Wells Fargo Investment Institute president Darrell Cronk. Darrell -- great to see you.What did you make of that retail sales number yesterday? I guess it did give some credibility to the report on jobs just a few days earlier when we saw 2.5 million jobs created in the month of May.DARRELL CRONK, PRESIDENT, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT INSTITUTE: Yes. You're exactly right -- Maria. Good morning.So it's the strongest reading on record. And if you get into each of the categories the spending was kind of off the charts across almost every category. So there is just absolutely nothing bad at all about the retail sales numbers.Your point is well taken if you couple it with the jobs report, from a couple of Fridays ago. And then also if you start looking at things like what we've seen with mortgage applications investigations setting an 11- year-high already this morning that (INAUDIBLE) released.The NFIB numbers were much better which is a good proxy of small business. We have seen the University of Michigan consumer sentiment number move higher and even the consumer comfort numbers moved higher. So the data of late has certainly been much better and well received by the markets.BARTIROMO: So what do you want to do then in terms of investing? We've got Alli McCartney on the panel this morning. And Alli -- you've been talking about midcap companies.MCCARTNEY: Yes, I think a lot of the data that we have just talked about has already been priced in. That is why we're trading at, you know, over 20 times next year's earnings and it's sort of thrown out this year's earnings.And so the question is if we are a little overvalued, and if a lot of this good news and good data is priced in, then where do we find opportunity.And we're starting to look at the midcap space because large cap growth has been what has taken us out of the bear market. And we see a lot of room and cyclicality and bottoming in the numbers that will have midcap which is also very value-oriented taking out from here.Darrell -- what is your positioning on growth versus value? And do you feel a lot of this good news is priced into the market already when you have risks being put in front us like we're seeing second waves in other countries?CRONK: Yes, it's a great point -- Alli. So we actually like midcaps. I've liked midcaps for some time. My two favorite areas within the (INAUDIBLE) markets today continue to be large and midcap stocks over small caps. We like domestic over international. And we continue to like cyclical over value.There has been rotation of late in valuing, certainly make an argument that that there is cheaper valuations there, or better more attractive valuations. We still think areas like technology, consumer discretionary, (INAUDIBLE) services are what's going to continue to lead the market higher. There is a value play that we like here. We think financials do make some sense. You're getting paid handsomely in the dividend yield while you wait.Most of the financials are trading far less than their tangible book value (INAUDIBLE). So there is some good opportunity within the market but you do have to be selective. You're right. I wouldn't tell them to dig in (ph) they were cheap at the industry levels we are looking at today.BARTIROMO: Darrell -- are you expecting anything out of Jay Powell today? The Federal Reserve chairman gearing up for day two of his semiannual congressional testimony? Yesterday, of course, here is what he said about the economy.CRONK: Yes --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)POWELL: The last thing I will say is this. It's all quite uncertain but we appear to be entering that second phase of the economy reopening and businesses reopening and spending increasing. In the long run, I am confident positive that we will have full recovery.The fact is we've had the largest economic shock in living memory and the economy is going to recover from that. But we just have to be a little patient with it.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Darrell -- all this as the Fed is now buying corporate bonds directly from eligible lenders. Don't fight the Fed? What do you do? Do you do what the Fed does?CRONK: Yes. Certainly the latest trade has been to buy what Chair Powell is buying. They announced Monday what they call the secondary market corporate credit facility which is what they'll use to buy up to $250 billion worth of corporate bonds in the market.It's been 85 days since they announced the parameters (ph) -- just now launching it. So we think corporate bonds and what we call spread products still make sense here as you think about the back half of the year. There's all kinds of firepower. You couple that with what they just announced Monday with the launch of the Main Street lending program which also has $600 billion worth of ammunition that the Boston Fed will purchase up to 95 percent of those loans.There is some opportunities we still think in the fixed income markets. Where the Fed goes we want to go.BARTIROMO: Ok. That's what I was -- that's what I was thinking. Follow the Fed.Darrell -- it's great to get your insights this morning. Thank you -- sir. We will see you soon. Darrell Cronk joining us there.Stay with us. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Mark Zuckerberg diving into politics. The Facebook CEO writing an op-ed in "USA Today" outlining his plan to get out the vote this November. Zuckerberg writes this, "I believe Facebook has a responsibility, not just to prevent voter suppression which disproportionately targets people of color, but also to actively support well-informed voter engagement, registration and turnout." Zuckerberg also announced users will be able to turn off political ads as part of a new feature.Governor Huckabee -- what do you think about that?HUCKABEE: You know, Zuckerberg seems to get it in a way that a lot of the other tech execs don't. he's not perfect for sure but at least he recognizes that it's the consumer that ought to turn off the political ads, not the media giant. And I appreciate him for doing that. Well done -- Zuckerberg.BARTIROMO: What do you think is going to happen here though? I mean all of this pressure on social media and media companies in general to make sure, and not at least put -- get perceived as covering up speech, censoring free speech. The DOJ obviously making moves today. How does this play out in your view?HUCKABEE: I think these companies have one of two choices. they either start acting like a common carrier and they don't try to regulate what people say. They simply provide a platform.Or else the government is going to bust them up and they're going to bust them up hard. And frankly, I don't see them having enough good common sense to make the decision on their own. I think we are going to see antitrust actions, civil suits and they're going to be split all to pieces.BARTIROMO: Dagen -- what do you think?MCDOWELL: Some of what Mark Zuckerberg is doing is posturing because he's trying to at least look better than the other large tech companies that are monopolies that like Google is working in cahoots with the media organization to shut down -- NBC News -- to shut down another media organization.But in terms of these bastions of liberal and progressive thought. That is what these technology companies are. They need to start walking the talk. I say it over and over again. But if you look at black America -- 13 percent of this country, the population is made up of black Americans. At Facebook the overall workforce, less than 4 percent of the workforce at Facebook is black.In technical jobs it is 1.5 percent. That is appalling. So they need to start stepping up. And I'm going to call them out as much as I can because what they are doing in terms of hiring practices is really, really frightening.BARTIROMO: Important -- important issue that you raised.Investors are waiting on some housing data this morning. that housing data will be out in moments. We will bring you those numbers on the other side of this break.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday June 17th. Your top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East coast.Markets are higher this morning. Looking to extend yesterday's big rally. Take a look. Dow futures up 147 points right now. We had a pretty good pop in the last 20 minutes. The NASDAQ is up 56 and the S&P 500 higher by 16. This on top of a big rally yesterday sparked by that much stronger than expected retail sales report. At the close on Wall Street yesterday, the Dow Industrials were up 526 points, that was better than two percent. The NASDAQ was up 169 and the S&P was up 58.Global markets also with a firmer tone this morning for the most part, European indices, take a look, green across the board. FT100 up 45, the Quatre Quarante in Paris up 45 as well, and the DAX Index in Germany up 65. Inflation slowing in the Eurozone this morning. May consumer prices out, falling 1/10th of a percent month over month.In Asia overnight markets were mostly higher with the exception of Japan, take a look. Japan reporting May exports down 28 percent year over year. Meanwhile in China, Beijing is closing schools, blocking off some neighborhoods and cancelling flights as it sees another spike in coronavirus cases. This time in Beijing. Nonetheless, the Asian markets mostly higher.Major job cuts at Hilton to report. Cheryl Casone with those details now. Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: That's right Maria, good morning. Hilton is cutting 2,100 jobs worldwide, or about 22 percent of the workforce following the collapse in travel from the COVID-19 pandemic. Hilton is also extending corporate pay cuts, furloughs and reduced ours for up to three more months. Hilton CEO says this is the first time in the company's 101 year history that a global crisis has virtually halted travel and he's devastated that he had to make this move, but they need to protect the busines. Hilton has more than 6,100 properties in 188 countries and territories. Taking a look a the stock, it is unchanged in the premarket. Down though, about 30 percent this year.Well, beginning today, US Facebook user are going to have the option to completely turn off all political advertising on their feed. After the company announced they would not fact check or moderate the ads. In a post Mark Zuckerberg said for those of you who have already made up your minds and want the election to just, well, be over, we hear you. Facebook also launched a new push to register voters. Users are going to see a voting information center on their feeds. The goal register four million they say. There's the stock in the premarket. It's up about half a percent.Well here's a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com. Apple is reopening more than 70 stores in the US this week after the coronavirus pandemic forced a mass shutdown in March. Elon Musk says SpaceX is developing offshore floating space ports to launch travel to the Moon, Mars and hypersonic travel. And finally this, NBA players who choose not to play when the season resumes reportedly won't face disciplinary action. They've got until June 24th to decide. And those are your headlines from the newsroom, Maria. Back to you.BARTIROMO: Alright, Cheryl. Thank you so much. Addressing trade imbalances this morning. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer set to testify before the House Ways and Means Committee later this morning. The USTR reportedly expected to call for a global reset in tariff's as the Trump administration wages battle with the World Trade Organization. Joining me right now is Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Mister Secretary, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for joining me.WILBUR ROSS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF COMMERCE: Thank you for having me on, Maria.BARTIROMO: What are you trying to do in terms of tariff's now with the World Trade Organization?ROSS: Well the President has always had the idea that tariff's should be reciprocal. If some country charges us X, we shouldn't only chart them a fraction of that. His real purpose, though, is to bring them down everywhere. So, reciprocal is important, low is important, and I think you'll hear Trade Rep Lighthizer talking about structural reforms to the WTO itself.BARTIROMO: Have you gotten any response on any of this? Do you expect that we will see tariff's go lower across the world?ROSS: Well, it's a very much more complicated story, because every country is a little bit different. But US historically has been, and remains today, the lowest, less protectionist country. And we have the trade deficits to show for it. So, the real problem is getting the other countries to be less protectionist.BARTIROMO: Secretary I want to switch gears, ask about Huawei. We were all very surprised yesterday to learn the news that the Commerce Department is now allowing American companies to work with Chinese telecom giant Huawei on setting 5G standards. Will this normalize, will this move normalize and elevate a company that has ties to the Chinese government we know that this is a state run company. And that there back doors and the data goes back to the Chinese Communist Party. Why the change?ROSS: Well, the change is really simply a clarification. It isn't that we're doing something to help Huawei. What we're doing is something to make it easier for global standards to be symmetrical. If our companies are not allowed to participate in the setting of standards, you'll have the same kind of problem that occurred many years ago when cell phones were early. You couldn't have a cell phone that worked in Japan and also worked in Korea, because they hadn't adopted a common standard. So, the idea of this is to make sure that standards are symmetrical, that they're worldwide and that with 5G, they facilitate the interconnectedness of everything. Every person, everything, every factory, every process, that's the whole idea of 5G. So, this is not anything to help 5G in Huawei, this is to help make sure we have ubiquity in 5G.BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, is there any reason that there should be vulnerabilities here by the use of Huawei and just the work with American companies? Should we be worried that there is a vulnerability and the opportunity to spy, given the Huawei connection?ROSS: Well, we are very opposed to the use of Huawei for 5G, and we've been explaining our purposes to countries all around the world. And they're gradually getting to realize it. There really is a vulnerability with 5G that's much more severe than it had been with 4G, 3G, 2G. So, we think it's very important, as you know, FCC is banning the use of Huawei in this country.BARTIROMO: Yeah.ROSS: Many other countries are limiting the use of it, and the problem with the security issue on Huawei is you'll never really know if there was a back door until they decide to open it, and that's far too late.BARTIROMO: Right, sure. What about this subcommittee of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee? Recently concluding an investigation, Secretary, into four Chinese Communist Party telecom companies for pretty much operating in this country, spying on American telecom companies for a long time, using their access to American carriers to conduct essentially unchecked espionage against the US. How worried are you about these four Chinese telecom companies that apparently have been embedded in US companies for decades?ROSS: Well, as you know, the FCC is taking action against them. And I think that's the correct thing to do. It's clear that one of the reasons that Huawei is so aggressive in its pricing is that it has motives, perhaps other than just providing commercial service. That's what we have great concern about. And that's what FCC is dealing with. You look at Huawei is under Federal indictment for several serious offenses, that's why the CEO's daughter, who is also the Chief Financial Officer, has been under house arrest in Canada, for well over a year, because she's trying to fight extradition to the United States, so she can be tried.BARTIROMO: Yeah.ROSS: Among the things she is being charged with is bank fraud.BARTIROMO: Well, you, I know this administration has been very tough and severe on this issue, but these companies, I'm talking China Mobile, China Telecom, China Unicom and ComNet. Three of those are actually traded on the New York Stock Exchange. So, I mean, some people have made the case that we're actually paying the CCP to spy on us, given that they're raising dollars, they're raising funding by being listed on our exchanges, and yet, their business is to spy on American companies.ROSS: Well, where stock is traded has very little to do with these other issues. But the President has directed the government to look into the accounting procedures that Chinese companies use, because many of us feel that those procedures are not adequate, they're not adequate to protect American investors.BARTIROMO: Okay.ROSS: Their whole concepts of auditing and financial principals in accounting are not the same as ours, so that's a whole separate issue, but the spying is a very real issue.BARTIROMO: Absolutely.ROSS: Very real issue.BARTIROMO: It's a real issue. Yeah, I mean that's why I want to make sure to communicate it, because our audience needs to know this. Real quick before we go. Let me squeeze in this question about potential $1 trillion dollar infrastructure package being spoken about by the administration in an effort to boost the economy. 5G wireless infrastructure would be part of that package. Is this something the administration is considering?ROSS: Well, President Trump, way back in the campaign days was very much in favor of big infrastructure bill. We've already taken many measures to reduce the time it takes to get an infrastructure project approved. It had been where it could take 10 years to get the approvals in themselves. It had been where it could cost almost 40 percent of the total project just for consultant fees, lawyer fees, things like that. We've gotten rid of a lot of that regulatory morass. Now what we need is funding to do a very significant program for infrastructure. We need rural broadband. We need our airports to be fixed. We need our highways to be fixed. We need our ports.BARTIROMO: Yeah.ROSS: We need our water infrastructure. We need our electrical grids.BARTIROMO: Might we see that this year? Will we see that this year Secretary?ROSS: Well, we'll see. It all depends on whether the Congress can get together and decide what activities, how many dollars, how to pay for it, and whether to just keep it a pure infrastructure bill, which is what the Senate wants, or whether they're going to load it up a bunch of goodies, which is what the initial draft from the House said.BARTIROMO: Sure. Yes, we understand. Secretary, it's good to see you this morning. Thank you so much. We will keep following all of that.ROSS: Thank you Maria. Good to be here.BARTIROMO: Very important conversation. We'll see you soon. Have a good day. Secretary Wilbur Ross. Stay with us, we'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A possible game changer in the fight against coronavirus. A new study shows the inexpensive steroid Dexamethasone can reduce death rates by 1/3 for the most seriously ill patients. Joining us right now is family medicine doctor Mikhail Varshavski, aka, Doctor Mike. Doctor Mike, great to have you. Scientists are calling this a major breakthrough, is it?DOCTOR MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, FAMILY MEDICINE DOCTOR: Good morning Maria, thank you so much for having me. I think this is a potential huge deal. It's not going to be a cure. It is going to be a very very helpful treatment for those who are on ventilators or on supplemental oxygen. That's where we've seen the biggest benefit in this study. However, Maria, I do have to say that I approach this with a bit of skepticism. At least healthy skepticism, because, I have not seen the full study. None of us has seen the full study. We're getting all this information essentially from press releases by the authors of the study and I'm inclined to trust them, but we have seen in the past few weeks studies coming out, at least preliminary reports to these studies, that were promising, but once the actual studies were released in peer reviewed journal, we found that they weren't exactly as promised. So, I will hold completely until I see the full study published in the coming weeks.BARTIROMO: Do you know if the drug has been used to treat COVID-19 patients in the United States yet?VARSHAVSKI: Yes, Maria. So, Dexamethasone is a commonly used steroid, both oral and IV, and we use it in several cases, not just in COVID-19 where we have a lot of inflammation going on inside a patient's body. Think sepsis, when you have an infection that potentially starts as a pneumonia and then starts spreading throughout the body through the blood. We use Dexamthasone in these cases. I know several ICU physicians who've used Dexamethasone in COVID-19 cases specifically, in fact one of the spokespeople for Northwell Health, which is one of the biggest providers here in New York, said that they've been using this medicine. So, it's not something that's foreign to physicians, but it's nice to have quality evidence to back up that type of treatment.BARTIROMO: Yeah, really good Op-ed in the Journal this morning from the Vice President that there is no second wave of the coronavirus. He's talking about 23 million tests being taken already, and that we're in a much better shape, much better place than we were just four months ago. Worth a read there. Doctor Mike, it's good to see you this morning sir. Thanks so much. We will see you soon. Mike Varshavski. Stay with us, we'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Time for the morning buzz. First up, don't stand too close. Amazon reportedly testing a new wearable device int it's fulfilment centers to tell workers when they are not social distancing. The clear plastic sleeve has a flashing light and flashing lights and beeping alerts to tell you to move farther away from somebody. Governor Huckabee, what do you think?HUCKABEE: I love it. I want to get one. I don't want to work in an Amazon warehouse. It's not that. But I would just like to wear one so that if somebody comes up and wants to be close talker, the alarm goes off. If somebody wants to mug me, the alarm goes off. I think this is great. Everybody ought to have one. It could change the world. It could be a lot of fun watching people step back when they've gotten too close, so way to go Amazon. Another great product.BARTIROMO: Alright, next up, a new look for Tom Brady. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers releasing the first look at the famed quarterback in his new uniform. There he is. Brady joining the team after spending the first 20 seasons of his career with the New England Patriots. Nice uniform Dagen, what do you think?MCDOWELL: I'm very happy for Tampa Bay. It will give, lift people's spirits down in that beautiful part of Florida, but if that's a white jersey, the other color, Florida is really steamy, I would say, well, 12 months out of the year, and you wear those dark colors out in the hot summer Florida sun, or even the winter sun. Man, watch out.BARTIROMO: It's hot. Finally this, Boston Dynamics putting its four legged Spot robot up for sale. It's one of the business in the United States. This robot is used mostly for surveying and data collection but could be used for other tasks as well. Spot comes at price tag of $74,000, roughly the same cost as a Tesla model S, Alli, what do you think?MCCARTNEY: I think I'll take two as long as it'll help me clean my house during this quarantine pandemic.BARTIROMO: You need spot.MCCARTNEY: Yes. I need lots of spots. Help me with my kids, my work, everything.MCDOWELL: It's called a Rumba Alli. You've got to buy a Rumba. You don't have a Rumba or like eight Rumba's roaming around your house, come on.BARTIROMO: Rumba. I've seen that Rumba, but no, I don't have that either. So, I'm with you.MCDOWELL: If you've got dogs, they will freak out.MCCARTNEY: I have a dog. I've got a puppy and a blind dog. So, it feels like we have a Rumba all the time.BARTIROMO: There you go. Still ahead, I'll speak with Georgia Congressman, House Judiciary Committee Member Doug Collins, he's up, coming up on the politization of the Justice Department, next hour, Morning with Maria right here, stay with us.Load-Date: June 17, 2020End of Document

TikTok: A National Security Time Bomb Waiting to Explode?Newsweek.comJuly 8, 2020 Wednesday 3:01 PM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1067 wordsByline: Charlie KirkHighlight: The U.S. should follow India's lead, when it comes to TikTok.BodyTikTok is: A Chinese-owned social media company that, like Snapchat and Instagram (owned by Facebook), permits users, primarily young users, to send quick video clips to their "followers."TikTok is also: An expression used to convey the idea of a ticking time bomb. In this instance, those two seemingly very different definitions have now converged to become synonyms, and it's time for our leaders to do something about it.While many of us conservatives, especially young conservatives more familiar with the use of social media, have repeatedly warned about TikTok capturing our children's personal and private information and sharing it with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the recent border clashes between India and China, which led to India banning almost 60 Chinese apps, has brought the "older folks" into the conversation. Their participation is welcome. Their leadership is needed.In an interview Monday with Fox News' Laura Ingraham, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo indicated the White House is preparing to provide that leadership, and is looking into banning TikTok from the U.S. "We are taking this very seriously and we are certainly looking at it," Pompeo said. "We have worked on this very issue for a long time."Even Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) was willing to reach across the aisle and partner with Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) to request the director of national intelligence investigate the national security threat posed by TikTok's presumed stealing of personal data and sending it back to our number one geopolitical enemy, the People's (you can only laugh at the use of the word "people" in this context) Republic of China.While Pompeo was warning that "Americans should be careful about using TikTok to avoid having their private information fall in[to] the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," TikTok was busy preparing the following statement in response to the secretary's challenge:"TikTok is led by an American CEO, with hundreds of employees and key leaders across safety, security, product and public policy here in the U.S. We have no higher priority than promoting a safe and secure app experience for our users. We have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked."You have to love the meeting between American public relations language and official totalitarian propaganda.TikTok is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance. The social media company was started in 2012 by Chinese entrepreneur Yiming Zhang and has exploded in value to an estimated $75 billion to $100 billion.The company's statement is problematic for two distinct reasons:• Spokespeople for Chinese-based companies have to be willing to lie or run the risk of ending up getting "disappeared."The CCP doesn't ask for anything. It takes.Here in the U.S., ByteDance has found its "useful idiot" in Kevin Mayer, a former executive at the very "woke" Disney, where he was instrumental in building out Disney's streaming services. As the new CEO of TikTok, Mayer has been tasked with building trust with America and the West.Good luck with that.To make sense of the incredible influence already wielded by TikTok here in America, the app has been downloaded over 165 million times in the U.S. alone (and over two billion times worldwide). In the first quarter of this year, TikTok became the most-downloaded app ever in a single quarter in the U.S., far surpassing the popularity of Facebook among Gen Z users.I personally get hundreds of emails from students asking if it's safe to use TikTok and my answer is like Secretary Pompeo's: only if you want your personal information in the hands of the CCP.In Washington, the politician who has been way out in front on this issue is Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO). Going back to last year, he introduced the National Security and Personal Data Act, which would, among other things, bar companies like TikTok from transferring Americans' personal data out of the country and back to China. The bill would also rightly change merger rules when Chinese companies try to buy U.S. firms that possess large troves of user data, requiring pre-approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) in order for the merger or acquisition to go through.While I applaud Sen. Hawley's early leadership on this issue, it's now clear, in light of what has transpired in 2020 with the spread of the Chinese coronavirus and the unmasking of the CCP as our number one geopolitical foe, that the bill just doesn't go far enough.It is time for us to take an even more aggressive stand, as a nation. This is no longer a free market versus regulation debate—it's an extraordinary and urgent national security threat.We need to change our focus from controlling Chinese influence, money and technology in our country to that of removing the Chinese influence, money and technology from our country. It is one thing to acknowledge the reality that "there will always be spies." It is quite another to pay them to spy on us.Congressman Matt Gaetz (R-FL) has been at the forefront of fighting another battle against a Chinese company, DJI, that has manufactured and sold most of the drones that are used for surveillance by American law enforcement. In many cases, these drones were donated to local police departments at the height of the pandemic to help with crowd monitoring. Ask yourself why DJI would make such a generous gesture? Gaetz has pointed out that these drones are likely sending security data back to China on the movement of American citizens and the tactics of our police.Despite what should be an obvious concern about the threat, Gaetz has been met with considerable resistance in his efforts to get these drones banned. You see, these drones are less expensive than other comparative models made here in America.Less expensive? That depends upon how we measure the cost.If we are not prepared to do the simple math—that the safety of our children and welfare of our nation is worth more to us than a few dollars saved on a flying piece of Chinese plastic—then we deserve what's coming for us.Perhaps I should post a story about it on TikTok? At least if I do, I can be sure the Chinese will see it.Charlie Kirk is the author of The New York Times bestseller The MAGA Doctrine: The Only Ideas That Will Win the Future and host of The Charlie Kirk Show.The views expressed in this article are the writer's own.Link to ImageGraphic TikTok app on smartphoneMARTIN BUREAU/AFP via Getty ImagesTikTok app on smartphoneLoad-Date: July 8, 2020End of Document

Biden Campaign Follows DNC's Lead, Tells Staffers To Delete TikTok Amid National Security ConcernsThe Daily CallerJuly 28, 2020 Tuesday 03:12 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: DAILY-CALLER-NEWS-FOUNDATION; techLength: 593 wordsByline: Chris White, Tech Reporter, chris@dailycallernewsfoundation.orgChris is a Missourian trying to find news angles in the blank spaces of life.

The decision comes shortly after the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee warned staff not to use the app, CNN reported on July 11.United States officials and lawmakers are considering a ban on the growing video-sharing app. TikTok has been downloaded more than 2 billion times globally from the App Store and Google Play, according to an April 29 report from Sensor Tower Store Intelligence, a firm providing mobile application marketing advice.“We are taking this very seriously. We are certainly looking at it,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said during a July 7 Fox News interview after being asked whether President Donald Trump is making a move against the company. His comments come as national security experts warn that TikTok, Huawei, and other Chinese tech companies pose a potential threat to national security.Link to ImageThe logo of the social media video sharing app Tiktok displayed on a tablet.

We declared ZTE a danger to American national security,” Pompeo said, citing telecommunications companies Huawei and ZTE. Lawmakers cite China's national security laws as one reason to be suspicious of the app.China's National Intelligence Law gives the government the authority to compel Chinese companies to collect and provide any information the government requests, including data on foreign users, Quartz reported in 2017, when the law was passed. (RELATED: Trump Admin Is Seriously Considering Banning TikTok And Other Chinese Apps, Pompeo Says)Biden warned in mid-July that China and Russia are interfering in U.S. elections. “We know from before and I guarantee you I know now because now I get briefings again,” the presumptive Democratic nominee said during a July 17 fundraiser. “The Russians are still engaged in trying to delegitimize our electoral process. Fact.”He added: “China and others are engaged as well in activities that are designed for us to lose confidence in the outcome.”Chinese and Iranian hackers targeted staff working for Trump's reelection campaign, as well as those working on behalf of the Biden campaign, according to Shane Huntley, the head of Google's counterespionage “Threat Analysis Group. He said in June that hacking groups sponsored by their state or nation-states targeted both campaigns, The Wall Street Journal reported in June.TikTok has not responded to the Daily Caller News Foundation's request for comment on Biden's decision, but the app often dismisses claims that it is subject to China.“TikTok collects much less U.S. user information than many of the companies in our space and stores it in the U.S. and Singapore. We have not, and would not, give it to the Chinese government,” spokeswoman Ashley Nash-Hahn told the DCNF July 21.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Former Officer Garrett Rolfe is facing 11 counts, including felony murder. If convicted, he could face life in prison or even the death penalty. Officer Devin Brosnan, who was first on the scene, was placed on administrative duty and charged with aggravated assault. The officers have until 6:00 p.m. tonight to turn themselves in. Attorneys for both men say they are not guilty. And newly released body camera video shows that the moments Officer Rolfe attempted to perform CPR on Brooks.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Brooks, keep breathing. Mr. Brook, keep breathing for me.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, the Atlanta police department addressing rumors officers are walking off the job in response to the charges. The department tweeted that that is inaccurate. However, there have been more call-outs than usual.Protesters in Seattle block a highway overnight. President Trump blasting Washington state leaders for allowing occupiers to create the autonomous zone or, chop (ph).(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The governor of the state of Washington is weak, and the mayor is weak, and what they're doing is setting a precedent that's never been set before. It should never been allowed to fester like it's festering right now. It's disgraceful. To our country, it's a disgrace.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Several shop owners say they feel like sitting ducks. Their concerns going unnoticed by a chop (ph) organizer.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Every single day that I show up here, I'm not here to peacefully protest, I'm here to disrupt until my demands are met.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: New video now surfacing of a Fox affiliate reporter being attacked after a police precinct was abandoned earlier this month.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sorry, can you guys not touch me, please?(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The reporter says the hostility was like nothing she had ever experienced.And then in -- elsewhere, several states, including Texas, Arizona and Florida are setting new records for Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations. Governors there say they are not considering another shutdown because the states are better prepared to deal with this uptick. But it is a different story in Michigan. Governor Gretchen Whitmer is extending her state of emergency order through July. It was supposed to end tomorrow. The state reported 204 new cases yesterday.Well, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is calling for full transparency and information sharing with China during the Covid-19 pandemic during meetings with his Chinese counterpart. The meeting in Hawaii this week comes amid heightened tensions between the two nations. President Trump has blamed China for the coronavirus pandemic and has threatened to revoke Hong Kong's special trading status to punish China for curbing political freedoms in Hong Kong.Cinemark getting back to business, saying all of its U.S. movie theaters will reopen by mid-July. Five cinemas will open tomorrow in Dallas, with the remaining theaters expected to return between July 3rd and July 17th. Cinemark, the third largest U.S. movie chain, will reopen with enhanced cleaning of high-touch areas and staggered seating. Employees will wear masks and gloves. Masks will be strongly encouraged for guests. Cinemark's stock is down 56 percent so far this year. It sits at $14.71 a share.Well, reforming police is topic A. Senate Republicans rolling out their police reform bill on Capitol Hill yesterday. The legislation includes new training programs and an expanded use of body cameras.South Carolina Senator Tim Scott spearheaded the effort.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC): If you support America, you support restoring the confidence that communities of color have in institutions of authority.We hear you. We're listening to your concerns.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The GOP legislation narrower in scope than what House Democrats have proposed, set up a political clash. All of this as the fired Atlanta police officer who shot Rayshard Brooks has been charged with felony murder.Joining me right now is former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.And, Rudy, it's always a pleasure to see you.RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: Always a pleasure to see you too.BARTIROMO: Tough days these days, that's for sure.First, let's talk about what took place, Rayshard -- with Rayshard's death and, obviously, the Atlanta Police Department denying reports of a police walk-out.I want to ask -- get your take, first, on what took place with this felony murder charge.GIULIANI: Well, it's an outrageous charge. I can't figure out what the felony is that the police officer was committing and therefore he committed murder in the commission of the felony. The police officer was trying to execute a quite lawful arrest and it was quite calm until Mr. Rayshard Brooks became violent. You can see that. Police officers did nothing to him. He went into a rage. And then he started hitting him.I count five crimes that he committed. He punched a police officer. He resisted arrest. He stole the police officer's Taser. He hit a police officer with a right-hand punch. And then he shot at the police officer with the Taser, which would seem to me would completely justify the police officer taking out his gun and shooting him because if that Taser had hit the police officer, the police officer would have been incapacitated. This man was so violent, you could predict that he would take the gun and try to kill you.Now, remember, what has been denied the American people is the truth about this. None of the liberal newspapers print Mr. Rayshard Brooks' record. This man was a violent criminal. Had quite a long history of being a violent criminal, including assaulting children, assaulting women, being engaged in major crimes. The man had a -- had a violent temper. If this man had just submitted to arrest, none of this would happen. It's not the police officer's fault, it's his fault. He was arrested for -- he was arrested --BARTIROMO: You know, and that's -- and that's the issue. And, Rudy, yes, you can see this all on the video. It's very clear that Rayshard Brooks takes the --GIULIANI: Of course you can see it all on the video. It's an outrage.BARTIROMO: Takes the Taser, shoots the -- shoot -- tries to shoot the cop with the Taser and -- and the whole while the police officer is saying, don't resist arrest, don't resist arrest, calm down, stay there, don't resist arrest. But he does resist. He steals his Taser. And he shoots the Taser. And now the officer is -- could see the death penalty or life in prison.GIULIANI: Yes.BARTIROMO: The problem is, this is happening at such a sensitive time in our -- in our lives when there was the wrongful death of George Floyd. And there is a tone in the country that --GIULIANI: What does this have to do with this?BARTIROMO: OK. I know that. I know that -- you're right, because I'm looking at the video and it's clear what has taken place here. So how does this play out? He's being charged with felony murder.GIULIANI: Well, if they really mean no justice, no peace, if you're going to try this man for felony murder, when he didn't do it because there's a tone in the country, are we really a democracy or are we some kind of a mob-ruled society that only has emotions and no logic or fairness?BARTIROMO: Yes.GIULIANI: I mean this is a turning point for America.I looked at the earlier killing and I'm capable enough of looking at that and saying, the police officer was totally wrong and should be tried for murder one.BARTIROMO: Yes.GIULIANI: But I'm also capable enough and fair enough to look at this and say, this was completely caused by the perpetrator. And, by the way, this is consistent with his conduct over his 27 years.BARTIROMO: There's -- this is also -- yes.GIULIANI: This is no angel.BARTIROMO: Yes, I -- I understand.GIULIANI: If they want to put out the record of the police officer, this is multiple -- of a multiple, violent criminal.BARTIROMO: He -- he also goes on -- he also -- he goes on and then tries to give him CPR as well, by the way. Yes.GIULIANI: This is an outrage.BARTIROMO: But, you know, this is also a turning point for the police, right, Rudy? I mean the -- the -- I understand. The Atlanta Police Department is denying reports of a police walk-out to protest officers being charged in the shooting of Rayshard Brooks.Mayor, your reaction to the fact that the police do not feel any support because of all of this. They're walking out. They're resigning. And then you've got havoc going on in places like Seattle and Atlanta.GIULIANI: Well, I mean, how -- how can you blame the police officers? The - - a police officer can do exactly what he's supposed to do and he can be charged with murder in the first degree. I mean what kind of world is that? And, remember, the district attorney in this case is under investigation for a major fraud and he's in a very close election.That hints of Duke, by the way. Remember the Duke case? That turned out to be a total fraud by a DA who wanted to get re-elected.BARTIROMO: Yes.GIULIANI: So I don't know if we learned from history. The -- the -- if you want to talk about the reforms that Senator Scott has suggested, they're all excellent.BARTIROMO: Yes.GIULIANI: They're all things I did in the New York City Police Department. We had a tracking for a police officer's conduct. We looked at it carefully.BARTIROMO: Yes.GIULIANI: We tried to get rid of them early. I fired police officers that I thought might be a problem. They hadn't even been a problem, but we thought they might be a problem.BARTIROMO: I mean -- well, when does the -- when does the federal government --GIULIANI: We tried to anticipate. You can't always do that, but we tried.BARTIROMO: When does the federal government, the AG, get involved in some of these situations like, you know, chop (ph), and CHAZ? I mean where -- where you've got protesters taking over parts of the city? Does the attorney general get involved? I mean is this so, you know, separate, state versus federal, that there's nothing to do with protesters taking over a portion of the city?GIULIANI: Well, I would say, you know, look, the president has to be careful because of state's rights and because states have a great deal of discretion in dealing with property law and things like that. But you do have deprivation of property without due process of law. That's a violation of the United States Constitution.BARTIROMO: Yes.GIULIANI: We have people that are being beaten up there. Don't fall for the fact that this is peaceful. It is not peaceful. It's a -- it's a -- it's a very, very unruly situation. A situation in which businesses are being crushed there.BARTIROMO: Yes.GIULIANI: And the attorney general may have a role in this shooting also in Georgia because it looks to me like these police officers may be the subject of a false arrest.BARTIROMO: OK.GIULIANI: You don't get arrested for doing your job.BARTIROMO: All right, real quick, Rudy, your -- your comments on national - - on former National Security Advisor John Bolton's new book. You're in it. He pointed to some serious accusations at President Trump. Your reaction?GIULIANI: He's a total -- he's a total back-stabber. I've known him for 10 years. He says all kinds of things about me in that book. He never was man enough to ever come up to me and raise that with me when we were in the administration, when I was representing the president. If he had a problem with my representation of the president or a legal problem that the president had, as the president's lawyer and as his friend for 10 years, you think he'd have been man enough to come and tell me? Well, he wrote that in order to sell books.BARTIROMO: Well, what are you going to do about it? Does the president want to sue him? Does the president want to sue him personally?GIULIANI: It's up to the -- if the president would like to sue him, I -- I could prove that what he -- he -- that he never discussed what he says about the Ukrainian thing about me. And I don't know, I mean he -- he calls me a hand grenade. I kind of feel -- I kind of feel really, really complimented by that because he's a hydrogen bomb. I mean this -- the statements this guy has made over 10 years and he's calling me a hand grenade? I mean the -- he -- most presidents were too afraid to have him in the cabinet because they were afraid he'd take us to war, you know, over Central Park or something.BARTIROMO: All right. Rudy, thank you so much for weighing in all of that.GIULIANI: Bad guy. No character.BARTIROMO: Good to -- good to see you, sir. Thank you so much. Mayor Rudy Giuliani.We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: The threat from Huawei. Former CEO of Google, Eric Schmidt, speaking out on the Chinese telecom giant, saying that the company is engaging in unacceptable practices. I spoke with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross yesterday on the program about Huawei, being able to work with American companies to set 5G standards. This is a change this week from the Commerce Department.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Will this move normalize and elevate a company that has ties to the Chinese government? We know that this is a state-run company and there are back doors and the data goes back to the Chinese communist party. Why the change?WILBUR ROSS, COMMERCE SECRETARY: Well, the change is really simply a clarification. It isn't that we're doing something to help Huawei.The idea of this is to make sure that standards are symmetrical, that they're worldwide, and that with 5G they facilitate the interconnectedness of everything. Every person, every thing, every factory, every process. That's the whole idea of 5G.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Ross went on to say that the spying threat from Huawei is a real issue.And, Steve Forbes, I want to get your take on what we heard from Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google. And he says there's no -- this is a quote to the BBC. There's no question that Huawei has engaged in some practices that are not acceptable in national security. Mr. Schmidt told a BBC Radio Four documentary. He's saying it poses national security risks and it is unacceptable.This is an issue I've spoken with the security officer at Huawei, Andy Purdy, many times, Steve, and they -- and he continually said no, no, no, no, there's no back doors. Now you even have the former CEO of Google saying, of course there's back doors and all the data at Huawei goes right back to the CCP, the Chinese Communist Party.FORBES: I'm shocked. I'm actually really shocked. Not. This has been known from the beginning. Those denials when he came on your show, we all knew he was speaking not -- he was not speaking the truth. And to have Eric Schmidt, though, come out gives credence to the administration's campaign to try to get ourselves and other of countries to keep this company out of sensitive areas concerning national security. So it's a vindication of facts that we already knew.BARTIROMO: Yes. Exactly. And it's just compelling to hear Eric Schmidt say it as well, but certainly we did -- were aware.We will take a break. We've got a -- yes, go ahead, Steve.FORBES: And that's important because he's on the left side. That's very important.BARTIROMO: That's exactly right.All right, we will be right back. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Markets this morning are mixed. Take a look at futures indicating a lower opening for the broader averages. We have seen a sharp pullback here. The Dow Industrials are now down 150 points, the Nasdaq down 23, and the S&P futures down 16.Some states seeing spikes in coronavirus cases. We told you earlier, the Bank of England decision came out keeping interest rates where they are. Investors are also waiting on today's initial jobless claims report. That will be out in about an hour. We will see the latest unemployment benefits for the last week. The Dow and the S&P yesterday snapped a three-day winning streak with a decline of 170 points at 4:00 on Wall Street.Joining me right now is Merrill Lynch Wealth Management President Andy Sieg.And, Andy, it is great to have you this morning. Thank you so much for joining me.ANDY SIEG, PRESIDENT, MERRILL LYNCH WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Thank you.BARTIROMO: You know, it's amazing to look at these markets trading where we are. Even though we're seeing declines today and yesterday, we're still seeing these markets near record highs. You've got real relationships with your clients. Tell us how clients are doing throughout the pandemic and are they still buying stocks and wanting to look at equities even as we're seeing the coronavirus spikes?SIEG: Well, Maria, I think it's a -- I think it's overall a pretty encouraging picture. I think that investors by and large are realizing we've just experienced something akin to an economic blackout essentially and there's a -- there's a bounce coming off that bottom. When they look at where we are today, there's an enormous amount of fiscal and monetary stimulus of course in the system. They also, though, see companies getting back on track. The entrepreneurial spirit of the American economy, the ingenuity of businesses across sectors is showing itself and I think markets are seeing that and reacting to it.Now, last thing I'll say, we don't see our clients today operating in a way that is particularly bullish. Our cash levels remain very high. So when you -- when you actually add that to the equation, if you're a contrarian, which I am, I think that speaks to the fact that we're not in the late stages of the rally. We're actually -- I think we're actually putting a base in here for what is going to be a pretty encouraging run for stocks.BARTIROMO: Wow.And what will drive that? You're overseeing more than $2 trillion in assets at Merrill Lynch and you're given advice to clients in terms of longer term. I know you're not looking for the knee-jerk reaction. How do you allocate capital if you are, in fact, looking at this long-term bull market in place?SIEG: Well, of course, you've got it exactly right, we need to build portfolios that are consistent with our clients' plans. And generally those plans are medium and long-term in nature. So we watch the markets every day, but you don't readjust portfolios every day. You adjust portfolios, you know, based on five, 10, 20-year time horizons.When we look out through the medium term, there's some very exciting things that are happening in the U.S. economy. You know, think about this topic of on-shoring. During this economic blackout, we've learned a lot about the risks of having global supply chains and over a medium term basis we expect to see companies across a wide range of sectors bringing jobs and factories back into the U.S. And that capital investment in the U.S. is going to be very powerful for us.Our economists think that one manufacturing job essentially has a multiplier effect in terms of creating seven additional jobs in the U.S. At the same time as that manufacturing moves back, we expect to see R&D spending kicking up. A dollar of R&D investment equals about $9 of GDP. So these are powerful forces. And, again, you know, finally, we're resting here on a bedrock foundation of the dynamism and strength of the U.S. economy. When you look at our innovation, our flexibility, our talent, the way our capital markets operate, there is no economy in the world like the U.S.BARTIROMO: Yes. And there's no liquidity like the U.S., the deepest, most liquid markets in the world. You're at Bank of America spending $3 billion a year on new initiatives. I know technology is also being used increasingly for clients' portfolios. So tell us what you use in terms of technology and also what kind of moves are made in the average portfolio during this pandemic? When you look at the first and second quarter, have investors wanted to stay put? Have they used technology to change anything? Tell us what they're doing as they're staying at home.SIEG: Well, I mean, first of all, with regard to our technology spend, this is a place where the Merrill Lynch business has benefited enormously from being part of Bank of America. And being able to take advantage of this enormous technology spend at Bank of America, it put us in position as the pandemic broke to be able to move over 20,000 employees at Merrill Lynch to work from home mode and not miss a beat in terms of serving clients. The connectivity was there, the trading capabilities were there. And, you know, today, based on what we've been able to do, our client satisfaction right now is at all-time record levels for us, which I think it speaks volumes.In terms of those conversations with clients, they resulted in frankly what we hoped, which was, first and foremost, preventing panicked selling during those very difficult, ferocious even weeks in March. The reassurance that came from advisors reaching out to clients caused people to hold on at times that their emotions were telling them to sell and head for the hills. And because they did that, our clients have been able to see the recovery in the market impact their portfolios by and large. And so we're very, very proud of that.You know, again, as I said earlier, we still see cash levels very high, so, you know, clients remain relatively conservative in their positions and, again, we think this is a bullish sign in terms of where the markets go from here.BARTIROMO: Is there anything that you worry about that with everybody having such high exposure to stocks as well as cash? I mean do they have enough wiggle room if they're thrown a curve ball?SIEG: Well, I mean, this is -- this is, again, the strength of the financial advisor model is the fact that when this pandemic broke, our clients had been in discussions, in most cases for years, with advisors about their objectives, they built diversified long-term portfolios and part of those conversations was ensuring that the right liquidity was in place so that you didn't find yourself up against the wall having to sell into a crisis. So I do think the -- I think the flexibility is there.The trades that we're seeing right now are not generally shifts in asset class positioning. They're more likely to be shifts between individual security exposure versus ETFs. In the last couple of weeks, we've actually seen, as the markets have rallied, we've seen our clients stay exposed to equities but sell some individual stocks and move into some ETFs that were a more broad-based exposure to indices, and those have been good trades.BARTIROMO: Sure. They want -- they want the diversity of it.Andy, it's great to have you this morning. Come back soon. Thank you, sir.SIEG: Maria, thank you.BARTIROMO: Good to see you.Andy Sieg from Merrill Lynch Bank of America.We'll take a break.When we come back, we've got the CEO of Kroger here. Kroger earnings just hitting the tape. It beat on the top and the bottom lines. We will get exclusive reaction from Kroger's chairman and CEO. Rodney McMullen is here top of the hour. Don't miss that.Then, lacking a green thumb? We've got you covered. The tips and tricks you need to know to how to make your garden flourish. You will not believe what you've been doing wrong.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Hopes are rising for a 2020 baseball season.Cheryl Casone with details now.Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, well, we'll see. Baseball fans are cautiously optimistic, Maria. Major League Baseball and the Players Union have agreed on a framework to salvage the season which was suspended well before it began by the Covid-19 pandemic. Well, according to league details of a meeting between MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred and Tony Clark, who's head of the Players Union, there would be a 60 game season and players would receive 100 percent of their prorated salaries, which has been a major sticking point. The league had offered 70 percent prorated salaries. And now ESPN is reporting the players think 60 games is too short. Games could start as early as July 19th. We shall see.Well, the pilot of the helicopter carrying Kobe Bryant and his daughter and six others may have become disoriented in fog. A preliminary report released by the National Transportation Safety Board says Ara Zobayan radioed air traffic control he was climbing to 4,000 feet when he was actually plunging toward a hillside where the chopper eventually crashed. They also believe the pilot may have disregarded the severity of weather conditions that day. Everyone on-board was killed when that chopper slammed into a hillside in January. Bryant's widow has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the company that owns the helicopter.And here is a look at what's trending this morning on foxbusiness.com.President Trump says he absolutely supports Colin Kaepernick's return to the NFL, as long as he has the on-field ability to justify an offer. According to the LA Chargers head coach, Kaepernick is on the summer workout list.Mitsubishi says its top executives are taking pay cuts of about 45 percent to offset the financial losses amid the coronavirus pandemic.And Ford says it's offering its salaried employees in the U.S. the option to work from home until at least the end of the year.And those are all your headlines from the newsroom, Maria.Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you.Changing police protocol. Senate Republicans are rolling out their police reform bill on Capitol Hill. The legislation spearheaded by South Carolina Senator Tim Scott includes new training program and a wider use of body cameras. This as House Democrats are teeing up their reform package for a floor vote.On the Senate floor yesterday, Scott pushed back after Illinois Senator Dick Durbin called the bill a token approach.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL): We cannot waste this historic moment.Let's not do something that is a token, half-hearted approach.SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC): And to have the senator from Illinois refer to this process, this bill, this opportunity to restore hope and confidence and trust from the American people, from African-Americans, from communities of color, to call this a token process hurts my soul.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Delaware Senator, Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship and Judiciary Committee member, Chris Coons.Senator, it's good to have you this morning.SEN. CHRIS COONS (R-DE): Good morning, Maria.BARTIROMO: What do you think of Tim Scott's plan?COONS: Well, I have respect for Senator Scott. We know each other well from the Senate weekly prayer breakfast. And I'm looking over the details of his bill, which was just introduced yesterday. It's an important start, but I am concerned that it doesn't do enough to meet this moment.In the three weeks since George Floyd was murdered in Minneapolis, we've seen literally millions of Americans of all backgrounds in towns and cities large and small across our country take to the streets, mostly peacefully, asking for change. So I'm hopeful that we can come to an agreement between Republicans and Democrats on a list of amendments that we would debate on the floor that would significantly strengthen this bill.BARTIROMO: What do you think is most important in terms of the amendment? Tell me what doesn't go far enough in Senator Scott's bill.COONS: Well, there's just too general buckets, if I could. One is in -- instead of encouraging, requiring a ban on chokeholds, for example, a ban on no-knock warrants. And then, more broadly, accountability. Making it easier for federal prosecutors to investigate and prosecute exceptionally sort of way out of the usual civil rights violations by law enforcement officers. There is a federal civil rights statute that right now is used about 20 times a year in police investigations. That's because the legal standard is very, very high. I do think it is possible for us to come to an agreement and, frankly, given the way the whole world is looking at us and at our country, we should find a way to meet this moment with bold reforms to policing.BARTIROMO: Senator, how worried are you that this is going to have also too much of a -- you know, going too far in one direction. You're seeing havoc across the country. You look in Seattle, where protesters have taken over the streets. You look at the issue in Atlanta. And, you know, when you look at that video of Rayshard Brooks and how he did not -- you know, he resisted the police and then -- and then took the Taser gun and then used the Taser gun on the officer, forcing the officer to shoot. Now, the officer is getting charged with murder. He could actually get the death penalty. What's your reaction to this?COONS: Maria, we had a great hearing on the Senate Judiciary Committee just this week. It went for seven hours. And we heard from a dozen witnesses, from law enforcement organizations, chiefs organizations, civil rights advocates, attorneys who represent families like that of Ahmaud Arbery, and there was, I think, very good testimony and a good conversation.Out of that should come this sort of balance that shows that our democracy is working. Around the world there's a contest right now as folks look at this global pandemic, at the global recession and at our challenges with a long history of racism and inequality in our country. If we can find a way to come together and to legislate a bold response that meets this moment, I think it doesn't just strengthen us here at home, I think its strengthens us around the world.BARTIROMO: Yes, I agree with you, but we're not seeing that. We're seeing police officers not feeling the support so they're resigning. You're seeing people want to defund the police. Do you also want to defund the police right now?COONS: Well, as you've heard from a number of Democratic leaders from Congressman Jim Clyburn to the former vice president, Joe Biden, defund the police, if that's understood as eliminating police departments, is not something I support or they support. If what it means is we're asking the police to handle homelessness, mental health issues, substance abuse issues, and we should be providing more funding to respond to those, that, frankly, we're putting too many social problems on the backs of police and should instead be better funding an appropriate response from mental health professionals or housing counselors, frankly, the law enforcement officers I've met with and heard from in Delaware, as well as activists and community activists, all agree that that would be a positive direction.BARTIROMO: Yes, I'm just trying to understand if you believe that it's going too far, particularly after Rayshard Brooks?COONS: I think the fact that Rayshard Brooks was shot and killed while running away from law enforcement indicates there wasn't an appropriate use of deadly force in that case. But that's for the local courts and law enforcement leaders to resolve.BARTIROMO: Right. Understood.COONS: Frankly, we are in the middle of three different crises, one of them is a recession. And what I'm hearing in Delaware from restaurant owners, hotel owners, and lots of others is the their Paycheck Protection Program loans, which, on a bipartisan basis, we got out through the SBA more than 500 billion of them --BARTIROMO: Yes.COONS: They're about to run out. We need to find a way to extend them and focus them on the smallest businesses.BARTIROMO: And you have a new bill, the Prioritized Paycheck Protection Program Act that would authorize new lending for small businesses with less than 100 employees. You're also part of a bipartisan effort to expand national service programs, like AmeriCorps (ph) to help combat Covid-19.Senator, this is a very important piece of legislation, particularly given the fact that some of the SBA emergency loan program left behind many of America's neediest companies.COONS: That's right.BARTIROMO: This is the story in "The Journal" this morning. Tell me more about these efforts and are you going to be able to hit those small mom and pop businesses that cannot make it out of this, that aren't even big enough to have banks. They don't have regular banking relationships.COONS: That's right, Maria. One of the ways in which I've been working to respond to calls I get every day from constituents is to authorize a second round of PPP loans to grants. I'm introducing a bill today with several of my colleagues, Senators Cardin and Shaheen. We're working to get a Republican co-sponsor. And I'm optimistic about that.There is still $140 billion in the PPP program not yet spent. This would prioritize it. It would carve out 25 billion for those with fewer than 10 employees who have lost half of their revenue or more and give them a quick process for applying and getting a second PPP loan to grant and the rest of it would be dedicated to those with fewer than 100, recognizing that the first round, which got out $500 billion successfully and put a floor under our economy, it hasn't reached those very smallest businesses. I do think this can be bipartisan.BARTIROMO: I agree with you. Yes.COONS: The National Service Bill, I am grateful for Senator Wicker, Senator Cornyn, Senator Rubio and others. We are working together to dramatically expand national service so that hundreds of thousands of young Americans can have the chance to go to work with local non-profits, helping our communities and country.BARTIROMO: Do you -- do you have a must ask question for the head of the SBA? She's going to be joining me in about an hour, given your legislation?COONS: The piece of the SBA program in the CARES Act that worked the least well was the EIDL grants. What are they doing to speed up the process and get those out to businesses?BARTIROMO: All right, Senator, thanks very much for joining us. Good to see you, sir.Chris Coons.COONS: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Get growing. Garden season is in full swing. Many just waiting for those vegetables to ripen now. Our next guest has tips to make sure you get the most out of your plants and avoid common mistakes that even the greenest thumbs make.Joining us right now is contractor Skip Adele.Skip, great to have you this morning.We have been looking forward to this segment.SKIP BEDELL, CONTRACTOR: Hi, Maria.BARTIROMO: So, your first tip, start small. What does that mean? What does that mean?BEDELL: Yes. So many people -- yes, so starting small is a great way to do it because you have to make sure you even like gardening first, right. So rather than digging up a whole side of your yard, I always say start small in a controlled space.So, this is something we use here in our home. This is the veggie pod. It's a raised garden bed, which is fantastic because you can control where you plant your seeds and your plants and you also have a hood on top of this that folds up, it keeps all the insects and all the bugs and all the pests out of it, but allows the sun and the water in.And speaking of water, look inside this. Maria, I'm going to turn the water on here. It has a self-misting system inside of it. So what this does, it actually makes it to where it's fool proof. You can have the perfect garden inside this. And, in fact, it's even portable. These things come on wheels so you can move it around and put it where you want it.So if you're going to garden, before you dig up the whole yard, I'd say get something like this, like a veggie pod, that allows you to really control your space.Also, this has a self-watering tray. And this is phenomenal. This allows the water to stay down in the bottom so the roots are always going to have water. Even if you forget to water, the roots are always going to get watered. So you really can't go wrong when you start out small with something like this, like a veggie pod.BARTIROMO: I love this veggie pod. This is such a great idea.BEDELL: Yes.BARTIROMO: OK, how important is the right soil?BEDELL: So the soil is everything. You could have all the other right ingredients, but what people forget all the time is to treat their soil. They get plant food and fertilizers. But you have to make sure you have good soil because that's the medium that the plant lives in. So this is a product that we use here at home. This stuff is amazing. This is Love Your Soil. It's a natural soil food, not a plant food. So what this does with a concentrated gypsum, this actually loosens up your hard soil. So all the soil in your planting beds and around the house many times will be hard and compacted and it doesn't allow the water and the air to get down to the roots. So this works really great for your lawn, your gardens, your planter boxes, even your vegetable gardens, everything. But the main thing this does is it conditions your soil and it loosens it so it allows the air and the water to get down deep to the roots. So even if you're using like bagged soil and stuff, many times it gets compacted. So this will loosen it up and make sure that you can get water and air to your roots down deep.BARTIROMO: What's the easiest plant to grow and thrive?BEDELL: So the easiest plant to grow and thrive, I love these Arbrevita, these shrubs I'm showing you right here. These are fantastic because they grow tall.BARTIROMO: OK.BEDELL: They start off real small and you can get a huge plant out of it.BARTIROMO: Yes. I like it.Skip Bedell, good to see you, sir. Thank you so much. Great tips. We love having you. Come back soon.BEDELL: Hey, thanks. Thanks, Maria. Have a good day.BARTIROMO: More MORNINGS WITH MARIA right after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Now your "Morning Buzz."First up, double decker airplane seats. Zephyr Aerospace designing seats that allow passengers to sit on top of one another but also offering more privacy and space, a major concern amid Covid-19.Steve Forbes, what do you think, is this the -- is this the wave of the future.FORBES: It's the wave of the future. It starts with allowing you to drink again on an airplane. As you know, airlines are trying to restrict drinking. This will liberate us from that, let you drink.But also it's the biggest advance since we had passenger planes. We're not going to be treated like cattle again. This is unbelievable. Finally, somebody's making a breakthrough in how you configure an airplane. This guy deserves a Nobel Prize just for that alone. It's amazing. Space on an airplane.BARTIROMO: Yes, we're going to see a lot of changes -- changes are going to be coming out of this.FORBES: An economy class.BARTIROMO: Right.FORBES: It's great.BARTIROMO: All right.Next up, Americans are watching less. According to Nielsen, U.S. streaming consumption has declined 25 percent from April's peak of nearly 76 minutes a day. People stuck at home are still watching about 50 percent more than a year ago.Mark, are you still glued to that screen at home or no?TEPPER: No, it's summertime. Get outside. Let's go, people.BARTIROMO: Good point.TEPPER: You know, look, I think we're all running out of things to watch. And TV in particular has been awful for years. You can have hundreds of channels but there's nothing ever on.Look, there's a lot of pent-up demand. People want to be outside. They want to have an opportunity to socialize. And, personally, I hadn't golfed in the last three years because I didn't have the time. I've now gone golfing with my son five times in the last two weeks just to get outside and have some fun. Even got my wife and daughters involved this week, which was awesome.BARTIROMO: Awesome.TEPPER: So, you know, come on, people, it's mid-June. Get outside. Have some fun. Get off your devices.BARTIROMO: All right.How about this, retreat for teachers. The Netflix CEO reportedly spending $20 million to build a luxury teacher training center in Colorado. It has a spa, hot springs, wine cellar, yoga deck.Dagen, does this have you thinking about changing professions?MCDOWELL: No, but I certainly value the teachers that I had in high school in particular.One other thing I'll note that Reed Hastings and his wife are giving, $120 million to historically black colleges and universities. But I pointed out on Twitter yesterday, that of the U.S. workforce at Twitter, just 7 percent is black Americans, in technology jobs it's 4 percent. So maybe Netflix should try and hire some of those graduates.BARTIROMO: Walk the walk.Still ahead, I'll get exclusive reaction from Kroger's chairman and CEO, Rodney McMullen. They reported earnings this morning, a strong beat, next hour.MORNINGS WITH MARIA right here. Stay with us.Load-Date: June 18, 2020End of Document

The Latest: S. Korea expert alarmed over speed of infectionsAssociated Press Financial WireJune 12, 2020 Friday 8:25 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWS; POLITICAL NEWSLength: 1948 wordsByline: The Associated PressBodySEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea’s top infectious disease expert has raised alarm over the speed of coronavirus transmissions in the densely populated capital area, where around 30 to 50 new infections have been reported each day since late May.Jung Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, says the average infectiousness of virus carriers in the Seoul metropolitan area was about three times higher than in the rest of the country.She said the basic reproduction number of virus carriers — which measures the number of infections caused by an individual — in the capital area reached as high as 1.7 or 1.8 in recent weeks. Any number above 1 indicates a growing epidemic.She pleaded with Seoul residents to stay home over the weekend, saying there was “high concern” that increased public activity would lead to a massive circulation of the virus.Health workers have struggled to trace hundreds of infections linked to e-commerce workers, church gatherings, elderly door-to-door sellers and clubgoers.___HERE’S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW TODAY ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK:— Indian capital’s crematoriums overwhelmed with virus dead— Researchers ask if survivor plasma could prevent coronavirus— Downplaying virus risk, Trump gets back to business as usual— The European Union urged all its member countries to start lifting travel restrictions on their common borders from next week, saying that the closures they introduced to tackle the coronavirus do little to limit its spread.— Among the numerous rural areas across the U.S. that have recently experienced coronavirus outbreaks are migrant farmworker communities in Florida. Immokalee is one of them. The poor town of 25,000 north of the Everglades has become a hot spot, with cases more than doubling in the past two weeks.— Surgeons in Chicago have given a new set of lungs to a young woman with severe lung damage from the coronavirus. Northwestern Medicine announced the procedure on Thursday. Only a few other COVID-19 survivors, in China and Europe, have received lung transplants___Follow AP pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and            https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak___HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING TODAY:LONDON — Three airlines have launched legal action against the British government, describing the country’s plan to quarantine most incoming travelers as “flawed.’’British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair say in a statement Friday that the quarantine will have a “devastating effect’’ on tourism and the wider economy. The airlines want the government to readopt its previous policy, where quarantine was limited to passengers from high risk countries.Quarantine measures imposed this week stipulate that all passengers — bar a handful of exceptions like truckers or medical workers — must fill in a form detailing where they will self-isolate for two weeks. The requirement applies regardless whether they are U.K. citizens or not, and those who fail to comply could be fined.The quarantine was imposed after a heated debate on whether it would help British efforts to tamp down the outbreak or simply stamp out any hopes that the tourism industry will recover following months of lockdown.___MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte has been promised by his Chinese counterpart that the Philippines “as a friendly neighbor” will be prioritized when China is able to develop a vaccine against COVID-19.Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said Friday that Duterte got the assurance from Chinese leader Xi Jinping in a late Thursday telephone call that lasted 38 minutes.Roque said Xi assured Duterte of “his country’s commitment to make the vaccine available for all, adding that the Philippines, as a friendly neighbor, would certainly be a priority.”___ISLAMABAD — Pakistan has reported 107 more COVID-19 deaths and 6,397 new cases, the highest single-day increase.It brought Pakistan’s tally to 2,463 deaths among 125,933 confirmed cases.The government said Friday that 40,247 patients have recovered.Experts say Pakistan may witness a further rise in COVID-19 cases. They say the disease has spread across the country since last month when Prime Minister Imran Khan eased lockdown, saying he was doing it to save the ailing economy and people from hunger and poverty.Pakistan’s economy will contract in the fiscal year ending June 30, for the first time in 68 years as a result of the global pandemic.___LONDON -- Official figures show that the British economy shrank by a colossal 20.4% in April, the first full month that the country was in its coronavirus lockdown.The Office for National Statistics said Friday that all areas of the economy were hit, in particular pubs, education, health and car sales.Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics, said April’s fall is “the biggest the U.K. has ever seen,” and “almost 10 times larger than the steepest pre-COVID-19 fall.”April’s decline follows a 5.8% contraction in March. In April, the economy was about a quarter smaller than it was in February.The U.K. was put into lockdown on March 23 and restrictions are slowly being eased. On Monday, nonessential shops, such as department stores and electronic retailers, are due to reopen.___CANBERRA, Australia — Australia’s prime minister expects international students will begin returning in July despite warnings of racism from China.Prime Minister Scott Morrison said after meeting federal state leaders on Friday that international students would be allowed to come to Australia under approved plans to study at nominated institutions.Morrison said he expected all state borders to reopen in July, with the possible exception of Western Australia.International students have been Australia’s most lucrative industry after mining, with China the largest source of foreign students.China this week warned its citizens of the risk of pandemic-related racism if they traveled to Australia. Last month, China banned beef imports from Australia and ended trade in Australian barley through massive tariffs in what is widely regarded as retaliation for Australia calling for an investigation into the pandemic.Foreign Minister Marise Payne on Friday accused China of “disinformation” through its racism warning. Morrison said he was not concerned that Chinese government warnings could deter Chinese students.___NEW DELHI— India’s coronavirus caseload has become the fourth-highest in the world, overtaking Britain, by adding 10,956 new cases in yet another biggest single-day spike.India’s two-month lockdown kept transmission low but in a large population of 1.3 billion, people remain susceptible and the campaign against the virus is likely to go on for months, Balram Bhargava, director-general of the Indian Council of Medical Research, said.India’s lockdown was imposed nationwide in late March but has eased since, and it is now largely being enforced in high-risk areas. The new cases rose after India reopened shops, shopping malls, manufacturing and religious places.Subways, schools and movie theaters remain closed.The increase reported Friday raised India’s confirmed cases to 297,535 with 8,498 deaths.___SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea is reporting 56 new cases of COVID-19 as the country continues to see a resurgence of the virus concentrated in the capital area.Figures released by South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday brought national totals to 12,003 cases and 277 deaths. It says 10,699 people have so far been released from hospitals after recovery, but 1,057 others remain in treatment.At least 45 of the new cases were reported from the Seoul metropolitan area, where about half of South Korea’s 51 million people live. Health officials have struggled to track transmissions linked to entertainment and leisure activities, church gatherings and low-income workers who couldn’t afford to stay home.___RENO, Nevada — Nevada health officials are closely monitoring a recent uptick in confirmed COVID-19 cases statewide, including the biggest one-day increase to date in the Reno area reported Thursday.But the state’s response director isn’t convinced a second wave of the coronavirus outbreak has arrived.Nevada COVID-19 Response Director Caleb Cage says the state has seen an above-average rise in daily positive cases this week and experienced six consecutive days of an increase in the number of cases requiring hospitalization. He says the most recent spike is the fourth highest since the pandemic was declared in mid-March in Nevada, which now has nearly 10,400 cases and 458 deaths.But Cage adds that “our assessment based on this data is that we are not seeing evidence of a second wave of COVID-19 in the state of Nevada yet.”___BEIJING — China has reported seven new coronavirus cases, including the first instance of local transmission in Beijing in weeks.Authorities said Friday that the other six cases were all brought into the country by Chinese citizens arriving from abroad. No new deaths were reported.Officials in Beijing say the locally transmitted case involves a 52-year-old man who arrived alone at a clinic displaying an intermittent fever but no other symptoms. He was swiftly diagnosed as having COVID-19, prompting authorities to isolate family members and reinstate anti-virus measures in his neighborhood.The man said he had not left Beijing Beijing for more than two weeks and had not been in contact with anyone from outside the city.___GRAHAM, N.C. — A North Carolina judge has ordered a small stock car track to halt racing after state health officials declared that large weekend crowds at recent races violated an executive order by Gov. Roy Cooper aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus.The judge agreed Thursday to issue a temporary restraining order preventing Ace Speedway in Alamance County from holding further events for now.Earlier this week, the state health secretary called the track an “imminent hazard,” ordered it closed and told the operators to announce the closure publicly. There was no evidence the owners did that, so officals asked the court to intervene.The governor’s restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus limit outdoor gatherings to 25 people.___SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Puerto Rico’s governor says she will lift nearly all restrictions aimed at curbing coronavirus cases, which means beaches, churches and businesses across the U.S. territory will reopen after a three-month shutdown.Gov. Wanda Vázquez said Thursday the changes will occur starting next week. She says businesses including gyms and movie theaters will be allowed to operate seven days a week.However, she says an overnight curfew will remain in place for two weeks, with people required to be inside from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.The governor also says that Puerto Rico will begin welcoming tourists again starting July 15 and that airport screenings will continue.___GENEVA — Geneva’s most famous landmark, the towering fountain known as the Jet d’Eau, has fired back up after an 83-day stoppage amid broad lockdown measures for the coronavirus outbreak.It was the longest such pause since the spray began operations in 1951. The head of the Geneva-based World Health Organization took part in a reopening ceremony Thursday that epitomized the recent easing of restrictive measures as case counts of COVID-19 have fallen dramatically in Switzerland.The Geneva utility that operates the Jet d’Eau said it was switched off March 20 “to embody the lockdown and the associated sanitary measures as well as to protect staff involved in its proper functioning.”The fountain shoots up a 140-meter (460-foot) plume of water onto Lake Geneva.Load-Date: June 12, 2020End of Document

He says the most recent spike is the fourth highest since the pandemic was declared in mid-March in Nevada, which now has nearly 10,400 cases and 458 deaths.But Cage adds that “our assessment based on this data is that we are not seeing evidence of a second wave of COVID-19 in the state of Nevada yet.”___BEIJING — China has reported seven new coronavirus cases, including the first instance of local transmission in Beijing in weeks.Authorities said Friday that the other six cases were all brought into the country by Chinese citizens arriving from abroad. No new deaths were reported.Officials in Beijing say the locally transmitted case involves a 52-year-old man who arrived alone at a clinic displaying an intermittent fever but no other symptoms. He was swiftly diagnosed as having COVID-19, prompting authorities to isolate family members and reinstate anti-virus measures in his neighborhood.The man said he had not left Beijing Beijing for more than two weeks and had not been in contact with anyone from outside the city.___GRAHAM, N.C. — A North Carolina judge has ordered a small stock car track to halt racing after state health officials declared that large weekend crowds at recent races violated an executive order by Gov. Roy Cooper aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus.The judge agreed Thursday to issue a temporary restraining order preventing Ace Speedway in Alamance County from holding further events for now.Earlier this week, the state health secretary called the track an “imminent hazard,” ordered it closed and told the operators to announce the closure publicly. There was no evidence the owners did that, so officals asked the court to intervene.The governor’s restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus limit outdoor gatherings to 25 people.___SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Puerto Rico’s governor says she will lift nearly all restrictions aimed at curbing coronavirus cases, which means beaches, churches and businesses across the U.S. territory will reopen after a three-month shutdown.Gov. Wanda Vázquez said Thursday the changes will occur starting next week. She says businesses including gyms and movie theaters will be allowed to operate seven days a week.However, she says an overnight curfew will remain in place for two weeks, with people required to be inside from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.The governor also says that Puerto Rico will begin welcoming tourists again starting July 15 and that airport screenings will continue.___GENEVA — Geneva’s most famous landmark, the towering fountain known as the Jet d’Eau, has fired back up after an 83-day stoppage amid broad lockdown measures for the coronavirus outbreak.It was the longest such pause since the spray began operations in 1951. The head of the Geneva-based World Health Organization took part in a reopening ceremony Thursday that epitomized the recent easing of restrictive measures as case counts of COVID-19 have fallen dramatically in Switzerland.The Geneva utility that operates the Jet d’Eau said it was switched off March 20 “to embody the lockdown and the associated sanitary measures as well as to protect staff involved in its proper functioning.”The fountain shoots up a 140-meter (460-foot) plume of water onto Lake Geneva.Load-Date: June 12, 2020End of Document

Johnson gives in to Trump and threatens to leave Huawei out of his 5GCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 6, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 587 wordsBodyPremier Boris Johnson is considering a "reverse" of Huawei's participation in the 5G network in the UK, in light of a recent report by the National Cybersecurity Centre (GCHQ), according to The Sunday Telegraph. Johnson gave the go-ahead to the chinese tech giant's concession to a portion of the 5G infrastructure (excluding "critical elements"), which earned him his first direct confrontation with President Donald Trump.The Premier will convene the National Security Council in the coming days before making a decision, which could lead to a ban on the installation of Huawei equipment within six months, according to the conservative newspaper near Downing Street. Johnson plans to present his strategy in Parliament before the end of the month, although he will possibly delay the debate on the new National Security and Investment Act until after the summer to avoid clashes with the party's hard wing.Relations with China, and more specifically the decision on Huawei and the 5G network, has become the new Brexit of the Tories. The Conservative Party is deeply divided against the issue and a group of 59 rebels, led by former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, threatens to even stand up to the premier in Parliament and force the total exclusion in 2023 of the Chinese giant on mobile phone infrastructure.Huawei has just celebrated its twenty-year anniversary of its presence in the UK with an advertising campaign, where it has 1,600 workers spread across 20 offices. The Chinese company has also been approved in June to build a large 50,000-meter-four research centre in Sawston, next to Cambridge, which would be a major qualitative leap in its implementation in the British Isles.Initially, the GCHQ gave the go-ahead to Huawei's participation in the 5G's core infrastructure, excluding its participation in the "critical elements". The new report estimates, however, that President Trump's veto on Huawei - banning the use of technology with American intellectual property - has had "a severe impact" on the company. Trump sees Huawei as "a risk to national security" because of its connections to the Chinese government. However, Boris Johnson decided to move forward with his plans to give Huawei a 35% turnout of the 5G network in the UK and opened his first Trump breach in the run-up to Brexit. Government sources now assure The Sunday Telegraph that the premier is willing to print "a fundamental turn" in his decision in light of the new GCHQ report.From his time as Mayor of London, Boris Johnson is regarded as one of the conservative party's most prominent synophiles (alongside David Cameron, who grabbed the red carpet and took a few pints with President Xi Jinping in 2015). The coronavirus pandemic and Hong Kong security law have nevertheless been brought in the london-Beijing relations, which are increasingly strained by Johnson's own decision to open the door to British citizenship to three million Hong Kongers. In the midst of a dialectical war, Johnson warned last week that he is willing to protect British infrastructure from "hostile state suppliers," in what is interpreted as a veiled warning to the Chinese government and Huawei.« It is important that we focus on the facts and not on speculation », declared aspokesmanfor the Chinese company to The Sunday Telegraph. "Huawei is the world's most stest-examined supplier, and we firmly believethat our unrivalled transparency in the UK means that we can continue to rely on the modernisation of the country's infrastructure."Load-Date: July 7, 2020End of Document

Trump's Proposed TikTok Ban May Threaten Free Speech: ExpertsNewsweek.comJuly 11, 2020 Saturday 4:45 AM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 771 wordsByline: Jacob JarvisHighlight: The Trump administration has suggested the app, owned by a Beijing-based company, poses security issues.BodyWhile both President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have said the administration was looking into whether or not to ban the short form video content app TikTok, suggesting risks to national security, such action could threaten first amendment rights, experts told Newsweek."A full ban would legally be hard for the US government to impose and is arguably unconstitutional. It would also be unprecedented," Sarah Cook, senior research analyst for China, Hong Kong and Taiwan at Freedom House, told Newsweek. "As a matter of principle, it would not be an appropriate balance between free speech and even legitimate security concerns."TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, was recently banned in India, further prompting speculation it could meet the same fate in the United States.As well as nations barring the app, Amazon previously sent out an email to employees instructing them to delete TikTok from devices which have access to company email.The message, sent July 10, cited security risks, though a spokesperson for the commerce giant later said the correspondence was sent in error. They stated there was no change to company policies surrounding the use of the platform.Despite speculation over TikTok being limited, rights surrounding free speech enshrined in the constitution may pose difficulties for such drastic action as a U.S.-wide ban.Stating that she believes any such ban would prompt immediate legal challenge, Cook said: "Overall, it would set a very problematic precedent for banning apps, a drop to the lowest common denominator of tactics the Chinese government uses that the US government has condemned, and a violation of the free speech and access to information rights of tens of millions of young Americans."Despite questioning the prospect of an outright ban, Cook does believe there are legitimate concerns over TikTok."The concern is that as companies like ByteDance and apps like TikTok gain more influence and control of key nodes in the information flow outside China, they are able to exercise a whole other level of influence and are likely to come under ever greater pressure from the Chinese party-state to use that influence in ways that favor the CCP's interests," she said.An option short of a full ban to somewhat diminish the threat could be to expand restrictions on certain people being able to use the app, for example curtailing the use by U.S. government personnel and "especially those with access to sensitive information."Kurt Opsahl, general counsel at Electronic Frontier Foundation, a non-profit digital rights group, similarly suggested barring the app's use could be an issue for free speech.Questioning the legal possibility of a ban, told Newsweek: "I suppose the Administration could lobby Congress to pass a new law against TikTok, but I will wait until there is a specific proposal before analyzing it. As courts have established, code is speech, so any law trying to ban software would raise First Amendment issues."Opsahl added that he believes a blanket barring of use of the app seems unlikely.Speculating as to what action could be taken towards TikTok, he said: "It could mean a lot of different things, like banning federal employees from using the app, preventing federal money from being spent on TikTok or trying to use Export Administration Regulations to restrict U.S. companies from doing business with TikTok without a government license."Amid criticism, a spokesperson for TikTok said it was a priority for the app to be "safe and secure.""TikTok is led by an American CEO, with hundreds of employees and key leaders across safety, security, product, and public policy here in the U.S. We have no higher priority than promoting a safe and secure app experience for our users. We have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked," they said, in a statement earlier this week.Newsweek has contacted the White House, the State Department and TikTok for comment.Amid the Trump admin's targeting of TikTok, some of its users have taken actions against the president's reelection campaign.Teen activists have encouraged fellow users to leave one star reviews for the Official Trump 2020 App. Thousands of negative reviews have been left.It is not the first time people using TikTok have pushed back against the president, having coordinated to put themselves forward for tickets at his Tulsa rally last month, only to not turn up.Newsweek has contacted the Trump campaign for comment.The graphic below, from Statista, looks at the nations where TikTok has been downloaded the most.Link to ImageGraphic tiktokOlivier Douliery/AFP via Getty ImagesThe logo for TikTok is displayed on the screen of an iPhone.

Why the Trump administration's win over Huawei could be bad news for TikTokCNN WireJuly 16, 2020 Thursday 8:44 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 995 wordsDateline: (CNN Business) Body (CNN Business) --  A week after saying his administration was "looking at" banning short-form video app TikTok in the United States, President Donald Trump claimed credit for personally thwarting the expansion plans of another Chinese-affiliated technology company: Huawei. "We convinced many countries, and I did this myself for the most part, not to use Huawei, because we think it's an unsafe security risk," Trump said at a White House press conference on Tuesday. Earlier in the day, the UK government said it was reversing a decision to allow Huawei to build parts of its new 5G mobile network. Under the announcement, any existing 5G gear from Huawei must be ripped out --- virtually eliminating the company from a major western market.The UK reversal is at least a symbolic victory for a White House that has at times struggled to persuade allies of the alleged security risks of using Chinese technology. And now, it may embolden Trump as he weighs whether to clamp down on TikTok, an app some policymakers allege is a national security threat, even as experts say there is little concrete evidence. (A Trump push to ban TikTok would have some precedent; earlier this month, India said it would ban the app, among others, after a bloody border clash involving Indian and Chinese forces.)Huawei and TikTok operate in very different lines of business --- one is a telecom company that deals with a complicated global supply chain and the other is a social app beloved by teens. But the telecom equipment maker's experience with the Trump administration hints at what may be in store for the social media app --- ranging from public criticism by government officials and greater regulatory scrutiny to legislation seeking to lock it out of the US market, where consumers have downloaded TikTok more than 165 million times. In a statement, TikTok's head of US public policy, Michael Beckerman, said there is a lot of "misinformation about TikTok right now." The company "stores US user data in Virginia, with backup in Singapore, and we work to minimize access across regions," he said. "We welcome conversations with lawmakers who want to understand our company,"TikTok has taken pains to distance itself from China by pointing to its recently hired American CEO and arguing that it stores US user data on US-based servers. It has also announced possible changes to its corporate structure that could further emphasize its independence from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. Huawei didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, but it has consistently denied that it poses a spying risk. The company has insisted that it would challenge any attempts by the Chinese government to acquire its customers' data. The US has taken numerous steps to freeze Huawei out of the American market. On Wednesday, the State Department said it was imposing visa restrictions on employees of some Chinese technology companies, including Huawei. Last year, the US government placed Huawei on a Commerce Department watchlist, making it impossible for US companies to do business with Huawei without a waiver. It has restricted federal agencies from using Huawei gear, and the Federal Communications Commission has forbidden US wireless carriers from buying Huawei products or services using agency-related funds. Separately, the US has sued Huawei over allegations of trade secret theft --- charges Huawei has called "unfounded and unfair."Compared to Huawei, TikTok may seem like a completely different operation. Most importantly, it does not have access to critical infrastructure networks that are core to national security, said James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. But TikTok does collect personal information on many Americans, data that lawmakers such as Sens. Chuck Schumer, Tom Cotton and Josh Hawley have said could undermine national security if it winds up in the possession of hostile foreign governments. With that in mind, policymakers like Hawley have proposed banning TikTok from US government devices. While the US government would be well within its rights to set federal workplace policies regarding TikTok, it's less clear how it could force states or the private sector to follow suit --- though it may not need to. At least one company, Wells Fargo, has already told employees not to have TikTok installed on company devices. To keep TikTok off of the app stores of US tech giants, Trump could seek to place TikTok on the same Commerce Department watchlist that it put Huawei on. However, Lewis has said the move could be legally murky because entities placed on the list are usually said to have violated laws or rules around trade, arms control or intellectual property theft. There is little evidence linking TikTok to that type of conduct.It isn't entirely clear what the Trump administration may seek to do to TikTok yet, but there is clearly bipartisan hostility toward TikTok. That's prompted TikTok to quickly expand its presence in Washington. Beckerman said the company is growing its team in the region, and creating so-called "Transparency Centers" in the nation's capital and in Los Angeles "so that lawmakers and invited experts can see for themselves how we moderate content and keep our users' data secure."Still, when policymakers are generally on the same page, very little can stand in their way. That's a lesson Huawei has learned, even as its commercial partners --- ranging from the large and powerful to the small and rural --- have warned it would be extremely costly to tear out Huawei equipment. What TikTok has that Huawei doesn't is a culturally significant and politically active user base. But just because TikTok users appear to have successfully disrupted a Trump campaign rally once, that doesn't necessarily translate to the sort of influence that matters inside the White House.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

TikTok Announces Plans To Create 10,000 American Jobs Over The Next Three YearsThe Daily CallerJuly 21, 2020 Tuesday 10:35 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc.

He said the company is pledging to build “teams where we have users.”• The company has tried to distance itself from China, including hiring political operatives to lobby on behalf of TikTok, and stopped using China-based employees to moderate foreign content. • United States lawmakers and government officials are meanwhile bearing down on the app, as the Trump administration floats possibly banning TikTok over concerns that the company is too intertwined with the Chinese Communist Party.TikTok's announced a plan Tuesday to create thousands of American jobs amid scrutiny from lawmakers who believe the company is linked to the Chinese Communist Party.The company said it would add 10,000 jobs in the U.S. over the next three years, TikTok spokesman Josh Gartner said, according to an Axios report published Tuesday. TikTok has grown from just 500 employees in January to 1,400 people as of Tuesday, Axios reported.“It's supporting the tremendous growth in the country and follows our strategy of building out teams where we have users,” Gartner said. (RELATED: TikTok Hires Former GOP And Democratic Congressional Staffers To Lobby On US Policy Ahead Of The Election) TikTok says it plans to create 10,000 jobs in the United States over the next three years, a substantial increase from the roughly 1,400 employees it currently has in the country. https://t.co/kJysoKoDGO - CNN International (@cnni) July 21, 2020The app has been downloaded more than 2 billion times globally on the App Store and Google Play, according to Sensor Tower Store Intelligence, a firm that provides marketing advice for mobile apps. The app generated the most downloads for any app in one quarter, Sensor Tower reported in April.Still, lawmakers have been suspicious of the upstart company.Sen. Josh Hawley and other Republicans have scrutinized TikTok's parent company, ByteDance. The Missouri Republican warned in a March press statement that ByteDance “includes Chinese Communist Party members in leadership.” He also suggested TikTok “admitted” to sending user data to China.Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, a Democrat, asked the U.S. intelligence community to assess TikTok's national security risks in October 2019, saying that such apps could be used to spy on U.S. citizens or become targets of foreign influence campaigns. Schumer and Hawley worry TikTok could be gathering user data and sending it to China.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo suggested during a July 7 Fox New interview that President Donald Trump is considering banning the app. Americans should download the app “only if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,” Pompeo said.TikTok has tried several ways to reassure lawmakers who worry the application is inextricably linked to Beijing.Stopped Using China-Based Moderators TikTok announced in March that it would discontinue using China-based moderators to monitor overseas content, a move that would reportedly result in roughly 100 such moderators shifting to other positions within the company, The Wall Street Journal reported in March.“We are working to find job options within the company for the China-based employees,” Gartner told TheWSJ. Local teams will take over the role after the China-based moderators monitored content for some non-U.S. regions, he added.TikTok Hires Political Operatives To Lobby Congress The company has hired political operatives to lobby on TikTok's behalf, including Michael Hacker, who worked as a senior adviser for Democratic House Majority Whip James Clyburn of South Carolina, CNBC reported July 10.TikTok also hired Freddy Barnes, a former staffer for Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, according to Barnes' LinkedIn page. Derrick Dockery, a former press assistant to former GOP House Speaker Paul Ryan, joined Barnes as one of the company's lobbyist on governmental policy.Launching Transparency Center TikTok launched a so-called transparency center in Los Angeles where officials and experts can monitor the company from afar. The center is unlikely to contain offices where the company makes content review decisions, meaning experts will only get a glimpse into the moderation process, Axios reported in March.Company officials also said the center is only the initial attempt to maintain transparency. “Later, we will expand the Center to include insight into our source code, and our efforts around data privacy and security,” the company said in a March statementTikTok has dismissed any insinuation that it works on behalf of China.“TikTok collects much less U.S. user information than many of the companies in our space and stores it in the U.S. and Singapore. We have not, and would not, give it to the Chinese government,” spokeswoman Ashley Nash-Hahn the DCNF.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

TIKTOK DEPLOYS LOBBYISTS TIED TO TRUMP, TOP DEMOCRATS AS US CONSIDERS BANStates News ServiceJuly 13, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 724 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Center for Responsive Politics:By Karl Evers-HillstromTikTok is one of the most popular and fastest-growing apps in the U.S. But unless its pricey lobbying campaign pays dividends, the video sharing app's time in the limelight could be coming to an end.Both President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have said the U.S. is considering banning TikTok, which is run by the Chinese company ByteDance, amid concerns that users' data could be shared with the Chinese Communist Party. White House trade advisor Peter Navarro told viewers during an interview with Fox News Sunday to expect "strong action" against TikTok and other apps owned by Chinese companies.TikTok, which recently hired former Disney executive Kevin Mayer to run its U.S. operations, says it doesn't share data with the Chinese government. To stave off a U.S. ban, the company is banking on its roster of Washington insiders, including a lobbyist who has close ties with both Trump and Pompeo and former aides to Democratic leaders.TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, didn't start lobbying until the second half of 2019, spending $270,000. In the first three months of 2020 alone, the company spent $300,000 to dispatch 27 lobbyists from four different K Street firms.The most crucial lobbyist for TikTok's future might be David Urban, a key player in Trump's 2016 win in Pennsylvania and an adviser to Trump's reelection campaign. Hired by TikTok in January, Urban's firm American Continental Group has seen its revenue explode to new highs in the Trump era as companies attempt to leverage Urban's connection to the president.Urban was a West Point classmate of Pompeo and reportedly recommended the former Kansas congressman for Trump's cabinet. His influence with Pompeo was underscored by his success in securing a meeting with Pompeo on behalf of defense contractor Raytheon just before the State Department froze congressional holds on arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the New York Times reported. That freeze allowed Raytheon to sell billions of dollars worth of weapons to the two nations.Help us keep government accountable by making a donation today.TikTok's roster also includes influencers with close ties to top Democrats in Congress. TikTok recently restructured its internal lobbying team by adding several well-connected lobbyists, CNBC reported. Among the company's new hires is Michael Hacker, former senior adviser to House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.) and Michael Bloom, a former senior adviser to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). That's after TikTok hired Michael Beckerman, former CEO of the Internet Association lobbying group, earlier this year.Former House Science Committee Chairman Bart Gordon (D-Tenn.), a partner at KandL Gates, also lobbies for TikTok.While Republicans such as Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) are the most vocal critics of TikTok in Congress, some top Democrats are also wary of the widely popular app. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) called on Transportation Security Administration workers to stop using the app earlier this year.The federal government has put pressure on TikTok before. The Federal Trade Commission fined the app maker $5.7 million early last year for illegally collecting information about users under the age of 13. The fine was a record penalty under child privacy laws but made up only a fraction of the company's revenue.While Pompeo has made statements on TikTok's possible national security risk, Trump is considering banning the app to punish China for the coronavirus pandemic, which experts believe originated in China's Hubei province. The U.S. has become the epicenter of the outbreak, with COVID-19 infecting over 3 million Americans and killing more than 135,000.Former American TikTok employees told the Washington Post last year that its Chinese parent company had the final say on what content was censored. TikTok has attempted to distance itself from China, noting that ByteDance offers a separate app that adheres to the country's strict censorship standards for its Chinese users. TikTok recently left the Hong Kong market after Beijing imposed a controversial national security law that will force internet companies to comply with government data requests and censorship.Load-Date: July 14, 2020End of Document

Trump will order TikTok to be sold in the United StatesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 31, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 402 wordsBodyPresident Donald Trump plans to announce a decision ordering ByteDance of China to divest from his ownership of the popular U.S.-based music video app TikTok, according to people familiar with the matter.The U.S. has been investigating potential national security risks due to the company's control of enforcement, and Trump's decision could be announced so soon, even on Friday.White House and Treasury Department spokesmen did not respond immediately to requests for comment. A spokesperson for TikTok could not be contacted for comment.Snap, a competitor from TikTok, won in the current report, reflecting speculation that he may benefit from any move that weakens TikTok. Shares of the company based in Santa Monica, California, rose 2 percent to $22.87 in New York.Bytedance bought Musical in 2017 and merged it with TikTok, creating a fast-growing and popular social media success in the United States, the first Chinese app to make such advances.As TikTok became more popular, U.S. officials became more concerned with the Chinese government's potential to use the app to obtain data on U.S. citizens. The US Foreign Investment Committee, which investigates the overseas acquisition of U.S. companies, began a review of the purchase in the fall of 2019, according to a person familiar with the investigation.TikTok has become a political pawn between the United States and China, and elected officials have criticized the app's security and privacy practices, suggesting that user data collected through the app could be shared with the Chinese government. Trump said earlier this month that he was considering banning TikTok as a way to retaliate against China for its handling of the coronavirus.TikTok's critics and competitors have played with that fear, including Facebook, which has criticized the app for alleged censorship.Trump's threat to ban TikTok came just weeks after reports that many TikTok users had attempted to sabotage a Trump campaign rally by requesting tickets they never planned to use and coordinated an effort to flood the app of Trump's 2020 campaign with negative criticism.TikTok has been looking for ways to distance itself from its Chinese property, trying to assure the public that there is no data stored on servers in China and that the application works independently. Bytedance even appointed a Walt Disney CEO, Kevin Mayer, to lead its operations in the United States.Load-Date: August 1, 2020End of Document

UK vetoed Huawei and will remove its technology from 5G networksCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 14, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 538 wordsBodyThe British Government announced that by the end of 2027 it will have completely removed the 5G technology of the Chinese company Huawei from its networks and decided that, in the meantime, the purchase of new devices will be banned from 31 December this year.The decision represents a 180-degree turn from an earlier resolution that allowed Huawei to supply 35% of the UK's 5G equipment and is a nod to both British companies and the US government that wages an open battle against the Chinese company's presence.According to critics, this turn is part of the UK's response to China over the passage of the czech security law imposed by the Asian country on Hong Kong, its former British colony, and because of the Alleged hiding of information about coronavirus by the Chinese government.Prime Minister Boris Johnson considered the security law applied in Hong Kong to be "a clear violation" of China's obligations, contained in the joint declaration agreed in 1984 that instituted the principle of "one country, two systems".However, the British Government justified the move by following new advice from the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) on the impact of US sanctions against the telecommunications provider.These sanctions were imposed on Huawei in May, following the UK's initial decision on high-risk sellers and are the first of its kind to remove the company's access to products that have been built on the basis of US semiconductor technology.US President Donald Trump had been pressuring Johnson since January to reverse his decision to allow Huawei to act limited in the British 5G market,which enabled him to use up to 35% of the equipment of the new networks.Johnson's turn can help please with the White House, but it won't be at no cost, as the Chinese ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, warned of the "consequences" for breaching the agreement with Huawei.Digital Technology Minister Oliver Dowdensaid in a statement to Parliament that "by the time the next elections arrive, we will have implemented by law a lap-back path in the complete removal of Huawei equipment from our 5G networks."Prior to this the minister said there will be a total ban on the purchase of any new 5G kit after 31 December 2020, which will provide the industry with the clarity and certainty it needs to deliver that technology across the UK.Dowden, argued that 5G will be transformative for our country, but only if we rely on the security and resilience of the infrastructure on which it is based."Following U.S. sanctions against Huawei and up-to-date technical advice from our cyber experts, the Government decided that Huawei needs to be banned from our 5G networks,"he insisted.The Government will now seek to develop a new telecommunications security bill to establish the powers needed to implement this new national security framework.Large British telephony operators warned that the total withdrawal of equipment will be "impossible" in less than a decade and could cause security problems.The Chinese group has already warned that its exclusion would affect "the future of the UK's digital strategy." And he said a two-year delay in the development of 5G would cost its economy 29,000million pounds(u$s36 billion).Load-Date: July 15, 2020End of Document

Lawmakers keen to break up 'big tech' like Amazon and Google need to realize the world has changed a lot since Microsoft and Standard OilThe Conversation - United StatesJuly 28, 2020 Tuesday 9:31 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights ReservedLength: 1272 wordsByline: Bhaskar Chakravorti, Dean of Global Business, The Fletcher School, Tufts UniversityHighlight: As the government considers antitrust action against big US technology companies, a global business scholar identifies four myths that need busting first.BodyBig tech is back in the spotlight. The chief executives of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are testifying before Congress on July 29 to defend their market dominance from accusations they're stifling rivals. Lawmakers and regulators are increasingly talking about antitrust action and possibly breaking the companies up into smaller pieces. I study the effects of digital technologies on lives and livelihoods across 90 countries. I believe advocates of breaking up big technology companies, as well as opponents, are both falling prey to some serious myths and misconceptions. Myth 1: Comparing Google with Standard OilArguments for and against antitrust action often use earlier cases as reference points.The massive 19th-century monopoly Standard Oil, for example, has been referred to as the "Google of its day." There are also people who are recalling the 1990s antitrust case against Microsoft. Those cases may seem similar to today's situation, but this era is different in one crucial way: the global technology marketplace. Currently, there are two "big tech" clusters. One is in the U.S., dominated by Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple. The other is in China, dominated by Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, Huawei and TikTok-maker ByteDance. This global market is subject to very different political and policy pressures than regulators faced when dealing with Standard Oil and Microsoft. For example, the Chinese government has blocked most of the U.S. companies from entering its market. And the U.S. government has done likewise, blacklisting some Chinese outfits over perceived national security threats while discouraging others.Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the Chinese government has doubled down on championing its own technology companies.U.S. companies' size and data accumulation capabilities give the country economic and political influence around the globe. If the U.S. technology giants are broken up, the result would be a vastly uneven global playing field, pitting fragmented U.S. companies against consolidated state-protected Chinese firms.Myth 2: Antitrust is about moneyThere are two main views of antitrust action among legal experts. One focuses on consumer welfare, which has been the prevailing approach federal lawyers have taken since the 1960s. The other suggests that regulators should look at the underlying structure of the market and potential for powerful players to exploit their positions.Those two sides seem to agree that price plays a key role. People who argue against breaking up the tech giants point out that Facebook and Google provide services that are free to the consumer, and that Amazon's marketplace power drives its products' costs down. On the other side, though, are those who say that having low or no prices is evidence that these companies are artificially lowering consumer costs to draw users into company-controlled systems that are hard to leave.Both sides are missing the fact that the monetary price is less relevant as a measure of what users pay in the technology industry than it is in other types of business. Users pay for digital products with their data, rather than just money.Regulators shouldn't focus only on the monetary costs to the users. Rather, they should ask whether users are being asked for more data than is strictly necessary, whether information is being collected in intrusive or abusive ways and whether customers are getting good value in exchange for their data.Myth 3: Trust-busting is all or nothingThere aren't just two ways for this debate to end, with either a breakup of one or more technology giants or simply leaving things as they are for the market to develop further. In my view, the best outcome is right in the middle. The errant company is sued to make necessary changes but isn't broken up. The very fact that the government filed a lawsuit leads to progress with other companies. That is exactly what happened in past cases against the Bell System, IBM and Microsoft. In the 1956 federal consent decree against the Bell System telephone company, for example, which settled a seven-year legal saga, the company wasn't split up. Instead, Bell was required to license all its patents royalty-free to other businesses. This meant that some of the most profound technological innovations in history - including the transistor, the solar cell and the laser - became widely available, yielding computers, solar power and other technologies that are crucial to the modern world. When the Bell System was eventually broken up in 1982, it did not do nearly as much to spread innovation and competition as the agreement that kept the Bells together a quarter-century earlier. The antitrust action against IBM lasted 13 years and didn't break up the company. However, as part of its tactics to avoid appearing to be a monopoly, IBM agreed to separate pricing for its hardware and software products, previously sold as an indivisible bundle. This created an opportunity for entrepreneurs Bill Gates and Paul Allen to create a new software-only company called Microsoft. The surge of software innovations that have followed can clearly trace their origins to the IBM settlement. Two decades later, Microsoft was itself the target of an antitrust action. In the resulting settlement, Microsoft agreed to ensure its products were compatible with competitors' software. That made room in the emerging internet marketplace for web browsers, the predecessors of Apple's Safari, Mozilla's Firefox and Google Chrome.Even Margrethe Vestager, the European Union's top antitrust official and frequent tech-giant nemesis, has said that "antitrust prosecutions are part of how technology grows." But that doesn't mean they all have to achieve their most extreme ends and be broken up. Myth 4: COVID-19 and the end of tech bashingThe current pandemic has highlighted the value of the technological innovations of the big tech companies. Americans are relying more than ever on the internet and online shopping and delivery, while mobility data has been critical in gauging social distancing behaviors and guiding policy. Digital tools for tracking coronavirus cases, deaths and social distancing behaviors in the smallest counties have circulated widely, and social media and smartphone videos were crucial to the recent protests and calls for social justice. Altogether, this has led to a softening of public opinion toward big tech and calls for an end to talk of breaking them up. But the pandemic has also revealed numerous digital fault lines: differences in access by country, race and region; the ability of tech companies to exploit labor; and potential for new kinds of misuse of data. Far from giving the technology industry a free pass, the pandemic is an opportunity to take a more balanced view. Yes, let's celebrate the Silicon Valley's value, but let's not turn a blind eye to the problems they create or worsen. During the hearings, you'll likely hear politicians accentuate the bad stuff, while the tech CEOs will paint an overly rosy image of themselves. Antitrust is complicated enough without misconceptions clouding their judgments as well. This is an updated and expanded version of an article originally published on July 17, 2019.Bhaskar Chakravorti has founded and directs the Institute for Business in the Global Context at Fletcher/Tufts that has received funding from Mastercard, Microsoft, the Gates Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, Omidyar Network and the Onassis Foundation.

Australia strengthens cybersecurity in the face of growing foreign attacksCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 30, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 369 wordsBodySydney, Australia, 30 jun (EFE).- The Australian government announced on Tuesday that it will allocate AUD 1.35 billion,928 million USD or EUR 826 million to strengthen the country's cybersecurity, amid growing tensions over the suspicion of meddling and espionage by foreign powers.The funds, which will be contributed for a decade will also serve to reinforce the tasks of intelligence agencies."The federal government's priority is to protect our nation's economy, national security, and sovereignty. Malicious cyberactivity undermines them," Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement.On 19 June, Morrison reported that Australia suffered a vast cyberattack supported by a foreign country, not to mention the author, while days later the country's authorities recorded the housing and office of a New South Wales state MP for his supposed nexus with the Chinese government.In the past, China has been the target of suspicion for the cyberattack of the Australian Parliament in February 2019, ahead of Australia's general election, and to other government and university institutions.Amid this climate of tensions between China and Australia over suspicions of interference and espionage, Beijing Foreign Foreign Spokesman Zhao Lijian accused Camberra of instigating dissertations in China, spying on his students, as well as encouraging in the media theories about Chinese espionage.Lijian noted that allegations of espionage and interference by China "are not based on solid evidence," while stressing that there is "irrefutable evidence that the spying activities of the Australian operation in China can prove," albeit without providing details about the prosecution.The China-Australia relationship has deteriorated further after Camberra prompted an investigation into the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic, or the passage in the ocean nation of laws against foreign interference and espionage after cases of Chinese donations to Australian politicians were uncovered.In addition, the Australian government blocked the entry of Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE into the concessions of its fifth generation (5G) network for security reasons, as well as the acquisition of land deemed strategic.Load-Date: July 1, 2020End of Document

Foundation for Individual Rights in Education: Fordham Student Punished for Holding Gun in Instagram Photo Memorializing Tiananmen Square MassacreTargeted News ServiceJuly 18, 2020 Saturday 3:48 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 732 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania BodyThe Foundation for Individual Rights in Education issued the following news release:The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education is taking aim at Fordham University for placing a student on probation for two images he posted on social media, one of which memorialized the Tiananmen Square Massacre.On June 3, rising senior Austin Tong posted (https://www.thefire.org/austin-tong-instagram-post-david-dorn-june-3-2020/) to his Instagram account a photo of David Dorn, a retired St. Louis police captain killed by looters in the unrest following the killing of George Floyd. The photo included the caption, "Y'all a bunch of hypocrites," a reference to Tong's frustration, as a supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement, with what he refers to as "the nonchalant societal reaction over [Dorn's] death."The following day, June 4, was the 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre of pro-democracy activists. Tong, who emigrated from China as a child, posed for a photo holding a legally-obtained gun off-campus, with the caption "Don't tread on me." The caption also included an American flag emoji, a Chinese flag emoji, and a hashtag commonly used by Chinese citizens to avoid censorship of online discussion of the Tiananmen Square massacre.Fordham wrote to Tong on June 8, when Dean of Students Keith Eldredge informed Tong he was under investigation by the university for the two photos. On Tuesday, Fordham handed down its verdict: Tong was found guilty of violating university policies on "bias and/or hate crimes" and "threats/intimidation.""When Tong immigrated to the United States from China at six years old, his family sought to ensure that he would be protected by the rights guaranteed by their new home, including the freedom of speech and the right to bear arms," wrote Program Officer Lindsie Rank, author of FIRE's letter to Fordham. "Here, however, Fordham has acted more like the Chinese government than an American university, placing severe sanctions on a student solely because of off-campus political speech."Tong's probation bans him from physically visiting campus without prior approval, taking leadership roles in student organizations, and participating in athletics. He is also required to complete implicit bias training and write an apology letter."While what happened to me is a total disgrace, I hope to use my example as an opportunity for the millions of people out there that fear to freely speak, and to protest the serious case of speech censorship in college campuses," said Tong.

U.S. on Tik Tok alert: Donald Trump analyzes banning it and even Amazon asks its employees to uninstall itCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 10, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 742 wordsBodyTik Tok achieved the impossible: to cap Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos with US President Donald Trump. After Trump secured that he is considering banning the Chinese app TikTok?, now Bezos's company asked his employees to uninstall it from the phones on which they use their Amazon emails.They are not joined by love, but by fear.On the government side, the representative was clear. "It's something we're evaluating,"Trump said in a television interview Tuesday with host Greta Van Susteren."It's a big deal. Look, what happened to China with this virus, what they've done to this country and the whole world is disgraceful," he said, merely stating that the ban is "one of the many options" under study against China, which he accuses of a lack of transparency regarding the pandemic.His statements echo those of his Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, who this week stated that the United States "considers" banning Chinese social media apps,including TikTok, on suspicion that Beijing uses them to spy on users.On Amazon's part, the notice tells you that employees must delete the app for this Friday to continue accessing Amazon mail. Workers will still be able to use TikTok from the browser of an Amazon laptop.No less data: After Walmart, Amazon is the second largest private employer in the United States, with more than 840,000 employees worldwide.In an emailed statement, Tik Tok said Amazon did not notify you before sending the email."We still don't understand their concerns," they argued, as well as ensuring that they were willing to address the differences to have a dialogue on the subject.In the Trump administration, the issue had been making noise since Wednesday, when Pompeo told reporters that the U.S. government is evaluating "every instance" in which it believes that its citizens' data, on their phones, or in their health care records, are at risk."We want to make sure that the Chinese Communist Party doesn't have a way of easily accessing that," he said, noting that "measures that preserve or protect that information will be sought."Despite these threats, TikTok, who denies Washington's accusations, announced Wednesday the launch of a platform that allows SMEs to create app-specific advertising clips.TikTok, very popular with younger people thanks to its videos on humor, dance and music, belongs to the Chinese group ByteDance and has almost a billion users worldwide.The furore in the United StatesBut the Trump administration's new enemy will be a tough opponent of winning at least for the Centennials, also known as Gen Z for his videos on humor, dance and music. The TikTok social network is in frank growth among Americans and the numbers account for that furore.By January 2018, the platform had 20 million monthly active users. With the app's staggering growth, estimates suggest that the current number of monthly active users increased to approximately 65 million, according to data revealed by the media analytics platform Wallroomedia.Among Americans over the age of 18, TikTok attracted 22.2 million unique visitors in January, 23.2 million in February and 28.8 million in March. In April, that number increased to 39.2 million, three times the 12.6 million who used the app in the same period of 2019, according to the most recent data from Comscoreprovided to Adweek.And the profits don't turn their backs on him: so far this year is $500 million.TikTok defends itselfThe Chinese platform group Bytedance, which on Tuesday suspended access to the platform in Hong Kong, days after Beijing enacted a new national security law that gives more powers to the police, has often had to defend itself against its relations with China."TikTok is led by an American chief executive, with hundreds of employees and managers (...) here in the United States,"said a spokesman for the group, quoted by Bloomberg news agency."We have never provided user data to the Chinese government and we wouldn't if asked to do so," he added.With regard to its new TikTok For Business platform, Tik Tok clearly hopes that "its community known for its creativity, inventiveness and good humor" will attract companies looking for a young audience.With this, TikTok could compete with its elders in this very profitable niche, whether with Facebook, YouTube or Twitter.TikTok recently appointed a new CEO, Disney Chief Executive Kevin Mayer, who experts say could help the company in its dealings with U.S. regulators.With information from AFPLoad-Date: July 11, 2020End of Document

Rep. Ken Buck Spearheads Campaign Pressing Trump To Ban TikTok Over National Security ConcernsThe Daily CallerJuly 15, 2020 Wednesday 09:00 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc.

Ken Buck and 24 other GOP lawmakers pressed President Donald Trump Wednesday to ban TikTok over concerns that the social media app's suspected ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) pose a threat to U.S. national security.TikTok's data collection practices present “a very real threat to U.S. national security,” Buck wrote in a letter  obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation. The letter was addressed to Trump and demands “strong action to stop the CCP's sophisticated espionage campaign.”Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz of Florida, Andy Biggs of Arizona, and Louie Gohmert of Texas signed the letter as well.TikTok insists that it does not nor will it provide China with customers's personal data.“TikTok collects much less U.S. user information than many of the companies in our space and stores it in the U.S. and Singapore. We have not, and would not, give it to the Chinese government,” a company spokesperson told the DCNF.The company's assurances are not enough for Buck and his Republican colleagues.“These popular apps' data collection, coupled with China's onerous cyber security laws requiring all companies operating in China, including TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to share data with the Chinese Communist Party present a threat to the United States,” they wrote.“TikTok is nothing more than a Trojan Horse for the Chinese Communist Party,” Buck said in a statement to the DCNF, adding: “The national security threat posed by TikTok has never been greater.” (RELATED: TikTok Hires Former GOP And Democratic Congressional Staffers To Lobby On US Policy Ahead Of The Election)Link to ImageRep.

Patrick Semansky/Pool via REUTERSRepublican Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley and other lawmakers have also scrutinized ByteDance. Hawley warned in a March press statement that ByteDance “includes Chinese Communist Party members in leadership,” arguing at the time that, “TikTok has admitted that it has sent user data to China.”Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, for his part, asked the U.S. intelligence community to assess TikTok's national security risks in October, saying that such apps could be used to spy on U.S. citizens or become targets of foreign influence campaigns.TikTok promised to stop accessing users' content on iOS devices in June, the Telegraph reported in June, after a new feature in iOS 14 indicated the company had not stopped collecting data despite pledging to end the practice in 2019.Users noticed that TikTok had been scanning content on the clipboard while the app was in background mode, according to the Telegraph report.Misty Hong, a college student from Palo Alto, California, alleged in a December lawsuit that TikTok and its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, is amassing enormous amounts of data on users without their consent and sending it to servers in China.“At the same time that Defendants utilized the Musical.ly and TikTok apps to covertly tap into a massive array of private and personally-identifiable information, they went to great lengths to hide their tracks,” Hong alleged in her lawsuit.Hong's civil action lawsuit argues that ByteDance used Musical.ly, acquired in November 2017 for $800 million, to covertly gather users' private messages, along with other highly granular personal information. The data was collected and then sent to Chinese servers, she argued in the lawsuit.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

TikTok removed 49 million videos for breaking rulesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 9, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 446 wordsBodyMillions of videos were removed from TikTok during the last half of last year because the company determined that they did not meet their community standards or terms of service.On Thursday TikTok released its second "Transparency Report" and in that document revealed that, only between July 1 and December 31, 2019, it deleted 49,247,689 videos from its platform alone.Such videos corresponded to users around the world, however, the company states that most of the deleted content originated in the United States and India.While all of these videos were removed because they generally violated TikTok's rules of use, the company details that in December a quarter of the deleted videos contained "adult nudity and sexual activities" and 24.8% was removed for "representing harmful, dangerous or illegal behaviors of minors".According to TikTok,in December 2019, only 3% of the deleted videos were removed because they violated their harassment and intimidation policy and less than 1% of the content removed from the platform was removed because it violated the application's rules on hate speech.Content regulation is always one of the main discussions around the work of social media, so in its report TikTok emphasizes that 98.2% of the videos he deleted in the last half of 2019 were deleted before a user reported them and 89.4% would have been deleted before someone saw them.Moreover, the platform contends that most of the content it deleted in the last half of 2019 was on its own initiative and only received about 1,300 copyright removal requests and 45 applications for deletion by governments, with India being the country that issued the most of those requests.In that regard, TikTok asserts that it did not approve all government requests and says that no deleted content was removed at the request of the Chinese government, the country of origin of ByteDance, the company that owns TikTok."We did not delete or remove any content at the request of the Chinese government, and we would not do so if requested," TikTok spokesman told The Verge, who further held that the social network "has never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if they asked for it."In that vein, it should be remembered that this new Transparency Report from TikTok was published shortly after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo noted that Donald Trump's administration would be considering banning enforcement in that country.Pompeo said that such a move would be motivated by doubts about the security of implementation, however, Trump recently said that he would be contemplating that sanction as a kind of punishment to China for its handling of COVID-19.Load-Date: July 10, 2020End of Document

FCC Chairman Pai Issues Remarks to American Council of Technology-Industry Advisory CouncilTargeted News ServiceJuly 10, 2020 Friday 5:17 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2178 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Federal Communications Commission issued the following remarks on July 9 by Chairman Ajit Pai to the American Council of Technology-Industry Advisory Council:I know that I'm here to talk about 5G. But considering that ACT-IAC is dedicated to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of government, I feel compelled to speak briefly about the FCC and its operations during the coronavirus pandemic.ACT-IAC focuses on two strategies for improving the effectiveness of government: fostering public-private collaboration and harnessing the power of technology. And at the FCC, we're practicing what you preach.Looking at the landscape in early March, we quickly decided that, with the need for social distancing, our top priority would be to make sure that as many Americans as possible would have access to communications services during this difficult time and that no American would have their Internet or voice services cut off because of disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.To that end, we engaged broadband and telephone service providers and called on these companies to take what we called our Keep Americans Connected Pledge. The Pledge had three core commitments. First, no consumer would lose service due to an inability to pay a bill because of disruptions associated with the pandemic. Second, no one would be charged late fees because of the pandemic. And third, Wi-Fi hotspots would be opened up to anyone who needed them.The response was overwhelmingly positive. More than 750 broadband and phone providers signed the pledge, including all of the nation's largest service providers and many of the smallest.The initial pledge was set to expire after 60 days--in mid-May. But we recognized that consumers' needs would persist beyond that deadline, so we asked companies to extend their commitment to June 30. And even more companies, nearly 800, did so.By working collaboratively with industry to advance the public interest, we were able to make progress much more quickly than had we tried to pursue command-and-control regulation. For example, within 48 hours of proposing the Pledge, all of the nation's largest broadband providers had signed on. Call me biased, but this sounds to me like a good candidate for an ACT-IAC case study on public-private partnerships.As for harnessing the power of technology to improve government operations, the FCC was able to shift its entire operations online and transition to mandatory telework without skipping a beat--even with minimal notice. In fact, we did much more than just keep the trains running. We launched multiple initiatives to address the challenges posed by COVID-19. To share just one example, back in March, the Commission worked with Congress to secure funding for our $200 million COVID-19 Telehealth Program, which has aided hospitals, health care providers, and patients in some of the hardest-hit areas of the country. We got Congressional approval of this program, adopted rules to stand it up quickly, and, just yesterday, we awarded the last funding available under this program. In the end, we approved 539 applications from facilities in 47 states, plus Guam and the District of Columbia. The overwhelming share of the credit for the Commission's effectiveness over the past four months goes to our outstanding staff, but the agency's IT infrastructure also played an indispensable and underappreciated role. And for that, I'd like to give a special shout-out to our IT staff.Shifting to 5G, I trust that you've already heard plenty today about the ways it will be critical to our economy, quality of life, and global competitiveness. So I'm going focus on what we're doing at the FCC to realize the potential of 5G.Yet again, I think the Commission's work is closely aligned with ACT-IAC's mission. That's because many of the policy challenges surrounding 5G involve balancing competing interests and trying to come up with mutually beneficial solutions.At the FCC, we call our strategy for U.S. leadership in next-generation wireless technology the 5G FAST plan. It consists of three central components: freeing up more spectrum for the commercial marketplace, promoting wireless infrastructure deployment, and modernizing our regulations to promote more fiber deployment for wireless backhaul.Each of these elements requires engagement with external partners, especially our work to repurpose spectrum for 5G.Earlier this year, for example, the FCC successfully completed the auction of airwaves in the upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47 GHz bands. By making available 3,400 megahertz in three different bands, this was the largest spectrum auction in our nation's history. But before holding it, we first needed to resolve how to deal with incumbent licensees. So we established a new form of incentive auction that simultaneously set prices for new licensees and made offers to incumbents to vacate the band. That kind of innovative thinking was big win for American leadership in 5G and for market-based solutions to sharing spectrum.Or consider our approach to sharing in the 3.5 GHz band. For years, federal users occupied the bottom 100 megahertz of the band. And even though they made little use of it across much of the country, commercial use was extremely limited, and this valuable spectrum largely lay fallow.So in 2015, the FCC voted to create a dynamic, three-tiered, hierarchical framework to coordinate shared federal and non-federal use of the 3.5 GHz band. Incumbents, which include federal users, comprised the highest tier and would receive protection from all other users, followed by Priority Access Licenses, or PALs, on the second tier, and General Authorized Access, or GAA, on the third tier.This new spectrum paradigm reflects the input of not only our government counterparts at the National Telecommunications Information Administration and Department of Defense, but also broadband providers of all types, large and small, fixed and mobile. And operators of Spectrum Access Systems and Environmental Sensing Capabilities--through a voluntary industry standards body, WinnForum--developed the technology to ensure that commercial users wouldn't interfere with incumbents. Thanks to these efforts, the FCC was able to move forward with commercial deployments in this band in September 2019.Unfortunately, the rules that the Commission adopted in 2015 didn't do enough to encourage investment and innovation with respect to the Priority Access Licenses. So I asked my colleague, Commissioner Mike O'Rielly, to lead a re-examination of the rules governing the Priority Access License tier. We determined that the earlier decision to license PALs by census tracts was ill-suited for 5G deployment, so we replaced that plan with county-based licensing. And to encourage more investment in the band, we also extended the license terms from 3 years to 10 years and created an expectancy of license renewal. These reforms have made 3.5 GHz licenses much more appealing for 5G operations and will encourage the rapid deployment of next-generation wireless networks in the band.Two weeks from today, the Commission will begin the auction of 3.5 GHz Priority Access Licenses, making available 70 megahertz of valuable mid-band spectrum for 5G. Over 270 applicants have qualified to bid, and I look forward to seeing the results.Mid-band spectrum, such as the 3.5 GHz band, is particularly appealing for 5G because it combines good geographic coverage with good capacity. And we have systematically identified additional mid-band airwaves that were being underused and have set plans to put these airwaves to work for the American people.In July 2019, the Commission adopted flexible new rules for the 2.5 GHz band. This is our nation's single largest band of contiguous spectrum below 3 GHz, and it's well-suited for 5G deployment.But it's dramatically underused today--existing licenses cover only about one-half of the country, and most of the spectrum is vacant west of the Mississippi River. We opened a Rural Tribal Priority Window so that Tribal Nations in rural America have early access to 2.5 GHz spectrum. This is a critical opportunity for rural Tribes, which are too often on the wrong side of the digital divide, to get the spectrum they need to deploy 5G networks. And we intend to auction any remaining spectrum after this window closes. In the end, this spectrum will yield about 200 megahertz for 5G and other wireless services.The Commission's biggest move to free up mid-band spectrum for 5G is in the 500-megahertz swath of spectrum from 3.7 GHz to 4.2 GHz--what we call the C-band. This spectrum is mostly used by fixed-satellite companies to beam content to video and audio broadcasters, cable systems, and other content distributors. However, with advances in technology, these companies can now provide the same services using considerably less spectrum.That's why the FCC recently voted to clear the lower 280 megahertz of the C-band and make this spectrum available for 5G through a public auction that will begin on December 8. All eligible space station operators currently using this spectrum have committed to an accelerated relocation to the upper 200 megahertz of this band--meaning that the lower 280 megahertz will become available for 5G two to four years earlier than otherwise would have been the case (and the remaining 20 megahertz will be used as a guard band).In addition to pushing more spectrum out in the marketplace, we continue to knock down regulatory hurdles and promote infrastructure build-out, spurring record-breaking capital investments in essential infrastructure, including fiber and small cells. Indeed, hundreds of thousands of small cells will need to be deployed each year to meet growing mobile data demands.On top of all these efforts to promote the development and deployment of ultra-fast, highcapacity 5G networks, the Commission is committed to making sure those networks are secure. When 5G is embedded in almost every aspect of our society and economy--from businesses to homes, hospitals to transportation networks, manufacturing to the power grid--that means securing our networks will become much more important and much more difficult. An important part of network security is the integrity of the communications supply chain--that is, the process by which products and services are manufactured, distributed, sold, and ultimately integrated into our communications networks.For years, U.S. government officials have expressed concern about the national security threats posed by certain foreign communications equipment providers. Hidden "backdoors" to our networks in routers, switches, and other network equipment can allow hostile foreign powers to inject viruses and other malware, steal Americans' private data, spy on U.S. companies, and more.The equipment at the heart of 5G networks currently comes from just a few global suppliers. And the largest right now is the Chinese company Huawei. This has raised concerns, given the company's close ties to the Chinese military and Communist Party and the fact that Chinese law requires all companies subject to its jurisdiction to comply with requests from the country's intelligence services, and bars disclosure of these requests to any third parties.To counter this risk, the FCC has prohibited the use of money from our Universal Service Fund to purchase or obtain any equipment or services produced or provided by companies posing a national security threat, including Huawei. We have also initiated a process to catalog, remove, and replace unsecure equipment from USF-funded communications networks. We've denied authorization to China Mobile, which is owned by the Chinese government, to enter the U.S. market. And we've issued show cause orders to other Chinese state-owned companies that received such authorizations many years ago, asking them to explain why those authorizations shouldn't be revoked. Finally, Congress recently passed and the President signed into law the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act to further strengthen the integrity of communications networks and the communications supply chain. On July 16, the FCC will vote to start the process of implementing that law.To finish where I began, I'm optimistic about the future of 5G in our country because we are implementing a plan that embraces one of the strategies recommended by ACT-IAC for improving the effectiveness of government: fostering public-private collaboration. The United States has the world's best innovators and entrepreneurs. They helped us lead the world in the development and deployment of 4G wireless technology. And I believe that by making more spectrum available for commercial use, removing obstacles to the deployment of wireless infrastructure, and modernizing regulations to promote fiber deployment, the FCC is empowering American businesses to build on our 4G success, establish American leadership in 5G, and create a wireless future that will benefit us all.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7170941 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 10, 2020End of Document

THE CYBERSECURITY 202: DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE'S EMAIL VOTING PLAN LIMITS HACKING RISK BUT CAN'T ELIMINATE ITUS Fed NewsJuly 16, 2020 Thursday 11:42 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 2505 wordsBodyANN ARBOR, Mich., July 16 -- The University of Michigan issued the following news release:The Democratic National Committee's virtual convention next month will mark a major test for whether Internet-based voting can be done safely and securely.The DNC, which is moving its convention online because of the coronavirus pandemic, released a plan Friday for delegates to vote by email for the Democratic presidential nominee and planks in the party's platform.Internet voting presents far fewer risks in this case than it would during a regular election because delegates' ballots aren't secret. That means they can verify their votes weren't altered either by hackers or technological snafus and correct any errors after the fact. There's also no drama about the outcome of the most important vote because former vice president Joe Biden has basically already secured the Democratic nomination.But it still presents numerous opportunities for hackers from Russia or elsewhere to disrupt the voting process, sow confusion about results or use disinformation operations to spread conspiracy theories or gin up hostilities between rival camps supporting Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).And any disruption is likely to spark painful memories of 2016 when information Russia hacked and leaked from the DNC helped wreak havoc on Hillary Clinton's campaign.That means the DNC must be hyper-prepared to knock back any allegations of digital interference or rapidly respond to attacks even as it runs a convention unlike any in history."Even if they're making a prudent decision for public health, this still remains a rich environment for bad actors," Edward Perez, global director of technology development at OSET Institute, a nonprofit election technology organization, told me. "No one should lose sight of the fact that a purely electronic return of ballots is very high risk. The DNC needs to wear both hats at the same time: public health and cyber defense."The DNC has been working for months on how to make a virtual convention work during the pandemic.The party passed a resolution in May allowing smaller subcommittees to handle in advance some of the more complex votes that usually take place on the convention floor. The remaining votes, including nominating the party's candidate for president, will go to all convention delegates on a single ballot delivered by email. They'll have 12 days to fill that ballot out and forward it by email to state party officials between Aug. 3 and Aug. 15. The convention begins Aug. 17.Those emailed ballots will include the delegate's name and another unique identifier such as a bar code that connects the delegate with his or her vote, the party said in an email to delegates."The State Parties will be responsible for collecting all ballots from convention delegates as they would if we were conducting votes in person at the convention," the letter states. "At the conclusion of voting, each state delegation chair will submit a tally sheet to the Secretary's Office that formally records the number of votes cast on each item of convention business."There are a number of built-in security safeguards.Delegates will receive email updates when their votes are tallied by state party officials and will be able to reach out to those officials to ensure their votes were correctly recorded, a DNC official told me. Delegates will also have the option of voting by phone or conventional mail if they object to email voting or lack Internet, the official said.Biden's and Sanders's campaigns hosted webinars this weekend outlining the email-voting system for their delegates."We want delegates to play their critical role without risk to their personal or the public health," said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about cybersecurity planning. "We know who all the delegates are. And because the votes are public, we feel confident that we could swiftly fix any problems that arise."The party is also taking measures to ensure that other elements of the convention aren't disrupted by hackers such as speeches by Biden and top party officials. That includes buying services from cybersecurity companies and "deploy[ing] redundant and diverse connections and pathways for the programming and infrastructure that supports the programming," the official said.If a traditional election was held this way, election security experts would be sounding alarms about it.Indeed, when a handful of states piloted voting on mobile apps earlier this year, it sparked so much concern that the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and the Election Assistance Commission sent states a guidance memo detailing the risks. The memo warned that returning ballots using the Internet poses "significant security risks," including that hackers could change large numbers of votes, block votes from being recorded or undermine ballot secrecy.Those risks are significantly mitigated when officials aren't trying to both send a vote over the Internet and keep the voter's identity secret. But they're not eliminated."The stakes are obviously a lot lower in a party convention setting than a general election context where online voting could be hacked to change the results," Alex Halderman, a University of Michigan election security expert, told me. "But what's at stake here is the legitimacy of the process and for that reason security is still very important."For example, hackers could prevent a state from forwarding votes to the DNC by locking up its computers with ransomware or overwhelming its networks with Internet traffic. They could also change large numbers of votes by hacking into delegates' personal computers and mobile devices. That would probably be caught but not before it publicly embarrassed the party."I'm less concerned about this instance of remote voting because they won't be anonymous," Duncan Buell, a University of South Carolina election security expert, told me. "But [the DNC] should contract with a really good security firm. They should have backups on top of backups and delegates should be checking their votes were cast the way they expected."The committee should also be as transparent as possible so there's less room for Russia or another hostile nation to spread phony rumors that votes aren't being counted accurately or to otherwise spark fights between delegate factions, Perez said."Just like the DNC attack in 2016, this creates an opportunity for bad actors to cast doubts on results and further divide us as a nation," he said.The keysTrump is taking credit for the U.K.'s decision to ban Huawei from its 5G networks.The president's boast came after the United Kingdom reversed an earlier decision that would have allowed the Chinese firm to build less-sensitive parts of its next-generation phone and Internet system."I did this myself, for the most part," Trump said at a news conference. "It's a big security risk. I talked many countries out of using it."British Health Secretary Matt Hancock pushed back on Trump's claims, saying ""All sorts of people can try to claim credit for the decision but this was based on a technical assessment by the National Cyber Security Centre about how we could have the highest quality 5G systems."Hancock told Sky News: "Well we all know Donald Trump don't we."The U.K. government expects its 5G network to be totally Huawei-free by 2027 because it will be a lengthy and costly process for British companies to shed all their Huawei gear. The decision came after a U.S. ban on foreign firms selling computer chips made with U.S. equipment to Huawei.U.S. security hawks hailed the ban as a victory. U.S. officials have long maintained that Huawei could serve as a back door for Chinese spying. Huawei denies the claims.Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, urged the Trump administration to work with allies "on promoting secure and competitively priced alternatives to Huawei equipment."Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, also weighed in:The decision could steer other European countries toward banning Huawei or seriously limiting its role in their 5G networks, Ellen Nakashima and William Booth report.Huawei, meanwhile, blamed the U.K. decision on politics. "This disappointing decision is bad news for anyone in the U.K. with a mobile phone," a company spokesman told Reuters. "Regrettably our future in the U.K. has become politicized, this is about U.S. trade policy and not security." Some trade groups have also criticized the move, saying the timeline could hurt U.K. consumers.The last-minute request by Harris County officials came on behalf of thousands of quarantined people, Zach Despart at the Houston Chronicle reports. An Austin resident in a similar bind had to get a last minute doctor's note that allowed her to have someone else return her ballot with minutes to spare, the Texas Tribune's Alexa Ura reports.The incidents shows the sort of thorny challenges that are likely to face officials in November as they attempt to run elections in the thick of the pandemic.Meanwhile, some Dallas County voters had their ballots returned to them because of issues with preprinted envelopes, the U.S. Postal Service confirmed Monday. It's unclear how many voters were affected and if they ultimately risked catching the virus to vote in person. "We reviewed this issue with the Dallas County Board of Elections before the election as well as last week, advising them how to correct the problem," USPS told Dallas news station WFAA in a statement.Other primary and runoff elections went relatively smoothly yesterday in Alabama and Maine.Spain is the latest nation accused of using spyware to go after political opponents.Roger Torrent, the speaker of a regional parliament in Spain's Catalonia region, alleges the Spanish government used controversial spyware from the Israeli company NSO Group to hack his phone, the Guardian reports.Torrent, an advocate for Catalan independence from Spain, was alerted about the hack by researchers working with WhatsApp. The Facebook division is suing NSO for helping government clients hack its customers. Torrent told the Guardian that it seemed clear the "Spanish state" was responsible for the alleged attack.Two other advocates for Catalan independence were allegedly also targeted in what researchers called a "possible case of domestic political espionage," the Guardian reports.A former NSO employee confirmed to Motherboard that the Spanish government is a client. NSO maintains it only sells its spyware to governments for tracking terrorists and criminals.WhatsApp is suing NSO for allegedly helping to hack approximately 1,400 of its users across 20 countries, including about 100 journalists, dissidents and activists. Amnesty International recently lost a case that would have stripped NSO of its license to export software outside of Israel.Hill happeningsA Democratic lawmaker is calling on Apple and Google to require apps to disclose where they store data.Rep. Stephen F. Lynch (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Oversight Subcommittee on National Security, sent letters to Apple and Google saying that the companies are responsible for making consumers aware of potential security risks posed by the apps.Neither company requires developers to disclose in which countries their data is stored.Intelligence officials have warned that foreign apps could be compelled to share U.S. user data depending on local laws. Some lawmakers and officials have pointed to the concern in advocating for restrictions on TikTok and other Chinese apps. (TikTok says it does not store U.S. user data in China.)Lynch also asks the companies to provide details on any instances in which they removed an app for sharing personal data with a foreign government.SECURING THE BALLOTMajor U.S. Postal Service operational changes could wreak havoc on mail-in voting.The changes, instituted by new Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, include directing carriers to temporarily leave some mail at distribution centers in order to finish their routes more quickly, according to a memo obtained by The Washington Post.Mail voting advocates fear that could dramatically slow delivery of ballots and mail ballots and ballot applications. The changes come as the Trump administration has wrested increased control over the struggling agency."With our states now reliant on mail voting to continue elections during the pandemic, the destabilizing of the Post office is a direct attack on American democracy itself," said Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. (D-N.J.). He urged the Senate to pass a $25 billion rescue package that the House has already passed.GLOBAL CYBERSPACETikTok tries to allay security concerns in Australia.The company's general manager for Australia wrote a two-page letter to Australian lawmakers insisting that the company does not share any data with the Chinese government, the Wall Street Journal reports.More international news:Chinese banks require clients to use tax programs laced with backdoors, report says (CyberScoop)CYBER INSECURITYMicrosoft issued a patch for a serious Windows flaw.The 17-year-old vulnerability could have allowed hackers to take over a victim's entire IT system, including emails and servers, CyberScoop reports.

Trump To Ban TikTokASEAN TribuneJuly 31, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 ASEAN Tribune All Rights ReservedLength: 300 wordsBody 31 July 2020 (Voice of America) President Donald Trump says he intends to ban the operation of TikTok in the U.S.Trump said Friday he could take action as soon as Saturday to stop the operation of the popular video-sharing social media app in the U.S.'As far as TikTok is concerned, we're banning them from the United States,' he told reporters traveling with him Friday from Florida.He said he would likely use an executive order to prohibit the app.Trump does not support a deal that would allow a U.S. company to buy TikTok's American operations.The app is extremely popular in both the U.S. and around the world. It has already been downloaded 2 billion times worldwide, and 165 million of those downloads were in the U.S.The app features not only entertainment videos, but also debates and takes positions on political issues, such as racial justice and the coming U.S. presidential election.U.S. officials are concerned that TikTok may pose a security threat, fearing that the company might share its user data with China's government. However, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, has said it does not share user data with the Chinese government and maintains that it only stores U.S. user data in the U.S. and Singapore. TikTok also recently chose former Disney executive Kevin Mayer as its chief executive in a move seen as an effort to distance itself from Beijing.Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said earlier this week that the U.S. government's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an interagency group led by the Treasury Department, would be looking into TikTok.CFIUS's job is to oversee foreign investments and assess them for potential national security risks.

WIFE OF JAILED DISSIDENT WHO STOOD UP FOR UYGHURS CALLS FOR HIS RELEASEStates News ServiceJuly 29, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 553 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Concerns are growing for jailed Xinjiang dissident Zhang Haitao, who has only been allowed three family visits in the past five years of his sentence at a prison in the northwestern region of Xinjiang.Zhang, an outspoken critic of the ruling Chinese Communist Party's treatment of the mostly Muslim Uyghur ethnic group, is serving a 19-year jail term at Xinjiang's Shaya Prison for "incitement to subvert state power" and spying charges.Zhang's wife Li Aijie fled China with her son after being targeted for threats by local authorities after Zhang was sentenced by the Intermediate People's Court in Urumqi, regional capital of the northwestern region of Xinjiang, on Jan. 15, 2016.Li told RFA on Wednesday that nobody in the family has had any news of Zhang since their last visit in April 2018."Zhang Haitao was detained on Dec. 2, 2016. He was sent to Shaya prison in Xinjiang. His last visit was from his sister on April 26, 2018," Li said."Family members haven't been allowed by the Chinese government to meet with him for two years and three months," she said."I call on the Chinese government to release Zhang Haitao immediately," she said. "He is innocent, and our son misses his father very much.""He asks me every day when his father will be allowed to come home," Li said.Zhang's sister said prison guards had called an immediate halt to her last meeting with him on April 26, 2018 when they heard her telling him that his wife and son were now safely in the United States."Before the visit, the prison guards called us to the office and told us that we wouldn't be allowed to discuss his wife and child's departure for the U.S., nor anything to do with religion," she said."About 30 minutes into the visit, we told him about his wife and child, and the meeting was terminated immediately," she said.Held in isolation, deprived of exerciseZhang's sister said he was being held in solitary confinement with no exercise in the open air."He said he was alone, and I asked if he was allowed to go outside for exercise, but he said there was a door which had been sealed off," she said.She said the authorities had refused to allow her to visit again, despite frequent telephone requests."They told me it was on orders from higher up," she said. "Later on, nobody even picked up."Repeated calls to Shaya Prison rang unanswered during office hours on Wednesday.At Zhang's trial, the prosecution cited 69 posts to the Chinese social media platform WeChat and 205 Twitter posts and reweets, as evidence of inciting subversion of state power.Li, who gave birth to the couple's son shortly after he was jailed, and was left with no income, was relying on relatives for financial support, she told RFA at the time.But ChinaAid, which helped to organize her escape from China, said she had faced abuse within her family as well as threats from officials.Zhang, 46, was initially detained on June 26, 2015 on suspicion of "picking quarrels and stirring up trouble," but the charges against him were later changed to the more serious charges of subversion and spying.The court said it had handed down a longer jail term because Zhang had "colluded" with overseas organizations.Reported by Qiao Long for RFA's Mandarin Service.

The UK to withdraw all Huawei equipment in its 5G network in five yearsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 11, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 413 wordsBodyThe UK will set the year 2025 as the deadline for the total withdrawal of equipment from the Chinese company Huawei from its 5G telecommunications networks, according to a report from The Telegraph newspaper published on FridayAccording to this publication, UK Culture Minister Oliver Dowden will announce it on Tuesday when he appears before the British parliament. Several of the ministers in Premier Boris Johnson's cabinet have pointed out that five years is the right deadline.By January the UK had limited Huawei's share of 5G networks in the British Isles to 35% and banned it from entering the most sensitive sectors in terms of system security.Earlier this week, however, London noted that recent US sanctions against the Chinese technology company had created "very serious risks" to security in the use of its equipment, as Huawei will no longer be able to access certain U.S. technologies.Recent measures against Huawei on the part of the British government have further strained relations between London in Beijing, confronted by the Chinese government's recent national security law imposed on the former British colony of Hong Kong.Huawei has clashed with the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States over its ties with the Communist Party of China (REUTERS/Toby Melville) (Toby Melville/)In this context, the UNITED Kingdom's position has come closer and closer to that of the United States, which has long accused Huawei, a multinational controlled mostly by the Chinese state, of accountability to the government of the People's Republic and the Communist Party of China, and that for this reason the use of its equipment could be a threat to the security of the communication networks.China's UK ambassador Liu Xiaoming warned last week that expeling Huawei would send a "very bad signal" to other Chinese companies.On Thursday, British telecom companies Vodafone and BT said they need a minimum of five years and ideally seven to take over the supply of equipment that will replace Huawei, otherwise there could be cuts in the services of 5G, a much faster network than the current one, in the UK.Some conservative party lawmakers, however, are pushing Johnson, who belongs to this force, to push the deadline by 2023.With information from ReutersMORE ON THIS TOPIC:France to restrict the use of Huawei equipment on 5G networkBoris Johnson will reduce Huawei's role in UK 5G technologyUK Giro: Boris Johnson will phase out huawei 5G network usageLoad-Date: July 12, 2020End of Document

While nothing in the following article will be news to anyone who follows Internet governance, it is worthwhile to look at these events together, as part of a pattern:* China imposed a repressive National Security Law on Hong Kong* India forced its ISPs and platforms to block dozens of apps offered by Chinese companies* The United States Senate advanced a bill attacking Section 230 immunity and proposed another that would ban end-to-end encryption in online services* Brazil put forward a law targeting "fake news" on the Internet* Germany is tightening its anti-hate speech rules* Advertisers urged to boycott Facebook to pressure it to assert more control over contentWe discuss these events in the order of their seriousness, and then assess some of the dynamics leading to this trend.China crushes Hong Kong SAR's autonomyA new "National Security" law for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), written in mainland China, came into effect at 23:00 on 30 June, 2020, an hour before the anniversary of the 1997 sovereignty transfer from Great Britain. The law is Beijing's answer to months of protest in the SAR. It is designed to chill all forms of speech, assembly and private communication critical of the regime. Michael Tien, the pro-China representative of Hong Kong in China's National People's Congress, said on Bloomberg that Hong Kong people will have "freedom" as long as they "stay out of politics."The law targets advocacy of secession, dissemination of messages considered subversive, and collusion with foreign forces. It also targets "terrorism" but defines it broadly to include any form of violent protest, such as damaging public transport facilities. All four are punishable by a maximum sentence of life in prison. Mainland China courts, not any Hong Kong judicial or policy body, will have full authority over the interpretation and enforcement of the law, and it overrides any Hong Kong law.Posts by Hong Kong people criticizing the Communist Party, or promoting Hong Kong resistance or independence can often be seen on Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp. The law criminalizes this speech. WhatsApp groups composed of Hong Kong expats have already fallen silent based on intimidation, even though WhatsApp messages are encrypted.Shockingly, Article 38 of the law asserts jurisdiction over people "from outside [Hong Kong]... who are not permanent residents of Hong Kong." This means that a Hong Kong expat who is now a citizen of Canada, a Chinese student in the UK, or any American, European, African or Indian who expresses thoughts on social media or email that the Communist Party deems secessionist (e.g., supporting Uighurs or Hong Kong autonomy), subversive (critical of the CCP and its system of government) or colluding with foreign forces (e.g., receiving support from external human rights organizations) could be deemed criminals. While it is unlikely that China would try to arrest someone in another territory, anyone who plans to visit or do business in Hong Kong - or the mainland - could be arrested and jailed under these provisions.Internet censorship will be extended to Hong Kong. Simon Young Ngai-man, associate law dean at the University of Hong Kong, said the legislation gives police "unfettered power" to require media outlets and internet service providers to delete information and aid authorities in tracking people down. No court order will be needed to require them to turn over information about their users. In short, One Country, Two Systems is dead.India blocks Chinese appsFollowing a clash between troops along the India-China border, India's government banned 59 Chinese apps, allegedly on cybersecurity/national security grounds. TikTok, WeChat and several popular gaming apps were among the blocked services. Using data from App Annie, TechCrunch reported that the blocked apps had a combined monthly active user base of over 500 million Indian users. The ban does not just remove the Chinese apps from local app stores; authorities have also ordered internet service providers (ISPs) to block access to their websites as well. Google said that the company had "temporarily blocked access to the apps" on the Google Play store available in India. Apple has taken a similar approach.As the South China Morning Post pointed out, India's move "could have been taken right out of China's playbook." It is a process of alignment, whereby access to global content and services is restricted to the territorial jurisdiction of the state. India's Ministry of Electronics and IT tried to justify the ban by claiming that the apps were "compiling, mining and profiling" users' data that posed threats to "national security and defence of India." But no credible national security threat from consumer social media and gaming apps was ever documented; the move was really economic punishment for the Kashmir conflict, and security was used as a cover story that made discrimination against Chinese apps more difficult to challenge legally.USA: Encryption and Section 230 under attackThe so-called EARN-IT Act, which emerged unanimously from a Senate Committee this week, erodes Section 230 immunity, ostensibly in order to improve detection and removal of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM). It would create a "National Commission on Online Child Sexual Exploitation Prevention" full of law enforcement personnel and child protection advocates, tasked with developing "best practices" for owners of Internet platforms to "prevent, reduce, and respond" to findings of child porn. Platforms who do not adhere to the designated best practices would lose their Section 230 immunity. Originally the law was seen as an indirect way of banning end to end encryption, but an amendment by Senator Wyden mitigated - but did not eliminate - that threat.[1]CSAM is already illegal and heavily prosecuted, and several laws have been passed from 1998 to 2017 strengthening cooperation on this issue. Section 230 immunity, not child abusers, are the real target of EARN-IT. Its supporters' goal is to give victims of CSAM a cause of legal action against social media platforms. That is, they are less interested in catching perpetrators or preventing child sexual abuse at its source than they are in being empowered to mount lawsuits against deep-pocketed social media providers, so that the platforms will more aggressively surveill and intervene in user-generated content. That approach has far-reaching implications for privacy and free expression. A child protection advocacy organization noted that the law provides no assistance for child sexual abuse prevention programs and makes no attempt to address the root causes of child sexual abuse.While Senator Wyden's amendment to EARN-IT reduced one threat to encryption, a new bill revives the threat. Senators Lindsay Graham (R-SC) and ultra-right Trump Republicans Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) introduced a bill that Stanford University's Center for Internet and Society called "a full-frontal nuclear assault on encryption in the United States." The bill bans providers from offering end-to-end encryption in online services, encrypted devices that cannot be unlocked for law enforcement, and any encryption that does not build in a means of decrypting data for law enforcement. The bill reprises a 2016 US bill known as the Compliance with Court Orders Act (which never made it out of committee) and is similar to Australia's 2018 Assistance and Access Act, which did pass.Germany strengthens social media surveillanceGermany is trying to tighten its online hate speech rules. A new law would make platforms send reports of alleged hate speech and the personal details about the person saying it straight to the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA). The German government's reform of hate speech law follows the 2019 murder of Walter Lubcke, a pro-refugee politician, by neo-Nazis. The government claims the murder was preceded by targeted threats and hate speech online.Civil liberties advocates believe that the social media giants are being co-opted to help the state build massive databases on citizens without robust legal justification. The Green party, concerned with the privacy implications of the law, proposed an amendment that would only require transmission of the content to the police with no personal details; the police would then be able to follow up to request the personal data if justified. That amendment was defeated.While proponents of the law correctly note that threats and incitement to violence can chill speech on the internet, the hate speech sanctions are also intended to suppress messages on social media ex ante rather than to prosecute incitement and the perpetrators ex post, which often results in broader chilling effects. Like so many other legal and regulatory responses to violent acts, the law seems to assume that removing expressions of social conflict from major social media will eliminate the conflict and the crimes, an assumption which has no empirical backing.Brazil reacts to "fake news"On 30 June 2020, Brazil's Federal Senate passed a Bill (2630/2020) intended to combat abuses of social media by heavily regulating both platforms and their users. Mislabeled the Law on Freedom, Responsibility and Digital Transparency on the Internet, the original version was a privacy and free expression nightmare. According to Human Rights Watch, it made it a crime punishable by one to five years in prison to create or share content that poses a serious risk to "social peace or to the economic order," without defining those terms. It ordered internet companies to track the chain of forwarded communications of all Brazilians for at least four months. It criminalized membership in an online group whose primary activity is the sharing of defamatory messages, even if the member did not create or share the messages. To discourage the use of inauthentic accounts to disseminate misinformation, users of social networks and interpersonal communication services in Brazil would be required to have a valid identity document, a cell phone number registered in Brazil, and a passport for foreign cell phone numbers. In trying to prevent anonymity in social media, the law "goes over the top" according to one Brazilian commentator.Controversy over it led to four versions of the fake news bill over 11 days and (as Brazil is still a functioning pluralist democracy) some of the harsher provisions were watered down. It is not easy to find an up to date, translated version of the bill at this time. The bill now goes to the lower house, where it may not be passed, and it may be vetoed by the President.Brazil's attempt to regulate fake news mirrors that of Malaysia, whose Anti-Fake News Act 2018 was passed by its Parliament a few weeks before national elections and was immediately used to curtail speech that was critical of the government, including reporting on corruption investigations that implicated the then-Prime Minister. The law was repealed by the reform government in October 2019.Facebook boycottSeeking to capitalize on the heightened awareness of racism fostered by BLM protests, a group of left-advocacy organizations have promoted an advertiser boycott of Facebook. Derrick Johnson, NAACP president and one of the leaders of the boycott, claimed that Facebook "is a breeding ground for racial hate groups." The same groups are also upset that Facebook has not moderated political ads more aggressively, especially the statements of Donald Trump.800 companies worldwide have pulled advertising from Facebook, including Coca-Cola, Unilever, and Ford. But, according to an insightful analysis of the situation by Casey Newton at The Verge, a boycott by brand advertisers is unlikely to have a major impact. The highest-spending 100 brands accounted only about 6% of the platform's ad revenue. Most of FB's money comes from smaller direct-response advertisers. Big brand advertisers could all quit Facebook permanently tomorrow and it would still have more than 90 percent of its revenue.At any rate, it's hard to get too enthusiastic about this effort because pressure from major advertisers has a long history of sanitizing and de-politicizing communications media, notably broadcasting. Note that Facebook policy already targets what it considers to be hate speech; Facebook says it removed 9.6 million pieces of it from the network in the first quarter of 2020. Casey Newton suggests that it is the massive size of Facebook, rather than its alleged tolerance of unacceptable forms of speech, that is the problem:"...what is at stake here, to the extent that the boycott is actually about hate speech, is not what is allowed but what is enforced. And if that's the conversation you want to have, you need to ask different questions. Questions like: How swiftly should violating content be removed? How much of it should be identified by automated systems? And how many mistakes are you willing to tolerate, both for posts removed in error and posts left up in error?"Surely bigness is part of the problem, but breaking up FB and/or fostering a more diverse social media economy also means that a wider range of content moderation policies would thrive, which could easily allow the groups that the boycotters don't like to find an outlet for their views. The underlying issue here is whether different ideologies and factions should be encouraged to shape platform policy in ways that suppress views and groups they disagree with.The patternCompressed into one week, we see a reactionary assault on almost all aspects of Internet capabilities. The spectrum of the reaction ranges from outright censorship and repression in Hong Kong, to an economic and technical blockade in India, to a variety of efforts to regulate platforms in western democracies. All have in common a perception that free and open communication on the internet is a threat that needs to be curtailed. China has, for all practical purposes, conceded that its entire political system is threatened by political speech in one tiny part of its territory holding less than 1% of its population. India purports to see a similar national security threat in Chinese apps, but in reality is using Internet-based information services as hostages that can be taken more easily than soldiers on the border. The attack on encryption in the United States is another instance in which the capacity for confidential communications on the Internet by businesses and civil society are seen as threats rather than as strengths. In Brazil and the US, social media content regulation is caught up in largely partisan, left-right factional and political disputes, sometimes flying under the banner of hate speech, sometimes under child protection, sometimes under the guise of platform bias.In Brazil, concerns about online misinformation are related to investigations documenting influence operations run by Bolsonaro's government, which is accused of hiring people to spread fake news and defame the opposition across social networks as part of their job. As in the US, the left sees social media as a vehicle of the right and the right sees the platforms' content moderation policies as biased toward the left. Social media content regulation has become the chosen vehicle for underlying conflicts between political parties and political factions. As the fate of fake news laws in Brazil and Malaysia show, however, one can only do this by ending anonymity, implementing comprehensive surveillance, and making the government the ultimate arbiter of truth, worsening the risk of political bias in application. In the USA, platform immunity is under assault from both left and right (both Biden and Trump have expressed their opposition to Section 230), but few seem to understand how eliminating that immunity will lead to more and probably less balanced forms of suppression.There was, however, one bit of good news: France's Constitutional Council invalidated key provisions of its anti-hate speech law. A good Techcrunch article on French Constitutional Council decision can be found here (https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/19/french-constitutional-authority-rejects-law-forcing-online-platforms-to-delete-hate-speech-content/).Footnote:(1) Sen. Patrick Leahy's amendment specified that the implementation of end-to-end encryption does not violate the new regulations and does not give rise to civil and criminal liability. But another amendment gives the state governments the power to implement anti-encryption policies and to push for criminal and civil penalties if the platforms were "reckless," a lower threshold that will certainly encourage the moderator's dilemma.[Category: Computer Technology]Copyright Targeted News ServicesC20-RajeshS-7166174 C20-RajeshSLoad-Date: July 6, 2020End of Document

Instagram's rival to TikTok will come to the US in early August (FB)Business Insider USJuly 16, 2020 Thursday 01:24 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Insider Inc.

The Trump administration recently said it's considering banning the Chinese app in the US, opening the door for US tech companies to roll out new features catered to the TikTok audience.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.Facebook will soon debut its competitor to TikTok's popular short-video format to US Instagram users as the Trump administration weighs a country-wide ban on the viral Chinese app.Instagram plans to roll out Reels, a new format that will live inside of the app's Stories feature, to the US in early August, a company spokesperson told Business Insider. Like TikTok, Reels will allow users to record and edit short-form videos with audio and music soundtracks. Instagram users will be able to create and share Reels to their Stories, and access their short-form videos in a new, dedicated tab on their profiles. Public accounts will have their their videos shared on the app's Explore page, and can choose whether or not their Reels content appear on their profiles and in followers' Feeds.As for similarities drawn between TikTok and Reels, an Instagram spokesperson said in a statement that "no two services are the same.""TikTok specifically has harnessed real consumer behavior, and done amazing things. We've also seen the rise of short-form video on Instagram, and think we can create something in a way that makes sense for our community," the spokesperson told Business Insider. "This responsiveness to consumer demand is competition at work and one of the longtime hallmarks of the tech sector. It increases choice, which is good for people."Facebook first started testing Reels with users in Brazil in November, before rolling out last month to France and Germany. The early August rollout will include the United Kingdom and around 50 other countries, NBC News reported.The debut of Instagram's Reels in the US - and in India in early July, as reported by Business Insider India - comes as concerns over TikTok's livelihood in both countries has created an opening in short-form video-sharing. The Indian government recently banned new user downloads of TikTok and other Chinese apps amid a bloody border dispute with China, where the app's parent company ByteDance is based.TikTok has been facing greater scrutiny in the US over how much access and influence the Chinese government is afforded over user data and content moderation. Most recently, multiple government officials - including President Trump himself - have threatened banning the app. TikTok has more than 2 billion global downloads and an estimated US userbase at as high as 80 million.So far, TikTok has been able to brush off lawmakers' calls for investigations and national security experts' warnings. In June, TikTok appointed a US-based CEO in June to try to distance itself from its Chinese roots. But the imminent threat of TikTok disappearing from the US has already signaled panic among users, and led tech companies to take advantage of the chaos to lure the app's loyal following to their competing platforms.YouTube has started testing its in-app feature for short-form video with a "small group" of people, and developers have discovered Snapchat could be switching out its horizontal swiping motion for TikTok's signature vertical swipe. Smaller apps, like Byte, Triller, Likee, and Dubsmash, have also seen an increase in downloads, according to Reuters. NOW WATCH: Here's what it's like to travel during the coronavirus outbreakSee Also:• TikTok's under pressure from the US government, and competitors like Snapchat, YouTube, and Instagram are capitalizing on the app's uncertain future• Inside the rise of TikTok, the viral video-sharing app that US officials are threatening to ban due to its ties to China• TikTok users are reporting that all their video views and like counts have reset to zeroSEE ALSO: Dozens of high-profile Twitter accounts, including Obama, Biden, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Kanye, were hacked in a colossal bitcoin scam: here's the full listLoad-Date: July 16, 2020End of Document

BlackRock, a giant without cracksCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 1, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1085 wordsBodyAfter the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, three major Goldman Sachs executives became U.S. Treasury secretaries. Between 1995 and 1999, during Bill Clinton's presidency, Robert Rubin held the main chair of the imposing Pennsylvania Avenue offices. In Republican George W. Bush's second presidential term, Hank Paulson served as Treasury holder between July 2006 and January 2009, The Moment Barack Obama landed at the White House.Steven Mnuchin, current Treasury secretary since February 2017, developed the most important part of his professional career at Goldman Sachs over 17 years, and retired as the firm's senior executive vice president in 2002.Larry Fink has been the president and ceo of BlackRock since 1992. The new York-based global firm is currently the world's largest manager of financial assets and sovereign debt, with an investment portfolio of around $7 trillion.In late March, the U.S. Federal Reserve reached an agreement with BlackRock to manage billions of dollar bond buying operations, a contract that sparked heavy criticism in various policy areas of the country but has so far not traded any regulatory agents.At 67, Fink maintains its confidence in global business amid the pandemic. He said so in a recent institutional communication. "Because of the nature of the crisis and its ability to reach us all, we will only be strengthened as human beings as we face this virus together. To overcome this crisis, we need a response that transcends party lines and national borders." Nothing different from the dialectical proclamation of a political leader.A dream team of former staffBlackRock brings together notable political leaders who achieved important positions in Democratic and Republican administrations on its board and in its management. Global finance is an effective vaccine against political cracks.Thomas Donilon is currently the Chairman of the Blackrock Investment Institute, or Larry Fink's top geopolitical strategy adviser. He had been nothing less than Obama's National Security Adviser between October 2010 and June 2013. In this regard, he met personally with the world's leading leaders, including Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and the Israeli Premier Netanyahu.He was previously chief adviser to Warren Christopher, Bill Clinton's first secretary of state from 1993 to 1996. In 2016, Obama appointed him to the head of his government's Cybersecurity Commission.His entire political career was developed in positions endorsed by Joe Biden. In fact, he is married to Catherine M. Russell, who served as chief adviser to Second Lady Jill Biden, during Joe's tenure in the vice presidency of the Nation.Terrence Donilon, Thomas' brother, is the Secretary of Communications and Public Affairs of the Archdiocese of Boston, front of which is Cardinal Sean Patrick O'Malley, Jorge Bergoglio's rival in 2013 for the Vatican leadership.Meanwhile, Mike Donilon, Thomas' other brother, is closely linked to Donald Trump's future rival in November, whom he has been advising on political strategy issues for more than two decades.In August 2019, Obama appointed Adewale "Wally" Adeyemo as president of the foundation that bears his name. A descendant of Nigerians and a graduate of the universities of Berkeley and Yale, Adelemo is a senior advisor at BlackRock.During the ten-year management of the former Democratic representative, Adeyemo served as deputy National Security Adviser for EconomicsDirector of the National Economic Council.For her part, BlackRock board member Cheryl Mills is closely linked to Hillary Clinton who she accompanied as head of advisers during her tenure at the head of the State DepartmentBlackRock's legal area is run by Christopher Meade. In 2013, when Jacob Lew was in charge of the Treasury Department, Meade was the agency's principal legal adviser. He had previously been one of the secretaries of the progressive Supreme Court Justice, John Paul Stevens.BlackRock's vast influence also reaches Europe. Its vice-president, Philipp Hildebrand, came to the firm after having been director of the Central Bank of Switzerland. As George Osborne, former British Premier David Cameron's former economy minister, he is a senior adviser to BlackRock.Until a few weeks ago, German lawyer Friedrich Merz, one of the leading leaders of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) who was at the helm of the German subsidiary of BlackRock, resigned his post to compete for the chair occupied by Chancellor Angela Merkel.Meanwhile BlackRock expands and increases its participation in major global firms. In Spain, it holds 6.3% of BBVA and 5.9% of Santander, the two most capsized market companies in Spain. In recent weeks, it also went on to control 4.3% of voting rights over Bankia, another major Iberian financial institution. Days ago BlackRock has just declared a 5.1% holding in the powerful steel holding company ArcelorMittal whose parent company is in Luxembourg.In mid-April this year, the European Commission awarded BlackRock a million-dollar business. The contract aims to provide information aimed at integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks into the risk management processes of EU banks.Geopolitical conflicts of interest with China?At the last shareholder meeting of the financial giant chaired by Larry Flink, a question aroused suspicion in many investors. Does BlackRock have as clients the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (PCCh)? And in that case, wouldn't having such clients become a conflict of interest when it comes to recommending investments in China?In this regard, the director of the National Economic Council, Lawrence Kudlow, and the President's National Security adviser, Robert O'Brien, recently warned of the importance of the activity that American regulatory bodies must undertake in overseeing the financial operations that Chinese companies conduct in their territory.The Chinese Communist Party's claims that corporate finance and other similar data are "state secrets" only raise more questions about the desirability of giving its corporations approval to meet the same legal and regulatory standards that registered U.S. companies must meet.The scandals that involved Chinese companies in recent years came at a million-dollar cost. In addition, the Chinese government currently prevents companies with Chinese trading traded on U.S. exchanges from complying with applicable securities law, leaving investors without the benefit of significant protections.Load-Date: July 2, 2020End of Document

Difficult year in Europe begins to change prospects for HuaweiCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 8, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 879 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. it has gone from being a crucial component of the UK and France mobile networks to a potential outcast, after resistance and arrangements began to yield to a relentless White House campaign.Both countries indicated this week that they are taking steps to reduce their reliance on the Chinese company: the UK is considering phasing out the role Huawei would start earlier this year, and French cybersecurity agency Anssi will impose an exemption system that is likely to severely limit its use.A year ago, things seemed much more optimistic to the Chinese company. Britain's intelligence and security committee said last July that banning Huawei would make networks less resistant to malicious attacks. The committee's reasoning was that it would reduce competition and leave the UK dependent on only two suppliers: Nokia Oyj and Ericsson AB.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson attempted a settlement in January, allowing operators to use Huawei equipment to build their 5G systems as long as they limited it to 35% and agreed not to use it on sensitive network cores.But U.S. pressure has only increased, and European governments and operators have been forced to choose sides between two world powers. President Donald Trump's administration has accumulated sanctions, making it increasingly difficult for European operators to access products from the world's largest telecom equipment manufacturer."Huawei's R&D; spending growth has accelerated recently," says Neil Campling, analyst at Mirabaud Securities. "Its progress in relation to its Western peers is significant, so the United States is using as much as it can in its political power, be it trade sanctions, official agreements, unofficial agreements, to try to slow China's progress."Huawei Vice President Victor Zhang urged the UK to assess the long-term impact of US sanctions before deciding to exclude the company's products."It's too early to assess its long-term impact. This means it's also premature to make a considered judgment about our ability to deliver next-generation connectivity across the UK," Zhang said in a call with reporters on Wednesday. "Now is not the time to rush to make such a critical decision about Huawei."Huawei has consistently denied that it is a security risk and does not work independently of the Chinese government. His spokesman, Paul Harrison, argued on Twitter that the US is unfairly dictating UK policy with its sanctions and that it threatens the UK's 5G rollout.Like the UK, France tried to find a middle ground. In May 2019, Macron told Bloomberg Television that it did not intend to capitulate to U.S. pressure, although the government had already restricted the amount and location of Huawei equipment used on its networks. As wireless carriers prepare to implement 5G, the country will likely add additional restrictions to Huawei access.The Trump Administration, which wanted Europe to ban Huawei altogether because of concerns that the Shenzhen-based company team was vulnerable to infiltrating Chinese spies, responded.Trump rebuked Johnson in a call after the UK announcement, said one familiar with the matter at the time, and Vice President Mike Pence did not rule out that the confrontation could affect trade talks with Britain after Brexit in aCNBC interview in February.Even U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stepped in to warn European allies at a security conference in Munich that month that it would be dangerous to trust the company. And U.S. Ambassador Richard Grenell tweeted that countries using an "unreliable seller" for 5G risk intelligence sharing.Now, France has effectively excluded Huawei by allowing only limited-time authorizations of between three and eight years for local telecommunications providers to use Huawei equipment. The move poses a technical challenge for companies such as Bouygues and SFR, who will now be forced to think twice before placing the Huawei 5G kit in addition to their 4G systems if they face the risk of dismantling Chinese equipment in the near future. There are still European markets to fight for. The German government is struggling to establish rules that require safety certification for 5G network providers. Previously, senior Chinese officials highlighted German auto companies – the crown jewel of Europe's largest economy – as a potential target of retaliation if Huawei is driven from its markets.The fatal blow to Huawei's relationship with Europe may have come in May, when the United States banned the company from obtaining microchips using American technology.The prevalence of chips that are made with or incorporate American technology caused New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu to declare in May that "Huawei has 12 months to live."Those sanctions were so severe that they led British security services to reopen their review of how safe and sustainable Huawei could be as a provider of national networks. That review has been completed and sent to the UK's digital and cultural secretary, Oliver Dowden. He said they will "probably have an impact on Huawei's viability as a supplier" and that there will soon be more details about the UK's next steps.Original Note:U.S. War on Huawei Begins to Turn After Europe's Rough Year (1)©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: July 9, 2020End of Document

O'Brien: Trump Weighing TikTok BanThe FrontrunnerJuly 9, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 211 wordsBodyThe New York Post (7/8, Nelson, 4.57M) reports President Trump is considering whether to ban Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok, National Security Advisor O'Brien said Wednesday.

Unfair US visa restriction to employees: HuaweiCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 16, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 349 wordsBodyChina's tech giant Huawei today called the U.S. decision to impose visa restrictions on company employees "unfair and arbitrary" for providing "material support" to governments in countries that violate human rights.In a short statement posted on your Twitter account, Huawei's U.S. subsidiary claims to feel "disappointed.""Huawei operates independently of the Chinese government. We are a private company, controlled by its workers," he reiterates in response to the accusations raised by Washington, which suspects its alleged links to the Asian country's intelligence and considers it a risk to its national security.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced yesterday that he would impose these restrictions on employees of Huawei and other Chinese companies "for providing material support to regimes that commit human rights violations around the world."However, it did not specify how many companies will be subject to this new punishment and also did not offer details on how many employees could be affected. On its website, Huawei, founded in 1987, indicates that it has 194,000 employees in 170 countries and regions around the world.Pompeo said Huawei is an "arm" of the Communist Party of China (PCCh), and warned international telecommunications companies: "They should give themselves as warned. If they're going to do business with Huawei, they're doing business with human rights violators."      Photo: AFP     The head of US diplomacy also congratulated the Uk on its decision to ban the country's telecommunications operators from acquiring Huawei's fifth-generation (5G) network technology.In this regard, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce today protested this "discriminatory" decision in London and assured that it will take the "necessary measures" to defend the rights and interests of Chinese companies.According to the spokesman for the institution, Gao Feng, the British Government's decision violates World Trade Organization rules, reduces the confidence of Chinese investors in the island country, and affects economic and trade cooperation between the two nations.Load-Date: July 17, 2020End of Document

TikTok to Leave Hong Kong as Security Law Raises QuestionsBillboardJuly 7, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Prometheus Global Media, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; TAGLength: 963 wordsByline: Associated PressHighlight: TikTok said Tuesday it will stop operations in Hong Kong, joining other social media companies in warily eyeing ramifications of a sweeping national security law that took effect last week.BodyTikTok said Tuesday it will stop operations in Hong Kong, joining other social media companies in warily eyeing ramifications of a sweeping national security law that took effect last week.The short-form video app's planned departure from Hong Kong comes as various social media platforms and messaging apps including Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, Google and Twitter balk at the possibility of providing user data to Hong Kong authorities.The social media companies say they are assessing implications of the security law, which prohibits what Beijing views as secessionist, subversive or terrorist activities or as foreign intervention in the city's internal affairs. In the communist-ruled mainland, the foreign social media platforms are blocked by China's “Great Firewall.”Critics see the law as Beijing's boldest step yet to erase the legal divide between the former British colony and the mainland's authoritarian Communist Party system.TikTok said in a statement that it had decided to halt operations “in light of recent events.” The company would not comment on the size of its operations in Hong Kong or any other matters.Operated by Chinese internet giant Bytedance, TikTok has sought to distance itself from its Chinese roots while striving for global appeal. It recently hired former Walt Disney executive Kevin Mayer to be its CEO.The company has said all its data is stored in servers in the U.S. and insisted it would not remove content even if asked to do so by the Chinese government. Even so, TikTok has still been regarded as a national security risk, with U.S. secretary of state Michael Pompeo saying Monday that it was looking at banning certain social media apps, including TikTok.Facebook and its messaging app WhatsApp said in separate statements Monday that they would freeze the review of government requests for user data in Hong Kong, “pending further assessment of the National Security Law, including formal human rights due diligence and consultations with international human rights experts.”Hong Kong was convulsed with massive, sometimes violent anti-government protests for much of last year as the former British colony's residents reacted to proposed extradition legislation, since withdrawn, that might have led to some suspects facing trial in mainland Chinese courts.The new law criminalizes some pro-democracy slogans like the widely used “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time,” which the Hong Kong government says has separatist connotations.The fear is that it erodes the special freedoms of the semi-autonomous city, which has operated under a “one country, two systems” framework since China took control in 1997. That arrangement has allowed Hong Kong's people freedoms not permitted in mainland China, such as public dissent and unrestricted internet access.Telegram's platform has been used widely to spread pro-democracy messages and information about the protests. It understands “the importance of protecting the right to privacy of our Hong Kong users,” said Mike Ravdonikas, a spokesperson for the company.“Telegram has never shared any data with the Hong Kong authorities in the past and does not intend to process any data requests related to its Hong Kong users until an international consensus is reached in relation to the ongoing political changes in the city,” he said.Twitter also paused all data and information requests from Hong Kong authorities after the security law went into effect last week, the company said, emphasizing that it was “committed to protecting the people using our service and their freedom of expression.”“Like many public interest organisations, civil society leaders and entities, and industry peers, we have grave concerns regarding both the developing process and the full intention of this law,” the company said in a statement.Google likewise said it had “paused production on any new data requests from Hong Kong authorities.”Though social platforms have yet to be blocked in Hong Kong, users have begun scrubbing their accounts and deleting pro-democracy posts out of fear of retribution. That retreat has extended to the streets: Many shops and stores that publicly stood in solidarity with protesters have removed the pro-democracy sticky notes and artwork that had adorned their walls.Under implementation rules of Article 43 of the national security law, which give the city's police force sweeping powers in enforcing the legislation, platforms, publishers and internet service providers may be ordered to take down any electronic message published that is “likely to constitute an offence endangering national security or is likely to cause the occurrence of an offence endangering national security.”Service providers who do not comply with such requests could face fines of up to 100,000 Hong Kong dollars ($12,903) and receive jail terms of up to six months.Individuals who post such messages may also be asked to remove the message, or face similar fines and a jail term of one year.Hong Kong authorities moved quickly to implement the law after it took effect on June 30, with police arresting about 370 people.The rules allow Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam to authorize police to intercept communications and conduct surveillance to “prevent and detect offences endangering national security.”Police can conduct searches for evidence without a warrant in “exceptional circumstances” and seek warrants requiring people suspected of violating the national security law to surrender their travel documents, preventing them from leaving Hong Kong.Written notices or restraining orders also may be issued to freeze or confiscate property if there are “reasonable grounds” to suspect that the property is related to an offense endangering national security.Link to ImageLoad-Date: July 7, 2020End of Document

PROMINENT UYGHUR JOURNALIST CONFIRMED DETAINED AFTER NEARLY THREE YEARSStates News ServiceJune 9, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 913 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A prominent Uyghur journalist has been confirmed detained in northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) after disappearing nearly three years ago, according to an official in the regional capital Urumqi.Qurban Mamut, the former editor-in-chief of the official Xinjiang Cultural Journal, went missing around November 2017, several months after he and his wife visited their son Bahram Qurban at his home in the U.S. state of Virginiathe first time the three had seen each other in more than nine years.Qurban told RFA's Uyghur Service in October 2018 that he had learned his father was taken to one of a network of internment camps in the XUAR, where Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities accused of harboring "strong religious views" and "politically incorrect" ideas have since April 2017 been detained without legal process.He said that while his father was guilty of no crime, he was likely detained because "authorities regularly arrest people who have relatives living abroad [to gain leverage over them]."Qurban's information was corroborated by one of his father's neighborsa Uyghur student who was studying abroad at the timewho said he had learned of the arrest in April 2018 from other residents of the area and that authorities had made "threats" against other family members.Mamut, of Kuchar (in Chinese, Kuche) county in the XUAR's Aksu (Akesu) prefecture, earned a bachelor's degree in literature from Xinjiang University in 1976 and worked as a journalist and editor for the official Xinjiang People's Radio Station until 1984.He worked for the Xinjiang Cultural Journal from 1985 until he retired as editor-in-chief in 2011, and was known for selecting works by the region's most influential writers on Uyghur culture, history, politics, and social development for publication.Scant informationSince his disappearance, Qurban's family members in the XUAR have told him not to ask about his father's case, suggesting that other relatives could be at risk over his inquiries. Regardless, he has continued to seek information about Mamut's wellbeing through social media campaigns used by Uyghurs in exile to demand proof-of-life videos of their disappeared loved ones from Chinese authorities."Ultimately, I haven't had a single opportunity to obtain any information about my father [other than that he was interned]I've called so many different places and I've used every means I can think of to make calls, to get in touch," Qurban recently told RFA."If only I could have spoken with someone, Uyghur or Han [Chinese], I would have been able to get something out of them. But I couldn't. I was never able to successfully get in touch with anyone."RFA recently spoke with a Han Chinese employee of the Urumqi City Cultural Office who suggested calling the local branch office of the central government's Bureau of Culture, but a Han staffer who answered the phone there said she had no knowledge of Qurban Mamut.Another Han employee at the Bureau of Culture told RFA to speak with the Xinjiang Cultural Journal but was unable to provide a contact number.However, a Han Chinese staffer at the Xinjiang Hall of Public Culture said she knew of Mamut and confirmed that he had been detained."He's not currently here ... he's been retired for a long time," she said."And then his situation later, perhaps you know, he's currently classified as a 'detained person.'"When asked whether Mamut had been sentenced to prison or sent to an internment camp, the staffer said she did not know."I don't know anything else about his situation," she said. "If you want to know more, you should probably call our boss's number."Targeting cultural identityNews of Mamut's arrest comes amid reports of several Uyghur writers and intellectuals being taken into custody by authorities in the XUAR and either jailed or sent to internment camps as part of what Uyghurs in exile say is a calculated campaign to destroy the cultural identity of their ethnic group.While Beijing initially denied the existence of the camps, China last year changed tack and began describing the facilities as "boarding schools" that provide vocational training for Uyghurs, discourage radicalization, and help protect the country from terrorism.But reporting by RFA's Uyghur Service and other media outlets indicate that those in the camps are detained against their will and subjected to political indoctrination, routinely face rough treatment at the hands of their overseers and endure poor diets and unhygienic conditions in the often-overcrowded facilities.Among those who have called for Beijing to shut down its camp system and end other rights violations in the region are U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, U.S. Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback, and several high-ranking lawmakers.Last month, the U.S. Congress passed the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2020, a bill that would sanction Chinese government officialsincluding regional Communist Party secretary Chen Quanguoresponsible for arbitrary incarceration, forced labor and other abuses in the XUAR.The bill has been sent to the desk of U.S. President Donald Trump, who is widely expected to sign it into law in coming days.Reported by Shohret Hoshur for RFA's Uyghur Service.

COMPARING HOW MEDIA AROUND THE WORLD FRAMES CORONAVIRUS NEWSStates News ServiceJune 25, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1567 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BOSTON, MA BodyThe following information was released by Boston University:BU researchers are using machine learning to analyze evolving news trends in countries hard-hit by the pandemicJessica ColarossiThe novel coronavirus that has now sickened more than 9.4 million people worldwide, and killed over 487,000, has been the major focal point of the news for most of 2020. But what aspects of the pandemic have received the most media attention, and where? Margrit Betke and Lei Guo, Boston University researchers developing machine learning algorithms for interpreting international media coverage, have joined forces to create data visualizations of how journalists around the world have reported on various facets of the pandemic."COVID-19 is a public health crisis on a global scale," says Guo, BU College of Communication assistant professor in emerging media studies. "It serves as an ideal case study for communication researchers to examine how different countries around the world report the same issue and how the reporting reflects each country's cultural and political context."Using machine learning strategies Betke and Guo developed alongside collaborators in the Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Media (AIEM) research group they co-lead at BU, the duo has been tracking COVID-19-related news in four countries that have played a major role in the coronavirus pandemicChina, South Korea, the United States, and the United Kingdomto shed light on how widely circulated media outlets in different countries are responding to and framing the global health crisis.Their goal for now is to provide a tool that enables people to inform themselves about the topics the media focused on in the different countries at different periods. Later, they plan to analyze how differences in culture, press freedom, and government communication impacted a country's ability to squash the pandemic. The researchers are sharing their data and analysis of international COVID-19 news coverage online.Leveraging a text analysis method known as unsupervised machine learning, their algorithm retrieves news stories from around the world and analyzes headlines and lead paragraphs to identify the 10 main news topics in each country during a given week. From those 10 topics, the algorithm then links each one with a list of 20 associated terms, which are also reviewed by Guo, Betke, and the rest of their AIEM team. The team attributes labels to each set of terms, such as "government responses and actions" or "frontline healthcare," and calculates the proportion of news coverage focusing on each topic, which gets reported in their graphics."Our dynamic data visualizations are surprisingly powerful and they reveal the emergence, prevalence, or lack of discussion of certain topics in certain countries during certain periods of the pandemic," says Betke, BU College of Arts and Sciences professor of computer science. The project particularly hits home for Betke, who overcame an infection with the novel coronavirus soon after it first began spreading in the United States.Before the project was off the ground, Betke faced the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic herself, along with her husband. After returning from a computer vision conference in San Diego, Calif., where she was in contact with numerous scientists from all over the worldincluding some researchers from Northern Italy, where the outbreak had already begunshe felt symptoms that closely matched those of the coronavirus. So, on March 5, just five days before BU's spring break, Betke began self-isolating and started teaching her class on artificial intelligence remotely, likely making it one of the first classes at BU to move online as a result of the pandemic. Even though Betke felt all the signs of a respiratory infection, and experienced other alarming symptoms, she did not qualify for a COVID-19 test since she had not traveled to a foreign country. At that point in time, testing for COVID-19 was not widely available in Massachusetts, and eligibility was based on a narrow list of requirements. Her doctor instead tested her for influenza A and B, and a few other viruses. All the tests came back negative. But when her husband also fell sick, Betke began to worry.Guo, who since late 2019 had been closely following the Chinese news coverage of the COVID-19 outbreak, suggested that Betke and her husband consider the real possibility that they may have contracted the novel coronavirus. Following Guo's advice, they bought an oximeter to monitor their oxygen levels during bouts of shortness of breath, providing them with peace of mind when their breathing felt particularly difficult. Betke's breathing issues lasted for about five weeks. It took two months before she started to feel back to normal."During my slow recovery, I [was] anxious to contribute to the COVID response with my AI expertise," says Betke. "It is important to analyze the differences between public discourse in different countries. We can learn from each other, as an informed global citizenry, [which] is vital to combatting the virus."This visualization shows the progression of US media coverage relating to COVID-19 between early January and early May. Other areas in the world, such as Mainland China and the United Kingdom, can be viewed here.Since recovering, Betke has been working closely with Guo to monitor worldwide news about the crisis with their artificial intelligence system, paying especially close attention to the framing of the newsmeaning, the angle a reporter takes. Guo says more analysis is needed before drawing definitive conclusions from their current datasets, which they will be expanding in the coming weeks and months, but potential findings have already begun to emerge.For instance, their algorithm has confirmed that at the start of the outbreak, between January and early March, global media attention was largely focused on the virus's spread in China.Guo says data also suggests that, initially, news stories in China, South Korea, the United States, and the United Kingdom were framed around scientific research, frontline healthcare workers, and the domestic and global outbreaks. But soon, according to their data, Guo and Betke saw the media's focus, in all four countries, shift to domestic and international economic consequences and financial fallouta topic that has largely remained a focus in most of the countries they analyzed."The US and other countries [have been very focused] on the economic consequences of the pandemic," says Guo. As cases started to rise in the US, "[news] shifted from international economic consequences to domestic economic consequences." In the week of May 9, for instance, coverage on the domestic economy accounted for 26 percent of all coronavirus-related coverage.Their data has also revealed that news stories about how to take personal preventive actions, like social distancing and adhering to stay-at-home orders, have consistently been a topical focus of news outlets in the US."This is a very controversial topic here in US coverage," says Guo, referring to stay-at-home orders that have drawn protesters in states including Michigan, Georgia, Massachusetts, and others. "This could be because American culture values individual freedom, combined with a decentralized government, possibly making mandatory preventive actions harder to implement here."During the week of May 10 to May 16, for example, the top three new subjects in American media coverage of the pandemic were "personal preventive actions," taking up 19 percent of the news, closely followed by "domestic economic consequences," and "government responses and actions."Personal preventive action also took up 19 percent of news coverage during that same week in the UK. Meanwhile, South Korean news emphasized the importance of using masks, but veered away from reporting on social distancing or other personal preventive actions that were the centerpieces of the recommendations from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In mainstream media in China, which is controlled by the Chinese government, news reports on how individual actions can fight the pandemic have been significantly lower in number compared to news about how government action has helped control the virus's spread.Betke and Guo will soon start to include data from additional countries and regions impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including Germany and Egypt, with the help of artificially intelligent language-translation software developed by BU computer scientist, Derry Wijaya, an expert on automated cross-lingual text processing and another principal investigator of the AIEM research group."Examining the correlation between news coverage of COVID-19 and the actual confirmed cases and deaths will shed light on the role the news media [has played] in this global pandemic," says Guo.Guo says the data could reveal best practices for news organizations and journalists to bring adequate awareness to future public health crises. Did framing stories around government advisories, economic consequences, or the extent of the global COVID-19 outbreak raise the most public awareness of the pandemic, thus reducing the infection rate?"News media can influence public opinion and even behavior, and previous research has found an association between news media reporting and health-related consequences," Guo says.Load-Date: July 11, 2020End of Document

Trump's billboard on TikTok's hit already reaches 5 million Americans on FacebookCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 24, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 522 wordsBodyU.S. President Donald Trump's re-election campaign is under pressure on TikTok, the application of china's ByteDance that Washington sees as one more tool of Beijing's espionage. The Republican team has already invested about $80,000 in ads for Facebook and Instagram where it warns voters that they are being watched."TikTok is spying on you" reads one of them where it alleges that the application has been caught red handed by monitoring its users.The company itself has criticized Facebook for running these ads accusing the world's largest social network of making money through a political campaign that attacks a competitor, just as that of Menlo Park, California, is preparing to launch services similar to TikTok.Instagram plans to release a new service in the coming weeks that will copy much of the features already offered by TikTok via Instagram Reels, which will allow users to make 15-second video clips with music.TikTok has argued that some of its most suspicious practices, such as the alleged surveillance of users' keystrokes, was actually "a feature designed to identify repetitive and unwanted behaviors" and not an intentional invasion of privacy. However, the company faces intense scrutiny from the us government and lawmakers in the face of concerns that China could force it to hand over user data.Earlier this month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US was shuffling the ban on multiple Chinese social media apps, including TikTok, just like India did last June. He also commended the Americans not to use the app unless they wanted their data to end up in "the hands of the Chinese Communist Party."For its part, last October, the US Senate requested an assessment of the national security risks posed by TikTok and other content platforms based in the Asian giant. However, the company argues that DATA from US users is stored on servers in the US and Singapore, not In China. Still, it should be remembered, as the Trump administration has already banned the operations of Chinese tech companies such as Huawei and ZTE citing the same general privacy concerns.Meanwhile, diplomatic tensions between the world's two largest economies continue to rise to unseen decades. The Trump administration has forced the Chinese government to close its consulate general in Houston, Texas, citing espionage activities. China has responded by closing the US consulate in Chengdu.So far, in the five days from July 17 to 21, the three accounts linked to the Trump campaign: their official Facebook and Instagram pages, the official pages of their Vice President Mike Pence, and the pages of the Trump Team, an organizing committee, have posted up to 450 separate ads criticizing TikTok, claiming that it spies users and derives their data to China.According to Data from Facebook, these ads have already reached 5.5 million Americans and are primarily targeted at younger audiences in states such as Texas and Florida. TheMost-watched ad released by the Trump campaign is a 30-second video that replaces the TikTok logo with an Asian man using binoculars.commentsforum0WhatsApp  Facebook  Twitter  Linkedin       Load-Date: July 25, 2020End of Document

World Health Organization Hired PR Firm To Identify Celebrity 'Influencers' To Amplify Virus MessagingThe Daily CallerJuly 17, 2020 Friday 06:24 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: DAILY-CALLER-NEWS-FOUNDATION; usLength: 775 wordsByline: Chuck Ross, Investigative Reporter, chuck@dailycaller.comChuck Ross is a reporter at The Daily Caller.Author ImageBodyLink to Image• The World Health Organization hired a high-powered public relations firm to seek out so-called influencers to help build trust in the organization's coronavirus response.• WHO paid $135,000 to the firm Hill and Knowlton Strategies, according to documents filed under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. • WHO has come under intense scrutiny for amplifying the Chinese government's false claims about the coronavirus. • Hill and Knowlton proposed identifying celebrities and other social media users with clout to 'amplify' WHO's messaging about the pandemic.Amid scrutiny over its response to the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization in early May hired an American public relations firm to burnish its image, including through identifying so-called “influencers” to help amplify messaging about COVID-19.According to documents filed with the Justice Department this week, WHO inked a $135,000 contract on May 1 with Hill and Knowlton Strategies to craft a public messaging strategy.“There has been criticism and assertions leveled against the World Health Organization (WHO) and media coverage that could undermine WHO as a trusted and critical information source on global public health issues,” Hill and Knowlton wrote in its proposal to WHO.The contract earmarked $30,000 for “influencer identification,” $65,000 for “message testing,” and $40,000 for a “campaign plan framework.”Hill and Knowlton, which registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, proposed identifying three tiers of influencers: celebrities with large social media followings, individuals with smaller but more engaged followings, and “hidden heroes,” those users with slight followings but who “nevertheless shape and guide conversations.”Link to ImageWorld Health Organization director general Tedros Adhanom (L) shakes hands with Chinese President Xi jinping before a meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on January 28, 2020. (NAOHIKO HATTA/AFP via Getty Images)The celebrity influencers would be used “for greater amplification of WHO messaging,” according to Hill and Knowlton's proposal, which was first reported by The Daily Beast.“Covid-19 has dominated day-to-day conversations, but not all voices are equal and not all are cutting through and being listened to,” the prospectus reads.After a phase of identifying influencers and message testing, Hill and Knowlton proposed making recommendations to WHO to “help ensure science and public health message credibility from the WHO in order to ensure there is trust in the WHO's advice and that public health guidance is followed.”WHO has come under intense scrutiny, especially in the United States, for a series of inaccurate assessments of the coronavirus pandemic.On Jan. 14, WHO amplified claims from the Chinese government that coronavirus was not transmitted through human-to-human contact. WHO officials also said in February that there was little evidence that people without symptoms were transmitting the virus. (RELATED: China's Propaganda Machine Loves WHO Official Bruce Aylward) Both claims have proved wildly inaccurate, with some health experts saying that WHO's inaccurate statements have hindered the global response to the pandemic.“When you look at what WHO did I think they set us back a great deal because they made countries believe if just a few countries that were going to get this would just do the containment work, we could stop it,” Dr. Michael Osterholm, a leading epidemiologist, said in an interview in late March.“Many of us were incredibly disappointed, for lack of a better word, in the WHO and its response,” Osterholm added.President Donald Trump said in April that he would stop funding WHO because of its handling of the pandemic.“The WHO's reliance on China's disclosures likely caused a twenty-fold increase in cases worldwide, and it may be much more than that,” Trump said on April 14.The administration notified WHO on July 6 that it will withdraw its membership next year.Hill and Knowlton said in the filing that it registered as a foreign agent of WHO “as a matter of prudence.” WHO receives funding from member-states and private organizations. The United States is by far the largest contributor to WHO's budget, contributing more than $400 million each year.Hill and Knowlton said that the contract with WHO was set to expire on June 15, but that its work is ongoing.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The companies are blocked in mainland China due to the autocratic government's so-called 'Great Firewall,' but operate freely in semi-autonomous Hong Kong.TikTok is owned and operated by China-based ByteDance.  ByteDance owns a similar app called Douyin which is available on mainland China, where TikTok is unavailable.  TikTok has long denied that its data can be accessed by the Chinese government, as its servers are located entirely outside of China.But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Monday the United States is considering banning TikTok and other Chinese social media apps due to privacy concerns.The law, which went into effect last week, calls for the central government to establish a national security office in Hong Kong aimed at confronting subversion of state power, terrorism, separatism and collusion with foreign forces.  The new law was a response to the massive and often violent pro-democracy demonstrations that engulfed the financial hub in the latter half of 2019.Critics say the measure effectively ends the 'One Country, Two Systems' policy under which Hong Kong was promised a high degree of autonomy after the handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997.

Continue reading Zoom promises its first transparency report later this yearCEO Eric Yuan made the commitment in an update on its 90-day security programZoom committed to sharing its first transparency report later this year in a blog by CEO Eric Yuan tracking the progress of its 90-day feature freeze to address privacy and security issues. The      freeze, which was announced on April 1st, was put in place after Zoom usage went up dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic, which revealed numerous privacy and security flaws in the      videoconferencing software. We have made significant progress defining the framework and approach for a transparency report that details information related to requests Zoom receives for data, records, or content,  said      Yuan in today s blog.  We look forward to providing the fiscal Q2 data in our first report later this year.  A Zoom spokesperson declined to comment when asked for more detail about the planned      release timeline.In his blog, Yuan also pointed to a recently created guide detailing how the company responds to government requests for Zoom data, the types of data that Zoom collects, the company s data      retention practices, and more. Zoom has also updated its privacy policies,  mostly to make them easier to understand,  according to Yuan, and it created a separate California Privacy Rights      Statement section in those policies.ZOOM HAS COME UNDER SCRUTINY FOR HOW IT HANDLES GOVERNMENT REQUESTSZoom has come under scrutiny for how it has handled requests for data in the past. Recently, the company suspended one account in Hong Kong and two in the US for hosting meetings commemorating      the Tiananmen Square massacre after the Chinese government informed Zoom of the meetings. Zoom later reinstated the accounts and said it was developing technology that would let the company      remove or block individual participants based on geography. That technology, had it been available, may have allowed Zoom to block participants from mainland China from attending the meetings      instead of shutting down the entire meeting.The advocacy group Access Now wrote an open letter calling on Zoom to release a transparency report on March 19th, but it criticized the company s decision announced today to publish a report      later this year. Though it is commendable that Zoom has taken steps over the last 90 days to update some of its security and privacy practices, the decision to delay the transparency report signals that Zoom      does not prioritize reporting,  said Isedua Oribhabor, a US policy analyst for Access Now, in a statement to The Verge.  The pressure that Zoom has faced from the Chinese government to restrict      accounts underscores just why a transparency report is essential   without it, users have no insight into the extent of government interference with their accounts and data or the steps Zoom      takes to push back. ZOOM HAS MADE MANY OTHER MOVES SINCE INSTITUTING THE 90-DAY FEATURE FREEZEYuan s blog covered many other moves the company has made since instituting the 90-day feature freeze, including a commitment to offer end-to-end encryption for all users, turning meeting      passwords on by default, giving users the ability to pick which data center calls are routed from, consulting with Alex Stamos and other security experts, enhancing its bug bounty program,      launching a CISO council, and working with third parties to help test the security of its products. Going forward, we have put mechanisms in place to make sure that security and privacy remain a priority in each phase of our product and feature development,  Yuan said.See Campaign:https://blog.zoom.us/ceo-report-90-days-done-whats-next-for-zoom/Contact Information:Jay PetersTags:, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: August 11, 2020End of Document

Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Market Worth $29.7 Billion by 2027- Exclusive Report Covering Pre and Post COVID-19 Market Analysis by Meticulous Research®PR NewswireJuly 22, 2020 Wednesday 8:08 AM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2312 wordsDateline: LONDON, July 22, 2020 BodyPR NewswireAccording to a new market research report titled,"Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Market by Type (Plug-in, Wireless), Component (Hardware, Software), Bus Charging Infrastructure, Connector (CCS, CHAdeMO, GB/T, Tesla Supercharger), Installation, and End User- Global Forecast to 2027",the electric vehicle charging stations market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 39.8% from 2020 to reach $29.7 billion by 2027. In terms of volume, this market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 31.8% from 2020 to reach 15,025.5 thousand units by 2027.Download Free Sample Report Now @ https://www.meticulousresearch.com/download-sample-report/cp_id=5078Electric vehicles (EVs) are a rapidly growing concept within the automotive industry owing to the improved technology, customer inclination towards minimizing carbon footprints, and government policy incentives. Currently, the electric vehicle industry is undergoing a technological transformation with two-fold objectives to improve vehicle range with charging infrastructure. Electric vehicle automakers are investing heavily in charging station infrastructure in order to support their long-range battery electric vehicles. Government incentives, subsidies, and funding for the installation of charging stations and automakers' initiatives for charging infrastructure development are the key factors driving the growth of the global electric vehicle charging stations market. However, the high cost of fast-charging stations; stringent rules for installation; and complex charging infrastructure will obstruct the growth of this market to some extent.Impact of COVID-19 on the electric vehicle charging stations marketAmong the most exposed verticals to the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, the automotive & transportation industry is currently facing unprecedented uncertainty. The COVID-19 is projected to dramatically affect the supply chain and the market for goods in the automotive sector. The concern of the industry has shifted from focusing on China's supply chain disruption to the overall slump in demand for automotive products. Commercial vehicle demand is expected to plummet with all non-essential services being shut down. Furthermore, shifts in consumer purchasing behavior due to uncertainty surrounding the pandemic may have significant consequences for the industry's near-future growth. Meanwhile, shortfall and cash crunch have already affected fleet operators' sales, which is expected to widen further in the coming months.However, the electric vehicle production seems to be somewhat less affected by the pandemic as predicted production levels for EVs in 2020 are expected to be more or less similar to that in 2019. As a result, the demand for EV infrastructure is not expected to be significantly disrupted due to the current pandemic, since electric vehicles and its associated charging infrastructure and sales originates from China, which has recovered from the pandemic to sustain its global dominance in terms of EV production. The Chinese government has also announced stimulus packages toward boosting the development of a network of electric vehicle charging stations.Speak to our Analysts to Understand the Impact of COVID-19 on Your Business: https://www.meticulousresearch.com/speak-to-analyst/cp_id=5078The electric vehicle adoption rate is growing, and many countries across the globe are investing heavily in research and development. Countries such as Canada, Australia, India, the Netherlands, and Germany have launched numerous programs to promote the adoption of electric vehicles. The government incentive programs for the future would assist the energy industry to solve the economic crisis triggered by COVID-19 through significant investments in charging facilities. Hence, most of the governments in these regions have used rehabilitation of infrastructure as an economic stimulus during COVID-19.The global electric vehicle charging stations market study presents historical market data in terms of value and volume (2018 and 2019), estimated current data (2020), and forecasts for 2027. The market is segmented on the basis of type, component, bus charging infrastructure, Connector, installation, and end-user. The study also evaluates industry competitors and analyses the market at the country level. Based on the charging station type, the plug-in charging stations segment is estimated to account for the largest share of the overall electric vehicle charging stations market in 2020. The growth in this segment is mainly driven by the government and automakers initiatives to expand the level 3 plug-in charging station infrastructure. However, the wireless charging stations market is expected to witness rapid growth during the forecast period. The rapid growth of this segment is primarily attributed to the automaker's initiatives for the development of wireless charging stations technology and government funding for the installation of the wireless charging stations.Further, the plug-in charging stations market is further segmented into level 1 charging station, level 2 charging station, and level 3 charging station. The level 3 charging station segment is estimated to command the largest share of the plug-in electric vehicle charging stations market in 2020. The large share of this segment is mainly attributed to the factors such as rising government initiatives for the installation of fast-charging stations; rebate on the purchase of level 3 charging stations; growing investment by automakers in level 3 charging stations in order to support their long-range battery electric vehicle; and advantage of faster charging than other types of charging stations.Based on bus charging infrastructure, the off-board top-down pantograph segment is estimated to command the largest share of the overall electric vehicle charging stations market in 2020, which is mainly attributed to its fast, reliable, and versatile operation as it consists of one charging terminal that adds a lot of flexibility to eBus service since the off-board charging infrastructure can be used by several buses per hour, even of different manufacturers. However, the on-board bottom-up pantograph segment is estimated to witness rapid growth during the forecast period. The on-board bottom-up pantograph charging solution is a fast-charging system mainly used for the charging of electric buses in cities with existing DC networks, such as for tramways. The key factor driving the growth of this segment include increasing adoption of electric buses in countries such as China and the United States over the past years.Quick Buy – Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Market Research Report: https://www.meticulousresearch.com/buy_now.php?pformat=325&vformat=964 Based on connector type, the GB/T segment is estimated to command the largest share of the overall electric vehicle charging stations market in 2020. The largest share of this market is mainly attributed to the fact that China's dominating position in the charging station market, where GB/T is the most common type of charging station connector standard. However, the Combined Charging System (CCS) segment is expected to grow with the fastest CAGR during the forecast period. This is primarily attributed to the increasing preference by major U.S. and European automakers such as BMW  (Germany), Tesla (U.S.),  Daimler AG (Germany), FCA (U.K), Ford (U.S.), Jaguar (U.K.), General Motors (U.S.), Group  PSA (France), MG (U.K.), Polestar (Canada), Renault (France), and Volkswagen Group (Germany). Based on installation type, the fixed charging stations segment is estimated to account for the largest share of the overall electric vehicle charging stations market in 2020, mainly due to the rising focus of government agencies on providing funds to charging station OEMs for the development of charging stations. Moreover, the growing collaborations among various industry stakeholders such as charging station OEMs, electric vehicle manufacturers, charging network operators, corporates, and utility service providers to deploy fast-charging stations, expand their geographical presence, and enable cost-effective deployment of charging network further supports the growth of this segment. However, the portable charger segment is expected to be the fastest-growing market during the forecast period.Geographically, the Asia Pacific region is estimated to command the largest share of the overall electric vehicle charging stations market in 2020. Also, Asia Pacific region is expected to witness a rapid growth during the forecast period. The rapid growth of this region is mainly driven by the high adoption of electric vehicles in countries such as China and Japan, owing to the electrification of the automotive industry along with the initiatives for setting up charging infrastructure. For instance, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China announced its new energy vehicle (NEV) quota in September 2017, requiring all car manufacturers in the country with over 30,000 annual vehicle sales to produce 10% new electric vehicles in 2019 and 12% in 2020. In addition, countries such as South Korea and India are taking initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by increasing the adoption rate of electric vehicles. For instance, on 1 April 2019, the government of India launched the second phase of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles and its associated charging infrastructure.The report also includes extensive assessment of the key strategic developments adopted by the leading market participants in the industry over the past 4 years (2016–2019). The electric vehicle charging stations market has witnessed a number of products launches in recent years. For instance, in September 2019, ChargePoint launched its most powerful, fastest and versatile home charger, ChargePoint Home Flex, which can deliver power up to 50 amps. It also offers a unique combination of speed and versatility, making it the most flexible home charger. Similarly, in October 2018, Webasto had launched its two new smart charging solutions: Webasto Live for the European market and Webasto TurboDX for the American and Asian markets. These new solutions allow flexible networking through a mobile network app.The global electric vehicle charging stations market is consolidated and dominated by few major players, namely ABB (Switzerland), ChargePoint, Inc.

TikTok To Exit Hong Kong; U.S. Mulls Tire: ReportsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 7, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 344 wordsBody       The United States is looking at banning TikTok, the China-based short form video app, which has been banned recently by India citing threat to national security.Meanwhile, Reuters reported that TikTok, owned by Chinela's ByteDance, has decided to exit Hong Kong Market after China established a new national security Law for the semi-autonomous city. According to TikTok, the decision was because it was not clear if Hong Kong would now fall entirely under China.As part of its strategy to appeal to wider global audience, the app's design doesn't allow access by mainland China. For China, ByteDance operates a short short video sharing app called Douyin.The U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, during an interview with Fox News, said the country is very seriously looking at banning TikTok and other Chinese social media apps.Pompeo added that people should only download the app if they want their private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.Responding to Pomxo's comments, a TikTok spokesperson reportedly said, "TikTok is led by an American CEO, with hundreds of employees and key leaders across safety, security, product, and public policy here in the US. We have no higher priority than promoting a safe and secure app experience for our users. We have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked. "Former Walt Disney Co. Executive Kevin Mayer is the Chief Operating Officer of ByteDance and Chief Executive Officer of TikTok. Bytedancy'S Mobile video app has said earlier that it would not comply with any of Chinese governance's requests to censor its content or access user data.TikTok recently entered the TOP 100 ranking in the world's most valuable brand for the first time and was ranked seventy ninth, according to an annual survey by consultancy firm Kantar.Concerned about national security, the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week banned 59 Chinese mobile applications like TikTok, SHAREiT, UC Browser and WeChat, after a border stand-off with the neighboring country.       Load-Date: July 8, 2020End of Document

Rep. Wright Issues Op-Ed to Washington TimesTargeted News ServiceJune 27, 2020 Saturday 8:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 883 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Ron Wright, R-Texas, issued the following op-ed on June 25, published in the Washington Times regarding the importance of passing the bipartisan AIR Security Act:Washington Times: Rep. Ron Wright: Stopping China's travel espionage in its tracksAlthough many Americans continue to see Russia as the United States' greatest foreign policy challenge, I believe the Communist Party of China (CCP) poses a far greater threat to our national security in the long run. Over the last decade, the Chinese government has ramped up its espionage efforts, predatory economic practices and strategic technology development in an attempt to directly challenge America's status as a global superpower.The United States has sounded the alarm on China's Belt and Road Initiative investments in Africa, Southeast Asia and Europe, but we have largely turned a blind eye to China's nefarious activities in our own backyard. Congress enacted important enhancements to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and our export controls in 2018, but we must do more to prevent China from infiltrating our critical infrastructure systems and supply chains.To get a better sense of the seriousness of this threat, look no further than the disastrous impact of allowing the China Railway Rolling Stock Corp. (CRRC) to enter the U.S. market. CRRC, which has used its CCP financial backing to become the world's largest rail-car producer, has been undercutting other passenger and freight rail-car manufacturers with unfairly low bids for projects across the United States.Beyond making it impossible for American and other companies to compete, CRRC's infiltration of our rail transportation infrastructure comes with serious counterintelligence and privacy consequences given the high-tech nature of new rail cars.What's worse is that many of the transit agencies were using taxpayer dollars to do business with the CRRC, meaning we were subsidizing the CCP's efforts to spy on us and put American companies out of business. Thankfully, lawmakers took note and passed legislation prohibiting the use of federal funds for the purchase of rail cars and buses from CCP-owned, controlled or subsidized companies and requiring transit agencies to adhere to cybersecurity guidelines in future procurements.Unfortunately, the CCP is not just targeting our rail infrastructure, but has also turned its focus to our aviation industry. Over the past few years, CIMC-Tianda, a Chinese-owned company convicted of industrial espionage in federal court, has repeatedly tried to partner with major U.S. transportation hubs, including Houston, Dallas, Miami and Boston, to sell its airplane passenger boarding bridges.Like rail cars, passenger boarding bridges increasingly feature technologies, such as facial recognition, with serious national security implications that necessitate greater scrutiny of foreign investment. Furthermore, if we allow CIMC-Tianda into our aviation supply chain, we can be sure that, like CRRC, they will undercut domestic producers at every turn in hopes that these American companies will eventually be forced to close shop.With Americans, domestic companies and major airports at risk, I teamed up with my fellow Texans, Sen. John Cornyn and Rep. Marc Veasey, to introduce the Airport Infrastructure Resources (AIR) Security Act. This critical legislation will ensure our hard-earned taxpayer dollars are not used to purchase passenger boarding bridges from companies that have previously violated intellectual property (IP) rights, as nearly all CCP-affiliated companies have, and are simply looking for yet another opportunity to put American companies out of business and steal from and spy on the American people.If anything, the COVID-19 pandemic has called attention to China's relentlessness and the need for America to secure its supply chains and critical infrastructure. On top of downplaying the severity of the virus, CCP leaders instituted new policies that restricted companies, such as 3M and Honeywell, from distributing much needed personal protective equipment (PPE) to the United States without prior approval. Chinese officials used these policies to hoard respirators, masks, gloves and other PPE equipment, all while putting on a facade of global unity.As we continue to integrate technology into our infrastructure, we must be wary of and resilient against attempts by China to infiltrate critical systems and carry out espionage and IP theft. After the last few months, we would be fools to think the CCP would not weaponize access to our critical infrastructure against us. We simply cannot afford for China to dominate our transportation supply chains the way we have empowered it to control PPE and pharmaceutical ingredients.Given the financial uncertainty facing many industries and risk that struggling American companies will be snapped up by opportunistic Chinese ones, I believe we must be especially vigilant. I applaud the president for his recent executive order, which will further protect the United States from IP and technology theft. Nevertheless, we must continue to implement additional safeguards in the months to come. Passing the AIR Security Act would a good place to start.Copyright Targeted News ServicesC20-RajeshS-7157998 C20-RajeshSLoad-Date: June 27, 2020End of Document

Boris Johnson doesn't want to catch it through HuaweiCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 17, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 585 wordsBodyThe darkness of reason is the optimal factory of conspiracy theories.Following the advance of the pandemic a group of Britons decided to destroy Huawei-owned internet broadcaster antennas believing that the new coronavirus spreads through the 5G signal waves.Stunned by the White House tenant and stunned by social media, a group of the global population believes that the Chinese government incubated the new coronavirus on the planet as if it were a nuclear bomb of slow destruction.Behind the cloud of misinformation is realpolitik. Gradually the curtain of the new normality is rising and you can already see the suspension of freedoms in Hong Kong (a country, a system) and the boycott of Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom to Huawei as if it were a Chinese embassy.Australia was the first country to block, in 2018, the Chinese company by considering that its 5G technology could serve espionage.The Trump administration has described Huawei as a threat to national security. For the past year, he has banned companies in his country from selling products such as semiconductors, and specifically to Google, giving it access to its smart telephony services.Angela Merkel will have to decide in September what will happen with Huawei's 5G. There are competing positions, between prioritizing security or trade relations with China. In France, there is currently no general veto on Huawei, but operators using their technology will only receive eight-year operating permits, a limit that will not be imposed on rival suppliers such as Nokia or Ericsson.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said last year that Huawei would not encounter any barriers to entry into his country to install 5G technology. The new security law articulated by Beijing to implement it in Hong Kong, whose sole purpose is to end the dissent that, for more than a year, has not stopped taking to the streets to protest Beijing's interference in its freedoms.China has broken an agreement signed with the United Kingdom in 1997. It would have been 50 years before they could extend their legal framework to Hong Kong.Xi Jinping's government points to supposed dark forces from abroad as responsible for the destabilization process in Hong Kong, but it was Beijing, who through a proposed extradition law, detonated the unrest among the pro-democracy group.The pandemic crisis emboldened Xi Jinping not only to activate the extradition law but to bet on a greater goal: to eliminate the legal basis that bound China to Kong Kong, "one country, two systems."Boris Johnson has responded through two ways: offering Hong Kongers three million visas to move his residence to the UK and the boycott against Huawei.In the geopolitical sphere, the Chinese president has moved his pieces against the interests of the United States and the United Kingdom by taking advantage of the resentment that President Trump's foreign policy shows a clear weakness, and that Brexit has degraded the power of the British abroad.Beijing is also taking advantage of the re-enusable that the crisis of the new coronavirus has not been taken seriously by President Trump. The process of weakening your image is correlated with the death toll caused by the virus. The most shocking thing is that to this day there is no Trump sensibility on the issue.

Pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong called on the world to support Hong Kong following China's imposition of a national security law, as authorities ordered schools to withdraw books to violate the new provisions."We have to let the world know that now is the time to support Hong Kong," said Wong, 23.China enacted a new security law last week that suppresses subversion, secession or collusion with foreign forces."You cannot ignore or silence the voice of the people of Hong Kong. With the conviction that the people of Hong Kong will fight for their freedom, we will never surrender to Beijing," Wong added outside the court where he is tried for his involvement in last year's pro-democracy revolts.Meanwhile, Facebook, Twitter and Google announced they will no longer respond to requests from the government and Hong Kong authorities for information from their users."We suspend the government's review of hong Kong user data while awaiting a more in-depth assessment of the national security law," a Facebook spokesman said.For its part, WhatsApp noted that "people have the right to have a private conversation online."Meanwhile, the Hong Kong government ordered schools to withdraw books that may violate China's national security law last week.School principals and teachers "should examine educational material, including books" and "withdraw them if they find outdated content that matches the four types of violations" defined by the law, the Pro-Chinese government's Department of Education announced.On the other hand, China's ambassador to London accused the Uk of "serious interference in China's internal affairs" for its response to the law.Boris Johnson announced last week that it will offer hong Kong residents easier access to British citizenship, paving the way for more than 3 million Hong Kongers to settle in the UK.Chinese authorities also issued a warning to Canada after sanctions announced by Ottawa.On Friday, Canada suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong to protest the new law, as well as its exports of military equipment deemed "sensitive" to this semi-autonomous territory.Yesterday, in another court, the hearing of the first person who was prosecuted for crimes under the new security law was held.Tong Ying-kit, 23, was charged with terrorism and incitement to secession, and was pre-emptively arrested.Police that the suspect, who was carrying a pro-democracy flag, threw his motorbike at a group of policemen.Load-Date: July 8, 2020End of Document

TikTok to withdraw from Hong Kong and US consider banning social networkCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 7, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 273 wordsBodyMADRID (Portaltic/EP) - Music social network TikTok said it will retire in the coming days of Hong Kong, while US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the U.S. government is considering banning Chinese enforcement.TikTok confirmed on Monday that it will withdraw its platform from Google and Apple apps in Hong Kong, after Beijing authorities passed the new National Security Act last week."In light of recent developments, we have decided to halt operations of the TikTok app in Hong Kong," a spokesperson for the social network told Axios.ByteDance, TikTok's parent company has tried to distance itself from its Chinese competitor. The company has assured that TikTok has not shared or shared data with the Chinese government, which would be difficult to achieve under the new standard.EU studies banFor his part, Pompeo noted in an interview for Fox News that the United States is "studying" the ban on Chinese social media applications, including TikTok, stressing that "we are taking this very seriously."The secretary of state has warned Americans to be careful when using TikTok, as Pompeo has pointed out that his private information could remain "in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party."Pompeo's statements and TikTok's decision to withdraw the platform from Hong Kong comes after the Indian government announced a ban on more than 50 applications from China on 29 June, including TikTok.As the Indian Ministry of Information Technology emphasized, the blocking of these applications is due to the "related nature of activities detrimental to India's sovereignty and integrity, its defense, and state security and public order."Load-Date: July 8, 2020End of Document

Business HighlightsAssociated Press InternationalJuly 16, 2020 Thursday 9:06 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 1254 wordsByline: The Associated PressBody___Netflix promotes content chief to co-CEO; adds 10M new subsNEW YORK (AP) — Netflix added a flood of new subscribers amid the coronavirus pandemic and also offered clues to a possible successor for founding CEO Reed Hastings, who on Thursday named the company’s chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, as co-CEO. The company picked up 10.1 million worldwide subscribers during the April-June period, more than triple what it usually adds in that period. The increase announced Thursday with Netflix’s second-quarter earnings eclipsed the gain of 8.3 million subscribers projected among analysts polled by FactSet. Netflix ended June with 193 million worldwide subscribers, including 70 million in the U.S. and Canada, its largest geographic market.___Rising coronavirus infections threaten US economic recoveryBALTIMORE (AP) — Rising coronavirus infections across dozens of states are threatening the U.S. economic recovery. The virus is forcing businesses and consumers to freeze spending and keeping the unemployment rate stubbornly high. The government reported Thursday that retail sales rose a sharp 7.5% in June, but the positive trend was undercut by more recent data showing that credit card spending has stalled. A separate report showed that more than a million Americans sought unemployment benefits last week — a sign that companies continue to cut jobs as the virus slashes through the heavily populated Sunbelt.___China becomes first economy to grow since virus pandemicBEIJING (AP) — China has become the first major economy to grow since the start of the coronavirus pandemic after anti-virus lockdowns were lifted and factories and stores reopened. The world’s second-largest economy expanded by 3.2% over a year earlier in the quarter ending in June. That was a dramatic improvement over the previous quarter’s 6.8% contraction that was China’s worst performance since at least the mid-1960s. But it still was the weakest positive figure since China started reporting quarterly growth in the early 1990s. China, where the coronavirus pandemic began in December, was the first economy to shut down and the first to start the drawn-out process of recovery in March after the ruling Communist Party declared the disease under control.___Pelosi urges Trump to ‘ask for directions’ on virus crisisWASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is comparing President Donald Trump to “the man who refuses to ask for directions.” She is pleading with the White House to seek input from the nation’s scientific leaders to reverse the rise in coronavirus cases and deaths. Tensions are rising as Congress considers the next virus relief package with no apparent endgame in sight to the pandemic that now threatens longer-term economic and societal turmoil that first envisioned. Senate Republicans are poised to come out with their next COVID-19 aid bill as early as next week. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is readying the GOP’s $1 trillion package, a counteroffer to the $3 trillion proposal that House Democrats approved in May.___Experts say Twitter breach troubling, undermines trustHONG KONG (AP) — Experts say a breach in Twitter’s security that allowed hackers to break into the accounts of leaders and technology moguls is one of the worst attacks in recent years and may shake trust in a platform politicians and CEOs use to communicate with the public. The ruse discovered Wednesday included bogus tweets from Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Mike Bloomberg and a number of tech billionaires. Hackers used social engineering to target some of Twitter’s employees and then gained access to the high-profile accounts, sending out tweets in an apparent Bitcoin scam. The FBI is now investigating the massive hack.___Barr says US now overly reliant on Chinese goods, servicesWASHINGTON (AP) — Attorney General William Barr says the United States has become overly reliant on Chinese goods and services. Examples include face masks, medical gowns and other protective equipment designed to curb the spread of coronavirus. He’s also accusing hackers linked to the Chinese government of targeting American universities and companies to steal research related to vaccine development. The attorney general spoke just hours after Western agencies made similar claims against Beijing. Barr’s address at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum is part of a full-court press by the Trump administration to outline what officials see as Beijing’s burgeoning economic threat to the U.S.___Homeowners rush to refinance as 30-year rate falls below 3%LOS ANGELES (AP) — With 30-year mortgage rates falling this week to a half-century low, U.S. homeowners are seizing on the chance to refinance their home loans. Refinancings from January through April more than doubled compared to the same stretch in 2019, according to real estate data company CoreLogic. “Cash-out” refinancing, in which homeowners withdraw equity from their home’s value, rose more than 70% in that period. Refinancing is outpacing home purchase loans, partly because job losses and economic uncertainty have put off would-be buyers and sellers. Economists predict the lending spree will continue while mortgage rates remain near all-time lows into next year.___Stocks dip on Wall Street as global rally fades, led by techNEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street drifted to a lower close Thursday after mixed reports on the economy highlighted its uncertain path, including one showing that layoffs continue at a stubbornly steady pace. The S&P 500 lost 0.3%, following up on declines across Europe and Asia, as a worldwide rally faded. Travel-related stocks led the S&P 500 to its first loss in three days as cruise-ship operators, airlines and hotels gave up chunks of their big gains from a day earlier. Drops for Microsoft and other tech titans also weighed particularly heavily because they’re the largest stocks in the index. Treasury yields fell.___EU court cancels US data-sharing pact over snooping concernsThe European Union’s top court has ruled that an agreement that allows big tech companies to transfer data to the United States is invalid, and that national regulators need to take tougher action to protect the privacy of users’ data. Thursday’s ruling does not mean an immediate halt to all data transfers outside the EU, as there is another legal mechanism that some companies can use. But it means that the scrutiny over data transfers will be ramped up and that the EU and U.S. may have to find a new system that guarantees that Europeans’ data is afforded the same privacy protection in the U.S. as it is in the EU.___Tesla tries to assure workers there’s no big virus outbreakDETROIT (AP) — Tesla is trying to assure its 55,000 employees that there hasn’t been a big coronavirus outbreak at company facilities worldwide, despite a report by an industry website that over 130 Tesla employees or contractors have tested positive. The company says in an email to workers that since January, it has had fewer than 10 cases of the virus that causes COVID-19 that were transmitted in the workplace. But the email confirmed reports that Tesla is looking into more than 130 positive tests among employees, including those who got the virus outside of Tesla facilities.___The S&P 500 fell 10.99 points, or 0.3%, to 3,215.57. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 135.39 points, or 0.5%, to 26,734.71. The Nasdaq Composite slid 76.66 points, or 0.7%, to 10,473.83.

COTTON BILL TO SUPPORT SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING IN U.S.States News ServiceJune 26, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1032 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton:Senators Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas), Chuck Schumer (D-New York), Josh Hawley (R-Missouri), Jack Reed (D-Rhode Island), James Risch (R-Idaho), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Angus King (I-Maine), and Doug Jones (D-Alabama) have introduced the American Foundries Act of 2020, a bill that supports the production and development of microelectronics in the United States. The Senators aim to include the bill as an amendment in this year's National Defense Authorization Act.Bill text may be found here. Additional details may be found below."The United States revolutionized the microelectronics industry, which is essential to our safety and security today. But by ceding semiconductor manufacturing and development to countries like China, the United States has fallen behind and given the Chinese Communist Party dangerous leverage over our nation's future. Our bill invests in the microelectronics industry here in America, where it belongs," said Cotton."America's technological advantage played a decisive role in our victory in the Cold War, and it will be equally important to our ability to outcompete China over the coming decades. This bill strengthens that advantage by bringing semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States, and it does so in a way that will create jobs and revitalize communities across our nation," said Hawley."As home to one of the world's foremost chip designers, Idaho has played a key role in the United States' leadership in the semiconductor industry, driving forward our world-class innovation," said Risch. "With the Chinese Communist Party's continued efforts to dominate the rest of the world's microelectronics industries through theft and coercion, it is critical that we work swiftly to strengthen domestic production of semiconductors and maintain our strategic competitive edge.""Semiconductors are not only essential to keeping our country on the cutting edge of technology, but are also vital to maintaining our national security," said Collins. "Although the U.S. semiconductor industry has been an international leader for decades, aggressive incentives by foreign governments and unfair business practices have eroded America's dominance in this crucial sector. The targeted investments provided in our bill would help spur the research and development necessary to keep U.S. semiconductor companies at the forefront of the industry while also preserving the good-paying, high-tech manufacturing jobs they create.""America's technological prowess is a key source of economic innovation, and a vital building block of our national security we cannot and must not undercut either by outsourcing the manufacturing of semiconductors," said King. "We need to be investing in these capabilities, to ensure that we are able to remain leaders in the world of microelectronics and to support good, high-paying jobs in communities across the country.""Our nation is in an economic crisis. Investing in microelectronics manufacturing and the semiconductor industry will create high paying manufacturing jobs for hard working Americans at a time when our country needs it most. The American Foundries Act of 2020 would expand our advanced manufacturing workforce and invests in cutting edge research and development. Additionally, this bill helps to strengthen our microelectronic domestic supply chain, prioritize American owned businesses over foreign production, and keep our country safe," said Gillibrand.Background:The United States revolutionized the microelectronics industry, inventing many of the key technologies that drive the economy today. However, it is at risk of falling behind in manufacturing or "fabricating" semiconductors at home as countries in Asia, especially China, have made significant investments in their microelectronics sectors. Seventy-eight percent of cutting-edge wafer fabrication capacity is now located in Asia; North America fell behind China in this benchmark for the first time in 2019.The American Foundries Act makes critical investments in commercial and defense-related microelectronics projects to ensure the United States remains a world leader in the industry. The bill includes the following measures:Support for Commercial Microelectronics Projects: Authorizes the Department of Commerce to award $15 billion in grants to states to assist in the "construction, expansion, or modernization ... of microelectronics fabrication, assembly, test, advanced packaging, or advanced research and development facilities."Support for Secure Microelectronics Projects: Authorizes the Department of Defense to award $5 billion in grants "for the creation, expansion, or modernization of one or more commercially competitive and sustainable microelectronics manufacturing or advanced research and development facilities capable of producing measurably secure and specialized microelectronic" for defense and intelligence purposes. This funding may go to primarily commercial facilities capable of producing secure microelectronics.RandD Funding: Authorizes $5 billion in RandD spending to secure U.S. leadership in microelectronics. Requires agencies that receive this funding to "develop policies to require domestic production, to the extent possible, for any intellectual property resulting from microelectronics research and development as a result of these funds."$2 billion for DARPA's Electronics Resurgence Initiative$1.5 billion for the National Science Foundation$1.25 billion for the Department of Energy$250 million for the National Institute of Standards and TechnologyNational Microelectronics Research Plan: Establishes a subcommittee of the President's Council on Science and Technology to produce a report each year "to guide and coordinate funding for breakthroughs in next-generation microelectronics research and technology, strengthen the domestic microelectronics workforce, and encourage collaboration between government, industry, and academia."Safeguards: Prohibits firms owned, controlled or otherwise influence by the Chinese government from accessing funds provided by the legislation.###Load-Date: June 26, 2020End of Document

Peters:U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI) helped advance the bipartisan annual national defense bill to the full Senate, voting to give servicemembers a pay increase and greater access to benefits, and for measures to strengthen our national security and support Michigan's defense sector."From serving on the frontlines of the Coronavirus pandemic to leading innovative projects at testing facilities throughout the state, Michiganders have continually displayed the unique skillsets and dedication that are critical to our national security," said Senator Peters, a former Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy Reserve and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. "I was proud to help advance this bill that would give our servicemembers a raise and includes provisions I authored to ensure servicemembers receive increased access to important benefits, strengthen key alliances, protect our medical supply chain and support cutting-edge defense manufacturers in every corner of our state."The National Defense Authorization Act, which sets annual policy for the Department of Defense (DOD), has been enacted into law for 59 consecutive years. The following provisions Peters led or supported were included in the Senate Armed Services Committee-approved bill:Supporting Our Troops and Their Families:Pay Raise for Troops: This bill includes a 3% pay increase for all servicemembers that Peters supported.Ensuring National Guardsmen, Reservists and Their Families Receive the Benefits They Have Earned: The bill builds on a provision Peters secured in last year's defense bill to ensure members of the National Guard and Reserves receive a record of service following their retirement. This year's provision will provide members of the National Guard and Reserve components a "Certificate of Military Service" that summarizes their record of service and will be the same form received by servicemembers from the active component of the Armed Forces. This type of form, which is currently labeled a DD-214 form, is usually required by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and other private sector organizations to unlock certain benefits.Promoting Youth STEM Education Programs in Michigan: This bill authorizes $15 million for STARBASE, a DOD Youth Program that promotes STEM education. Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Harrison Township is home to the first STARBASE program, which specifically provides K-12 students unique experiences in experiential learning, simulations and experiments in aviation and space-related fields.Supporting JROTC STEM Programs: The bill includes a measure Peters supported to form a grant program for Junior ROTC organizations that focus on STEM education, including cyber security training.Strengthening Our National Security:Protecting Our Medical Supply Chain: As Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Peters released a 2019 report identifying the national security risks of our country's overreliance on foreign sources for critical medications and medical supplies including adversaries like China. Peters sponsored an amendment that was adopted to require the Government Accountability Office to assess the Department of Defense's current pharmaceutical and medical device contracts and identify opportunities to invest in domestic advanced manufacturing capacity for these items.Bolstering Anti-Espionage Efforts: This bill contains a bipartisan amendment Peters co-authored to help universities protect critical defense research from espionage by our nation's adversaries, including the Chinese government. The amendment would specifically require high-ranking officials at universities that conduct sensitive defense research to receive briefings on the espionage risk to those projects.Funding the Pacific Deterrence Initiative: This bill authorizes $1.4 billion that Peters helped secure for the Pacific Deterrence Initiative, which works to defend American interests in the Indo-Pacific region against aggression and coercion by the Chinese government.Strengthening the U.S.-Israeli Defense Partnership: This bill includes an amendment Peters sponsored to establish a working group between the United States and Israel focused on developing defense technology. This builds upon Peters' bipartisan legislation to increase coordination on conducting research and developing technology to combat threats faced by both the United States and Israel.Bolstering America's Cybersecurity Defenses: The bill includes a provision based on legislation Peters introduced to develop pilot programs for the National Guard to provide remote cybersecurity support and technical assistance to states responding to cyber incidents. State and local governments increasingly find themselves targeted by high-profile cyber-attacks, costing taxpayers millions of dollars and threatening the data privacy of millions of Americans.Investing in Michigan's Defense Sector and Advanced Technology:Bolstering Missile Defense: The bill includes a requirement Peters supported for the DOD to study a layered approach to homeland missile defense. Peters offered an additional amendment requiring that study to include the possibility of locating any future missile defense sites at locations that have already been evaluated by the Department, including Fort Custer near Battle Creek.Cybersecurity Grants for Small and Medium Manufacturers: The bill contains an amendment Peters introduced to provide grants to Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) Centers to be used to assist small and medium manufacturers with meeting new federal cybersecurity standards which are set to be phased-in as a requirement starting this year. Peters has previously worked to strengthen and cement the MEP program and the Michigan Manufacturing and Technology Center (MMTC), which provides technical assistance to small and medium-sized manufacturers.Supporting Defense Research Initiatives at the Ground Vehicle Systems Center (GVSC): This bill authorizes an increase of $18 million Peters secured for projects currently underway at the Ground Vehicle Systems Center in Warren that are focused on modeling and simulation and unmanned capabilities, including immersive virtual modeling and simulation techniques, cyber and connected vehicle innovation research and virtual experimentations enhancement efforts.Prohibits the Retirement of the A-10 Warthog: This bill includes an amendment Peters cosponsored to prohibit retiring the A-10 in Fiscal Year 2021. The A-10 still plays an important role in counterterrorism and combat search and rescue missions, and the bill prohibits divesting of that aircraft in FY21 and requires the Air Force to provide a briefing to Congress on the future of the A-10. Selfridge Air National Guard Base hosts an A-10 fighter mission.Establishing a Quantum Research and Development Program: This bill includes a provision Peters authored to improve a research and development program for quantum computers, including developing a list of problems for which quantum computers are uniquely suited.Other Provisions:Renaming Military Bases Currently Named After Confederates: The bill includes a provision Peters supported and that was approved unanimously by Democrats and Republicans that instructs the DOD to remove names, symbols, or monuments that honor the Confederate States of America and those who served the Confederacy voluntarily from all Department of Defense installations.Improving Recruiting Efforts: The bill includes a provision Peters authored that instructs the Secretary of Defense to work with senior officials from the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Health and Human Services, and Justice to address issues that negatively impact military recruiting efforts.###Load-Date: June 12, 2020End of Document

HONG KONG TO PROSECUTE MEDIA MOGUL JIMMY LAI, ORGANIZERS OVER TIANANMEN VIGILStates News ServiceJune 11, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1031 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Authorities in Hong Kong will prosecute four prominent pro-democracy figures including media mogul Jimmy Lai for their involvement in a public commemoration of the Tiananmen massacre anniversary on June 4.Lai, along with trade unionist Lee Cheuk-yan, rights lawyer Albert Ho, and veteran democracy activist Richard Tsoi will be charged with "incitement to join an illegal assembly" after thousands defied a police ban to gather in Victoria Park for the traditional candlelight vigil marking the 1989 bloodshed in Beijing.The vigil was organized by the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, which is run by Lee, Tsoi, and Ho.Lee said he was informed of the decision to prosecute in a phone call from police on Thursday evening."We expected all of this," he said in a recorded audio statement for journalists. "When you look at the overall situation in Hong Kong, the police are abusing the power to arrest and the department of justice is abusing the power to prosecute."Lee said the government is trying threaten the people of Hong Kong, who have thrown their support behind city-wide pro-democracy protests in the past year.But he dismissed the charges, saying "we are exercising our right to assembly."The case will be heard on June 23, the Alliance said on its Facebook page.The four already face similar charges alongside 11 other activists linked to a mass protest on Aug. 31, 2019."The Hong Kong Alliance believe that we have the right to mourn June 4 and have a rally to condemn the massacre," Lee said of the peaceful vigil.Subversion and sedition lawThe decision to prosecute the four activists came as the U.K. foreign secretary said he was "deeply concerned" at China's plan to impose a draconian subversion and sedition law on Hong Kong, bypassing the city's Legislative Council (LegCo)."The proposed national security law undermines the ... framework under which Hong Kong is guaranteed a high degree of autonomy with executive, legislative and judicial powers," foreign secretary Dominic Raab said in a six-monthly report on the situation in Hong Kong."For the Chinese government, rather than Hong Kong's own institutions, to directly impose national security legislation would lie in direct conflict with Article 23 of Hong Kong's Basic Law, and with China's obligations under the Sino-British Joint Declaration," he said, in a reference to Hong Kong's mini-constitution and the 1984 treaty governing the 1997 handover of the city to Chinese rule."The law ... raises the prospect of prosecution in Hong Kong for political crimes, which would undermine existing commitments to protect the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong," Raab said in a foreword to the report.The report said the widespread protest and social unrest of the past six months were political in nature, and should be resolved by political dialogue.While it said violence and vandalism from protesters was unacceptable, it supported public demands for an independent public enquiry into police violence, saying a recent report was "heavily criticized" because the police complaints body lacked the power to compel witnesses."Use of force by the police has been a major political issue, including the treatment of arrested persons," the report said, adding that the U.K. had stopped issuing licenses for exports of crowd control equipment to Hong Kong.Raab said his government would move ahead with plans to allow a pathway for British National Overseas (BNO) passport-holders from Hong Kong to settle in the U.K. if the national security law was implemented, and called on Beijing to "step back from the brink."He said London "remains deeply concerned" at the arrest of the 15 pro-democracy figures on April 18."The U.K. will not look the other way when it comes to the people of Hong Kong, we will stand by them, and we will live up to our responsibilities," Raab wrote.Officer summonedMeanwhile, a judge in Hong Kong on Thursday summoned a traffic officer to appear in court over the shooting of a protester during a Nov. 11 demonstration, marking the first time a police officer has faced charges related to year-long protests in the city.Pro-democracy leader Ted Hui filed five charges through a rare private prosecution against the officer in Januarythree of which were approved by the court, including shooting with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. If convicted, the officer faces a maximum penalty of life in prison for that charge alone.Two other approved chargesdangerous or reckless use of firearmseach carry a maximum punishment of seven years in jail.The officer, who was granted anonymity by a court in another case and has not been named to comply with the earlier order, had been recorded in a video which showed him drawing his weapon and firing into a crowd that surrounded him during a demonstration, hitting one protester in the abdomen. He later said he believed protesters were trying to take his gun.According to Hong Kong law, the Department of Justice can now intervene in the case and decide whether to prosecute or terminate it.To date, no cases have been pursued against officers relating to accusations of abuse during the police response to protests over the past year. A government report recently dismissed claims that police had used excessive force to quell demonstrations, prompting public anger.Teacher trainingAlso on Thursday, the Hong Kong education bureau said teachers in the city would now be required to attend an additional 60 hours of professional training over the next three years to improve their "professional values and conduct," prompting concerns that the authorities will soon start reshaping teaching according to the ruling Chinese Communist Party's "patriotic education" goals for the city.The training, which will also include a module on "local, national and international education issues" will be rolled out for newly qualified teachers, in-service teachers, and will form part of requirements for promotion, the bureau said in a June 10 circular.Reported by Man Hoi-tsan for RFA's Cantonese Service.

According to the New York Times, the company email stated that the app is now      prohibited from all employee phones that can  access Amazon email,  and that employees need to remove the app by Friday in order to for email access to continue.TikTok has been under increased scrutiny lately. The app, which is owned by Chinese tech company ByteDance, was banned in India last month. More recently, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has      said that the US could ban Chinese apps like TikTok due to the potential threat to national security.TikTok itself also pulled out of the Hong Kong market on Monday, citing a new Chinese national security law that would make it impossible to use. Despite TikTok being based in China, the      country itself does not have access to the app. The company has even decided to stop employing Chinese moderators and claimed that none of its data is stored in China. TikTok has also taken      pains to say that a lot of its business and data decisions are made outside China, a move which the company hopes will alleviate any concern that it s controlled by the Chinese government.Amazon has reportedly said in the email that employees can still check TikTok on their laptop browsers.Engadget has asked Amazon for comment and will update this story when we hear back.See Campaign:https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-exit-hong-kong-china-security-law-083620437.htmlContact Information:Nicole LeeTags:, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: August 17, 2020End of Document

AFRICAN COUNTRIES NEED TO SEIZE OPPORTUNITIES CREATED BY US-CHINA TENSIONSIPS - Inter Press ServiceJune 19, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 IPS - Inter Press Service/Global Information NetworkLength: 1182 wordsByline: External SourceDateline: JOHANNESBURG, Jun 19 2020 BodyThe unfolding US-China power rivalryÂ bears a striking resemblance to the tensions between the US and the Soviet bloc during the Cold War years. Back then, African countries were positioned like pawns on a grand chessboard. Their social and economic progress was hampered because they expended energy aligning themselves with either of the superpowers in the battle for world supremacy between communism and capitalism.With notable exceptions, African states generally failed to exercise positive agency for their own development. They also eroded the institutional and governance foundations vital for economic success.In the current context of rising geopolitical tensions between the US and China, African countries may find themselves repeating the same mistakes unless they proactively shape their own destinies.The tensions between the two great powers, characterised by a vicious trade war, are deepening at a time when the world economy is under enormous strain due to COVID-19. At the same time African countries are facing their worst economic crises since independence.Africa is institutionally under-prepared to weather the combined effects of the health pandemic and severe economic recession. Its leaders will need to consciously design strategies of engagement that will help them to manage the ongoing superpower tensions to their advantage. They should do so without taking sides. This requires that they deal with each of these great powers based on pragmatic - rather than ideological - choices.Despite their institutional under-preparedness, African countries can - and indeed must - be highly strategic and tactical in how they respond to the US-China tensions. Failure to do so will inevitably mean sacrificing their own interests.There are three arenas of challenges and opportunities for the African continent in the current geopolitical climate. The first involves technological frontiers, the second is global supply chains, and the third is trade integration and economic cooperation.New technological frontiersThere is overwhelming evidence that technological innovation is the key driver of economic growth. Therefore, access to and exploitation of new technologies such as 5G is vital to Africa's development. Fifth generation technologies are important options for a continent like Africa where mobile technology has leap-frogged more traditional technologies.Access to technologies like 5G offers access to universal broadband, which is critical for the continent's advance to a digital economy.In May last year the US government put the Chinese firm Huawei, the world's leading supplier of 5G network infrastructure, on its list of entities deemed to pose a significant risk to national security and foreign policy interests.Huawei was effectively banned from importing and incorporating key US technologies into its products and services. This included both hardware, such as high-tech semiconductor components, and software, like Google Mobile Services (GMS). The ban was later extended to key technologies from non-US firms. These included the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, a major Huawei supplier.In the month following the initial ban, the CEOs of four major South African telecommunications operators - Telkom, Vodacom, MTN and Cell C - wrote a joint letter to South African president Cyril Ramaphosa requesting his urgent intervention on the US action against Huawei. Their aim would have been to lend diplomatic weight to prevent damage to South Africa's telecommunications sector.In July last year Ramaphosa came out in support of the four operators as well as Huawei. He said the ban was: an example of protectionism that will affect our own telecommunications sector, particularly the efforts to roll out the 5G network, causing a setback on other networks as well. This was an example of pragmatism on the part of the South African government.African policymakers should strenuously safeguard their right to choose from the widest possible range of technology options that suit their countries' development needs. And they should insist on acquiring and developing new technologies like 5G based on pragmatism.Global supply chainsThe second theatre of struggle for African countries is in global supply chains.The COVID-19 reality, combined with the ratcheting up of US-China tensions over trade, technology and supply chains, has opened up opportunities that African countries should exploit.Combined, they have exposed serious problems in supply networks across various sectors. These include digital products, food, pharmaceutical and medical supply chains.These sectors represent opportunities for African countries to develop new products, services and capabilities. They could, for example, provide answers to safeguarding Africa's food security needs, local production of essential drugs and medicines, low-cost medical tests and equipment, and logistics.But African countries will need to work more collaboratively to develop thriving economic sectors and cross-border industrial linkages. Trade will, in our view, be a critical enabler for this.This leads us to the third domain, namely the need for African countries to deepen trade integration and economic cooperation. This will provide a basis for diversifying from over-reliance on export markets such as China and the US, and to build internal resilience.Intra-Africa tradeIntra-African trade accounts for just 16% of total African trade. This compares with 52% in Asia and 73% in Europe. African trade is highly concentrated on a few economic hubs: China and Europe together account for 54% of total African trade, with China being Africa's single largest trading partner. It accounts for over 14% of total African trade.The African Continental Free Trade Area creates the institutional and infrastructural framework for Africa to strengthen intra-African trade, diversify its trading partners and implement long-overdue trade policy reforms.COVID-19 has induced significant delays in the implementation of this trading arrangement. It should, in fact, have magnified a sense of urgency. But instead of showing adaptability, African leaders pressed a pause button. As a result, the continent could miss an opportunity to accelerate development of cross-border value chains in medical supplies and equipment and other areas.Imagination and courageAfrican countries should seize the opportunities presented by deepening tensions between China and the US to realise positive agency and chart their own future. They will need to be more proactive and adaptive under the fluid and uncertain global environment. This will require a great deal of imagination and courage.African countries face a daunting set of challenges and constraints. But policymakers always have options.Mzukisi Qobo, Head: Wits School of Governance, University of the Witwatersrand and Mjumo Mzyece, Associate Professor of Technology and Operations Management, University of the WitwatersrandThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Amazon tells employees to delete TikTok immediately-then takes it backCNN WireJuly 10, 2020 Friday 9:49 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 537 wordsDateline: (CNN Business) Body (CNN Business) --  Amazon made waves on Friday by ordering employees to remove TikTok from their devices, only to announce hours later that the directive had been sent by mistake.In a statement, a company spokesperson said an email urging employees to immediately remove the short-video app from their devices was sent "in error.""There is no change to our policies right now with regard to TikTok," the spokesperson said. In its earlier email to employees Friday morning, obtained by CNN, Amazon said that due to "security risks, the TikTok app is no longer permitted on mobile devices that access Amazon email."Accessing TikTok from company laptops would still be permitted, the email said, but mobile devices would be cut off from Amazon email unless the app was removed by July 10.The original email appeared to catch TikTok off guard. In a statement earlier Friday, a TikTok spokesperson said Amazon "did not communicate to us before sending their email, and we still do not understand their concerns." "We welcome a dialogue so we can address any issues they may have and enable their team to continue participating in our community," the spokesperson added. "We're proud that tens of millions of Americans turn to TikTok for entertainment, inspiration, and connection, including many of the Amazon employees and contractors who have been on the frontlines of this pandemic."TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Amazon's reversal. The original announcement would have represented the biggest company to warn its employees of TikTok as a possible security risk, following claims by US politicians that the app could undermine national security given its ties to China. Cybersecurity experts have been more cautious about that assessment.TikTok is owned by the world's most valuable startup, a Chinese company named ByteDance. But TikTok does not operate in China and functions as an independent subsidiary. TikTok has been taking pains to draw that distinction, recently naming an American CEO and pointing out that its servers are based in the US and not subject to Chinese laws.Other organizations have moved to ban TikTok. The US military has prevented soldiers from installing the app, while some policymakers, such as Sen. Josh Hawley, have proposed banning TikTok from all US government devices. On Friday, the Democratic National Committee warned Democratic campaigns, committees and state parties to take additional security precautions when using TikTok. In an email obtained by CNN, the DNC's security team wrote: "We continue to advise campaign staff to refrain from using TikTok on personal devices. If you are using TikTok for campaign work, we recommend using a separate phone and account." The DNC suggested to campaigns in a memo in December not to use TikTok, citing concerns about the app's "Chinese ties and potentially sending data back to the Chinese government."TikTok has been downloaded 165 million times in the US and has become a key part of internet and popular culture, serving as a platform for viral memes, political satire and activism.Donie O'Sullivan contributed to this report.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

MAKING SURE THE U.S. MILITARY REMAINS THE BEST IN THE WORLDStates News ServiceJuly 24, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 655 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by South Dakota Senator Mike Rounds:This year marks the 60th consecutive year that the U.S. Senate has passed a bipartisan National Defense Authorization Actor NDAA. The NDAA is one of the most important pieces of legislation we pass each year, as it authorizes funding for the Department of Defense. The bill we recently passed authorizes funding to support our armed forces and their families throughout fiscal year 2021. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and chairman of that committee's Cybersecurity Subcommittee, I've been working with my colleagues on this legislation to make sure it provides the resources necessary to keep our troops safe, strengthen our national security and support military families. This is especially important as our adversaries, especially China, seek to gain strategic dominance over the United States as they grow their militaries in quality and quantity.Of all our near-peer competitors, China is continuing to strengthen its powerful grip on its own people as well as expand its influence across the globe. This year, we've seen China perform an ethnic cleansing of Uighur Muslims, many of whom are being held against their will in concentration camps. While imposing this abuse of Uighur Muslims, the Chinese Communist Party, which governs China, has meanwhile issued a new law on Hong Kong that would strictly punish anyone who opposes the Chinese government, in effect the Chinese Communist Party. These profound violations of human rights are painted by the Party's state-run news service in the best light possible while hiding and distorting the truth from its citizens.On an international level, China has unlawfully claimed most of the South China Seaa major shipping channelas its own sovereign territory. This, despite the fact that many of our Southeast Asian allies have legitimate claims to islands and areas in the South China Sea. We've recently seen an escalation of aggressive actions by China's maritime forces against U.S. ships in the South China Sea, which are there to maintain freedom of navigation and make sure free trade can continue within this critical artery for international commerce. This type of aggression is a prime example of why our armed forces need to remain the strongest in the world. We can fulfill that requirement by giving our armed forces all they need through the NDAA that we have passed every year for over half a century.The fiscal year 2021 NDAA that we just passed was designed to support the National Defense Strategy. The National Defense Strategy provides clear direction for restoring our military's competitive edge in an era of re-emerging, long-term great power competition. As our near-peer competitors like China and Russia continue to advance their own weapon systems and strategies, we must make sure our armed forces have the tools and capabilities to deter aggression by these adversaries against the United States, our allies and partners. We never want our service men and women to go into a fair fightU.S. troops must always have the advantage.The B-21 Raider bombers coming to Ellsworth Air Force Base in the near future will be a critical part of maintaining that deterrent. The B-21s will play a crucial role in neutralizing China's threat because the long-range strike bomber will put them at risk if they choose to act out.International threats against U.S. interests will continue to grow, but we have the best military in the world. It isn't just weapons systems that make our armed forces strong, though they are indispensableit's the men and women who volunteer to wear the uniform. At the end of the day, the NDAA is about making sure they have everything they need to do their job, keep us safe and protect freedom. I'm glad we were able to pass this important legislation and show that, in Congress, we can work together when we share a common interest.###Load-Date: July 24, 2020End of Document

Brazil could face "consequences" if it gives Huawei access to 5G, says US ambassadorCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 29, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 291 wordsBodyJul 29 (Reuters) - The top U.S. diplomat in Brazil said in an interview that the country could suffer "consequences" if it allows Chinese firm Huawei Technologies to participate in its 5G network, regarding Washington's warnings that Beijing does not protect intellectual property.The U.S. government has increased its efforts to limit Huawei's role in developing high-speed technology in Latin America's largest economy. Huawei believes it could hand over data to the Chinese government for espionage, an accusation rejected by the company.U.S. ambassador Todd Chapman told the newspaper O Globo that Brazil will not suffer retaliation for choosing Huawei, although it could face consequences."Every country is responsible for its decisions," Chapman said. "The consequences we are seeing in the world is that the firms involved in intellectual property are afraid to make investments in countries where it is not protected."Chapman said the International Finance Development Corporation, an agency created by President Donald Trump to boost U.S. funding initiatives abroad to counter Chinese influence, has $60 billion in its coffers.The U.S. government agreed to have money available in the fund to help allies who choose to purchase their telecommunications infrastructure from "reliable suppliers."Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, said last month that the 5G deployment would have to meet the requirements of national sovereignty, information and data security. Despite his long-standing skepticism about China, Bolsonaro has taken a less harsh tone toward Beijing since taking office in 2019, though he remains a Trump ally.China is the main market for Brazilian exports.(Report by Gabriel Stargardter; edited in Spanish by Carlos Serrano)Load-Date: July 30, 2020End of Document

Continue reading Amazon bans TikTok and then says  nevermind UPDATE: The Information says that even though Amazon is saying that its email to employees banning TikTok was a mistake, banking firm Wells Fargo has told its employees to remove the app from    their phones. Just a few days ago we told you that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was talking about banning one of the most popular apps found in the App Store and the Google Play Store, TikTok.    The short-form video app took its popularity to a new level when the global pandemic hit; Generation Z ers used TikTok as a tool to combat the boredom to make lip-syncing videos, videos with    hilarious physical pranks, and clips that showed off users  dancing skills. What possibly could be the threat? Pompeo explained what the U.S. government is afraid of when he said that Americans    should not install the app unless they want their personal data to fall into  the hands of the Chinese Communist Party. Amazon bans TikTok from employees  phones and then says that it was a mistakeLike Huawei and ZTE, TikTok is owned by a Chinese company. And once again there are the usual rumors that those using the app are in danger of having their personal data stolen by the app    and sent to Beijing. Because the Chinese government can allegedly force companies to spy on its behalf, the U.S. has banned Huawei from its U.S. supply chain and is limiting its access to    cutting-edge chips. Yet, there never has been any evidence proving that the manufacturer shares purloined personal data and all of the companies involved have denied this as well. The U.S. is far    from being the only country playing hardball with TikTok developer ByteDancer. At the start of this week, TikTok said that it withdraw from stores in Hong Kong and will make the app inoperable to    users there in a few days. India has also banned the app.TikTok remains an extremely popular app in the App    Store The New York Times says today that Amazon employees are being told by email to immediately remove the TikTok app from any devices that can  access Amazon email.  The newspaper obtained a    copy of the missive which gave Amazon employees until today to remove the app or get blocked from their Amazon email account. The email from Amazon read,  Due to security risks, the TikTok app is    no longer permitted on mobile devices that access Amazon email. If you have TikTok on your device, you must remove it by 10-Jul to retain mobile access to Amazon email.  Amazon employees are    still being allowed to view TikTok from the browser on their laptop. The U.S. military has also banned personnel from using TikTok. The interesting thing is that while TikTok is owned by a    Chinese company, it does not operate in China. Furthermore, all of TikTok s servers are in the U.S. and are not subject to Chinese laws. Amazon has yet to issue a comment on the matter while a    TikTok spokesperson said that Amazon  did not communicate to us before sending their email, and we still do not understand their concerns.  Amazon is the biggest company to warn its employees    about the possible security risk of using TikTok and the latter s spokesperson continued by saying,  We welcome a dialogue so we can address any issues they may have and enable their team to    continue participating in our community. We re proud that tens of millions of Americans turn to TikTok for entertainment, inspiration, and connection, including many of the Amazon employees and    contractors who have been on the frontlines of this pandemic.  Just as we were putting the finishing touches to this article, Bloomberg reported that Amazon admitted that it had made a mistake.    In a statement, Amazon said that  This morning s email to some of our employees was sent in error. There is no change to our policies right now with regard to TikTok.  Just before that message    was disseminated by Amazon, TikTok released another statement that said,  User security is of the utmost importance to TikTok   we are fully committed to respecting the privacy of our users. See Campaign:https://www.phonearena.com/news/amazon-bans-tiktok-and-then-calls-it-a-mistake_id125865Contact Information:Alan FriedmanTags:, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: August 18, 2020End of Document

Four students detained in Hong Kong on charges of inciting secessionCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 30, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 429 wordsBodyBeijing, Jul 30 (EFE).- The Hong Kong Police on Wednesday detained, under the controversial new national security law, four students between the ages of 16 and 21, accused of organizing and encouraging secessionist activities, the organization to which they belonged, Studentlocalism, reported today in a brief statement published on their social media profiles."All four have been arrested for violating articles 20 and 21 of the National Security Act, including secession and inciting secession," the text said, which stated that those affected, three males and one woman have been denied bail.Hong Kong Police Superintendent Li Kwai-wah said at a press conference late on Wednesday that detainees had published information online on the creation of a new group to fight for the establishment of a "Hong Kong Republic" and that they stated that they would use all necessary means to achieve that end.Those arrested would also have expressed their intention to unite Hong Kong's pro-independence groups.According to the Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post, it is the first arrest of anti-government activists to take place outside the context of protests.Studentlocalism was one of the Hong Kong pro-democracy organizations that decided to dissolve hours before the Chinese government's imposition of the national security law, which establishes sentences of even life imprisonment for cases of "secession, subversion against state power (a charge commonly used against dissidents and critics of the communist regime), terrorist activities and confabulation with foreign forces to put national security at risk."Li stated that the offenses occurred after 1 July, the time of entry into force of the law, since it is not retroactive.This legislation has been opposed by lawyers, activists, journalists and a large segment of the Hong Kong population for fear that it might curb the freedoms enjoyed by the semi-autonomous Chinese city, which was a British colony until 1997.The law came after more than a year of pro-democracy protests that also recorded violent incidents between the police and some radical demonstrators, and whose effects have fueled the local economy.The 1984 Sino-British Declaration, which articulated the retrocession of Hong Kong from British to Chinese in 1997, established maintenance for at least 50 years from that date of a number of freedoms in unimaginable territory in mainland China.However, from China's Foreign Ministry its spokespersons have reiterated that the commitments contained in that document were fulfilled at the time.Load-Date: July 31, 2020End of Document

U.S. war against Huawei begins to work in EuropeCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 11, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 470 wordsBodyHuawei Technologies has gone from a base provider of mobile networks in the UK and France to possibly being banned. Initial resistance and commitments from European countries begin to give way after the Relentless White House campaign.Both countries indicated this week that they have taken steps to reduce dependence on the Chinese company. The UK is considering reducing huawei's use of equipment as early as this year, and ANSSI, the French cybersecurity agency, plans to impose an exemption system that is likely to greatly limit the use of the company's products.A year ago, the scenario seemed much more optimistic for the Chinese company. The UK intelligence and security committee had said in July 2019 that barring Huawei would make networks less resistant to malicious attacks. The committee's reasoning was that the measure would reduce competition and leave the UK dependent on only two suppliers, Nokia and Ericsson.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tried to close a compromise in January by allowing operators to use Huawei equipment to install their 5G systems, provided they met the 35% limit and agreed not to use them on sensitive network cores.But U.S. pressure continued to mount, and both European governments and carriers had to choose between two world powers. President Donald Trump's administration has resorted to sanctions, making it increasingly difficult for European carriers to access products from the world's largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment."Huawei's R&D; spending growth has accelerated recently," said Neil Campling, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities. "Their progress towards Western peers is significant, and therefore the U.S. is using everything it can with its political power - be it trade sanctions, official agreements, unofficial agreements - to try to cool China's progress."Huawei has consistently denied that it poses a security risk and claims it operates independently of the Chinese government. Huawei spokesman Paul Harrison argued on Twitter that the US is unfairly conditioning UK policy with sanctions and threatening the launch of 5G in the country.There are still European markets to be disputed. The German government is struggling to establish rules requiring security certification for 5G network providers. Chinese authorities have singled out German manufacturers - the crown jewel of Europe's largest economy - as a potential target of retaliation if Huawei were banned from their markets.The blow to Huawei's relations with Europe may have occurred in May, when the U.S. banned the company from acquiring microchips that use American technology.The prevalence of chips that are manufactured with American technology or incorporate it led Pierre Ferragu, an analyst at New Street Research, to say in May that "Huawei has 12 months to survive."Load-Date: July 12, 2020End of Document

The site is meant to eventually serve as Huawei's international headquarters for its optoelectronics business, where it will research, develop, and produce semiconductor technology focused on optoelectronics used in fiber optic broadband networks.In a statement to Fierce Wireless, a U.S. State Department spokesperson said it had seen reports the U.K. intends to allow Huawei to build an R&D center in England and urged all countries, especially allies and partners like the U.K., to carefully evaluate the long-term impact of granting “untrusted companies like Huawei access to sensitive information.”“We believe countries need to be able to trust that partners will not threaten national security, privacy, intellectual property, or human rights. Trust cannot exist where a company such asHuaweiis subject to an authoritarian government, like the PRC [People's Republic of China], that lacks an independent judiciary or rule of law that would effectively prohibit the misuse of data,” the State Department spokesperson said.RELATED: Huawei's future in U.K. 5G networks in question againThe Financial Times first reported that a local council approved the plan (PDF) nine to one despite lobbying from U.S. officials            against the plant over security concerns. The report said senior U.S. officials contacted Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee in Britain, with concerns that U.S. chips might be tested by Huawei at the facility.“The Chinese Communist Party acquires technology and intellectual property through licit and illicit means, through collaboration and through deception, and by investment, joint research, and outright theft,” the State Department spokesperson said, adding that the U.S. is “deeply concerned about the serious risk” this strategy poses to U.S national security, as well as to “the security of advanced technology producing countries like the United Kingdom.”Huawei did not respond to Fierce request for comment.RELATED: Industry Voices — Paolini: Protecting the US, or isolating it? The long-term effects of US policies on HuaweiEarlier this year, against amidst an ongoing campaign by the U.S. for countries worldwide to ban the use of Huawei gear in communications networks, the U.K. decided to give the telecom vendor a limited role. It excluded “high-risk vendors” including Huawei, from core networks, but allowed Huawei to supply parts of the radio access network (RAN) with a hard 35% cap on its presence.However, Huawei's participation is in question again. In May the U.K.'s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), part of the GCHQ security and intelligence office, launched a new review to assess the impact U.S. sanctions against Huawei might have on Britain's telecom networks.The U.S. has warned Huawei could be used by the Chinese government for state-backed spying or disruption through its presence in communications networks. Huawei has denied such claims.The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reported Thursday that U.S. officials and policy makers have discussed ways the federal government can back the private sector in order to compete against Huawei globally.U.S. officials, including at the FCC, have already shown increased interest in open RAN technology, which could help create a more diverse set of vendors.Ideas reportedly also include prodding large U.S. tech companies like Cisco to buy Ericsson or Nokia, or the government providing tax breaks to the Swedish and Finnish vendors – who are Huawei's two main competitors in the telecom space.RELATED: FCC's Pai bullish on open RAN, virtualizationHuawei VP Victor Zhang told the Financial Times he doesn't think there's a strong link between the planned R&D center and Huawei supporting U.K. operators' networks like Vodafone or BT – so Huawei is committed to the new R&D facility no matter what happens with the U.K.'s NCSC review.The first phase of Huawei's U.K. project involves building roughly 540,000-square-foot facilities across nine acres of land, directly creating around 400 local jobs, according to Huawei. Huawei started work on the initiative in 2017 and acquired a 500-acre site in South Cambridgeshire, as well as 50 acres of brownfield land.“Through close collaboration with research institutes, universities, and local industry, we want to advance optical communications technology for the industry as a whole, while doing our part to support the UK's broader Industrial Strategy,” said Zhang in a statement. “Ultimately, we want to help enshrine the UK's leading position in optoelectronics and promote UK tech on a global scale."Load-Date: June 27, 2020End of Document

U.S. enables its companies to collaborate with Huawei in creating standardsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 16, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 390 wordsBodySan Francisco ,USA, 16 Jun. (EFE).- The U.S. Department of Commerce on Tuesday released an exception to the orderly veto for U.S. companies to do business with China's Huawei to enable them to work with China's company in developing international technology standards, such as the 5G network.In a statement, the US Government explained that the decision has been taken to ensure that the country's companies continue to contribute "to important standards development activities despite Huawei's ubiquitous involvement in the organizations" entrusted to this purpose.In addition to the super-fast, high-capacity 5G internet network, the Executive led by Donald Trump also cited the cases of autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence, for which the development of international standards provides a guarantee of "functionality, interoperability and security."The U.S. first announced a ban on U.S. companies to maintain trade ties with Huawei in the midst of trade with China in May 2019, but has since decreed five moratoriums, the latter of which expires in mid-August.The Trump administration is wary of the company's ties to the Chinese government and claims to have suspicions that Huawei could use its mobile phones and other technology equipment to spy abroad and provide the information to Asian country leaders.However, the strong presence of Huawei, one of the world's largest technology manufacturers, in international standards development organizations had caused confusion in U.S. companies, which did not know how much they could share information with the Chinese firm because of the restrictions.Commerce's new standard clarifies this aspect and allows companies to share technology information with Huawei to develop standards without receiving an export license.For its part, the Chinese company said in a statement that "standards should be set in an open, fair and non-discriminatory manner" and called for "inclusion" and a "productive dialogue" to help "promote the creation of technical standards and promote the development of both industry and the global economy"."We would like to continue to have honest discussions on the standards for new technologies with our counterparts, including those in the United States, and thus contribute to the technological advancement of society at large," they said from Huawei.Load-Date: June 17, 2020End of Document

U.S. warns Brazil of 'consequences' of authorizing Huawei in 5GCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 29, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 367 wordsBodySao Paulo, Jul 29 (EFE).- The U.S. ambassador to Brazil, Todd Chapman, alerted the Brazilian government to possible "consequences" if Huawei's Chinese technology was authorized on the country's 5G network, which is scheduled for auction next year."I would say there will be no retaliation, but consequences. Each country is responsible for its decisions," he said in an interview published wednesday by the newspaper O Globo.In that regard, the U.S. ambassador suggested that Huawei's presence could compromise future investments by U.S. companies in fear that their intellectual property secrets will be violated."First, the information will not be secure. At any time the Chinese government will be able to ask Huawei to send the information to them," Chapman stressed."Those who are investing in pharmaceuticals, in software, look at that. Our economy is service-based. America's biggest export is intelligence, intellectual property. And Brazil has to do the same, or it will continue to export primary and non-high-tech products," he added.The 5G auction has generated great international interest and has become a new chapter of tensions between the United States and China due to the appetite expressed by Chinese giant Huawei to offer its technologies and the public pressures of US President Donald Trump's government for the Asian company to be vetoed.Although Huawei is not a telephony operator and would not participate in the auction, it is one of the largest infrastructure companies for 5G technology in the world, together with Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia.According to Chapman, the selection of 5G suppliers is not a business issue for the United States, but a matter of "national security."However, Brazil's Vice President Hamilton Mourao recently said it will be difficult to leave Huawei out of the auction, although he acknowledged that there will be increased pressures to do so as the U.S. presidential election approaches.President Jair Bolsonaro's government, aligned with the United States, has tried to maintain the difficult balance between its biggest political ally and its main trading partner, although the upcoming 5G auction could put the country at a crossroads.Load-Date: July 30, 2020End of Document

Trump puts an end to Hong Kong's special status against the U.S.CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 14, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 486 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said he issued an order to end Hong Kong's special status before the United States and signed legislation that would sanction Chinese officials responsible for taking strong action against political dissent in Hong Kong, in the latest escalation of tensions among the world's largest economies."No administration has been tougher on China than this administration," Trump said Tuesday at the White House.Trump approved the move Tuesday after spending weeks blaming Beijing for the coronavirus pandemic and criticizing its handling of Hong Kong. The president has faced widespread criticism for his response to the virus, and cases soar again as companies reopen.Bipartisan legislation comes in response to the Chinese government's new national security law for the former British colony, which critics say aims to crush political protests and quell dissent. Persons convicted under the law may, in some cases, face life imprisonment.The legislation would penalize banks doing business with Chinese officials involved in the national security law that the country seeks to impose on Hong Kong. It is the latest in a series of efforts designed to put pressure on China amid tensions over the spread of coronavirus, the implementation of a trade pact finalized earlier this year, and efforts to strengthen control over Hong Kong.The legislation would require the State Department to report to Congress each year on officials seeking to undermine the "one country, two systems" model that applies to Hong Kong. It also gives the president the power to seize the assets and block the entry into the United States of those people.The law gives banks a kind of one-year grace period to stop doing business with entities and individuals that the State Department determines to be "major offenders" from undermining Hong Kong's autonomy.After that period, the Treasury Department may impose a variety of sanctions on these institutions, including prohibiting senior executives from entering the U.S. and restricting the ability to participate in U.S. dollar-denominated transactions, according to Toomey.Trump announced last month that he would end preferential treatment for Hong Kong and signed legislation aimed at punishing Chinese officials for the oppression of Uighurs and members of other Muslim minority groups.The toughest stance toward Beijing represents a turn for Trump, which largely avoided human rights interventions while negotiating the first phase of his trade agreement. On Monday, the U.S. president said the deal was still "intact" because China was buying the promised agricultural products. But Trump also expressed frustration with the country over the spread of the coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan."What they did to the world must not be forgotten," Trump said.Original Note:Trump Ends Hong Kong's Special Status With U.S. to Punish China©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: July 15, 2020End of Document

FCC 'stuns' RWA with immediate USF ban on Huawei FierceWirelessJuly 1, 2020Copyright 2020 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 670 wordsByline: Bevin FletcherHighlight: The move comes in conjunction with the FCC's final designation of Huawei as a national security risk, and RWA is asking the commission to give member enough time to submit waivers. BodyThe Rural Wireless Association (RWA) said Tuesday that it was “stunned” by the FCC decision to immediately ban service providers from using Universal Service Fund (USF) dollars for Huawei telecom gear and wants enough time to submit waivers.In a Public Notice (PDF), released yesterday, the FCC finalized its            initial designation of Huawei and fellow Chinese vendor ZTE as national security threats. The formal designations, effective immediately, mean service providers can't use USF support (which includes about $8.5 billion annually for broadband deployment, largely for rural providers) to purchase, maintain or support any services or equipment supplied by Huawei or ZTE.“As a result, rural carriers who have deployed Huawei or ZTE equipment or services in their networks will now lack the ability to support their critical networks that are serving hundreds of thousands of rural Americans and those traveling through rural America,” RWA said in a statement.RELATED: FCC bans use of USF funds for Huawei, ZTE equipment“Given the difficultly in demonstrating where specifically their USF support is being utilized in their networks, this puts rural carriers in a precarious situation,” RWA continued, pointing out that the group is simultaneously working to give customers time to pay bills as requested by the FCC, adjust to changes from the T-Mobile/Sprint merger and keep rural Americans connected during the COVID-19 pandemic.It appears service providers can request waivers from the ban, but RWA is still concerned with the timeframe.“RWA members appreciate the opportunity to submit waivers of this prohibition but ask the Commission to give them sufficient time to submit such waivers before pulling away their USF support which is scheduled to start tomorrow, July 1,” RWA stated.In November 2019, the FCC voted unanimously to ban USF recipients from using funds for telecom equipment from companies deemed national security risks, initially naming Huawei and ZTE as entities covered by the order.RELATED: Huawei, ZTE fight against FCC national security threat classificationRegarding Tuesday's decision, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said its Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau made the formal designation based “on the overwhelming weight of evidence.”“Both companies have close ties to the Chinese Communist Party and China's military apparatus, and both companies are broadly subject to Chinese law obligating them to cooperate with the country's intelligence services,” Pai said in a statement (PDF). “The Bureau also took into account the findings and actions of Congress, the Executive Branch, the intelligence community, our allies, and communications service providers in other countries. We cannot and will not allow the Chinese Communist Party to exploit network vulnerabilities and compromise our critical communications infrastructure.”In response to Fierce, Huawei said its original statement on the designation – that the order is unlawful – is still valid.“Huawei believes this order is unlawful as the FCC has singled out Huawei based on national security, but it provides no evidence that Huawei poses a security risk. Instead, the FCC simply assumes, based on a mistaken view of Chinese law, that Huawei might come under Chinese government control,” Huawei stated. RELATED: FCC's Pai bullish on open RAN, virtualizationHuawei has been in the U.S. crosshairs on several fronts, including Washington's campaign to keep the tech giant out of communications networks both at home and abroad. In March, the Trump administration            signed bipartisan legislation to establish a $1 billion fund to help smaller telecom providers rip out and replace insecure network equipment from companies like Huawei and ZTE that are deemed a national security risk.RWA and the Competitive Carriers Association (CCA), which counts regional and rural carriers as members, praised earlier Senate passage of the bill.

Arandia Jr., associate at Polsinelli P.C., Dallas, Texas, has issued a public comment on behalf of Pinnacle Climate Technologies Inc. On the Office of U.S. Trade Representative's notice entitled "Request for Comments on Additional Modifications to the 301 Action to Address COVID-19: China's Acts, Policies, and Practices Related to Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property, and Innovation". The comment was written on June 3, 2020, and posted on June 11, 2020:* * *On behalf of our client, Pinnacle Climate Technologies, Inc. ("Pinnacle"), we respectfully request that the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative ("USTR") exclude Chinese-origin propane-forced air heaters from Section 301 duties that are essential for providing temperature control for emergency expansion of temporary medical treatment and testing facilities in response to the COVID-19 outbreak./1In addition to the medical sector, propane-forced air heaters further support essential critical infrastructure workers as identified by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's "Identifying Critical Infrastructure during COVID-19" guidance./2Accordingly, essential workers in critical infrastructure sectors need the propane-forced air heaters to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak, such that removing the Section 301 tariffs on these products is appropriate.I. Propane-Forced Air Heater DescriptionThe propane-forced air heater is a portable, outdoor space heater that incorporates a motor driven fan or blower. It is a steel cylindrical shape held by a rectangular base with the controls and has a carry handle on top. The heater output ranges from 40,000 BTUs to 375,000 BTUs. The propane-forced air heaters range in dimensions from 18 inches in length by 7.5 inches in width (14lbs) to 35 inches in length by 13 inches in width (52lbs). See Exhibit B.Pinnacle's propane-forced air heaters are classifiable under subheading 7322.90.0015, of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States ("HTSUS"), which provides for air heaters, not electrically heated, incorporating a motor-driven fan or blower. The regular customs duty rate is duty-free. However, the HTSUS subheading is currently subject to additional duties of 25% under Section 301, List 3.III. Propane-Forced Air Heaters Directly Benefit the Healthcare and Public Health Sector's COVID-19 ResponseThe fight against the COVID-19 pandemic requires the nationwide support of the healthcare industry. Pinnacle's propane-forced air heater directly benefits the healthcare and public health sector's efforts. Specifically, emergency expansion of temporary medical treatment and testing facilities will require substantial heating sources to maintain warmth for critical healthcare workers and to protect functioning medical equipment.The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency ("CISA") has identified essential critical infrastructure workers including "laboratory personnel that perform critical clinical, biomedical and other research, development, and testing needed for COVID-19 or other diseases." Propane-forced heaters provide essential warmth to critical healthcare workers at emergency outdoor drive-through testing facilities. Additionally, the heaters will ensure properly functioning medical testing and personal protective equipment. For example, in a May 19, 2020, news article, a nurse describes how propane heaters provide warmth and protect the testing equipment from cold weather:The drive-thru setting is also another hindrance: While we see over one hundred patients a day per location (there are eight different drive-thru locations across New York), and we are able to protect them by not having them come into an office setting, it makes our jobs as nurses even harder. Even though it's currently May in New York, it's still pretty cool outside--so much so that we noticed our equipment wasn't working properly from the temperature. Now, we have tents and propane heaters so that has helped keep both us comfortable and our equipment working./3Moreover, propane heaters provided warmth to temporary facilities for quarantined patients in New Orleans and pop-up medical tents in New Jersey./4Propane-forced air heaters may also help reduce airborne transmission in the emergency outdoor medical and testing facilities. According to the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc./5(ASHRAE), through its Environmental Health Committee, "changes to building operations, including the operation of heating, ventilating, and air conditioning systems, can reduce airborne exposures."/6Powerful heating systems like the propane-forced air heaters may reduce the airborne concentration of COVID-19 and thus the risk of transmission through the air.Tariff relief on the propane-forced air heaters will enable local, state, and Federal leaders to prepare for the likely fall and winter COVID-19 outbreaks. In a recent Washington Post article, the director of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned that a winter outbreak will likely be more difficult than the spring 2020 outbreak:"There's a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through," CDC Director Robert Redfield said in an interview with The Washington Post. "And when I've said this to others, they kind of put their head back, they don't understand what I mean." "We're going to have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time," he said./7Emergency pop-up medical and triage hospitals will likely be required during the colder winter months throughout the country. Moreover, outdoor testing sites will likely increase as well. Propane-forced air heaters will provide the warmth necessary for essential healthcare workers in these emergency outdoor environments.III. Propane-Forced Air Heaters Support Essential Workers in Other Critical Infrastructure SectorsIn addition to the healthcare and public health sector, propane-forced air heaters further support essential workers in at least three other CISA-designated critical infrastructure sectors.In its "Advisory Memorandum on Identification of Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers during COVID-19 Response," CISA identifies the Public Works and Infrastructure Support Services sector as a critical sector needed to fight COVID-19. This sector includes the following essential critical infrastructure workers:* Workers who support the construction, maintenance, or rehabilitation of critical infrastructure.* Workers supporting construction materials production, testing laboratories, material delivery services, and construction inspection.* Workers who support the operation, inspection, and maintenance of essential public works facilities and operations, including bridges, water and sewer main breaks, fleet maintenance personnel, construction of critical or strategic infrastructure, traffic signal maintenance, emergency location services for buried utilities, maintenance of digital systems infrastructure supporting public works operations, and other emergent issues.Here, the propane-forced heater supports many Public Works and Infrastructure workers employed at outdoor construction and related job-sites. These heaters are required for work in extremely cold climates. Most industrial consumers will choose not to replace old worn out units. As a result, heaters that have exceeded their useful life will not be replaced. The job site will be cold and workers will not be as productive.Like the Public Works sector, propane-forced heaters support essential critical workers in the Commercial Facilities sector including:* Workers who support the supply chain of building materials from production through application and installation, including cabinetry, fixtures, doors, cement, hardware, plumbing (including parts and services), electrical, heating and cooling, refrigeration, appliances, paint and coatings, and workers who provide services that enable repair materials and equipment for essential functions.* Workers distributing, servicing, repairing, installing residential and commercial HVAC systems, boilers, furnaces and other heating, cooling, refrigeration, and ventilation equipment.* Management and staff at hotels and other temporary lodging facilities that provide for COVID-19 mitigation, containment, and treatment measures or provide accommodations for essential workers.Propane-forced air heaters provide necessary warmth in outdoor cold environments to critical infrastructure workers in the Commercial Facilities sector. Specifically, the CISA identifies temporary lodging facilities that provide for COVID-19 mitigation, containment, and treatment measures or provide accommodations for essential workers. Here, as described above, propane-forced heaters provide warm conditions to enable emergency pop-up facilities to function.Finally, propane-forced heaters support essential critical workers in the Residential Facilities sector including:* Workers who support food, shelter, and social services, and other necessities of life for needy groups and individuals, including in-need populations and COVID-19 responders, including travelling medical staff.* Workers performing housing and commercial construction related activities, including those supporting the sale, transportation, and installation of manufactured homes.For the same reasons stated above, propane-forced air heater provide warm environments against the cold weather in emergency shelters.IV. A Tariff Exclusion for Propane-Forced Air Heaters is Easily AdministrablePinnacle proposes the following exclusion language for the USTR's consideration:Propane air heaters, each incorporating a motor-driven fan or blower, each valued at $30 or more but not exceeding $250 (described in statistical reporting number 7322.90.0015)In our view, this language would allow U.S. Customs and Border Protection ("CBP") to administer and distinguish the propane air heaters that are needed to respond to the COVID19 outbreak from the heaters classified in subheading 7322.90.0015, HTSUS. Furthermore, the language is broad enough to encompass different heating outputs.V. Section 301 Duties on Propane-Forced Air Heaters Causes Severe Economic Harm to Pinnacle and U.S. InterestsThe Section 301 duties on propane-forced air heaters have resulted in severe economic harm to Pinnacle and significant U.S. interests. For example, Section 301 duties have significantly increased Pinnacle's costs and caused reduced sales opportunities. Moreover, the Section 301 duties have a significant negative impact on other U.S. critical infrastructure industries that cannot absorb higher prices. As outlined above, the propane-forced air heater supports essential workers in CISA-designated critical infrastructure sectors. These heaters are required for essential infrastructure personnel to work to occur in cold climates. Tariff relief will equip the national response to COVID-19 for the colder, fall and winter months.VI. Removing the Section 301 Duties on Propane-Forced Air Heaters Will Not Undermine the USTR's Objectives of the Section 301 Tariff ActionsExcluding propane-forced air heaters from the Section 301 duties will not undermine the USTR's objectives because the heaters do not embody the types of technology targeted by China's industrial policies including "Made in China 2025." Propane-forced air heaters are not strategically important or related to "Made in China 2025" or other Chinese industrial programs.Propane-forced air heaters are not included in any of the ten strategic advanced technology manufacturing industries for promotion and development identified in the "Made in China 2025" initiative: (1) advanced information technology; (2) robotics and automated machine tools; (3) aircraft and aircraft components; (4) maritime vessels and marine engineering equipment; (5) advanced rail equipment; (6) new energy vehicles; (7) electrical generation and transmission equipment; (8) agricultural machinery and equipment; (9) new materials; and (10) pharmaceuticals and advanced medical devices.The propane-forced air heater does not require any special technology or divulge any type of trade secret. The heater does not benefit from the "Made in China 2025" program, or any other Chinese Government's acts, policies, or practices identified by the USTR as being unreasonable or discriminatory and that burden or restrict U.S. commerce.VII. ConclusionFor the reasons set forth above, Pinnacle respectfully submits that USTR should exclude propane-forced air heaters from the Section 301 tariffs. Removing the additional tariffs on such products would be a concrete and meaningful step USTR could take to help combat the COVID19 outbreak in the long term.All information contained in this submission is complete and correct, to the best of my knowledge.

Trump used Huawei as a ploy in his reelection strategy, according to John Bolton's explosive new bookBusiness Insider USJune 18, 2020 Thursday 07:16 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Insider Inc.

The US has consistently accused Huawei of acting as a proxy for the Chinese government and spying on the US, which Huawei denies.Bolton makes broader accusations in his book about Trump's conduct during the US-China trade war, saying he pleaded with China's president Xi Jinping to buy US agricultural products to help with his 2020 election strategy.The Justice Department filed an emergency restraining order against Bolton's book on Wednesday seeking to block its publication, claiming it compromises national security.            Trump lashed out against Bolton in an interview with Fox News and in a            late-night tweet on Wednesday, saying the book was "made up of lies & fake stories."NOW WATCH: How waste is dealt with on the world's largest cruise shipSee Also:• Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt says there's 'no question' Huawei endangered US national security• Joe Biden is demanding that Facebook fact-check political ads.

TikTok hired two executives from the Internet Association as well, according to the report.TikTok also hired Freddy Barnes, a former longtime staffer for Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, according to Barnes's LinkedIn page. Derrick Dockery, a former congressional press assistant to former GOP House Speaker Paul Ryan, has joined Barnes as one of the company's lobbyists on governmental affairs.Barnes and Dockery's LinkedIn pages indicate they were hired in June.News of the hiring spree came on the heels of reports that the Trump administration is considering the possibility of banning the social media platform over concerns that the video app shares U.S. user data to Beijing.

GRASSLEY AT HEARING ON PROTECTING THE RELIABILITY OF THE U.S. MEDICAL SUPPLY CHAIN DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC PART 1States News ServiceJuly 28, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1461 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance, Majority Office:Prepared Opening Statement by U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley of IowaChairman, Senate Finance CommitteeTuesday, July 28, 2020VIDEOGood morning.I'd like to welcome everyone to the Finance Committee's hearing on Protecting the Reliability of the U.S. Medical Supply Chain during the COVID-19 Pandemic.This is the first hearing of a series of hearings to discuss the integrity of our nation's medical supply chain.Today, we will hear from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and in a few days we will hear from private sector stakeholders.This is an extremely important topic to discuss and one that impacts the safety of all Americans.It's Congress's responsibility to ensure that DHS upholds its responsibility to protect the public health by properly ensuring that Americans on the frontline get safe and effective medical supplies.I think we can all agree. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed several vulnerabilities in our nation's medical supply chain.Some of these vulnerabilities are new, while others have been around long before the pandemic and have been further exacerbated by this crisis. Indeed, I've been asking questions long before the pandemic brought these issues to the forefront of national debate.In November of last year, I finalized my oversight activities on the proliferation of counterfeit and other illicit goods sold on e-commerce platforms.The Ranking Member and I issued a report on our findings and highlighted the threat counterfeits pose to our nation's economic security, and the health and safety of Americans.We also highlighted that many counterfeits originate in China and Hong Kong.At this point, I think it's fair to say that China has serious quality control problems. It was evident then, and even more so now.Before the coronavirus pandemic, hospitals and health care workers could avoid purchasing counterfeits by tapping into tried-and-true supply chains.However, as the demand for PPE skyrocketed, some of these providers have had to go outside their normal supply chains to source supplies, and in some cases have inadvertently purchased fake, faulty and even illicit medical supplies.The problem of counterfeit and faulty products is something that I've looked into for a very long time, dating back to when I was Chairman of the Judiciary Committee.As the virus began its foothold in the United States, I also sent a letter to Vice President Mike Pence and several other agency heads to express my concern that PPE shortages were allowing bad actors to take advantage of hospitals and health care workers desperate for supplies.I've talked to hospitals all over the country, and have heard stories of price gouging, shady middlemen and PPE that was ordered and then never arrived, or was unusable.In my letter, I asked the Administration to take this issue seriously, and to prosecute bad actors to the fullest extent of the law.Today, we'll hear from a representative from U.S. Immigration and Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations on their efforts to do just that.Before we hear from today's witnesses, I want to discuss the substance of today's hearing. We will discuss several issues confronting our nation's supply chain as our country continues to battle the coronavirus pandemic.First, I want to go back to the beginning, and expose the root cause of why the United States and frankly the world is experiencing a breakdown of their supply chains.China is the largest manufacturer of PPE in the world, with more than 40 percent of PPE manufactured there.In the beginning of the pandemic, China did the unthinkable.They turned off the taps of PPE manufacturing, and heavily restricted their exports of PPE. The Chinese government also directed its local and state governments to source more supplies from the international market.As global demand soon spiked, and China restricted exports, distributors and suppliers were unable to fulfill orders.As a result, some hospitals report estimated delays of three to six months for supplies.Some pundits say China did what it did it to address a domestic health crisis. However, it's important to remember that, in the beginning, China downplayed the seriousness of the coronavirus threat to the world while it redirected vast quantities of PPE towards its domestic needs.In the United States, China's decision to redirect medical supplies occurred when states, territories, localities, and tribes began to desperately need these critical supplies.While China has since reversed course, and allowed PPE to leave the country, the United States has continued to struggle to meet demand, with most of our supply chains heavily dependent on China or Mexico.We cannot allow our supply chains to rely so heavily on China, and I look forward to working with my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to discuss how we can diversify our supply chains and increase our domestic manufacturing capacity.I want to turn now to how shortages have affected hospitals and health care workers.Before the coronavirus pandemic, hospitals and health care providers employed a "just-in-time-approach" to sourcing supplies from trusted distributors. However, as the virus gained a foothold in the United States, everyone rushed to compete for supplies, further exacerbating the shortages.As a result, some health care providers resorted to purchasing PPE from unverified suppliers, and some even turned to the internet to source supplies.By doing so, these providers sometimes received fake, fraudulent and even illicit goods not safe for use in treating patients with the coronavirus. In other cases, providers faced price gouging or hoarding.Fake N95 masks have become so prolific that 3M recently filed suit against several purported PPE sellers profiting from COVID-19 at the expense of the sick and vulnerable.Large health care systems have told me that the supply chain is doing better now, with more PPE coming in daily, which gives them the ability to avoid unverified suppliers altogether.However, smaller providers continue to face horrific shortages which may cause them to continue to turn to unverified suppliers, or even the internet, to source supplies.Even more concerning is that smaller providers, like safety-net clinics and rural hospitals, tend to treat low income families, a majority of which are African Americans and Latinos.This population has been hit the hardest by the pandemic, and is four to five times more likely to be hospitalized for contracting the coronavirus.This is an issue that cannot be sugarcoated, or spun for some political purpose. It's a fact.The black and brown community is suffering.As members of Congress, and stewards of the public trust, we must do everything in our power to protect this vulnerable population.This Committee is considering several proposals to do just that.And one way we can help this vulnerable population is to do everything in our power to shore up the integrity of our nation's supply chain, and make sure that all hospitals and health care providers get the quality supplies they need to treat COVID-19 patients.With that said, I want to now turn to the Department of Homeland Security's efforts to protect the integrity of our nation's supply chain, as we have witnesses before us today that can speak to this very issue.DHS and its components are engaged in an unprecedented, whole-of-government response to combat the coronavirus pandemic.Our nation has not faced a pandemic like the coronavirus in more than 100 years.Even so, we can't deny that the Federal government's approach to emergency preparedness has always been fraught with problems, going back to President Obama's Administration and beyond.This is not some partisan point. It's a fact.It also shows that no matter which party is in the White House, we can always do more to prepare.Today, we will hear from witnesses that represent DHS's Office of Procurement, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and ICE's Homeland Security Investigations.Thank you for being here. I look forward to hearing from all of you.In closing, I want to say two things. First, I want to thank the DHS officials who work tirelessly to ensure the integrity of our nation's supply chain, and for their efforts to ensure that those in most need get critical, quality medical supplies.Your job is incredibly difficult right now, but it is also incredibly important.Second, we must come together to address vulnerabilities in our nation's supply chain. I hope today we can have a good faith discussion so that we can better understand what we, as Congress, need to do to protect American's front line workers and prepare our country for future national health emergencies.Load-Date: July 28, 2020End of Document

Sen. Grassley Issues Remarks at Hearing on Protecting Reliability of Medical Supply Chain During COVID-19 PandemicTargeted News ServiceJuly 29, 2020 Wednesday 8:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1470 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen.

However, it's important to remember that, in the beginning, China downplayed the seriousness of the coronavirus threat to the world while it redirected vast quantities of PPE towards its domestic needs.In the United States, China's decision to redirect medical supplies occurred when states, territories, localities, and tribes began to desperately need these critical supplies.While China has since reversed course, and allowed PPE to leave the country, the United States has continued to struggle to meet demand, with most of our supply chains heavily dependent on China or Mexico.We cannot allow our supply chains to rely so heavily on China, and I look forward to working with my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to discuss how we can diversify our supply chains and increase our domestic manufacturing capacity.I want to turn now to how shortages have affected hospitals and health care workers.Before the coronavirus pandemic, hospitals and health care providers employed a "just-in-time-approach" to sourcing supplies from trusted distributors. However, as the virus gained a foothold in the United States, everyone rushed to compete for supplies, further exacerbating the shortages.As a result, some health care providers resorted to purchasing PPE from unverified suppliers, and some even turned to the internet to source supplies.By doing so, these providers sometimes received fake, fraudulent and even illicit goods not safe for use in treating patients with the coronavirus. In other cases, providers faced price gouging or hoarding.Fake N95 masks have become so prolific that 3M recently filed suit against several purported PPE sellers profiting from COVID-19 at the expense of the sick and vulnerable.Large health care systems have told me that the supply chain is doing better now, with more PPE coming in daily, which gives them the ability to avoid unverified suppliers altogether.However, smaller providers continue to face horrific shortages which may cause them to continue to turn to unverified suppliers, or even the internet, to source supplies.Even more concerning is that smaller providers, like safety-net clinics and rural hospitals, tend to treat low income families, a majority of which are African Americans and Latinos.This population has been hit the hardest by the pandemic, and is four to five times more likely to be hospitalized for contracting the coronavirus.This is an issue that cannot be sugarcoated, or spun for some political purpose. It's a fact.The black and brown community is suffering.As members of Congress, and stewards of the public trust, we must do everything in our power to protect this vulnerable population.This Committee is considering several proposals to do just that.And one way we can help this vulnerable population is to do everything in our power to shore up the integrity of our nation's supply chain, and make sure that all hospitals and health care providers get the quality supplies they need to treat COVID-19 patients.With that said, I want to now turn to the Department of Homeland Security's efforts to protect the integrity of our nation's supply chain, as we have witnesses before us today that can speak to this very issue.DHS and its components are engaged in an unprecedented, whole-of-government response to combat the coronavirus pandemic.Our nation has not faced a pandemic like the coronavirus in more than 100 years.Even so, we can't deny that the Federal government's approach to emergency preparedness has always been fraught with problems, going back to President Obama's Administration and beyond.This is not some partisan point. It's a fact.It also shows that no matter which party is in the White House, we can always do more to prepare.Today, we will hear from witnesses that represent DHS's Office of Procurement, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and ICE's Homeland Security Investigations.Thank you for being here. I look forward to hearing from all of you.In closing, I want to say two things. First, I want to thank the DHS officials who work tirelessly to ensure the integrity of our nation's supply chain, and for their efforts to ensure that those in most need get critical, quality medical supplies.Your job is incredibly difficult right now, but it is also incredibly important.Second, we must come together to address vulnerabilities in our nation's supply chain. I hope today we can have a good faith discussion so that we can better understand what we, as Congress, need to do to protect American's front line workers and prepare our country for future national health emergencies.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7191508 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 29, 2020End of Document

Business HighlightsAssociated Press InternationalJune 12, 2020 Friday 9:11 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 927 wordsByline: The Associated PressBody___US stocks bounce higher, but still end the week with a lossNEW YORK (AP) — Stocks closed another bumpy day with solid gains on Wall Street, but not enough to erase its worst weekly loss since late March. The S&P 500 rose 1.3% Friday, a day after dropping nearly 6%. The volatility interrupted what had been a dramatic rally for the market over the past three weeks. Stocks turned wobbly this week as investors re-evaluated their expectations for economic growth, which many skeptics have been saying were overly optimistic. Small-company stocks and bond yields rose, meaning investors were a bit more willing to take on risk again a day after the heavy market rout.___Twitter removes China-linked accounts spreading false newsLONDON (AP) — Twitter has removed a vast network of accounts that is says is linked to the Chinese government and was pushing false information favorable to the country’s communist rulers. Beijing denied involvement Friday and said the company should instead take down accounts smearing China. The U.S. social media company suspended 23,750 accounts that were posting pro-Beijing narratives, and another 150,000 accounts dedicated to retweeting and amplifying those messages. Twitter said the network was engaged “in a range of coordinated and manipulated activities” in predominantly Chinese languages. Those activities included praise for China’s response to the coronavirus pandemic and “deceptive narratives” about Hong Kong pro-democracy protests.___Fed says ‘full range of tools’ in play to counter pandemicWASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve is promising to use its “full range of tools” to pull the country out of a deep recession caused by a global pandemic, signaling that it would keep interest rates low through 2022. In its semi-annual monetary policy report to Congress, the central bank said that the COVID-19 outbreak was causing “tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world.” The report said that the central bank was “committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time.”___Airlines launch legal action against UK quarantine policyLONDON (AP) — Three airlines have launched legal action against the British government, describing the country’s plan to quarantine most incoming travelers as “flawed.’’ British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair say in a statement Friday that the quarantine will have a “devastating effect,’’ on tourism and the wider economy. The airlines want the government to re-adopt its previous quarantine policy, where quarantine is limited to passengers from “high risk” countries. Quarantine measures imposed this week stipulate that all passengers — bar a handful of exceptions like truckers or medical workers — must fill in a form detailing where they will self-isolate for two weeks.___Nike, NFL and others to start giving workers Juneteenth offNEW YORK (AP) — Nike, the NFL and other businesses are giving their employees a paid day off on Juneteenth for the first time, the latest example of how American employers are responding to protests that have placed additional attention on racial injustice in the U.S. Juneteenth commemorates June 19, 1865 when Major General Gordon Granger came to Galveston, Texas, to announce the end of the Civil War and slavery. Although slavery was already abolished more than two years earlier by the Emancipation Proclamation, it continued in some areas.___UK economy shrinks 20% in a month to fall back to 2002 levelLONDON (AP) — The British economy has seen nearly two decades worth of growth wiped out as a result of the lockdown measures put in place as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The Office for National Statistics revealed Friday that the economy shrank by a colossal 20.4% in April, the first full month that the country was in its coronavirus lockdown. All areas of the economy were hit during the month, in particular pubs, education, health and car sales.___Starbucks creates own Black Lives Matter shirt for employeesSEATTLE (AP) — Starbucks is creating its own Black Lives Matter shirt for employees to wear if they choose. The move comes after the coffee chain reportedly initially banned employees from wearing Black Lives Matter gear. The T-shirt depicts protests signs with phrases including “Black Lives Matter,” “Speak Up” and “Time for Change.” Social media blew up over news reports that Starbucks had told employees in a memo they couldn’t wear Black Lives Matter shirts or other paraphernalia because it might be used to amplify divisiveness.___Pop open a bottle, California wine tasting rooms reopeningSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — California wineries popped open their bottles Friday and welcomed people to their tasting rooms as the state’s $145 billion tourism industry started gearing up with hotels, zoos, museums and aquariums allowed to reopen. With COVID-19 cases in the state still growing, the tourism industry is trying to balance how to implement safety measures to control a pandemic without ruining the fun. Hotels will limit people lounging by pools and attractions will require masks. Some parts are choosing to go slower than the state is allowing. San Francisco started outdoor restaurant dining Friday. Hotels there will not receive tourists until August.___The S&P 500 gained 39.21 points, or 1.3%, to 3,041.31. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 477.37 points, or 1.9%, to 25,605.54. The Nasdaq gained 96.08 points, or 1%, to 9,588.81. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies climbed 31.46 points, or 2.3%, to 1,387.68.Load-Date: June 12, 2020End of Document

SENATOR JERRY MORAN: PROTECTING AMERICANS FROM COVID-19 SCAMSStates News ServiceJuly 27, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 3676 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Kansas Senator Jerry Moran:Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them.Passing the NDAA and MOMS Leave ActThe Senate passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) this week, which authorizes funding for the Department of Defense and supports programs that support the men and women who serve in our military. This marks the 60th year in a row that the Senate has passed a bipartisan bill to strengthen our national defense. The men and women serving in our military work every day to keep us safe here at home and to defend our freedoms from threats around the world. The NDAA includes a pay raise for our troops, invests in the development of new technology, weapons and cybersecurity and provides resources to help our military families thrive. The bill also supports Kansas military bases and industries by investing in hypersonic weapons and prioritizing improvements to the KC-46 tanker.A number of my priorities were included in the bill, which will help servicemembers and veterans in Kansas and throughout the nation. This includes the Mothers of Military Service (MOMS) Leave Act, which will grant maternity leave to women serving in the National Guard and Reserve. This legislation would make certain that women serving in the National Guard and Reserve can take maternity leave without worrying about how it will affect their creditable military service. Women who serve our country should not be penalized for having a child, nor should they be expected to return to drill duties in the weeks following childbirth.The NDAA also included my bill, the FIRST Act, to allow the names of fallen Big Red One soldiers to be added to the First Division Monument that is located on the White House grounds. There are over 600 names of fallen soldiers dating back to Desert Storm that need to be added to this monument, and we are now closer than we've ever been to seeing this happen. The bill also includes a study that would look into unemployment issues facing women veterans of the post-9/11 era. The results of this study will inform future legislation to help strengthen the employment opportunities for women in this cohort. I also co-sponsored amendments that will improve access to mental health care for members of the National Guard and Reserve and enhance the country's ability to compete in the global semiconductor market.I am pleased that we were able to come together to pass this bipartisan bill that improves our national security and supports our servicemembers and their families.Protecting Americans from COVID-19 ScamsAs Chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Manufacturing, Trade and Consumer Protections, I convened a hearing on Tuesday to examine the rise of scams that are occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic and discuss what more can be done to protect the public from falling prey to these scams. I questioned witnesses, including the Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt and the Federal Trade Commission, on how they are cracking down on these predators and helping consumers become better informed. During this time of national emergency and coordinated recovery, there are fraudsters and scam artists that seek to take advantage of consumers, especially the most vulnerable communities like our nation's seniors. The variety of these increasingly complex and innovative scams remains exceedingly difficult for any consumer to wrap their head around, much less defend themselves against. Whether it be unsubstantiated health benefits advertised for certain products, illegal robocalls pitching low-priced health insurance, fraudulent donation solicitations, or even imposters claiming to be from federal agencies collecting mandatory payments, raising awareness to these harmful practices is critical to educating consumers in protecting themselves. I look forward to continue working with my Senate colleagues in protecting American consumers from these fraudulent practices.Introducing the RAMP-UP Act to Expand Markets for Small MeatpackersOn Thursday, I introduced the Requiring Assistance to Meat Processers for Upgrading Plants (RAMP-UP) Act, a bill that would provide grants to meat processors to make the improvements necessary to become federally inspected. Currently, meatpacking facilities can only make sales across state lines if they are federally inspected. Facilities that are state inspected can only sell their products within the state they are located, and custom-exempt processors can only process livestock for the exclusive use of the livestock owner.The RAMP-UP Act would provide grants to meatpacking plants for planning activities, facility upgrades and other necessary improvements to meet the standards necessary for federal inspections, increasing their market opportunities and encouraging interstate commerce. The importance of meatpacking facilities in Kansas has been especially clear during this pandemic as they work to meet a growing, nationwide demand for quality meat. By increasing small packer capacity and production, this legislation will strengthen the food supply chain for consumers and give cattle producers in Kansas more options to market their livestock.I recently introduced the Small Packer Overtime and Holiday Fee Relief COVID-19 Act that would support small, federally-inspected meatpacking plants that are operating longer hours during the COVID-19 pandemic to keep our supply chain moving. I will continue to work with my Senate colleagues to strengthen small meatpackers and improve markets for livestock producers.Speaking to the Artemis Generation: Organizing a Student QandA with Kansas Astronaut Nick HagueThis week, I partnered with the Cosmosphere, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine and Kansan and NASA Astronaut Nick Hague to host a virtual QandA for Kansas students interested in learning about careers in STEM fields and what it takes to be a part of the Artemis generation. Students were able to learn about the Artemis program, NASA's current mission to return Americans to the moon, and the jobs of several panelists, all with ties to the Cosmosphere.Through my role as chairman of the committee that funds NASA, I have the opportunity of working with Administrator Bridenstine to ensure the agency has the appropriate supplies and tools needed for the critical missions they conduct. One vital component NASA depends upon is talent. The Cosmosphere plays a critical role in teaching and inspiring our next generation of space explorers, in Kansas, and across the nation. I'm grateful to our panelists who participated in the event: Astronaut Nick Hague, Theresa Sindelar, and Charlie Garcia who dedicated their time in answering student questions. I am also grateful for Administrator Bridenstine for moderating the panel and the Cosmosphere for hosting this great event. I look forward to our continued work together in inspiring students in Kansas and across the nation.Hosting the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Director in KansasOn Saturday, I hosted the Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Aurelia Skipwith in Sedgwick and Stafford Counties to discuss ongoing FWS efforts in the state and to meet with farmers, ranchers and partners of our state's agricultural and natural resource associations.We began the day with a tour of the Great Plains Nature Center (GPNC) in Wichita, which serves as a resource of conservation and environmental education for the community and local school districts.. Thank you to GPNC Director Marc Murrell for leading an informative tour and Kansas House Majority Leader and Senator Dan Kerschen for joining.Our next stop was at the Quivira National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), which includes a water basin important for local agriculture and regional economy. We had the opportunity to meet with staff and local stakeholders, as well as tour the refuge. Thank you to Kansas Senators Carolyn McGinn and Mary Jo Taylor, as well as Representative Alicia Straub, for being with us.During my meeting with then Director-nominee Skipwith last October, I raised concerns regarding the water rights dispute surrounding the Quivira NWR. I explained the need for farmers and ranchers to be able to utilize groundwater in the basin. Director Skipwith committed to working with local stakeholders to find a voluntary solution to satisfy the Quivira water impairment. I was pleased to have Director Skipwith at the Quivira NWR this weekend and appreciate her continued commitment to finding solutions to the difficult challenges facing Kansas agriculture.Read more about my visit here in the Hutchison News.Emphasizing the Importance of Veteran Mental Health on the Senate FloorOn Tuesday, I spoke on the Senate floor to call attention to the growing issue of suicide among our veterans and to encourage my colleagues to support the Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act. Now is the time for the Senate to take a stand to protect the lives of veterans who have given so much for our nation. They have protected us and we need to protect them.Veteran suicide prevention has been one of my top priorities as Chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee (SVAC), and I have been working closely with the VA and the White House to improve upon and advance this legislation which will make necessary investments in suicide prevention services, innovative research and improvements to mental health care. We know there is not one single explanation or reason for suicide and there is no one single treatment or prevention strategy. While post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injuries are prominent among veterans and are known as an invisible wound of war, we now realize other conditions such as depression, anxiety and substance use disorder also contribute to suicide among veterans and all Americans. Our veterans are fighting new battles, and the stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated these issuesThe Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act will strengthen community organizations already providing support to veterans, bolster research efforts on brain and mental health conditions, expand upon telehealth partnerships to deliver better care to our veterans in rural areas, allow veterans to take advantage of emerging, complimentary and integrative treatments, and so much more. This bipartisan bill received a unanimous 17-0 vote in the Committee on Veterans' Affairs earlier this year, and the time for the full Senate to act is now.Sending Legislation to the PresidentExpanding Veteran SAH Grant Eligibility in Honor of Kansan Paul BenneThis week, the United States House of Representatives unanimously passed my bill, the Ryan Kules and Paul Benne Specially Adaptive Housing Improvement Act. This bill is now on its way to President Trump to be signed into law.My bill, named after Spring Hill, Kansas native Army Colonel (Ret.) Paul Benne and Captain (Ret.) Ryan Kules, will expand Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) grant eligibility for blind and seriously injured veterans. It will allow blind veterans to access this grant program and double the maximum number of awarded grants from 3 to 6 per veteran. It will also increase the number of authorized applications per fiscal year from 30 to 120. My bill will allow veterans to utilize vital SAH grants in a way that best fit their needs providing greater support and improving the quality of life for many of our nation's veterans.In 2013, Col. Benne developed a medical condition that led to his retirement from the U.S. Army after 23 years of service. Col. Benne was rated 100 percent disabled at the time of his retirement. In 2016, Col. Benne was fitted by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for a wheelchair and applied for an SAH grant, as neither the Benne's home nor vehicle could accommodate his new wheelchair. After more than a year of navigating the VA, Col. Benne and his wife, Christine, contacted me for assistance. Within three months of working with Col. Benne to engage the VA, Col. Benne was given a favorable decision on his adaptive housing claim and provided SAH grants.I want to thank both the Benne and Kules families for their service and advocacy. Their willingness to share their stories significantly contributed to this legislation being passed by Congress. Sadly, Col. Benne passed away in December, 2019 due to complications from his disability. While he was unable to personally see this legislation signed into law, I spoke with Christine after it passed the House of Representatives to let her know that its passage was in Col. Benne's honor. I look forward the President Trump signing this bill into law to help blind and disabled veterans adapt their homes and improve their quality of life.Providing Legal Protections for Servicemembers During COVID-19This week the U.S. House of Representatives passed S. 3637, my bipartisan legislation, which I introduced with SVAC Ranking Member Jon Tester (D-MT), to amend the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) and provide additional legal protections for members of the military impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. The bill now heads to the President's desk to be signed into law. This legislation expands SCRA protections to servicemembers who were previously issued orders to change duty stations but, due to the pandemic, received a stop movement order from the Department of Defense (DoD) and now may have a housing or car lease in two different locations.This will positively impact our military members in Kansas and across the nation and ensure they are not financially burdened by two leases due to DoD's stop movement orders. I am pleased the U.S. House of Representatives voted to advance my legislation and look forward to it arriving on the president's desk.Working Towards Equity for Women and Minority VeteransOn Wednesday, I hosted a Senate VA Committee roundtable discussion on issues faced by women and minority veterans with key partners and stakeholders from across the federal government and numerous veteran service organizations. We discussed the challenges that these veterans face in getting VA care and services and the disparities in utilization of VA benefits among minority veterans and their non-minority counterparts. Women and minorities have served in our military to defend our nation since the first days of our republic, and as they serve in greater and greater numbers, it is important that today's VA works for them. This roundtable discussion was substantive, candid and afforded an opportunity to learn a great deal, from both the VA and from veterans themselves, which will help us create better and more equitable outcomes for veterans, regardless of their race or gender. I look forward to continuing to work with the VA, veterans' advocates and my colleagues in Congress to make certain that every veteran who has served our nation gets the care and service they have earned.Condemning Human Rights Violations in ChinaAdditional information on the Chinese government's treatment of its Uyghur minorities, primarily Muslims, have recently come to light that are shocking. A video showing Uyghurs being loaded onto trains to be sent to camps for forced labor and "re-education" emerged, and reporting has provided the dehumanizing details on life inside these camps. Uyghur women, for example, are subject to forced sterilizations and abortions in an effort to reduce the population. What is happening is appalling, and Chinese officials must continue to be held accountable. I am pleased that the Trump Administration has imposed sanctions provided for by the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act passed in May, which I co-sponsored, but additional sanctions should be forthcoming. I will continue to work with my colleagues to defend human rights around the world.Introducing Kansan C.J. Mahoney to the Senate Committee on Foreign RelationsOn Tuesday, I had the privilege to introduce Ambassador C.J. Mahoney before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. A native of Russell, C.J. is currently the Deputy United States Trade Representative and has been nominated to become Legal Adviser for the Department of State. Over the past two years in his current role, C.J. was instrumental in brokering the USMCA trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, as well as working with both sides of the aisle in Congress to get the agreement passed. I shared with the committee that I was recently in Russell, and many were asking about C.J., a testament to how fondly he is remembered in his hometown. Endorsed by numerous former Legal Advisers, I assured my colleagues on the committee that C.J.'s education, professional experience, and character will make for an outstanding Legal Adviser. I expect the committee will approve his nomination quickly, and I look forward to actively supporting C.J. on the Senate floor.Introducing Legislation for National Guard SurvivorsThis week, I introduced S. 4287, the COVID-19 Benefits for Active Duty Servicemembers, the Reserve Components, and their Survivors Act of 2020, alongside my colleagues on the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees. This bipartisan legislation would expand survivor benefits for family members of the Reserve Components, who are activated under federal orders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and pass away in their line of duty. This bill would also create an avenue for our nation's Reserve Components to apply for a service-connected disability due to their service in response to COVID-19.All of our servicemembers, whether active duty or as a member of our Reserve Components, have stepped up and served their fellow Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic, risking exposing themselves to the virus. I have introduced this bill to make certain that any servicemember who dies or is medically impacted due to their service during this pandemic, may now be entitled to the VA benefits they deserve. I will work to get this legislation passed and signed into law quickly to provide servicemembers and their families more certainty during this time. As chairman of SVAC, I will continue to prioritize the health and lives of our servicemembers who consistently put their lives on the line for our safety.Participating in a Senate Commerce Hearing on SpectrumAs a member of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation, and the Internet, I questioned witnesses in a hearing on Thursday about the federal government's role in telecommunications spectrum management and policy. For the United States to be a leader in 5G mobile technology, spectrum must be commercialized for development by the telecommunications industry. Government agencies need to coordinate to free up spectrum expediently and responsibly for this purpose, and there must be an effective and transparent process to govern this decision-making. I will continue to work with my colleagues on the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee to make certain the government is effectively working to allow innovation to take place while promoting economic competitiveness.Meeting with KFB Board MembersOn Sunday, I stopped by the Kansas Farm Bureau's office where I visited with President Rich Felts and the Board of Directors during their quarterly board meeting. We discussed the current state of the agriculture economy in the midst of COVID-19, including the several disruptions in markets and supply chains due to COVID-19 and the significant economic damage to Kansas producers. Thank you to President Felts and the Board members for the opportunity to join you.Recognizing Kansas Olympian and Former Congressman Jim RyunMy former colleague Jim Ryun was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Friday. From being the first high schooler to break the 4-minute mile while at Wichita East High School, to standing on the podium at the Olympic Games, to serving as a Kansas Congressman, Jim has combined his passion and incredible work ethic to represent and serve both Kansas and the country.This past week, I saw Jim running (what looked like a 4-minute mile) on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. It was great to congratulate Jim in person on this well-deserved honor. You have made Kansans proud.Read more about Jim here in the Wichita Eagle here.Visiting HaysOn Friday, I stopped by Hays and had the opportunity to speak with locals, including business owners and employees. I enjoyed hearing everyone's perspectives, their ideas for additional relief Congress could provide in a Phase IV package and how the Paycheck Protection Program helped local businesses keep employees on their payroll. I also spoke to Ellis County Sheriff Ed Harbin and Court Deputy John Walz. Thank you to everyone who took the time to speak with me.Remembering Dick BondDick Bond dedicated his life to service, including more than a decade in the Kansas State Senate. He worked diligently behind the scenes on behalf of Kansans for decades before running for office himself, demonstrating his dedication to improving Kansan lives. Our state is a better place because of his public service, and I am a better person because of his friendship. Robba and I are saddened to hear of his passing and send our heartfelt prayers to his wife Sue and his family.Read about Dick's contributions to Kansas here in KCUR.Honored to Serve You in WashingtonIt is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the words of Kansans, whether in the form of a letter, a Facebook comment, or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard.Please let me know how I can be of assistance. You can contact me by email by clicking here. You can also click here to contact me through one of my Kansas offices or my Washington, D.C., office.Load-Date: July 27, 2020End of Document

The 7 Magnificent: the young medical talents who know most about coronavirus in ArgentinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 23, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1810 wordsBodyJust over two years ago, when she sent the resume, Clara wouldn't have imagined having to be pasting a Chinese government statement into Google's translator to see what steps they took to prevent a virus that became a pandemic. Nor would Sofia have believed that she would be standing in front of an auditorium of experts in North Carolina explaining the research she had done. Or would Julian, on one of his bus and train trips from San Isidro to Flores, would not have suspected that he would now be recruiting patients with recent symptoms of coronavirus? for plasma research."They are exceptional," sumsup Fernando Polack, the director of the Infant Foundation and a kind of technical director of these young medical talents he calls "The Magnificent 7s.""The boys have been working with us for a while. Most were already in international conferences and participated in research, but when the pandemic began they formed a kind of task support commando group," he says.Each of these seven talents of the University of Buenos Aires (UBA) was assigned a country. Here Polack instead of a technical director could enter the role of The Professor of The Paper House. And he handed out the letters: United States, China, Germany, Italy, Spain... The task was to put together a database with a detailed follow-up of each experience. When did you get your first case? What action did that country take? Was the health system prepared to deal with a pandemic? What technology tools did you use?WhatsApp's group is called "The Sofias". And the explanation is not very scrat: of the seven three members they are called that. To be ready: Sofia Aranda, Sofia Jares, Sofia Laudanno (the reasons for the name of the group), Clara Sánchez Yanotti, Florence Nowogrodzki, Julian De Luca and Juan Gutman. Even this production of Clarín did not have a picture in which the seven were together.The future has comeThe boys agree that they are balancing in a contradiction:on the one hand they are not pleased to be part of a pandemic that paralyzed everyone's daily daily life, but in turn they are excited by the window that opened up to their vocation this context. A new universe to research, study, search for answers."As an experience this is something unique. It makes us grow as professionals and also on a personal level. When the pandemic started, it was my turn to analyze what was going on in South Korea? And face the texts in Korean... it got complicated," says Julian (24) who lives in San Isidro and has art as a wire to land: he studied singing, plays guitar and also dabbled in acting. He says that for football he has "two left legs" and that that frustration led him to other hobbies.Sofia Aranda (25) received her doctor in March, just a week before isolation declined. Even the title process was paused and you will have to wait for the activities to resume. He lives in San Telmo, studied at the Avellaneda School of Popular Music and carries the rhythm in his blood. Their mom is a tango dancer and they have done a duet in local bars. "I've always wanted to do research," he says. When I was 4, she said she wanted to be an astronaut and by 5 she wanted to be a scientist. Then, at 12 when I went on vacation to Puerto Madryn, I fell in love with a marine biology museum. I mean, I always liked science."And now? "And now every day seems like something new, you don't have time to get bored. It's a love-hate relationship with the pandemic. On the one hand it is exhausting, we do not have schedules, you work when you have to work. But we like itwhat we do and that's the most important thing."Clara's family (25) lives in Cipoletti and since the pandemic began they are more in touch than before. "There they also have community contagions, so we look alike," he warns.In the beginning, the first link in the coronavirus was set to the situation in China. And beyond also having the logical obstacle of the language, it highlights the rapid reflexes that were activated in Wugan to isolate the city."We are now working with the plasma assessment of convalescents. As the patient to enter has to have less than 48 hours since the symptoms were detected it is super difficult to identify them so quickly. And I'm learning a lot, I hadn't worked in clinical trials. We realize what it's like to work with the times on a pandemic: everything is urgent."Florence (24) is taken as the voice authorized to speak of the pandemic. As with many doctors, it is responsible for clarifying that there are still many unanswered questions. "It's an ugly and stressful situation for everyone, but inside everything dark for us is a challenging, fun thing. It makes you want to get up and read, inform yourself."Quarantine? put a stop to one of his passions, hockey. He can no longer go to the Italian Club where he played 10 years ago. Although in return the insulation gave him more time for another of his tastes, the kitchen. "I'm a vegetarian so I try to meet new meals or cook things differently. I make a sweet potato brownie that I love."Florence, who is in Infant two years ago and who previously worked on a preterm research, took care of studying the day-to-day life of Italy?. "I think when the coronavirus came to Europe the world had not yet become aware of what was going on. There was the example of China, obvious; but, being culturally so different, the decisions to be made were also different."Juan Gutman (26) is the group's biologist. She received last year and dreams of working on research and being able to collaborate with some discovery that may have an impact on public health."It's very stimulating what we're living. I feel part of such a huge problem... And it's interesting to see what strategy each country takes at the pandemic not only because of its culture but also because of the different assessments that the government in turn gives to science and the recommendations of the experts."Sofia Jares (24) has two finals left to receive. He was born in Madrid and lived there until he was 9 years old. He now resides in Palermo with his family. He studied French, likes to cook and in 2018 was working for three months in Dublin to improve his level of English.Did she want to analyze Singapore?. "I was surprised that I had an impressive level of pre-preparation. They didn't start from scratch like they did here in Latin America. As he had suffered a great deal with the 2008 pandemic (H1N1 influenza) he already had care centres ready and immediately set to work to test for the virus. And it is interesting to see that there are measures that can be taken according to each culture: for example, in Korea or In Singapore they have a lot of computer control of the population, by means of an application the cell phone tracks you contacts or follow the expenses of your card... That's harder here."Now she's excited about the study of convalescent plasma. "It's great because it's more applied to medicine, to seek treatment, a form of prevention."For Sofia Laudanno (24) medicine is part of her everyday scenario. He lives in School with his dad who is head of gastroenterology, with his motherwho is a biochemist in the Malrán and with his sister who is studying in the faculty. "In the early years of my course no one has any idea what research is, so it's a new world. I've never read a paper in my life," he says.In Infant he started working on a hygiene project, then followed with another on interferons, a substance that secretes the cells in response to a viral agent. And thanks to that research he traveled to a Congress in North Carolina and presented himself to an auditorium of experts. "My legs were shaking a little, I was so scared. But they super prepared me, they made me practice, it was very good."Sofia sings and was the voice of a cumbia band that played in bars and clubs. She studied Chinese, studied French, likes to read, is now hooked on the feminist theme and with a book by Malén Denis.When the pandemic started, did you have to analyze the U.S. case. "We immediately noticed that the eastern model was much better than the Western model." The worst thing is that I had to analyze state by state, I couldn't get into the U.S. government's website to see the global determinations. Everyone did what they wanted. It was chaos."From the classroom to the labIf Polack is the current technical director of these seven youngsters, previously Jorge Geffner acted as headhunter. He is the director of the chair of Immunology, a subject that is completed in the third year of the Faculty of Medicine. They pass around 1,800 students through their classrooms per year and, to have a more personalized round trip, set up an assistant school made up of students who are taking the last stretch of the race or recently received."This group is barbaric. Look, I'm over 64, I've been teaching at university for 30 years, and these guys are awesome. They don't fail once. It's one of the cutest achievements of my life. The motivation these kids have is tremendous. And I'm already half-jovato excited," Geffner says of the group of students who are now working with Polack at the Infant Institute.First of all, they're a very smart, very motivated bunch of guys, adds. And that in 20 years they can project themselves as the leaders of medicine in the country. They have restlessness, ability, intelligence that positions them to reach a global level. An example: they all have some article published in an indexed research journal. That's something that can be achieved at 40 years or so. Well, they've done it by the age of twenty-three."Both point out that there are more talents peeking out. A group of students is engaged in a job in partnership with the Hospital of Clinics also of plasma of convalescents but with severe patients. Others collaborate with PAMI?. And there are more young people, also of assistants of the subject Immunology, who work in the Faculty of Medicine with sample reception for diagnostic detection of Covid-19.The plasma factoryAt the Infant Foundation a team of doctors led by Fernando Polack aims to detect the Covid-19 when he hints at the first symptoms. And neutralize it thanks to convalescent plasma, which is the fluid in the blood that has antibodies.This project is carried out by the seven young talents who, in connection with the Ministry of Health and municipalities, manage the search for people over 65 who are taking the first 48 hours of symptoms of the virus to include them in the protocol.As Polack explained in a note with this diary, the "plasma machine" would prove to be a key tool against coronavirus "as long as there is no vaccine".Patient plasmarecovered has been used for decades to treat infectious diseases, including Ebola, H1N1 influenza and Mers.The goal of the study is to see if plasma may be reduced to a viral cold sooner rather than later.DdLoad-Date: June 24, 2020End of Document

US enemies bring back criticism of human rights careCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 1, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 743 wordsBodyCountries routinely criticized about human rights violations by Washington have turned back on accusations at a time when several U.S. cities are the scene of protests outraged by police brutality against the black population.The strongest convictions came from China, which days ago faced US measures because of its decision to tighten controls on Hong Kong.Iran, with numerous officials punished by U.S. sanctions for suppressing protests in November, also took the opportunity to criticize it.The United States is experiencing one of its worst uprisings in 50 years, with dozens of cities under curfew following George Floyd's Minneapolis death. The African-American died during his arrest when a white policeman immobilized him with his knee in his neck for nearly nine minutes, and he begged "I can't breathe.""Racism against ethnic minorities in the United States is a chronic disease of American society," said China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian."The current situation once again reflects the seriousness of the problems of racism and police violence in the United States," he told reporters in Beijing.Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi echoed the language frequently expressed by President Donald Trump's administration in support of clerical state opponents."To the American people: the world has heard their protest at the state of oppression. The world is on their side," Mousavi said in English in Tehran."And American officials and police: stop the violence against your people and let them breathe," he added.On social media, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted a State Department conviction to Iran in which he exchanged the names of the two countries.- "Pleasure and comfort" -Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, deplored Chinese officials having "some kind of pleasure and comfort in what they're seeing" in the United States.Americans seeking reparations "will not be imprisoned for peacefully protesting. There's a difference between us and you," he told ABC News.Many demonstrations have been peaceful, but activists have accused police of using excessive force in a series of incidents.O'Brien added Zimbabwe among "foreign adversaries" who may be enjoying the scenes in the American country.Zimbabwe summoned the ambassador to protest O'Brien's comments.- Deflect from attention? -Analysts indicate, however, that China and Iran are not examples of rights.Activists have denounced China's one million Uighurs and other Turkish Muslims in a vast network of "re-education" camps.In Guangzhou, African residents said police forcibly evicted them this year and that they were denied service in shops and restaurants in the context of the pandemic.In Iran, a lawmaker acknowledged Monday that 230 people were killed in last year's protests, sparked by an increase in the price of fuel, although outside groups say the number was much higher."Like all countries, the United States has never been perfect when it comes to human rights. Nothing further from reality," said Rob Berschinski, senior vice president of politics at Human Rights First."But the fact that a human rights defender like me can say this openly is what sets the United States and other free countries apart from countries like China and Iran," he said."When the Chinese governments andIranian criticizes demonstrations in the United States, they do so to distract from their own records, not because they care about racial injustice," he said.Berschinski, who served in the State Department in Barack Obama's administration, said trump injured the cause, even by calling on Twitter to shoot the looters."When American citizens are brutalized by our police and national leaders like President Trump promote violence, of course, America's ability to speak credity-friendly about human rights abroad is harmed," he said.Protests in solidarity, including Britain, Ireland and New Zealand, have taken place in allied countries in the United States.Trump has not been criticized by those governments. Among them, a spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the violence "very alarming" and expressed concern about the arrests of journalists, including at least one British citizen.A spokesman for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said U.S. police should show restraint "as in any other country in the world" and that officers around the world need human rights training.sct-fff/bgs/mls/dgaLoad-Date: June 2, 2020End of Document

Take a closer look at Instagram Reels, Facebook's TikTok rival coming to the US next monthBusiness Insider USJuly 19, 2020 Sunday 12:16 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1236 wordsByline: pleskin@businessinsider.com,  (Paige Leskin)Body• Instagram Reels, Facebook's competitor to TikTok, is expected to roll out in early August to users in the US and several other countries. It's already being tested in India, Brazil, France, and Germany.• Reels is a new format for Instagram Stories that allows users to create and share short-form video content on the Explore page and with followers.• Here's everything you need to know about Reels' launch and how it works.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.Facebook's attempt to compete with TikTok - a new short-form video format on Instagram - is expected to roll out in early August to users in the US.Reels, which will live inside of the app's Stories feature, allows users to record and edit short-form videos with audio and music soundtracks - akin to what users already do on TikTok. Facebook first started testing Reels with users in Brazil in November, before rolling out last month to France and Germany.The debut of Instagram's Reels in the US - and in India in early July, as reported by Business Insider India - comes as concerns over TikTok's livelihood in both countries has created an opening in short-form video-sharing. The Indian government recently banned new user downloads of TikTok and other Chinese apps amid a bloody border dispute with China. In the US, the Trump administration is weighing a country-wide ban on TikTok due to its ties to China, where the app's parent company ByteDance is based. Nevertheless, TikTok is wildly popular: It has more than 2 billion global downloads and an estimated US userbase at as high as 80 million.Several tech companies have come out with apps similar to TikTok, but no platform has yet to successfully rival TikTok's viral reach. But it looks like Facebook is putting its full weight behind Reels, and trying to capitalize on Instagram's popularity among a younger audience and success with copying other platform's big features - most notably, Snapchat Stories.Instagram has been tight-lipped thus far about how Reels is being received in other countries, so there's not a lot we know about the new format ahead of its US launch. Here's everything we know so far about how Instagram Reels will work: Why is Instagram Reels such a big deal?In just a few years of its existence, TikTok has become a staple of internet culture and social interaction for Generation Z. The app has more than 2 billion all-time downloads, thanks to its flurry of short-form videos where users participate in viral challenges, lip sync and dance to music, show off comedic skits, and share their hot takes on society at large. It's quickly become a social media powerhouse, outperforming US-based apps that have attracted younger audiences - including Instagram. But Facebook's first attempt at competing with TikTok was a failure. The company launched an app called Lasso in November 2018, but it failed to gain traction: Lasso had fewer than 600,000 downloads, according to Sensor Tower. Lasso shut down on July 10, making way for Facebook to throw all its short-video efforts behind Instagram Reels.Facebook is notorious for copying other platform's popular formats and features and bringing them to its own apps - with rousing success. Most notably, Facebook cloned Snap's Stories feature and brought it to Instagram, where it was wildly more popular than it ever was on Snapchat. Why is Instagram rolling out Reels to the US now?It's unclear how long Facebook has been readying Reels for an August launch, but the timing is particularly convenient.The Trump administration has increased its pressure on TikTok recently after months of scrutinizing the platform's ties to China, where its parent company ByteDance is based. Earlier this month, President Trump threatened to ban TikTok for what he said was punishment for the coronavirus. Others have called for TikTok's ban in the US due to concerns over how much access and influence the Chinese government is afforded over user data and content moderation.The imminent threat of TikTok disappearing has led both users and creators to panic, and scramble to find similar platforms where they can continue creating content in case TikTok disappears. Instagram Reels may be one of those platforms to which users migrate. What's the difference between Instagram Reels and TikTok?Until we actually get our hands on using Instagram Reels, the differences are not clear. It appears that Reels videos are limited to 15 seconds, while TikTok extended the maximum length of its videos to 60 seconds earlier this year.It's also not clear what kind of partnerships Facebook has struck up with music labels and agencies to allow Instagram users access to music and audio for Reels videos. But Facebook did recently announce it's soon launching licensed music videos, which could indicate the company is working on these partnerships. As for similarities drawn between TikTok and Reels, an Instagram spokesperson said in a statement that "no two services are the same.""TikTok specifically has harnessed real consumer behavior, and done amazing things. We've also seen the rise of short-form video on Instagram, and think we can create something in a way that makes sense for our community," the spokesperson told Business Insider. "This responsiveness to consumer demand is competition at work and one of the longtime hallmarks of the tech sector. It increases choice, which is good for people." How will I know which posts on Instagram are Reels?Instagram has provided some basic screenshots of what Reels will look like when it launches. When scrolling through your home feed or Explore page, you'll be able to tell which posts are Reels clips by a clapperboard icon in the bottom-left corner. What will Reels videos look like on Instagram?On the surface, it seems viewing Reels will be a similar experience as viewing TikTok videos: You can like or comment on videos, and click through to see what audio track was used in a specific video. It's not clear if you're able to scroll vertically through videos - akin to TikTok's addictive "For You" feed" - or if you have to navigate back to the Explore page to find more Reels. Where can I find all of an individual user's Reels?A new tab will be added to users' profiles to showcase all their Reels in one place. The tab will live alongside the traditional grid of recent posts, as well as tabs for viewing IGTV videos or videos a user was tagged in. How do you create a Reels video on Instagram?Instagram has said that the Reels video format will live inside of Stories, which users can create in the top-left corner of the Home feed. It appears that Instagram is updating the Rolodex of options at the bottom of the screen - for creating Live videos, text posts, or Boomerangs - to add a tab for Reels. The creation process for Reels appears similar to that on TikTok, but it remains to be seen how seamless of an experience it is compared with TikTok's video-creating ease. When will Reels be available in my country?Facebook first started testing Reels with users in Brazil in November, before rolling out last month to France and Germany. Reels then rolled out in India earlier this month, Business Insider India reported.The planned rollout for early August is reportedly a global launch: Reels will debut not only in the US, but also in the United Kingdom, Japan, Mexico, and around 50 other countries, according to NBC News.Read the original article on Load-Date: August 5, 2020End of Document

Spain to unveil its opinion on Huawei in late autumn, after US electionsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 17, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 330 wordsBodyThe Spanish Government shall remain cautious with regard to Huawei, without giving an open opinion in the case. As the Eponomist of sources who know the situation has known, the multiple geopolitical, economic, business and technological variables invite us to act with the utmost caution. In this way, the Spanish administration does not contemplate following in the footsteps of the United Kingdom, a country that has vetoed the Chinese company for the development of the 5G. For the time being, the Executive's plans place any performance until the end of the fall. In addition to these implications, there is one detail that does not escape Moncloa: elections will be held in the United States on 3 November and the outcome of these elections could alter the situation.Donald Trump's obvious encouragement against Huawei may not exist on the assumption that the tenant of the Banking House is the Democratic nominee.   The government will therefore see the face of future developments to act accordingly.Other sources in the sector point to this newspaper that any element of distortion or uncertainty will affect their long-term investments, but without ruling on the matter, being left out of tension between the United States and China.According to the analysts consulted, the situation is summed up in a few words: there are no objective or technical arguments to doubt the quality and safety of Huawei's infrastructures, but geopolitical noise conditions company managers.On the other hand, and in the face of US restrictions on obtaining visas to Huawei employees, the Chinese company claims to feel "disappointed". "Huawei operates independently of the Chinese government. We are a private company, controlled by its workers," he reiterates in response to the accusations raised by Washington, which suspects its alleged links to the Asian country's intelligence and considers it a risk to its national security.commentsforum0WhatsApp  Facebook  Twitter  Linkedin       Load-Date: July 18, 2020End of Document

Dictators are Besieging Internet Freedom—and Trump Just Opened the GatesNewsweek.comJune 22, 2020 Monday 2:43 PM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 909 wordsByline: Raphael MimounHighlight: The Trump administration is quietly dismantling the Open Technology Fund, the tiny but impactful agency that seeded projects like Signal, Tails OS and WireGuard—vital to activists and journalists in places like China and IranBodyLast week, the Trump administration started dismantling one of the US government's most impactful agencies, the Open Technology Fund, which supports projects to counteract repressive censorship and surveillance around the world. The drastic move, coming at a time of global repression against activists and unprecedented digital threats, endangers the lives of human rights defenders and the privacy of all internet users.The Open Technology Fund, or OTF, is relatively new, founded in 2012 as a program of the government-backed Radio Free Asia. In 2019, it became an independent non-profit reporting to the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM). Since its founding, the organization has funded dozens of projects now part of the toolkit of millions of rights advocates and journalists around the world. But OTF is now under attack: the new leadership of USAGM, appointed just weeks ago, fired the leadership of all USAGM entities, including            OTF, dismissed OTF's independent and bipartisan board of directors, and is threatening to            hollow out OTF altogether.This is despite the fact that OTF has a robust track-record, particularly for such a young organization. For example, it incubated Signal, now considered one of the most private communication apps in the world. Signal is used by US policymakers, human rights defenders, and journalists alike—as well as millions of privacy-wary citizens. Another OTF-supported project is Tails,            described as "one of the most secure operating systems in the world". The operating system, installed on a USB drive, leaves no trace on the computer it is used on, providing robust privacy and anonymity to thousands of journalists.Many of those tools help those who most need it, where surveillance, censorship, and repression is most acute. Just last month, Delta Chat declined a request for user data from Russia's communication regulator—because the security architecture developed with OTF support meant it did not have any data to handover.            FreeWechat, which publishes posts censored by the Chinese government on the app WeChat, has been visited over 7 million times by Chinese-speakers. Dozens more OTF-funded tools enable millions to evade surveillance by autocratic governments and access the open internet, from Cuba to Hong Kong and Iran.OTF's work is critical to human rights defenders and journalists, but it brings privacy and security far beyond those groups. OTF only supports open-source projects, meaning that the code used must be available for anyone to view and reuse. This follows the logic of "Public Money, Public Code": if code is developed using taxpayers dollars, then that code should be freely available to citizens. That logic has meant that OTF-supported technology often ends up in mainstream products we all use everyday. The technology underpinning Signal has been adopted in countless other apps, including WhatsApp and its 2 billion users. WireGuard, a new cryptographic protocol funded by OTF, is being adopted by            dozens of VPN companies and is widely seen as the future of VPN technology.But OTF's work on internet freedom isn't limited to funding technology development. The organization takes a holistic approach to internet freedom, providing life-saving training and capacity-building to groups directly targeted by cyberattacks, harassment, and violence: LGBTQI advocates in Indonesia, journalists in Mexico, civic activists in Belarus, or exiled Tibetan organizations. OTF also funds events bringing together researchers, technologists, policy-makers, and advocates. Those gatherings—whether global like the Internet Freedom Festival or focused on specific countries or regions like the Iran Cyber Dialogue, the Vietnam Cyber Dialogue, or the Forum on Internet Freedom in Africa--have been transformative. They have helped build a tight community in a space where trust is hard to achieve. Without such events, many of the projects, tools, and collaborations to circumvent censorship and counter surveillance would not exist.Despite these notable results, OTF operates on a tiny budget by US government standards—a mere $15 million per year on average. With a team of just a dozen staff, the vast majority of the funds goes directly to projects, maximizing the impact per dollar spent. OTF is also strikingly transparent, publishing monthly and yearly reports on how it allocates funds. The efforts to dismantle OTF is all the more unsettling because the organization has enjoyed broad bipartisan support. In fact, a bill to safeguard and institutionalize the fund's mission was            introduced to the House of Representatives, with            accompanying legislation in the Senate and supporters on both sides of the aisle.The impact of the Open Technology Fund is hard to overstate. In less than a decade, OTF has become a pillar of the human rights community and has already left a mark on the broader internet ecosystem. The attack by the new USAGM leadership is a threat to human rights defenders, journalists, and vulnerable communities around the world, and it is a threat to digital privacy in general. The Open Technology Fund must be protected.Raphael Mimoun is the founder of            Horizontal, a human rights technology organization. One of Horizontal's projects,            Tella, is supported by the Open Technology Fund. The views expressed in this article are the author's own.​​​​​Link to ImageGraphic trumpdeskSaul Loeb/GettyUS President Donald Trump listens during a roundtable meeting on seniors in the Cabinet Room at the White House in Washington, DC, June 15, 2020Load-Date: June 22, 2020End of Document

Sen. Cruz Joins AEI's 'What the Hell is Going On' PodcastTargeted News ServiceJune 6, 2020 Saturday 8:41 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1058 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: HOUSTON, Texas BodySen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, issued the following news release:U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) joined the American Enterprise Institute's 'What the Hell is Going On' podcast with hosts Danielle Pletka and Marc Thiessen for a wide-ranging discussion on George Floyd's tragic death, the violent riots breaking out across the country, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the Chinese Communist Party's responsibility for endangering millions of lives, and the catastrophic Obama-Iran nuclear deal.On the death of George Floyd and police brutality:"What the police officer did there was completely wrong. It was police brutality. It was grotesque. He kept his knee on Mr. Floyd's neck for eight full minutes while Mr. Floyd was handcuffed, while he was incapacitated. And I think it is the right thing that the U.S. Department of Justice launched a civil rights investigation. I think it's the right thing that the prosecutors have brought a homicide case based on the evidence. There's no legitimate law enforcement purpose for what happened to George Floyd. And I think people all across the country rightly and understandably exercised their First Amendment rights to speak out against racial injustice, to speak out against police brutality."On the riots erupting throughout the country:"I think violent criminals cynically decided to exploit and take advantage of those protests, and began engaging in looting, began engaging in violence, began engaging in assaulting police officers, and burning police cars, and murdering police officers, and burning our cities. And it is horrific. It's something our country has not seen on this scale in my lifetime. And I think we need to stop it now."I think it's incumbent on the president, the attorney general, governors, mayors, police chiefs, to stop the violence and keep people safe. And we need to use every law enforcement tool we have to prevent these criminals from jeopardizing peoples' lives.""Unfortunately, you've got too many elected politicians who are playing politics with this, who have decided it is beneficial to them politically not to stop these riots. And you've also got organized groups like Antifa that are helping fuel the violence. And for two years, I've been calling on the president to designate Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization. And thankfully, this past week, the president announced he was going to do that."On the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the Chinese Communist Party's responsibility for endangering millions of lives:"The Chinese Communist government bears very real and direct responsibility for the over 300,000 lives that have been lost to the coronavirus pandemic."The Chinese Communist government lies, and it engages in propaganda, and it engages in torture, and kidnapping, and murder. [...] If you look at the coronavirus pandemic, I believe the most significant foreign policy consequence of this pandemic is going to be a fundamental reassessment of our relationship with China."We need to work to decouple our economy from China. In particular, to decouple the critical infrastructure, the lifesaving medicines that we need so that we're not dependent and vulnerable to the Chinese Communist government."I've introduced harsh sanctions on Chinese officials who engaged in censorship of coronavirus and critical health related information. We've always thought of censorship as a human rights issue. Now we see that it's a public health issue and a national security issue as well. So that is another step in terms of directly penalizing those Chinese officials who are responsible."On the catastrophic Obama-Iran Nuclear deal:"The Iran deal was an area that Trump and I explicitly disagreed with on the campaign trail when we were running against each other in 2016. I pledged that if I was elected on the first day in office, I would move the embassy to Jerusalem and on the first day in office I would rip the Iran deal to shreds. Trump disagreed with me on the Iran deal. He said he was not going to rip it to shreds. He was going to renegotiate instead. Fast forward to the Trump administration. I made the case vigorously and repeatedly to the president. He ended up agreeing with me and pulling out of the deal, overruling both State and Defense. I think that is the single most important foreign policy decision that has been made in the entire Trump administration.""I think there are a lot of career folks at State. I think there are a lot of career folks at Treasury who, frankly, are supporters of the Iran deal and want to see it come back. They want to see Trump lose. They want a Democratic president, and they want to reinstate the Iran deal. And I think they're digging in and fighting at every stage."I am hopeful that we will exercise snapback, that we will re-impose sanctions, worldwide sanctions on Iran. State has been mightily resistant. I've been publicly calling for us to exercise snapback. I think there's a good chance the Trump administration will do it, but getting them there has taken vigorous encouragement and vigorous persuasion."Listen to the episode here https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/wth-is-going-on-in-america-sen-ted-cruz-on-george-floyd/id1467993804?i=1000476843565.

Hong Kong is gone. It's over.Business Insider USJuly 1, 2020 Wednesday 02:00 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1636 wordsByline: hblodget@businessinsider.com,  (Henry Blodget)Highlight: China's security law means that Hong Kong's time as an open society is over. And Trump's ineffectiveness helped push the situation there.BodyHello, everyone! Welcome to the new edition of Insider Today. Please sign up here.QUOTE OF THE DAY"We are living in an Idiocracy." - Washington Post conservative columnist Max Boot bemoaning the stupidity of the Federal government's refusal to advocate ubiquitous mask wearing and thereby save 5% of GDP.WHAT'S HAPPENINGHong Kong police arrested more than 300 people protesting a new security law imposed by China. Police say nine arrests were under the new law, which criminalizes any speech promoting Hong Kong's independence from China.Seattle Police are clearing the CHOP protest zone. On Wednesday morning the mayor declared the area an unlawful assembly, and more than 100 officers from Seattle police and FBI are sweeping it. There have been four shootings in CHOP's brief existence as a police-free zone, including one on Monday that killed a 16-year-old. We're six months into the coronavirus crisis, and there's a lot we still don't know. Where it came from. The mortality rate. Why the young get less sick. What actually kills people. How it spreads. The 11 questions we need to answer to defeat the pandemic. Republican leaders finally embrace masks - except for President Trump. Conservative media and politicians who shunned masks are praising them now that the pandemic is racing through red states. Fox News's Steve Doocy said, "'MAGA' should now stand for 'Masks Are Great Again.'"   A new theory for why "Sun Belt" states are getting hammered... air-conditioning.  A Harvard epidemiologist suggests that hot weather in the south may be driving people inside where they "re-breathe" air circulated by air-conditioning. Tuberculosis can spread this way. Maybe coronavirus, too.On the other hand, Trump reportedly expects a vaccine in the fall. There's just no way that's happening. It's his latest example of magical thinking about the coronavirus.VIEWS OF THE DAYSkyrocketing coronavirus cases in Arizona, Texas, and Florida are slowing the economic recovery."Lockdowns" may have worsened the economic impact of the coronavirus, but they didn't cause it. The main reason our economy has been crippled is because Americans are, wisely, changing their behavior to reduce the chance of getting sick.This sensible caution - and the economic impact that results from it - are visible in this chart of restaurant reservations in Arizona, Texas, and Florida. Economist Paul Krugman posted the chart, which is based on data from restaurant reservations app OpenTable. The chart shows the seven-day median of restaurant activity in the three states. The index is still down 50%-60% from last year.Paul Krugman/TwitterMore broadly, the recovery of the US economy as a whole also appears to be slowing as the coronavirus surges. Here's a recent real-time economic activity index chart from Jefferies.  In addition to the recent slowing, the chart shows how far we have to go to get back to normal.JefferiesWhat's the best and easiest way to restart our economic recovery? A national mask-wearing mandate. As we discussed yesterday, Goldman Sachs estimates that this simple step would allow us to avoid new lockdowns and preserve an astounding 5% of GDP. - HBDon't celebrate the US cornering the market in remdesivir HHS Secretary Alex Azar is crowing over the administration's "amazing deal" to corner the market in remdesivir, the Gilead drug that has proven mildly effective in speeding up recovery from COVID-19. For the next three months, the US will buy more than 90% of Gilead's supply, enough to treat about 500,000 patients. So what have we accomplished? We've infuriated our allies and friends by locking them out of the market, and guaranteed that patients and insurance companies will pay a high price for a slightly useful treatment. The remdesivir gloating is a very good metaphor for the whole misbegotten US response to the pandemic. The administration wants us to spend tons of money on a meh drug because they couldn't be bothered to spend a lot less money to slow the spread of the disease. Imagine the benefit we'd get if we had spent that billion plus dollars on a public awareness campaign about masking, or on hiring 10,000 contact tracers? Hoarding mediocre medicine for already sick people - people who, incidentally, also have already passed their most infectious stage - is just about the least efficient, least valuable use of a COVID dollar. - DPHong Kong is goneChina passed its mysterious national security law meant to curb protests in Hong Kong. It's worse than what analysts and observers were imagining. • It outlaws subversion, a crime that includes any attempt to "interfere, obstruct or damage" any Chinese government or Hong Kong government agency's function. • Secession is also a crime, as is inciting, aiding, abetting, or financing either of these activities• Terrorism is defined as everything from throwing Molotov cocktails to anything that "seriously endangers public safety."• The law prohibits anyone from aiding "terrorists" with information, funds, materials, labor, transportation and technology among other things.• Foreign collusion is also prohibited. That includes anything from receiving financial aid to plotting with foreigners to obstruct the policy of the People's Republic of China.Participants in these crimes face three to 10 years in prison.This law's net is wide. Anyone from protesters calling for an independent Hong Kong to taxi drivers who helped them avoid police could be imprisoned. China's secret police on the ground in Hong Kong are now codified into law, and the mainland government has wide latitude to take jurisdiction over these cases.And so with that, Hong Kong as an open society governed by the rule of law is over. By the time the US was threatening to pass sanctions against individuals involved in enshrining and implementing this security law, it was too little, too late. There are two reasons for that, both are failures of the Trump administration.• Trump doesn't care about human rights, or Hong Kong, so he wasted precious months glad-handing Xi Jinping in exchange for soybean purchases.• The US State Department now thinks it can execute US foreign policy objectives by going it alone. That is a mistake. To put pressure on a country like China, we need our allies.We could've done better, but we didn't, and now we've lost Hong Kong. - Linette LopezQAnon was never funny, and now it threatens the entire Republican Party.Laura Boebert, a Colorado gun rights activist with a penchant for saying nice things about QAnon, beat a Republican incumbent yesterday in a House primary, and is favored to be elected to Congress in November. A few weeks ago, a more overt Q-enthusiast, Marjorie Taylor Greene, won a Republican primary in Georgia in a safe district, and will almost certainly be woo-wooing down to Washington to peddle her conspiracist junk. A Q-person also won the Republican Senate primary in Oregon. Trumpworld has moved from flirting with Q to making out with it, as Trump himself regularly retweets Q-ish accounts, and Michael Flynn is snuggling up to his QAnon admirers. QAnon, the perfervid, incomprehensible Deep State conspiracy theory that worships Trump like a God, has transformed in three years from joke to lunatic fringe to criminal enterprise (remember the Pizzagate attack?) to a genuine force in conservative politics. In the 1980s, the followers of Lyndon LaRouche briefly panicked the Democratic party by sneakily winning primaries and evangelizing his conspiracist rantings. QAnon is like LaRouche, but vastly more dangerous because it's grabbed hold of the party establishment. Rather than disavowing it or distancing themselves from it, the GOP and its president tacitly welcome Q to the party. Normal politics can't survive when it's infected with people who want to destroy it. The Republican Party should purge itself of this poison.  - DPAnd now Trump is on the wrong side of the immigration debateAccording to pollster Gallup, the US has changed its mind about immigration. Support for increasing immigration into the US is at its highest level since 1965, with 34% of Americans in favor. Only 28% of Americans are in favor of decreasing immigration, a record low.Not only is Trump on the wrong side of the debate, but it seems the longer he sticks around the more wrong he becomes. - LLBUSINESS & ECONOMYUS companies added 2.37 million workers in June, according to ADP's survey.

The Latest: 510 women positive for virus at Texas prisonAssociated Press InternationalJuly 21, 2020 Tuesday 11:57 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWSLength: 2702 wordsByline: The Associated PressBodyFORT WORTH, Texas -- More than 500 women at a federal medical prison in Texas have tested positive for the coronavirus, in one of the largest confirmed outbreaks at a federal prison.The Bureau of Prisons said the number of confirmed cases at the Federal Medical Center-Carswell in Fort Worth jumped to 510 on Tuesday, just two days after the Bureau of Prisons reported that 200 women there had tested positive for COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus.Only the federal prison in Seagoville, also located in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, had more infected inmates, with 1,156 cases as of Tuesday.___HERE’S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK:— CDC: Antibody tests show virus rates 10x higher— Jordan to reopen airports to tourists in August— Weary EU leaders finally clinch $2.1 trillion budget and coronavirus recovery fund— New research suggests that antibodies the immune system makes to fight the coronavirus may only last a few months in people with mild illness, according to report in the New England Journal of Medicine.— The Justice Department says hackers working with the Chinese government targeted firms developing coronavirus vaccines and stole hundreds of millions of dollars worth of intellectual property and trade secrets from companies worldwide.— With the pandemic worsening and aid expiring, Washington's divisions thwart new relief package.Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak___HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:SAO PAULO — Brazilian authorities say the country’s Sao Paulo state has topped 20,000 deaths from COVID-19, while the nation as a whole has recored more than 80,000 fatalities due to the coronavirus.Sao Paulo is Brazil’s most populous state, with 46 million people, and is the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in the South American country.It has been enforcing social distancing measures since mid-March, but has never applied a full lockdown.Sao Paulo Gov. João Doria replaced his health secretary this week, though he says the official left the post for medical reasons unrelated to the coronavirus.___ DENVER -- Colorado teachers may refuse to report for work unless their criteria for reopening schools during the coronavirus pandemic this fall are met.That’s the word from Amie Baca-Oehlert, the head of the state’s largest teachers union, the Colorado Education Association.Baca-Oehlert said Tuesday that teachers want more of a say in how school districts implement safety protocols such as mask-wearing, restricting movement among public school students and restricting class sizes.She says individual school districts should establish their own protocols and provide all students with access to remote learning tools such as computers.___SANTA FE, N.M. -- New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is thanking President Donald Trump for telling Americans that they should wear masks when they’re unable to keep distance between themselves and other people.The Democrat tweeted her appreciation Tuesday, saying: “Thanks for joining us, Mr. President.”Masks are mandated in New Mexico as the state has been dealing with an uptick in COVID-19 cases.Health officials are now reporting an additional 307 cases. That brings the statewide total to 17,517 since the pandemic began. Officials also reported an additional 10 deaths, bringing that tally to nearly 590.___WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump says he’s “getting used to” wearing a mask as he showed off his from the White House briefing room podium.He’s telling reporters that he has “no problem” wearing one, saying: “I carry it. I wear it... and I’ll continue.”Trump’s recent comments are a major change in tone for the president, who spent months resisting wearing a mask in public and once suggested they were a political statement against him.But he told reporters Tuesday that he’s “getting used to the mask” and uses one when appropriate.Trump then pulled his out of a suit pocket and encouraged the public, saying: “if you’re close together, I would put on the mask.”Trump’s comments came at the end of the return of his evening briefing, which lasted less than half an hour. Trump appeared alone, with no public health experts appearing.___DENVER -- Colorado Gov. Jared Polis has ordered bars and restaurants across the state to stop serving alcohol past 10 p.m. as the number of coronavirus cases among young adults continues to increase.He says anybody who has been drunk knows that inhibitions are reduced and social distancing takes a back seat when large groups are involved.The order is expected to take effect before the weekend and last for 30 days. Last call at Colorado bars is normally 2 a.m.The governor previously ordered bars closed as the state saw an uptick in cases, but those serving food were allowed to remain open.___BATON ROUGE, La. — Gov. John Bel Edwards is keeping Louisiana’s mask mandate and business restrictions in place for at least two more weeks as the number of coronavirus patients at hospitals is surging in all regions of the state.The Democratic governor’s current regulations were set to expire Friday but instead will extend until at least Aug. 7.The rules limit restaurants to 50% capacity for in-person dining, restrict bars to takeout and delivery only and place occupancy limits on gyms, salons and other businesses deemed nonessential. Face coverings are required for anyone ages 8 and older, with medical exceptions. Indoor gatherings above 50 people are banned.Edwards’ announcement came Tuesday.“We still have a lot of COVID-19 in Louisiana, more than we want, and it’s widespread all across our state,” the governor said. He added: “There is no doubt we have a long way to go and the situation is very serious, especially as it relates to hospitalizations.”___LAS VEGAS -- Unions representing 65,000 Las Vegas-area casino workers have dropped two MGM Resorts International properties from a lawsuit accusing companies of skimping on coronavirus protective measures.A Culinary Union executive called it a victory to drop legal proceedings against the owner of the Bellagio resort and the Signature Condominiums towers and begin “expedited arbitration” over safety requirements.The union says 22 workers or dependent family members have died from COVID-19. MGM Resorts on Tuesday called the court filing “frivolous.”Culinary and bartenders unions didn’t drop claims against Caesars Entertainment, operator of Harrah’s Las Vegas, over measures at a restaurant there.___BRASILIA, Brazil — Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro says he has had a third test to see if he is still infected with the coronavirus and that the result will be released Wednesday.Speaking to supporters gathered in front of the presidential residence Tuesday, Bolsonaro said, “God willing, I will test negative.”The president announced on July 7 that he had COVID-19, the disease that can be caused by the virus. On July 15, he said he had tested positive one more time.Bolsonaro says that if his latest test proves negative, he wants to travel Friday to the state of Piauí in northeastern Brazil. The head of Brazil’s Ministry of Regional Development is scheduled to visit the city of Floriano in that state to dedicate new housing and a sanitation system.___JACKSON, Wyo. -- Wyoming has approved a countywide mask mandate with some exceptions in Teton County during the coronavirus pandemic.The Jackson Hole News & Guide reported that State Health Officer Alexia Harrist signed the order Monday, hours after the Teton County Board of County Commissioners voted unanimously to approve a resolution for the mandate. Her signature was required to make the order law.The mandate is in effect through July 31. People who have a physical or mental health reason to not wear masks are exempt under the order and do not need to provide documentation. The mandate is intended to reduce the spread of COVID-19.___ATLANTA — Georgia reported its second-highest daily count of deaths on Tuesday since the COVID-19 pandemic began, in what health officials said was a consequence of the elevated number of coronavirus infections the state has seen since June.The day a death is reported in Georgia is often not the day it occurs, and it’s not unusual to see a burst of deaths reported just after a weekend. But Tuesday’s total of 78 was below only the 100 Georgia deaths reported on April 7.“It is due in part to decreased reporting over the weekend, but just as we’ve seen increased cases and hospitalizations, we are seeing the number of deaths increase, also,” wrote Department of Public Health spokesperson Nancy Nydam in an email.Nydam couldn’t immediately say when the deaths reported Tuesday had happened. The numbers pushed Georgia’s 7-day and 14-day trend on deaths to their highest point since late June.___WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has resumed a starring role in the White House’s coronavirus briefings on Tuesday, returning to the podium in the press briefing room in hopes that he can shore up support for his administration’s work amid flagging poll numbers.Trump says the administration is doing well with vaccine and therapeutic development.He says the country has learned so much about the disease, and “my administration will stop at nothing to save lives and shield the vulnerable, which is so important.”Trump also warns the virus outbreak “will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better - something I don’t like saying about things, but that’s the way it is.”___ST. PAUL, Minn. — Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz says the state is making progress in stemming coronavirus infections in the state’s long-term care facilities.Walz and state health officials cite a dramatic drop in deaths and new cases of COVID-19 at nursing homes and other facilities over the last two months. Residents of long-term care facilities still make up the majority of coronvirus-related deaths in Minnesota, but officials say their interventions since mid-May have led to a significant drop in daily deaths and outbreaks in congregate care settings.“We are certainly not taking a victory lap,” Walz told reporters Tuesday. “The key here was controlling infections.”Officials scrambled to respond as deaths at long-term care facilities rose in late April and early May. Walz outlined a “battle plan” in early May that included expanded testing, more personal protective gear for health workers and ensuring “adequate” staffing levels when workers fall ill.Officials said Tuesday those collective efforts have worked. In early May, there were 23 facilities reporting new cases each day. That number is now about six per day, Minnesota Public Radio News reported.___BATON ROUGE, La. — Louisiana hospital leaders are warning that efforts to combat the coronavirus outbreak could be hampered by conservative House Republicans’ push to revoke Gov. John Bel Edwards’ public health emergency declaration.The Louisiana Hospital Association is joining GOP House Speaker Clay Schexnayder in trying to discourage Republican lawmakers from signing a petition nullifying the Democratic governor’s virus response orders.The petition requires support from a majority of the House or Senate.Supporters say Edwards is crippling the economy with his restrictions. The hospital association argues removal of the emergency declaration would decrease health facilities’ ability to bring in nurses and doctors from other states, expand telemedicine services and increase bed capacity.___COLUMBIA, Mo. — Missouri on Tuesday reported more than 1,100 new coronavirus cases, once again breaking its own record for the largest single-day increase in cases.Data from the state health department show 34,762 people have tested positive for COVID-19 since the virus first struck Missouri, a 1,138 increase in reported cases compared to Monday.Missouri last set its record for the largest increase in cases reported in a single day on Saturday, when the state announced another 958 people sickened by the virus.___NEW ORLEANS -- Public schools in New Orleans won’t offer in-person classroom instruction when they open in August because of a resurgence of COVID-19 infections, said the city’s school superintendent, Henderson Lewis.Online instruction will begin next month, but Lewis said Tuesday that classroom instruction for the city’s 45,000 public school students won’t resume until some time after Labor Day.Meanwhile, Lewis said, school buildings will be open to teachers and administrators and to continue offering meal programs for students from low-income families.Among those at the news conference were Mayor LaToya Cantrell and city health director Dr. Jennifer Avegno. Avegno said key factors in the decision include an increase in average daily cases and the percentage of tests that show infections.She also said that there aren’t enough tests available to test students and school personnel as often as the city feels is necessary to open schools.Local school systems in Louisiana are determining whether to resume classes on sight, with some planning in-person instruction, others preferring online distance learning and some districts announcing a hybrid approach.___SAO PAULO — Brazilian health authorities are starting a three-month test of a coronavirus vaccine produced by Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac.Dimas Covas, president of the Butantan Institute coordinating the study, says if the vaccine proves safe and effective, Brazil would receive 120 million doses from China at the beginning of next year and 30 million Brazilians would be vaccinated. IIt’s one of nearly two dozen potential vaccines in various stages of human testing worldwide, and one of a handful entering late-stage testing to prove effectiveness. The federal Ministry of Health on Monday confirmed 632 more deaths from COVID-19 and 20,257 newly confirmed infections.Brazil has recorded more than 80,000 confirmed deaths and 2 million cases of coronavirus -- second in the world in both categories behind the United States.Brazil is also helping test a vaccine produced in a partnership between Oxford University and the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. Federal officials on Tuesday authorized tests of a third vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech.The Sinovac tests on 9,000 volunteers, all health professionals, will be in six Brazilian states. The tests are coordinated by Butantan, a Sao Paulo state scientific institute that’s produced vaccines for more than a century.Half of the volunteers will receive two doses of vaccine starting this week, the other half will receive a placebo.___JUNEAU, Alaska — People in Alaska’s capital city must wear face coverings in certain indoor public places.The City and Borough of Juneau Assembly passed the measure, which is similar to a measure enacted in Anchorage. It calls for use of face coverings in grocery stores, restaurants, bars, childcare and personal care facilities.It’s also required in communal office areas and on public transportation.Exceptions include people who cannot tolerate a mask due to medical conditions or disabilities, those exercising and children younger than 2.The ordinance allows for fines up to $25. It also states a violation doesn’t create grounds for harassment.___SAO PAULO — Brazil needs to take measures to protect Indigenous populations from coronavirus within 15 days, according to a human rights arm of the Organization of American States.The commission says Brazil must introduce a plan to protect the Yanomami and Ye’kwana groups, who live in remote northern regions, “because they are in a situation of great danger.” Few ventilators and intensive-care beds are available close to their lands in the Amazon region.The commission says Brazil’s government insists it's doing its job with the Indigenous but won't give details.The Yanomamis presented a request in mid-June to pressure the Brazilian government to remove illegal miners and loggers from their lands. They blame them for bringing the virus. The Brazilian government didn’t respond to a request for comment.Brazil’s Health Ministry estimates about 200 Indigenous people have died of COVID-19. But another count by independent groups says the actual number is twice as high.Load-Date: July 21, 2020End of Document

I wear it... and I’ll continue.”Trump’s recent comments are a major change in tone for the president, who spent months resisting wearing a mask in public and once suggested they were a political statement against him.But he told reporters Tuesday that he’s “getting used to the mask” and uses one when appropriate.Trump then pulled his out of a suit pocket and encouraged the public, saying: “if you’re close together, I would put on the mask.”Trump’s comments came at the end of the return of his evening briefing, which lasted less than half an hour. Trump appeared alone, with no public health experts appearing.___DENVER -- Colorado Gov. Jared Polis has ordered bars and restaurants across the state to stop serving alcohol past 10 p.m. as the number of coronavirus cases among young adults continues to increase.He says anybody who has been drunk knows that inhibitions are reduced and social distancing takes a back seat when large groups are involved.The order is expected to take effect before the weekend and last for 30 days. Last call at Colorado bars is normally 2 a.m.The governor previously ordered bars closed as the state saw an uptick in cases, but those serving food were allowed to remain open.___BATON ROUGE, La. — Gov. John Bel Edwards is keeping Louisiana’s mask mandate and business restrictions in place for at least two more weeks as the number of coronavirus patients at hospitals is surging in all regions of the state.The Democratic governor’s current regulations were set to expire Friday but instead will extend until at least Aug. 7.The rules limit restaurants to 50% capacity for in-person dining, restrict bars to takeout and delivery only and place occupancy limits on gyms, salons and other businesses deemed nonessential. Face coverings are required for anyone ages 8 and older, with medical exceptions. Indoor gatherings above 50 people are banned.Edwards’ announcement came Tuesday.“We still have a lot of COVID-19 in Louisiana, more than we want, and it’s widespread all across our state,” the governor said. He added: “There is no doubt we have a long way to go and the situation is very serious, especially as it relates to hospitalizations.”___LAS VEGAS -- Unions representing 65,000 Las Vegas-area casino workers have dropped two MGM Resorts International properties from a lawsuit accusing companies of skimping on coronavirus protective measures.A Culinary Union executive called it a victory to drop legal proceedings against the owner of the Bellagio resort and the Signature Condominiums towers and begin “expedited arbitration” over safety requirements.The union says 22 workers or dependent family members have died from COVID-19. MGM Resorts on Tuesday called the court filing “frivolous.”Culinary and bartenders unions didn’t drop claims against Caesars Entertainment, operator of Harrah’s Las Vegas, over measures at a restaurant there.___BRASILIA, Brazil — Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro says he has had a third test to see if he is still infected with the coronavirus and that the result will be released Wednesday.Speaking to supporters gathered in front of the presidential residence Tuesday, Bolsonaro said, “God willing, I will test negative.”The president announced on July 7 that he had COVID-19, the disease that can be caused by the virus. On July 15, he said he had tested positive one more time.Bolsonaro says that if his latest test proves negative, he wants to travel Friday to the state of Piauí in northeastern Brazil. The head of Brazil’s Ministry of Regional Development is scheduled to visit the city of Floriano in that state to dedicate new housing and a sanitation system.___JACKSON, Wyo. -- Wyoming has approved a countywide mask mandate with some exceptions in Teton County during the coronavirus pandemic.The Jackson Hole News & Guide reported that State Health Officer Alexia Harrist signed the order Monday, hours after the Teton County Board of County Commissioners voted unanimously to approve a resolution for the mandate. Her signature was required to make the order law.The mandate is in effect through July 31. People who have a physical or mental health reason to not wear masks are exempt under the order and do not need to provide documentation. The mandate is intended to reduce the spread of COVID-19.___ATLANTA — Georgia reported its second-highest daily count of deaths on Tuesday since the COVID-19 pandemic began, in what health officials said was a consequence of the elevated number of coronavirus infections the state has seen since June.The day a death is reported in Georgia is often not the day it occurs, and it’s not unusual to see a burst of deaths reported just after a weekend. But Tuesday’s total of 78 was below only the 100 Georgia deaths reported on April 7.“It is due in part to decreased reporting over the weekend, but just as we’ve seen increased cases and hospitalizations, we are seeing the number of deaths increase, also,” wrote Department of Public Health spokesperson Nancy Nydam in an email.Nydam couldn’t immediately say when the deaths reported Tuesday had happened. The numbers pushed Georgia’s 7-day and 14-day trend on deaths to their highest point since late June.___WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has resumed a starring role in the White House’s coronavirus briefings on Tuesday, returning to the podium in the press briefing room in hopes that he can shore up support for his administration’s work amid flagging poll numbers.Trump says the administration is doing well with vaccine and therapeutic development.He says the country has learned so much about the disease, and “my administration will stop at nothing to save lives and shield the vulnerable, which is so important.”Trump also warns the virus outbreak “will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better - something I don’t like saying about things, but that’s the way it is.”___ST. PAUL, Minn. — Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz says the state is making progress in stemming coronavirus infections in the state’s long-term care facilities.Walz and state health officials cite a dramatic drop in deaths and new cases of COVID-19 at nursing homes and other facilities over the last two months. Residents of long-term care facilities still make up the majority of coronvirus-related deaths in Minnesota, but officials say their interventions since mid-May have led to a significant drop in daily deaths and outbreaks in congregate care settings.“We are certainly not taking a victory lap,” Walz told reporters Tuesday. “The key here was controlling infections.”Officials scrambled to respond as deaths at long-term care facilities rose in late April and early May. Walz outlined a “battle plan” in early May that included expanded testing, more personal protective gear for health workers and ensuring “adequate” staffing levels when workers fall ill.Officials said Tuesday those collective efforts have worked. In early May, there were 23 facilities reporting new cases each day. That number is now about six per day, Minnesota Public Radio News reported.___BATON ROUGE, La. — Louisiana hospital leaders are warning that efforts to combat the coronavirus outbreak could be hampered by conservative House Republicans’ push to revoke Gov. John Bel Edwards’ public health emergency declaration.The Louisiana Hospital Association is joining GOP House Speaker Clay Schexnayder in trying to discourage Republican lawmakers from signing a petition nullifying the Democratic governor’s virus response orders.The petition requires support from a majority of the House or Senate.Supporters say Edwards is crippling the economy with his restrictions. The hospital association argues removal of the emergency declaration would decrease health facilities’ ability to bring in nurses and doctors from other states, expand telemedicine services and increase bed capacity.___COLUMBIA, Mo. — Missouri on Tuesday reported more than 1,100 new coronavirus cases, once again breaking its own record for the largest single-day increase in cases.Data from the state health department show 34,762 people have tested positive for COVID-19 since the virus first struck Missouri, a 1,138 increase in reported cases compared to Monday.Missouri last set its record for the largest increase in cases reported in a single day on Saturday, when the state announced another 958 people sickened by the virus.___NEW ORLEANS -- Public schools in New Orleans won’t offer in-person classroom instruction when they open in August because of a resurgence of COVID-19 infections, said the city’s school superintendent, Henderson Lewis.Online instruction will begin next month, but Lewis said Tuesday that classroom instruction for the city’s 45,000 public school students won’t resume until some time after Labor Day.Meanwhile, Lewis said, school buildings will be open to teachers and administrators and to continue offering meal programs for students from low-income families.Among those at the news conference were Mayor LaToya Cantrell and city health director Dr. Jennifer Avegno. Avegno said key factors in the decision include an increase in average daily cases and the percentage of tests that show infections.She also said that there aren’t enough tests available to test students and school personnel as often as the city feels is necessary to open schools.Local school systems in Louisiana are determining whether to resume classes on sight, with some planning in-person instruction, others preferring online distance learning and some districts announcing a hybrid approach.___SAO PAULO — Brazilian health authorities are starting a three-month test of a coronavirus vaccine produced by Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac.Dimas Covas, president of the Butantan Institute coordinating the study, says if the vaccine proves safe and effective, Brazil would receive 120 million doses from China at the beginning of next year and 30 million Brazilians would be vaccinated. IIt’s one of nearly two dozen potential vaccines in various stages of human testing worldwide, and one of a handful entering late-stage testing to prove effectiveness. The federal Ministry of Health on Monday confirmed 632 more deaths from COVID-19 and 20,257 newly confirmed infections.Brazil has recorded more than 80,000 confirmed deaths and 2 million cases of coronavirus -- second in the world in both categories behind the United States.Brazil is also helping test a vaccine produced in a partnership between Oxford University and the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. Federal officials on Tuesday authorized tests of a third vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech.The Sinovac tests on 9,000 volunteers, all health professionals, will be in six Brazilian states. The tests are coordinated by Butantan, a Sao Paulo state scientific institute that’s produced vaccines for more than a century.Half of the volunteers will receive two doses of vaccine starting this week, the other half will receive a placebo.___JUNEAU, Alaska — People in Alaska’s capital city must wear face coverings in certain indoor public places.The City and Borough of Juneau Assembly passed the measure, which is similar to a measure enacted in Anchorage. It calls for use of face coverings in grocery stores, restaurants, bars, childcare and personal care facilities.It’s also required in communal office areas and on public transportation.Exceptions include people who cannot tolerate a mask due to medical conditions or disabilities, those exercising and children younger than 2.The ordinance allows for fines up to $25. It also states a violation doesn’t create grounds for harassment.___SAO PAULO — Brazil needs to take measures to protect Indigenous populations from coronavirus within 15 days, according to a human rights arm of the Organization of American States.The commission says Brazil must introduce a plan to protect the Yanomami and Ye’kwana groups, who live in remote northern regions, “because they are in a situation of great danger.” Few ventilators and intensive-care beds are available close to their lands in the Amazon region.The commission says Brazil’s government insists it's doing its job with the Indigenous but won't give details.The Yanomamis presented a request in mid-June to pressure the Brazilian government to remove illegal miners and loggers from their lands. They blame them for bringing the virus. The Brazilian government didn’t respond to a request for comment.Brazil’s Health Ministry estimates about 200 Indigenous people have died of COVID-19. But another count by independent groups says the actual number is twice as high.Load-Date: July 21, 2020End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 27 of 311US to hit Huawei employees with visa bans for rights abuses  Page 29 of 311US to hit Huawei employees with visa bans for rights abuses  Page 40 of 311Google's Conservative Censorship; Retail Revival; Facebook's New Feature; Addressing Trade Imbalances; A Possible Gamechanger In The Fight Against Coronavirus; ....  Page 43 of 311TikTok: A National Security Time Bomb Waiting to Explode?  Page 45 of 311Biden Campaign Follows DNC's Lead, Tells Staffers To Delete TikTok Amid National Security Concerns  Page 60 of 311Rudy Giuliani is Interviewed about Police Reform and Bolton's Book; Stock Markets and Coronavirus Concerns.
