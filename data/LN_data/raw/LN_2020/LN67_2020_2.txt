DOJ says Chinese hackers targeted coronavirus vaccine researchPolitico.comJuly 22, 2020 Wednesday 2:46 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1331 wordsHighlight: A senior FBI official described the scale and scope of Chinese government-directed hacking as "unlike any other threat we're facing today."BodyFederal prosecutors on Tuesday charged two Chinese men with hacking hundreds of U.S. and foreign companies, nongovernmental organizations and human rights activists, as well as trying to hack three U.S. firms researching the coronavirus, in an escalation of Washington's war with Beijing over intellectual property theft and espionage.Beginning in September 2009, the two men, Li Xiaoyu and Dong Jiazhi, stole "hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of trade secrets, intellectual property, and other valuable business information," according to an indictment unsealed in the Eastern District of Washington. Their alleged victims included high-tech manufacturing firms, pharmaceutical companies and the makers of educational software and medical equipment. Victim companies were located in the U.S., Australia, Germany, Japan, South Korea and other countries.In some cases, the men allegedly acted out of self-interest, in one instance attempting to extort a victim into paying a ransom by threatening to publish their intellectual property. In other cases, prosecutors said, "they were stealing information of obvious interest" to the Chinese government. The hackers "worked with, were assisted by, and operated with the acquiescence of" an officer in China's Ministry of State Security, according to the indictment."China is determined to use every means at its disposal, including the theft of intellectual property from U.S. companies, laboratories and our universities, to degrade the United States' economic, technological and military advantages," FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich said at a press conference.Bowdich said that the scale and scope of Chinese government-directed hacking "is unlike any other threat we're facing today."The hackers allegedly breached defense contractors and stole sensitive military information, prosecutors said, including about military satellite programs and communications systems.Other operations also showed signs of foreign-policy motivations. Li and Dong allegedly provided their Chinese government contact with the passwords of human rights activists, including a community organizer in Hong Kong and a former Tiananmen Square protester.In late January and early February, as the coronavirus ravaged China, Li tried to find security vulnerabilities in the networks of biotech firms in Maryland, Massachusetts and California that were studying coronavirus vaccines and treatments, according to the indictment. The hackers also allegedly targeted a California firm producing coronavirus testing kits.The case epitomizes what senior Trump administration officials have called the "blended threat" - an emerging trend of foreign governments using private hackers as proxies. The U.S. has previously charged Russian, Iranian and North Korean hackers for such operations. This is the first case charging independent Chinese hackers with cyber operations on behalf of Beijing."China has now taken its place, alongside Russia, Iran and North Korea, in that shameful club of nations that provide a safe haven for cyber criminals in exchange for those criminals being 'on call' to work for the benefit of the state, here to feed the Chinese Communist party's insatiable hunger for American and other non-Chinese companies' hard-earned intellectual property, including COVID-19 research," John Demers, who heads the Justice Department's National Security Division, said in a statement.The inclusion of coronavirus-related victims in the latest case comes as U.S. security agencies warn that China is seeking to gain the upper hand in the global race for a vaccine.Chinese government hackers "have been observed attempting to identify and illicitly obtain valuable intellectual property (IP) and public health data related to vaccines, treatments, and testing from networks and personnel affiliated with COVID-19-related research," the FBI and the DHS Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said in a May alert. "The potential theft of this information jeopardizes the delivery of secure, effective, and efficient treatment options."Cyber intrusions into research labs can slow down their critical work, officials say, by forcing scientists to pause vital research, raise the alarm among colleagues and review their data to determine if the hackers tampered with it.The hackers often breached their targets by exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in widely used software, according to the indictment. When possible, the two men took advantage of newly announced vulnerabilities before companies had had time to patch them. Targeted systems included web servers and "software collaboration programs," according to the indictment.The MSS officer occasionally helped the hackers breach their targets, prosecutors said. In one case, when Li was trying to hack a Burmese human-rights group, the officer allegedly gave him a zero-day exploit - a highly valuable piece of code designed to compromise a previously unknown flaw - for a popular web browser.After gaining an initial foothold, the men allegedly planted software that let them send further commands to victim computers. They also frequently deployed password-stealing programs and tried to access more parts of their victims' networks with the stolen credentials.To exfiltrate the files undetected, Li and Dong employed a tried-and-true technique: compressing the stolen data into archive files, then changing those archives' file extensions so security software wouldn't spot them leaving the companies' networks. In some cases, the two men stashed their malware and stolen files in computers' recycle bins, an often-overlooked location.The stolen data included software code, drug testing results and students' personal information, according to the indictment.Li and Dong sometimes returned to their victims several years after the initial intrusion to steal more data, prosecutors said.Authorities discovered Li and Dong's long-running campaign after they breached the Hanford Site, a Department of Energy nuclear waste complex in Benton County, Wash., in March 2015, according to William Hyslop, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Washington. A private security firm working for the facility spotted the hackers and alerted the FBI, Hyslop said at the press conference.Senior administration officials and congressional Republicans have highlighted the cyberattacks targeting coronavirus research to bolster President Donald Trump's broader case against China, which remains locked in a long-running trade war with the U.S.In May, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the intrusions "an extension of [China's] counterproductive actions throughout the COVID-19 pandemic."Days later, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) tweeted, "The Chinese Communist Party is notorious for stealing American technology to make up for China's inability to self-innovate. A cure for COVID-19 is next on their list of things to steal."Lawmakers have requested briefings about the intrusions and introduced legislation to respond.Beijing has consistently denied hacking into companies researching the virus.China has conducted a broader effort to steal intellectual property to benefit its domestic industries in recent years. Chinese agents have aggressively targeted third-party IT contractors known as "managed service providers," leap-frogging from these contractors into the networks of their high-value clients. In December 2018, the U.S. charged two Chinese cyber criminals with a 12-year campaign that hit MSPs, dozens of tech firms and multiple government agencies.At the press conference, Bowdich described China's political and economic espionage as "the greatest long-term threat to our nation's information, intellectual property and its economic vitality.""We're bringing these charges today to put the Chinese leaders directing these cyberattacks on notice," he said. "There are serious consequences and risks for stealing our technological and our intellectual property."Load-Date: July 22, 2020End of Document

Pompeo Calls for U.S.-European Unity to Answer 'China Challenge'Newsweek.comJune 28, 2020 Sunday 1:37 PM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 642 wordsByline: Benjamin FearnowHighlight: United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is touting an international coalition against China, using his social media accounts to highlight criticisms of the Communist Chinese government from across the globe.BodyUnited States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is touting an international coalition against China, particularly using his social media accounts to highlight criticisms of the communist Chinese government from across the globe.Pompeo has amplified direct criticism of the Chinese Communist Party over the past month through several actions, including the restriction of visas against all current and former CCP officials "complicit" in undermining Hong Kong's autonomy. The Trump administration has chastised the Chinese government in tit-for-tat remarks that escalated at the end of last year, at the outset of both the coronavirus pandemic and Beijing's crackdown on pro-democracy Hong Kong protests. The secretary of state has vowed to uphold President Donald Trump's threats against any CCP actions against democratic governments.Pompeo in the last few days has appeared to step up his response to China's ongoing propaganda campaign against the U.S., touting both European and Southeast Asia alliances against the Chinese government.On Sunday, he tweeted: "The U.S. and European nations have awakened to the reality of China's role as a rising authoritarian regime, and the implications for our free society. The CCP's cover-up of the coronavirus outbreak from Wuhan - which has killed thousands - has accelerated our awakening."In another tweet he later posted that same day, Pompeo wrote: "The U.S. and our European partners must work together to continue the Transatlantic awakening to the China challenge, in the interest of preserving our free societies, our prosperity, and our future."He also tweeted on Friday: "President @realDonaldTrump promised to punish the CCP officials responsible for eviscerating Hong Kong's freedoms. Today, we are taking action to do just that– we've announced visa restrictions on CCP officials responsible for undermining Hong Kong's autonomy and human rights.Last Thursday, the secretary of state honed in on criticism of China during a virtual Brussels forum with E.U. leaders: "I'm starting to see even more realism on the continent as it relates to the threat of the Communist Party in China. We should address that challenge together – as transatlantic partners have met many challenges," he said at the outset of the meeting."The CCP has broken multiple international commitments, including those to the WHO, the WTO, the United Nations, and the people of Hong Kong," he told European allies during the Brussels meeting. "I am talking too about the CCP's predatory economic practices, such as trying to force nations to do business with Huawei, an arm of the Chinese Communist Party's surveillance state ... its violations of European sovereignty, including its browbeating of companies like HSBC."Pompeo went on to note the "provocative military actions" of the People's Liberation Army, another name for China's armed forces. And he criticized the Chinese government's "aggression" in the South China Sea, confrontations with India and "an opaque nuclear program."Newsweek reached out to the U.S. Department of State and the Chinese embassy in Washington Sunday afternoon for additional remarks.Taking to Twitter over the weekend, Pompeo applauded leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), who on Saturday rebuked the Chinese government's claim to the entire South China Sea region on historical grounds. The 10-bloc Southeast Asia leaders, who spoke during a weekend video conference, cited a 1982 United Nations oceans treaty that allows Vietnam and other countries in the region to traverse the South China Sea despite China's attempted lockdown of the area.The Trump administration and Chinese government officials have traded barbs over the culpability of the coronavirus pandemic, which U.S. leaders claim originated in a Wuhan laboratory before being spread globally.Link to ImageGraphic mike pompeo china wang yiJONATHAN ERNST / Contributor/Getty ImagesUnited States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is touting an international coalition against China, particularly using his social media accounts to highlight criticisms of the communist Chinese government from across the globe.Load-Date: June 28, 2020End of Document

UK backtracks on giving Huawei role in high-speed networkAssociated Press Financial WireJuly 14, 2020 Tuesday 10:17 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; INTERNATIONAL NEWS; POLITICAL NEWSLength: 1244 wordsByline: DANICA KIRKA, Associated PressDateline: LONDON BodyLONDON (AP) — Britain on Tuesday backtracked on plans to give Chinese telecommunications company Huawei a role in the U.K.’s new high-speed mobile phone network amid security concerns fueled by rising tensions between Beijing and Western powers.Britain said it decided to prohibit Huawei from working on the so-called 5G system after U.S. sanctions made it impossible to ensure the security of equipment made by the Chinese company.The U.S. had also threatened to sever an intelligence-sharing arrangement with Britain because of concerns that Huawei’s involvement could allow the Chinese government to infiltrate U.K. networks.Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told Parliament the decision would delay the rollout of 5G technology and increase costs by up to 2 billion pounds ($2.5 billion), but that it had to be done.“This has not been an easy decision, but it is the right one,” he said.The decision forces British telecoms operators to stop buying 5G equipment from Huawei by the end of this year but gives them until 2027 to remove Huawei gear that has already been used in the network, which is currently under construction.Fifth generation, or 5G, networks are expected to usher in a new wave of wireless innovation, with super-fast speeds and low signal delay that will help the development of self-driving cars, remote surgery and factory robots.Critically for telecoms operators, the government opted not to order them to rip out equipment manufactured by Huawei and used in earlier systems, such as the existing 4G network. Such a decision might have caused havoc in U.K. telecoms systems.Still, the decision marks a major retreat for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who in January sought to balance economic and security pressures by agreeing to give Huawei a limited role in the 5G network. Under the earlier ruling, Huawei would have been limited to providing 35% of equipment such as radios and antennas, with the company barred from supplying core components of the system.But the move set up a diplomatic clash with the U.S., which is involved in a wide-ranging trade dispute with China and threatened to cut off security cooperation unless Britain dumped Huawei. Amid continued pressure to remove Huawei from communication networks entirely, the U.S. in May imposed new sanctions that will bar companies around the world from using American-made machinery or software to produce chips for the Chinese company.U.S. officials claim that under Chinese law the government could force Huawei to give it access to foreign networks it has helped build. Huawei denies this, saying that countries such as Britain have already developed oversight procedures to ensure there are no security breaches.President Donald Trump’s national security adviser applauded Britain’s decision.“The reported U.K. action reflects a growing international consensus that Huawei and other untrusted vendors pose a threat to national security, as they remain beholden to the Chinese Communist Party,” said Robert O’Brien, who is in Europe this week. “We look forward to working with the U.K., as well as our many other partners and allies, to spur innovation, promote vendor diversity in the 5G supply chain, and ensure 5G security free from dangerous manipulations.”U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that with the ”decision, the UK joins a growing list of countries from around the world that are standing up for their national security by prohibiting the use of untrusted, high-risk vendors."Johnson also came under pressure from rebels in his own Conservative Party who criticized China’s new Hong Kong security law and its treatment of ethnic Uighurs in China’s far west Xinjiang region, as well as Huawei’s links to the Chinese government. Two weeks ago, members of Parliament debated Huawei’s entanglement in Xinjiang following an Associated Press report on forced birth control measures in the region, pressing the government to cut ties with the company on human rights grounds. Ten Conservative lawmakers this week sent a letter to Johnson demanding that he remove Huawei from “the U.K.’s critical national infrastructure.”The Labour Party’s spokeswoman on communications issues, Chi Omwurah, decried the government’s flip-flop approach and said it would have a dire impact on the future.“It has been clear for some time that there are serious questions over whether Huawei should be allowed to control large sections of our country’s telecoms networks, yet the government refused to face reality,” she said. “Their approach to our 5G capability, Huawei and our national security has been incomprehensibly negligent.”Huawei expressed disappointment, saying that the decision threatens to move “Britain into the digital slow lane, push up bills and deepen the digital divide.”“The American motive for these activities is one of protecting American jobs,\u2033 Huawei UK Vice President Jeremy Thompson told The Associated Press, arguing that the United States., despite its global might, is behind the curve when it comes to wireless technology.“The U.S. have under-invested in wireless consistently since the second generation. Here we are in the fifth,\u2033 he said. “They’ve under-invested. And as a result, they’re behind the rest of the world.”The controversy has put Huawei at the vortex of tensions between China and Britain.Last fall, the U.K. called on China to give the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights free access to Xinjiang.More recently, Johnson’s government has criticized China’s decision to impose a sweeping new national security law on Hong Kong. Britain accused the Beijing government of a serious breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration under which the U.K. returned control of Hong Kong to China in 1997, and announced it would open a special route to citizenship for up to 3 million eligible residents of the city.China’s ambassador to Britain, Liu Xiaoming, last week decried what he described as “gross interference” in Chinese affairs.“Britain can only be great,” he said, when it has an independent foreign policy, adding that it sets a bad precedent to “make your policy in the morning and change it in evening.”“It also sends out a very bad message to the China business community,” Liu said, suggesting Chinese companies might think twice about investing in Britain. “They are all watching how you handle Huawei.”Rana Mitter, an Oxford University history professor specializing in China, said that the security law — combined with broader resentment about the way China handled information about the coronavirus — created increased wariness among Britain’s politicians and the public.But for China, it’s the way Britain has handled the Huawei issue that is the major problem. Even if Britain decides that buying Huawei isn’t a good idea, this could have been done more discreetly, Mitter said.“I think the immediate reaction from China is going to be pretty incandescent,” he said. "They’re going to be very, very angry about the reversal of the decision, not just because of the decision itself, but because in a sense, it has made them lose face."Having said yes, back in January, the British government has now done a pretty exact U-turn and said absolutely no. But I think that China will maybe made to feel as if it’s been made essentially to suffer the consequences of that U-turn in public.”___Associated Press Writers Deb Reichman in Washington, and Kelvin Chan and Pan Pylas in London, contributed to this report.Load-Date: July 14, 2020End of Document

UK backtracks on giving Huawei role in high-speed networkAssociated Press InternationalJuly 14, 2020 Tuesday 10:17 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; INTERNATIONAL NEWS; POLITICAL NEWSLength: 1244 wordsByline: DANICA KIRKA, Associated PressDateline: LONDON BodyLONDON (AP) — Britain on Tuesday backtracked on plans to give Chinese telecommunications company Huawei a role in the U.K.’s new high-speed mobile phone network amid security concerns fueled by rising tensions between Beijing and Western powers.Britain said it decided to prohibit Huawei from working on the so-called 5G system after U.S. sanctions made it impossible to ensure the security of equipment made by the Chinese company.The U.S. had also threatened to sever an intelligence-sharing arrangement with Britain because of concerns that Huawei’s involvement could allow the Chinese government to infiltrate U.K. networks.Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told Parliament the decision would delay the rollout of 5G technology and increase costs by up to 2 billion pounds ($2.5 billion), but that it had to be done.“This has not been an easy decision, but it is the right one,” he said.The decision forces British telecoms operators to stop buying 5G equipment from Huawei by the end of this year but gives them until 2027 to remove Huawei gear that has already been used in the network, which is currently under construction.Fifth generation, or 5G, networks are expected to usher in a new wave of wireless innovation, with super-fast speeds and low signal delay that will help the development of self-driving cars, remote surgery and factory robots.Critically for telecoms operators, the government opted not to order them to rip out equipment manufactured by Huawei and used in earlier systems, such as the existing 4G network. Such a decision might have caused havoc in U.K. telecoms systems.Still, the decision marks a major retreat for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who in January sought to balance economic and security pressures by agreeing to give Huawei a limited role in the 5G network. Under the earlier ruling, Huawei would have been limited to providing 35% of equipment such as radios and antennas, with the company barred from supplying core components of the system.But the move set up a diplomatic clash with the U.S., which is involved in a wide-ranging trade dispute with China and threatened to cut off security cooperation unless Britain dumped Huawei. Amid continued pressure to remove Huawei from communication networks entirely, the U.S. in May imposed new sanctions that will bar companies around the world from using American-made machinery or software to produce chips for the Chinese company.U.S. officials claim that under Chinese law the government could force Huawei to give it access to foreign networks it has helped build. Huawei denies this, saying that countries such as Britain have already developed oversight procedures to ensure there are no security breaches.President Donald Trump’s national security adviser applauded Britain’s decision.“The reported U.K. action reflects a growing international consensus that Huawei and other untrusted vendors pose a threat to national security, as they remain beholden to the Chinese Communist Party,” said Robert O’Brien, who is in Europe this week. “We look forward to working with the U.K., as well as our many other partners and allies, to spur innovation, promote vendor diversity in the 5G supply chain, and ensure 5G security free from dangerous manipulations.”U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that with the ”decision, the UK joins a growing list of countries from around the world that are standing up for their national security by prohibiting the use of untrusted, high-risk vendors."Johnson also came under pressure from rebels in his own Conservative Party who criticized China’s new Hong Kong security law and its treatment of ethnic Uighurs in China’s far west Xinjiang region, as well as Huawei’s links to the Chinese government. Two weeks ago, members of Parliament debated Huawei’s entanglement in Xinjiang following an Associated Press report on forced birth control measures in the region, pressing the government to cut ties with the company on human rights grounds. Ten Conservative lawmakers this week sent a letter to Johnson demanding that he remove Huawei from “the U.K.’s critical national infrastructure.”The Labour Party’s spokeswoman on communications issues, Chi Omwurah, decried the government’s flip-flop approach and said it would have a dire impact on the future.“It has been clear for some time that there are serious questions over whether Huawei should be allowed to control large sections of our country’s telecoms networks, yet the government refused to face reality,” she said. “Their approach to our 5G capability, Huawei and our national security has been incomprehensibly negligent.”Huawei expressed disappointment, saying that the decision threatens to move “Britain into the digital slow lane, push up bills and deepen the digital divide.”“The American motive for these activities is one of protecting American jobs,\u2033 Huawei UK Vice President Jeremy Thompson told The Associated Press, arguing that the United States., despite its global might, is behind the curve when it comes to wireless technology.“The U.S. have under-invested in wireless consistently since the second generation.

On Senate Floor, Portman Urges Passage of Safeguarding American Innovation Act to Protect COVID-19 ResearchTargeted News ServiceJuly 30, 2020 Thursday 8:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1537 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, issued the following news release:On the Senate floor, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) spoke on the need for the Senate to pass his bipartisan Safeguarding American Innovation Act to help stop foreign governments from stealing American taxpayer-funded research and intellectual property developed at U.S. colleges and universities.Recently, both FBI Director Wray and Attorney General Barr have spoken about the threat to American taxpayer-funded research and intellectual property from foreign governments, particularly China, which would be addressed by this legislation. In fact, FBI Director Wray announced that the FBI is opening a new China-related investigation every 10 hours with around 2,500 open counterintelligence investigations across the country.In addition, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has reported that 54 scientists have resigned or been fired as a result of a NIH investigation into American taxpayer-funded grant recipients' failure to disclose financial ties to foreign governments, particularly China. In fact, according to the NIH investigation, more than 90 percent of the scientists had undisclosed ties to China.There are already troubling reports that China, and other global competitors, may be trying to steal COVID-19-related research.The Safeguarding American Innovation Act, which passed the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee last week, will help prevent this from happening. For that reason, it was recently announced that this legislation has been included in Senate Republicans' HEALS coronavirus rescue package.A transcript of the speech can be found below and a video can be found here."Another aspect of the COVID-19 legislation is a part of the bill that focuses on how do we deal with bringing back our personal protective gear production from overseas, particularly from China, and how to deal with the concern we have that some of the work we're doing on therapies and cures -- and by the way, there's substantial more resources, billions of dollars that go into that in this bill -- that other countries aren't taking this research. So right now in labs all around America, some of the best and brightest minds are at work on therapies, cures, and vaccines for COVID-19. It's changed all our lives in the past few months and we stand to benefit from these medical breakthroughs. We want them to happen."So again Congress has already appropriated billions of dollars and in the McConnell proposal, there is billions more for this purpose. That's appropriate. But as we work to find a cure, there are troubling reports emerging that China in particular is actively trying to take this research for themselves. As the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency warned in May, there has been a pattern of 'targeting and compromise of U.S. organizations conducting COVID-19-related research by China-affiliated cyber-actors and nontraditional actors.' FBI Director Wray was even more pointed about this threat earlier this month stating on July 7 that 'At this very moment,' he said, 'China is working to compromise American health care organizations, pharmaceutical companies, and academic institutions conducting essential COVID-19 research.'"Just last week the Justice Department filed charges against a Chinese researcher who failed to disclose her ties to the People's Liberation Army while conducting medical research at Stanford University. While she was not accused of stealing the research in this case, this kind of arrangement where scholars are essentially agents of the Chinese government to gain access to our cutting edge labs around the country to find research to sneak back into China is all too common. That China would attempt to steal for their own benefit is, unfortunately, not surprising. As we have all seen over the past few months China's failure to live up to its international commitments on critical issues like transparency and human rights have led to some of the issues we've had, particularly with regard to the lack of transparency on the unchecked spread of the coronavirus from Wuhan."Frankly, relations with China are not good right now in part because of that. And unfortunately, our problems with China extend to our labs and our universities. As Chair of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I led a bipartisan investigation last year into this issue. Over the course of a year we learned how the Chinese Communist Party has used so-called talent recruitment programs, notably its Thousand Talents Plan, to systematically target the most promising U.S.-based research and researchers and pay them to take their American taxpayer-funded research back to Chinese universities. While stealing this research is bad enough, what's worse is it's not taken for academic purposes. Instead according to a State Department witness at our hearing last November, 'The Chinese Communist Party has declared the Chinese university system to be on the front line of military-civilian fusion efforts for technology acquisition.' This means there's a clear link between the research being taken from American labs and the latest advancement in China's military and its economy."There's more recent attention to this topic of research theft, which is a good thing. We need to talk about it. We need to expose it. We need to deal with it. Recently both FBI Director Wray and Attorney General Barr have spoken about this threat. In fact, Director Wray announced that the FBI Is opening a new China-related investigation on this topic every ten hours. A new investigation every ten hours, with around 2,500 counterintelligence investigations now going on around the country."We've seen this type of research theft in my own home state of Ohio, unfortunately. Just a couple of months ago, a National Institutes of Health-funded researcher affiliated with both the Cleveland Clinic and Case Western University was accused of hiding that he had received more than $3 million from the Chinese government to effectively take and replicate his Cleveland Clinic research at lab in China. He's actually accused of taking biological samples from Cleveland, Ohio, to Wuhan, China, and this was taxpayer-paid research by the NIH. He's not alone. The NIH has recently reported that 54 scientists and researchers have either resigned or been fired as a result of an NIH investigation into American taxpayer-funded grant recipients for their failure to disclose financial ties to foreign governments, particularly China. In fact, according to the NIH investigation, more than 90 percent of the scientists had undisclosed ties to China. Unfortunately, as it stands, our law enforcement agencies can't go directly after these researchers for hiding their foreign conflict of interest, for not telling the truth while taking taxpayer money."As important as it is that we speak out against these improper actions by China around the world, it's also critical that we take steps to clean up our own house right here in the United States, make America more resilient against China. One way we can do that is by stopping research developed in our labs from going to benefit China's military and economy at our expense. I'm pleased to say we have an opportunity to change that right now because this legislation is included in the COVID-19 legislation, and in doing so, take a stand in a bipartisan manner in defense of our values of research, transparency, collaboration, fairness, and national security."It's called the Safeguarding American Innovation Act, our legislation, and I introduced it along with Senator Tom Carper and a group of bipartisan senators to ensure that individuals are held accountable for failing to disclose their foreign ties on federal grant applications. It will also reform the State Department's vetting process for issuing visas to foreign researchers. It will require more safeguards on sensitive research from our research institutions and our universities and will help us better track who is working on taxpayer-funded research."This bill is ready to pass the Senate. The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee voted to approve it last week with bipartisan and unanimous consent. And I'm pleased to say that, again, Leader McConnell has chosen to include this legislation in his Phase 5 proposal, the CARES 2.0 package because it will help protect taxpayer-funded COVID-19 research and serve as a safeguard for the $150 billion that Americans give to scientists to conduct research every year -- that's the taxpayer funding that goes into our research institutions."In that regard, including the Safeguarding American Innovation Act in this CARES 2.0 bill can and should be viewed as a fiscally responsible measure. As we take a stance against behavior that China has gotten away with for way too long, let's do all we can to put American institutions on a solid footing as well. It's time to put an end to the Chinese Communist Party's theft to our taxpayer-funded research, including COVID-19 research. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the Safeguarding American Innovation Act."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7192752 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 30, 2020End of Document

Justice Department opposes Google, Facebook cable link to Hong KongPolitico.comJune 17, 2020 Wednesday 2:50 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1128 wordsHighlight: Officials warn that if allowed to proceed, an underseas cable project could expose Americans' data to China's government.BodyA key group of Trump administration officials now formally opposes an effort involving Google and Facebook to activate an underwater cable network connecting the United States to Hong Kong.In a new filing staking out opposition to that Hong Kong link, executive branch officials raised concerns it would expose global data flows to the eyes of China's communist government. They said the cable could be a boon to the Chinese government's spy services and would bring China a strategic benefit at a time when its global ambitions are rising."This cable would change the way U.S. data flows and are stored, around the world," said Adam Hickey, a senior Justice Department official overseeing telecom issues, in a statement to POLITICO. "It has the potential to establish Hong Kong as the center of gravity for U.S. data connectivity in Asia, offering unprecedented opportunities for collection by the Chinese intelligence services."Google, Facebook and other parties first proposed the sprawling underseas network of fiber optic cables known as Pacific Light three years ago, aimed at fast-tracking internet data traffic around the world. The project was aimed at better connecting the U.S. and Asia, with cables passing through the U.S., Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Philippines.The Federal Communications Commission will ultimately decide whether to allow Pacific Light's operations, but members of the independent agency frequently defer to the Justice Department and other administration officials on national security matters. The administration considers such concerns as part of an inter-agency body known as "Team Telecom."Construction is complete on parts of the network, running for thousands of miles under the Pacific Ocean. But some of its operation has been on hold while the U.S. government scrutinizes its national security implications.Wednesday's filing gives a green light to most of the portions of the network, raising no concerns about legs that connect the U.S. to the Philippines and Taiwan, subject to what it calls "appropriate mitigation" of any risks.Meanwhile, Facebook and Google appear to have all but conceded that they won't be able to operationalize the leg linking the U.S. and Hong Kong.In Wednesday's filing, the Trump administration raised concerns about the capacity of such a network and the possibility of data getting exposed to China's government while in transit.If the project is granted with the Hong Kong connection, "U.S. users may find it difficult to prevent U.S. traffic from transiting Hong Kong on the way to ultimate destinations in other parts of Asia," wrote officials.Such a cable "landing in Hong Kong would provide additional opportunities for [Chinese government] authorities to collect U.S. communications traffic for further big data analysis," said the administration recommendations. "By combining personnel data with travel records, health records and credit information, [China's] intelligence services may have the capability to create in just a few years a database more detailed than any nation has ever possessed about one of its rivals."Security concerns around Pacific Light began mounting over the last year as U.S. policymakers weighed some of the Chinese partners involved in the endeavor."This project is backed by a Chinese partner, Dr. Peng Telecom & Media Group Co., and would ultimately provide a direct link from China into Hong Kong," wrote Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) in a letter to the FCC last fall. "We cannot allow this. China has repeatedly shown it cannot be trusted."Scott cited human rights violations, asserting China is "breaking their agreement to give Hong Kong autonomy and freedom." U.S. government officials have repeatedly sounded the alarm about what China's government could do to communications networks, worrying about potential espionage and theft of technology.The Wall Street Journal reported last year that Dr. Peng built a surveillance network for Beijing police and that some of its executives were convicted of bribing Chinese government officials.The administration publicly indicated concerns about the Hong Kong link earlier this year.In April, the executive branch signed off on the companies operating the Taiwan portion of the network on a temporary six-month basis. But in a filing at the time, the administration warned that "in the current national security environment, there is a significant risk that the grant of a direct cable connection between the United States and Hong Kong would seriously jeopardize the national security and law enforcement interests of the United States."The FCC quickly moved to grant that temporary permission, much to Google's pleasure. At the time, Google noted the effort was about staying ahead of the need for data capacity."Our dedicated global network deployment and operations team is continually increasing capacity to meet the needs of our users and that includes our subsea cable system," said a Google spokesperson then.The move comes just weeks after Beijing introduced a national security law substantially restricting Hong Kong's autonomy. The law is set to formalize the footprint of China's intelligence services in Hong Kong, and human rights groups say it presents an immediate danger to the city's pro-democracy activists.The regulators' proposal was underway before that move, but the filing pointed to the national security law, adding that since 2019, mainland China "has endeavored to undermine Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy, democratic institutions and civil liberties" that it previously promised to honor.The announcement also comes as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Yang Jiechi, in Hawaii - a trip first reported by POLITICO.Pompeo has been one of the Trump administration's most vocal critics of Beijing. But concerns about its ascent and ambitions are widely held throughout the U.S. government, among political appointees and career officials alike. And the global spread of the coronavirus, which first appeared in China, has also fueled anti-China sentiment among the American electorate.The administration's recommendations to the FCC say the scale of data flowing through the cables calls for new security considerations. What travels the cables "may include millions of Americans' sensitive personal data," said the executive branch.Silicon Valley giants have emerged as a key player in this space, according to the administration's assessment.Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon "are now the largest investors in new subsea cable routes," wrote the administration officials, noting that in "2018 alone, Google and Facebook were estimated to have spent $39 billion on capital expenditures on network infrastructure" like these submarine cables.Load-Date: June 18, 2020End of Document

Huawei security chief: UK ban is not related to US claims of security risksCNN WireJuly 15, 2020 Wednesday 11:16 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 510 wordsDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  The United Kingdom this week dealt a major blow to Huawei by banning equipment made by the Chinese tech giant from its telecom networks, shutting Huawei out of a role in building the country's superfast 5G wireless infrastructure. But Huawei Chief Security Officer Andy Purdy said he believes the United Kingdom's decision was not related to claims by US officials that Huawei is linked to the Chinese government. The UK decision, which reverses an earlier ruling to allow Huawei a limited role in building the country's 5G infrastructure, comes after months of pressure by the US government. The United States has long considered Huawei a national security risk and feared its equipment could be used by the Chinese government for spying. Huawei firmly denies those allegations. However, the ban also follows new US sanctions implemented in May that bar global firms using American equipment to make semiconductors from selling to Huawei. The new rule restricts companies like TSMC from exporting computer chipsets and other key components to Huawei, causing worries about Huawei's supply chain and potentially harming its ability to build 5G base stations and other equipment.Purdy told CNN's Richard Quest in an interview Wednesday that he thinks the new US sanctions "forced" the United Kingdom into its decision. "The additional restrictions that the US government has put on Huawei, to hurt China by hurting Huawei, has forced the UK government," Purdy said. "It's a fairly complex issue because of the US sanctions that have been put in place ... But it's not because of what President Trump and Secretary of State (Mike) Pompeo have said. They've said that this is evidence that the UK government is coming to believe that Huawei is an arm of the Chinese government, the Chinese Communist Party. The UK government said no such thing."UK Digital and Culture Minister Oliver Dowden said Tuesday that new US sanctions imposed on the company in May had "significantly changed" the landscape."Given the uncertainty this creates around Huawei's supply chain, the UK can no longer be confident it will be able to guarantee the security of future Huawei 5G equipment," Dowden said.Still, the UK decision is a huge loss for Huawei, especially because other countries could now follow suit.Purdy said China should not retaliate against the United Kingdom over the ban. Instead, he urged the US and Chinese governments to come together to discuss the larger tensions that he said are behind the US crackdown on Huawei. Pompeo on Wednesday escalated the pressure by announcing visa restrictions on employees of Chinese technology companies, including Huawei."This kind of action, to try to retaliate, to try to hurt China by hurting Huawei, is really unjustified, and the US and China need to start having talks because, despite the vast differences, there are some major issues in the world that need to be addressed by those two governments," Purdy said. TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

A new world war over technologyCNN WireJuly 11, 2020 Saturday 00:47Invalid date found for VDI: 1594182949 XCEDOCID: 0 LNI: 60B5-MGP1-JBSS-S03F-00000-00. Date output 'as-is'.GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1462 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Nations and companies around the world are being sucked into a running battle over the future of technology between the United States and China, forcing them to choose sides in a conflict that is fracturing global supply chains and pushing businesses out of lucrative markets.The latest casualty is TikTok, a video app that is popular with teenagers and which has hundreds of millions of devoted fans across markets such as India and the United States. The app is owned by a Chinese company, but run by an American CEO.The first major hit came last month, when TikTok was blocked in India after a heated border clash with China left at least 20 Indian soldiers dead. Then, on Monday, US authorities said they would look at banning the app because they consider it a possible threat to national security. That news broke as the company said it would leave Hong Kong because of concerns over a sweeping national security law China imposed on the city. "It is becoming harder to be a truly global tech platform," said Dipayan Ghosh, the co-director of the Digital Platforms and Democracy Project at the Harvard Kennedy School.The fight right now between the world's two largest economies cuts to the heart of that issue. The United States and China are competing over artificial intelligence, super-fast 5G mobile networks and other technology. Although the countries have long-running economic ties that enable some collaboration, recent tensions over national security have pushed their governments and businesses to reconsider those partnerships.The conflict is bleeding over into the relationships those countries have with other global powers, too. The United Kingdom, for example, is re-examining its decision to grant Chinese tech company Huawei the ability to help build the country's 5G network. That review comes after the United States, which has repeatedly targeted Huawei, imposed sanctions on the company that could prevent other firms from supplying it with the chipsets it needs to build its next-generation technology. "My impression is that the tech companies are only now waking up to the fact that life in the future is going to be a lot less globalized," said Michael Witt, a senior affiliate professor of strategy and international business at INSEAD, the international business school. "They are really on the horns of a dilemma."A bitter rivalryThe United States and China have for decades held opposing views on how to wield technology. While IBM and Microsoft were driving American innovation in the 1980s, China was laying down the foundation for its Great Firewall --- a massive censorship mechanism that shuts out content widely available elsewhere on the internet. In the years since then, China has created a closed and controlled internet that has found fans among other authoritarian countries: Russia, for example, has moved to restructure and rein in its once freewheeling internet with the assistance of Chinese tech.China's investments in technology have grown even more rapidly in recent years because of "Made in China 2025," Beijing's ambitious plan to shed the country's reliance on foreign tech by spending billions of dollars in areas such as wireless communications, microchips and robotics. (Last year, for example, the country imported $306 billion worth of chipsets, or 15% of the value of the country's total imports.)The United States has responded by seeking to limit China's advance. The Trump administration has accused China of stealing US technology, an issue central to the damaging trade war that has colored the relationship between the two since 2018. Chinese officials have repeatedly denied such allegations and argued that any tech secrets handed over were part of deals that had been mutually agreed upon. The United States has also imposed sanctions on prominent Chinese tech firms and taken steps to limit Beijing's access to America's vast capital markets.As Washington escalates its fight against Beijing, international technological cooperation looks increasingly likely to disappear. "Beijing has concluded that decoupling is inevitable," wrote Ian Bremmer and Cliff Kupchan, the president and chairman of Eurasia Group, in a report published earlier this year that noted how Chinese President Xi Jinping is calling for the country to break its technological dependence on the United States. "China will expand efforts to reshape international technology, trade, and financial architecture to better promote its interests in an increasingly bifurcated world," they wrote.The 'virtual Berlin Wall'As the relationship between the world's two largest economies deteriorates, several analysts warned that the fallout will have major implications for every global power, along with the tech companies that operate across their borders.The Eurasia Group analysts wrote that the "new virtual Berlin Wall" will push world economies to choose sides. They said traditional US allies such as Taiwan and South Korea, for example, may tilt toward China because they supply cutting-edge semiconductors that Chinese firms rely on to compete with global rivals."Both the US and China have demonstrated they're willing to weaponize global trade and supply chains," the analysts added.Global tensions are also causing countries to view tech firms as "national sectors, and not global actors," said Samm Sacks, a senior fellow at Yale Law School's Paul Tsai China Center who studies cybersecurity and US-China relations."It's the idea that a tech company is going into a market on the other side of the world, and now is being asked to carry the flag of the country," she added. "This is a sea change from even a decade ago."Huawei has perhaps become the most prominent example of that shift. Washington has for more than a year been pressuring its allies to keep the Chinese company's telecommunications equipment out of their 5G networks. That campaign may be producing some results in Europe: UK authorities said last week that US sanctions on the company will likely hurt Huawei's viability as a 5G network provider there, while Reuters reported Thursday that Italy's largest telecom firm is excluding the company from a bid for 5G equipment.The advancement of technology in other parts of the world also suggests that there are "evolving, multiple playbooks" beyond the rivalry between the United States and China, according to Kislaya Prasad, a research professor at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business.He pointed to China's neighbor India, which is pushing for growth among local industries while also enjoying a major internet boom. When New Delhi banned TikTok and other major Chinese apps in late June, local app developers like Indian-made Chingari rushed to fill the void. Retreat or decentralizeFor the tech companies stuck trying to navigate this world, there are no easy options.Witt, the INSEAD professor, said firms must choose between giving up on part of the world, or decentralizing their operations to such a point that the company is essentially two or more different entities. TikTok seems to be trying the second approach. While the app is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, it has taken great pains to distance itself from its parent company. In May, it hired former Disney executive Kevin Mayer as its CEO, and it has repeatedly said that its data centers are located entirely outside of China where that data is not subject to Chinese law.The company might be trying to make an even more dramatic break. The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing a source familiar with the matter, that ByteDance is considering establishing a headquarters for the video app outside of China or a new management board to distance the service from the country. A TikTok spokesperson confirmed to CNN Business that its parent company is weighing changes to its corporate structure."The close connection to the Chinese government is what has shut Huawei out of so many markets," said Ghosh, of the Harvard Kennedy School. (Huawei maintains that it is a private firm owned by its employees.)"I think TikTok sees that and wants to distinguish itself from Huawei," he added.But that might not be enough. US lawmakers have repeatedly piled on TikTok in recent weeks. And while the company says it doesn't pose any threats to national security, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo mentioned those concerns this week when he floated the idea of banning the app. "The problem is, I think, for them it's too late," Witt said. "That light of public attention, that is already brightly shining on them. I think that's not going to end well for them."--- Brian Fung contributed to this report.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

GOLDEN, COLLEAGUES INTRODUCE BILL TO HOLD CHINA ACCOUNTABLE, PROTECT AMERICANS DURING COVID-19States News ServiceJuly 8, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 530 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of Maine Rep. Jared Golden :Congressman Jared Golden (ME-02) and a group of 13 members of Congress have introduced new legislation requiring the U.S. government to identify, analyze, and combat efforts by the Chinese government to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic.The Preventing China from Exploiting COVID-19 Act would mandate that the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) investigate the ways in which the Chinese government intends to seize on the COVID-19 pandemic to promote its interests on the national stage, evaluate risks to the United States, and provide policymakers with the information they need to address and counter Chinese actions when necessary. The DNI would report their findings to Congress."Since COVID-19 began, there is evidence that China is at work using the pandemic crisis against Americans through cyber-theft and the spread of misinformation," said Congressman Golden. "We need to fully understand these threats and respond to them. We're introducing the Preventing China from Exploiting COVID-19 Act to gather and analyze important intelligence our country needs to protect the American people and businesses."The legislation requires the DNI to investigate, analyze, and report on the following topics, among others:The techniques used by the Chinese government to obstruct or retaliate against nations that have sought a full inquiry into China's role in the emergence and spread of COVID-19, and the Chinese government's motivations for such efforts.The activities undertaken by the Chinese government, like cyber-theft, intended to acquire information and intellectual property related to COVID-19 testing, treatment, and vaccines.The manner in which the Chinese government seeks to advance its foreign policy interests by providing economic aid or medical equipment to nations adversely affected by COVID-19, and the degree to which this aid makes recipient countries more likely to adopt positions favorable to China and detrimental to the United States.The ways in which the Chinese government is using, or may be planning to use, the global disruption and distraction associated with COVID-19 as an opportunity to more aggressively pursue longstanding objectives, including with respect to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Xinjiang, and territorial disputes.The means by which the Chinese government is disseminating misinformation about COVID-19, including on U.S. social media platforms.How all of these activities, taken together, further Chinese interests, and the extent to which they constitute a continuation of the longstanding practices of China or represent an evolution in the foreign policy behavior of China.Golden introduced the bill with Reps. Kendra Horn (OK-05), Stephanie Murphy (FL-07), Max Rose (NY-11), Tom O'Halleran (AZ-01), Ed Case (HI-01), Ben McAdams (UT-04), Lou Correa (CA-46), Anthony Brindisi (NY-22), Charlie Crist (FL-13), Joe Cunningham (SC-01), Daniel Lipinski (IL-03), and Xochitl Torres Small (NM-02).If passed, the law would also require that the DNI's report be submitted to Congress within 90 days, and that a public and unclassified version be provided online.###Load-Date: July 8, 2020End of Document

Diplomatic war between London and Beijing on Huawei's behalfCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 7, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 392 wordsBodyThe British Government's possible reversal in granting some of the G5 network infrastructure to Huawei has triggered an intense diplomatic war between London and Beijing in recent hours.Chinese UK ambassador Liu Xiaoming has assured "premier" Boris Johnson that such a decision would cloud the relationship between countries and send "a very bad signal to Chinese companies.""We want to be your friend and your partner," Xiaomingwarned. "But if you want to treat China as a hostile country, you will have to bear the consequences."The relationship between the two countries has deteriorated ostensibly in recent days in the wake of Hong Kong's Security Law.London has accused Beijing of violating the principle of "one country, two systems" and has opened the doors of British citizenship to three million Hong Kongers."Premier"Boris Johnson rose his rhetoric and assured that he is unwilling to allow "hostile state suppliers" in the UK,in what is interpreted as a veiled reference to Huawei. Johnson has reviewed the latest national cybersecurity center report these days that it concludes that Huawei's technological capability has been severely diminished by the veto imposed by US President Donald Trump,which considers it "a security threat" for its ties to the Chinese government.China influences Huawei's favorTensions have flared up in recent hours following the publication in The Daily Mailof a report entitled"China's Elite Capture"revealing an alleged campaign undertaken by Beijing to influence British elites in favor of Huawei and other Chinese companies. The 86-page report was prepared by controversial former MI6 spy Christopher Steele,also embroiled in the "Russiagate" on Moscow's interference in the US presidential election.The report details a long list of politicians, businessmen and academics as China's potential "targets": from Liberal-Democratic MEP Sarah Wollaston to businessmen Kenneth Olisa and Mike Rake. All of them have denied their involvement in the alleged plot.A total of 59 Conservative MPs,led by former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, have in the meantime threatened to torpedo in Parliament the granting of part of the 5G infrastructure to Huawei for security reasons. The Chinese company has just celebrated the 20th anniversary of its implementation in the UK and plans to build a research centre in Cambridge.Load-Date: July 8, 2020End of Document

Scandal grows: Zoom admitted he closed pro-democracy activists' accounts by order of the Chinese regime and will continue to do soCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 12, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 853 wordsBodyZoom acknowledged that it bound the demands of the Chinese regime and closed the accounts of pro-democracy militants based in the United States and Hong Kong who wanted to use their videoconferencing application to commemorate the brutal crackdown in Tiananmen. In addition, he warned that it will block upcoming virtual meetings that the Chinese Communist Party deems illegal.In a statement issued Thursday night, Zoom promises to equip itself with the technological tools to limit governments' demands to limit activities they deem illegal to limit to the country's territory. The application, popularized during confinement by the coronavirus pandemic, is concerned about freedom of expression."The Chinese government informed us that this activity is illegal in China and demanded that Zoom cancel meetings and host accounts. We do not provide any user information or content of the meeting to the Chinese government. We don't have a backdoor that allows someone to enter a meeting without being visible," the press release said after the scandal broke out.Zoom said it did not have the ability to block participants from particular countries, ending three of the meetings and suspending the accounts that created those virtual meetings. In addition, it acknowledged two of the other meetings had a "significant number of mainland Chinese participants" and that is why they censored it.On Wednesday and Thursday, human rights militants in the United States and Hong Kong announced that three of their accounts had been suspended without explanation before conducting planned virtual reunions to honor the memory of Tiananmen victims, a taboo episode in China.On the night of June 3-4, 1989, a military intervention in Beijing's Tiananmen Square brought a bloody end to seven weeks of pro-democracy demonstrations in China. Zoom then acknowledged that he had temporarily closed these accounts and justified it by the fact that "like any planetary society, we must respect the laws in force in the jurisdictions in which we operate," without further precision.In the last statement, Zoom explains that he was alerted by the Chinese government to hold four public online meetings to commemorate Tiananmen. How did the regime know about these encounters? Who reported it?"The Chinese government has informed us that this activity was illegal in China and asked Zoom to cancel the meetings and the accounts that were going to hold them," explains the company based in Silicon Valley, California, which notes that it acted because users from mainland China were going to participate in the meetings.The net profits of the online video conferencing company Zoom increased 12-fold between February and April compared to the same period of the previous year. However, it could be subject to sanctions for censoring its participants (Reuters) (EFEI0500/)Zoom added that because its current technology does not allow it to "withdraw specific participants from a meeting or block participants from a particular country," Zoom made the decision to "end three of the four meetings and suspend or delete the associated guest accounts" thereto.Two Tiananmen survivors based in the United States, Wang Dan and ZhouFengsuo, as well as the organizer in Hong Kong of the annual vigil commemorating the events of Tiananmen, Lee Cheuk-yan, announced that their accounts had been temporarily closed. Lee said Zoom's response was "embarrassing" and accused her of "political censorship." "They have restored my account, but Zoom continues to kneel before the Communist party," he said in statements published by the British newspaper The Guardian."My purpose in opening Zoom is to reach the mainland Chinese, breaking the censorship of the Chinese Communist Party. With this policy, he defeated my original purpose," said the pro-democracy activist who closed his account and requested a refund. The company then reactivated all three accounts and will be equipped with tools to block or withdraw participants from some countries.Yaqiu Wang, a Chinese researcher at Human Rights Watch, was outraged by the technology company's decision: "Laws in China are often abusive and do not meet international human rights standards. However, technology companies have a responsibility to respect human rights. Tech companies should come together to resist Beijing's demands for censorship and defend the right to freedom of expression. Otherwise, the drag will never end."Like other Western-based technology companies, Zoom faces demands from authoritarian governments in major markets.In China, Apple acknowledged in 2017 having removed VPN apps from its Chinese App Store, computer systems that allow bypassing local internet blocking. The group also built a data center in China to store users' personal information to comply with cybersecurity legislation that requires storage to be done on Chinese territory.MORE ON THIS TOPIC:Zoom closed the account of an activist who wanted to commemorate Tiananmen victims: suspect Chinese regime31 years after the Tiananmen massacre, the day Beijing crushed the democratic aspirations of the Chinese peopleLoad-Date: June 13, 2020End of Document

RESEARCHER CHARGED WITH ILLEGALLY USING U.S. GRANT FUNDS TO DEVELOP SCIENTIFIC EXPERTISE FOR CHINA ARRESTED WHEN PREPARING TO BOARD CHARTER FLIGHT TO CHINAStates News ServiceJuly 9, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 856 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: COLUMBUS, OH BodyThe following information was released by the United States Attorney's Office Southern District of Ohio:A rheumatology professor and researcher with strong ties to China has been ordered held without bond to face a charge of grant fraud for not disclosing that he was engaged in a sophisticated scheme to use approximately $4.1 million in grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to develop China's expertise in the areas of rheumatology and immunology. He is also charged with making false statements about maintaining employment in China at the same time he was employed at universities in the United States, including The Ohio State University.Song Guo Zheng, 57, was arrested Friday, May 22, 2020, after he arrived in Anchorage, Alaska, aboard a charter flight and as he prepared to board another charter flight to China. When he was arrested, he was carrying three large bags, one small suitcase and a briefcase containing two laptops, three cellular telephones, several USB drives, several silver bars, expired Chinese passports for his family, deeds for property in China and other items."Yet again, we are faced with a professor at a U.S. University, who is a member of a Chinese Talent Plan, allegedly and deliberately failing to disclose his relationship with a Chinese university and receipt of funds from the Chinese Government in order to obtain millions of dollars in U.S. grant money designed to benefit the health and well-being of the people of the United States not to be hijacked to supplement the research goals of the Chinese Communist Party," said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers. "This case, like too many others, should serve as a reminder that the United States Government takes seriously the obligation of truthfulness and transparency on grant applications, and those who violate the law to benefit China or any other foreign nation will be held accountable.""This case highlights another example of a Chinese Talent Plan member allegedly using U.S. taxpayer funds for the benefit of the Chinese government," said Alan E. Kohler, Jr, Assistant Director of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division. "According to the criminal complaint, Zheng violated laws concerning the use of federal research funds and did not disclose his employment in China. The FBI will continue to work with our partners to stop such illegal activity and protect U.S. research.""We allege that Zheng was preparing to flee the country after he learned that his employer had begun an administrative process into whether or not he was complying with rules governing taxpayer-funded grants," said David M. DeVillers, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio. "This is our office's third recent case involving the illegal transfer of intellectual property and research to China. This underscores our commitment to work with the FBI, the Department of Health and Human Services, and our research institutions to protect our country's position as a global leader in research and innovation, and to punish those who try to exploit and undermine that position.""The taxpayers of the United States are the real victims when researchers defraud our government and exploit our system to benefit China," stated FBI Cincinnati Special Agent in Charge Chris Hoffman. "The cutting-edge technologies that are being developed in our country must be carefully protected from our foreign adversaries and the FBI will continue to work with our partners to safeguard these important innovations."A criminal complaint filed May 23 and unsealed following today's detention hearing charges Zheng with one count of fraud or bribery concerning programs receiving federal funds, a crime punishable by up to ten years in prison, and one count of making false statements, which is punishable by up to five years in prison. Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Preston Deavers ordered Zheng held without bond because he is a flight risk. The case will be presented to a federal grand jury for possible indictment. The investigation is continuing.An affidavit filed with the complaint alleges that, since 2013, Zheng has been participating in a Chinese Talent Plan, a program established by the Chinese government to recruit individuals with knowledge or access to foreign technology intellectual property. Since then, Zheng has used research conducted in the U.S. to benefit the People's Republic of China. Zheng allegedly failed to disclose conflicts of interest or his foreign commitments to his U.S. employers or to the NIH.Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers, U.S. Attorney DeVillers, and Christopher Hoffman, Special Agent in Charge, FBI, Cincinnati Field Division announced the criminal complaint. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Douglas W. Squires and Courter Shimeall, Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher St. Pierre, and Trial Attorney Matthew J. McKenzie with the Department of Justice National Security Division are representing the United States in this case.A criminal complaint merely contains allegations.

He chose Zoom because unlike other social platforms, such as Facebook or Twitter, the use of the video conferencing app is not restricted or censored in China.But a few days later, Fengsuo discovered that his Zoom account had been blocked by the company itself. It wasn't the only case. At the request of the Beijing Government, the Silicon Valley company had also blocked the accounts of Hong Kong-based Lee Cheuk-yan and Wang Dan for planning three meetings on the same subject, an activity considered illegal within China's borders.All three accounts have been re-enabled, but have put Zoom at the center of a new controversy. After numerous problems in managing the security and privacy of users, the application, which has become almost essential during the pandemic, now faces the same problem that for years has been pursued by companies such as Google or Facebook: China is a succulent market, but which forces you to play with the rules that are marked from Beijing from Beijing , often opposed to those styled in the West when it comes to privacy and censorship."The reality is that Zoom operates in more than 80 countries and continues to expand, requiring compliance with local laws, even when Zoom seeks to promote the open exchange of ideas," explain from the company, founded in the US by Eric Yuan, a Chinese emigrant who worked as an engineer at Cisco before launching this application.To ensure its presence in the market, Zoom will follow new procedures from now on. The company will not block accounts at the request of the Chinese government if these accounts belong to individuals who are not in the country, one of the mistakes it claims to have made in this situation.In addition, it will enable the ability to block meeting attendees by region so that, on request by the Government, Chinese users cannot access certain sessions. One of the reasons Zoom had to cancel three of the four meetings held by Zhou Fengsuo, Lee Cheuk-yan and Wang Dan was precisely not having the ability to block only certain attendees based on their IP number.The company has also acknowledged in the past that some of the calls and meetings may have circulated on the servers that the company has in China. Zoom's infrastructure is global, but by law, China requires that its users' data be on servers hosted in the country itself. By routing calls from third countries through these servers, Zoom could have made it easier for the Chinese authorities to have access to some of the participants' data or even the conversations held, as the company does not currently offer encrypted peer-to-peer meetings. It will do so shortly, but only for paid users.Zoom has ensured that since April 18, meetings created by companies and users outside China do not go through these servers and paid users around the world can choose the specific data center that manages their conferences. The tool, created for corporate users and large companies, has had to face in recent months a barrage of new users because of the needs of remote work and distance education that has imposed the coronavirus. The number of users has grown by almost 50%, with more than 300 million daily participants in conferences and meetings.Load-Date: June 17, 2020End of Document

CARPER, COONS, COLLEAGUES INTRODUCE BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION TO STOP THEFT OF US RESEARCH AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BY GLOBAL COMPETITORSStates News ServiceJune 18, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1941 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Delaware Senator Christopher Coons:Today, U.S. Senators Tom Carper and Chris Coons (both D-Del.) and Senators Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), James Risch (R-Idaho), Joe Manchin (D-W.V.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Catherine Cortez-Masto (D-Nev.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) introduced the Safeguarding American Innovation Act, bipartisan legislation to help stop foreign governments, particularly China, from stealing American taxpayer-funded research and intellectual property developed at U.S. colleges and universities.Portman and Carper, as Chairman and Ranking Member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), led a year-long investigation into this issue culminating in a bipartisan report and hearing that detailed how American taxpayers have been unwittingly funding the rise of China's military and economy over the last two decades while federal agencies have done little to stop it. Starting in the late 1990s through its "talent recruitment programs," China began recruiting U.S.-based scientists and researchers to transfer U.S. taxpayer-funded IP to China for their own economic and military gain. This legislation will ensure that the federal government is taking decisive action to safeguard American innovation.This legislation also addresses the findings of PSI's February 2019 report, which highlighted the Department of Education's lack of enforcement of foreign gift reporting at U.S. colleges and universities, which the department admitted was " historically lax ." This bill gives the department increased authority to enforce foreign gift reporting rules and lowers the reporting threshold to increase transparency and prevent foreign interference on U.S. campuses."Last month, it was reported that foreign hackers were targeting our nation's universities and health care firms in an attempt to steal intellectual property related to coronavirus treatments. Unfortunately, this is not the first time a foreign government has tried to get ahead by stealing the product of American ingenuity. A recent investigation Senator Portman and I led revealed the ways in which the Chinese government has worked to exploit the open and collaborative nature of the U.S. research community to advance their businesses and military interests. Today, with input from our nation's higher education community and the federal agencies charged with fostering scientific innovation, Senator Portman and I are introducing a common sense, bipartisan bill to protect American intellectual property and better leverage our international research partnerships," said Carper. "The Safeguarding American Innovation Act aims to protect taxpayer-funded research from foreign governments working to steal it, hold those acting in bad faith accountable, and improve the partnerships between our researchers and their foreign partners, and preserve our economic competitiveness around the world.""If the United States is to be successful in competition with China, we need to promote and protect American innovation," said Coons. "I am pleased to cosponsor this bipartisan legislation that will protect federally funded research and development grants and tighten loopholes within the U.S. government and make sure U.S. agencies are protected from adversaries trying to exploit our openness. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this bill into law.""We cannot continue to allow our global competitors to steal taxpayer-funded research and innovation in order to benefit their military and economy. That's why I'm proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation, which takes decisive action to safeguard American innovation, hold countries like China accountable for their actions, and ensure our world-class research enterprise is protected here in America," said Portman. "For nearly two decades, as we detailed in the November 2019 PSI report, the federal government has been asleep at the wheel while foreign governments have exploited the lack of transparency in our education system and bought access and influence on our school campuses. This bill will help us stop foreign governments from stealing our research and innovation while also increasing transparency to ensure that taxpayers know when colleges and universities accept significant foreign funding. We must hold countries that act in bad faith, like China, accountable and I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation.""The Chinese government and Communist Party systematically attempts to steal U.S. intellectual property and trade secrets in order to undermine American industry and technological advancement," Rubio said. "This bipartisan legislation will help prevent China and other hostile foreign actors from stealing U.S. research funded by American taxpayers, and it will ensure there is adequate transparency and reporting requirements for academic research funded by foreign entities. The threat posed by China even amidst the coronavirus pandemic remains present, and policymakers at every level must be vigilant in counteracting it.""The United States is at the forefront of innovation, leading the world in scientific and technological advances," said Hassan. "As a result, America attracts top talent from across the world to help further this research a major benefit for our country. But bad actors, such as China, are exploiting loopholes in our laws to steal U.S.-based research and intellectual property for their own economic and military advantage. Our bipartisan bill will take necessary steps to protect American innovation and hold bad actors accountable.""For too long, China has been exploiting the world-class research and innovation happening at American colleges and universities by strategically exporting American taxpayer-funded intellectual property back to Mainland China for its own economic and military gain," said Risch. "China has earned an international reputation for its rampant theft of intellectual property and it must be held to account. The Safeguarding American Innovation Act will protect our national intellectual capital while ensuring our national security remains uncompromised by the United States' foreign adversaries.""This bipartisan legislation will help American innovators safeguard their intellectual property and ensure American taxpayer dollars go towards American research, not foreign governments by creating transparency and accountability. Multiple foreign adversaries, including China, Russia and Iran have exploited the American people through research funding and stealing intellectual property for too long. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation and look forward to putting it on the President's desk," said Manchin."American innovation is one of our country's greatest assets, especially in times of crisis such as this. China has been clear: If America can invent it, they will try to steal it. I'm proud to help lead this effort to protect American universities from attempts to steal sensitive information by China and other foreign adversaries," said Tillis."America's research enterprise is the best in the world and the Chinese Communist Party knows it. That's why they've spent the last twenty years stealing American taxpayer-funded intellectual property and then using that IP to strengthen their own military and economy," said Hawley. "The time has come to put a stop to this, which is exactly what this bill will do, by preventing the Party from buying access to American researchers and sending spies to our colleges and universities.""U.S. academic institutions are global leaders in research, innovation and discovery. It is because of the caliber of their groundbreaking work that American colleges and universities have become targets for bad actors like China. This bipartisan bill would strengthen the protections for our research and intellectual property from being exploited by China and other rogue actors for their own interests," said Shaheen. "I'm glad to be part of this bipartisan effort to protect American institutions and safeguard the work that bolsters our national security and economy.""For years, China has tried to infiltrate American universities in order to influence and access scientists and researchers. We must do everything we can to safeguard one of our most precious resources: American innovation," said Barrasso. "Our bipartisan bill increases transparency and holds China and other countries accountable for any attempt to steal taxpayer-funded research and sensitive technologies.""Nevada's premier institutions of higher education get significant federal funding for their cutting-edge research," said Cortez Masto. "It's crucial to safeguard innovation garnered through both taxpayer-funded research and private enterprise so that Nevada's economy can reap the benefits of its groundbreaking ideas.""We should all be very concerned about the threat of Communist China and its attempts to steal U.S. research and intellectual property," said Scott. "Communist China has infiltrated our research institutions in an attempt to illicitly funnel knowledge and research back to mainland China. We cannot take this criminal action lightly. We have to remain vigilant and proactive, and this is an important step to protect American intellectual property from foreign influence.""Innovation is the engine that powers the American economy, and it's what will enable us to return to the greatest economy we've ever had following the COVID-19 pandemic," said Braun. "This legislation is an important step in holding China accountable for their intellectual property theft and protecting American innovators from having their research stolen.""Securing the integrity of our nation's research institutions is crucial for maintaining our national security," said Blackburn. "We cannot allow China to continue exploiting our grant process. This legislation will ensure that the academic exchange of ideas is possible with partner nations, while inhibiting untrustworthy actors like China to participate and use what they learn against us."This bipartisan legislation will protect American research and IP from global competitors by:- Punishing individuals who intentionally fail to disclose foreign support on federal grant applications, with penalties ranging from fines and imprisonment for not more than five years or both and a five-year prohibition on receiving a federal grant;- Strengthening the Student and Exchange Visitor Program by requiring the State Department's exchange program sponsors to have safeguards against unauthorized access to sensitive technologies and report to State if an exchange visitor will have access to sensitive technologies;- Strengthening the State Department's authority to deny visas to certain foreign nationals seeking access to sensitive technologies when it is contrary to U.S. national security and economic security interests of the United States;- Mandating a standardized U.S. government grant process by authorizing the Office of Management and Budget to work with federal grant-making agencies to standardize the grant application process; share information about grantees; and create a U.S. government-wide database of federal grantees; and- Lowering the reporting threshold for U.S. schools and universities receiving foreign gifts from $250,000 to $50,000 and giving the Department of Education authority to punish schools that fail to properly report.Load-Date: June 18, 2020End of Document

APP'WHAT BULLIES DO': REP. SMITH IS SANCTIONED BY THE CHINESE FOR HIGHLIGHTING HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSESStates News ServiceJuly 14, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 861 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of New Jersey Rep. Chris Smith:NJ Congressman pointed out nation's human rights abusesBy Mike Davis of the Asbury Park PressU.S. Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., was sanctioned by the Chinese government on Monday in a retaliatory move, after the U.S. placed sanctions on Chinese leaders over human rights abuses.The sanctions filed against Smith, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Sam Brownback, the U.S. ambassador for international religious freedom, bars them from the country, Chinese foreign affairs ministry spokeswoman Hua Chungying said Monday. She did not provide any further details about the sanctions."I'm not scared. I'm angry. This is what bullies do," Smith said in an interview Monday. "In no way will this diminish what I do. And in many ways, it's causing me to want to do even more. Because if they can do this to members of Congress, think of what they could do to a Muslim leader or a person out in rural China."Last week, the Trump Administration issued sanctions of its own against four Chinese officials, including a senior member of the ruling Communist party, over human rights abuses against the Uighur Muslim minority population in China's Xinjiang province, including forced sterilization.On July 1 Smith testified during a House hearing on a new Chinese "security law" in Hong Kong, which institutes lengthy prison sentences for protesters advocating for democracy."(Chinese President) Xi Jinping continues to commit pervasive human rights abuses against the Chinese people, including the use of torture, which has been well documented over and over again by the special rapporteurs of the United Nations," Smith testified. "They're going after them to destroy their children, destroy their families. ... There's an all-out effort to end all religious practice unless it comports with Marxist principles."It is going from bad to worse," he said.The sanctions against U.S. officials were expected. In May, the Global Times a Chinese newspaper owned by the Communist party reported that the government was "considering punitive countermeasures against U.S. individuals, entities and state officials."China won't just strike back symbolically, but will impose countermeasures that will make them feel the pain," the newspaper reported.Earlier this month, the FBI briefed Smith on the threatened "pain," including bribes to attack Smith's reputation and coordinated disinformation on social media. Smith's office has already fought to remove fake accounts with his likeness from Twitter, Smith said."It's become a new normal a new abnormal," Smith said.Smith has introduced numerous bills in the last 30 years related to human rights abuses in China, including the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which imposed sanctions on the Chinese government for its actions against democratic activists in Hong Kong. President Donald Trump signed that bill into law in November.Last year, Smith introduced a bill specifically calling for the condemnation of the human rights abuses against Muslims in Xinjiang."We urge the U.S. side to immediately revoke the wrong decision and stop any words and deeds that interfere in China's internal affairs and harm China's interests," said Hua Chunying, spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign ministry, during a Monday news briefing. "China will make further response according to the development of the situation."Smith, 67, was planning to travel to China once the COVID-19 pandemic is abated, specifically to visit Hong Kong, Beijing and Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang.It's not the first time Smith has been targeted by the Chinese government.He wasn't allowed to visit the country for nine years after criticizing the Chinese government for covering up human rights abuses during the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing."They were rounding up all the human rights activists so they couldn't talk to journalists," Smith said. "I spent four or five days there. I had press conferences. We put together a political prisoners list. And sure enough, when we left, I was told 'you're not coming back.'"Before the sanctions came down, Smith was already working on a bill that would remove a nation from the U.S. "most-favored nation" trade list if there wasn't "significant progress" on human rights.Similar language was included in a 1993 executive order issued by then-President Bill Clinton. When it was rescinded, "we lost China as a human rights democracy," Smith said."If we just had a principled view that we're not going to trade with a dictatorship unless there's human rights progress ... we would empower the people to have a stronger voice," Smith said. "Where's the hope going to come from? Where's the democracy going to come from?"The relationship between China and the U.S. has deteriorated over the coronavirus pandemic, human rights, trade and Beijing's policy toward Hong Kong, where it has moved to erode the territory's separate judicial system from mainland China's.Beijing and Washington have agreed to the first phase of a trade deal. However, the second part of the agreement has stalled amid the heightened tensions.Load-Date: July 15, 2020End of Document

2 CHINESE HACKERS WORKING WITH THE MINISTRY OF STATE SECURITY CHARGED WITH GLOBAL COMPUTER INTRUSION CAMPAIGN TARGETING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION, INCLUDING COVID-19 RESEARCHUS Fed NewsJuly 21, 2020 Tuesday 2:27 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 1420 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, July 21 -- The U.S. Department of Justice issued the following press release:A federal grand jury in Spokane, Washington, returned an indictment earlier this month charging two hackers, both nationals and residents of the People's Republic of China (China), with hacking into the computer systems of hundreds of victim companies, governments, non-governmental organizations, and individual dissidents, clergy, and democratic and human rights activists in the United States and abroad, including Hong Kong and China. The defendants in some instances acted for their own personal financial gain, and in others for the benefit of the MSS or other Chinese government agencies. The hackers stole terabytes of data which comprised a sophisticated and prolific threat to U.S. networks.The 11-count indictment alleges LI Xiaoyu, 34, and DONG Jiazhi, 33, who were trained in computer applications technologies at the same Chinese university, conducted a hacking campaign lasting more than ten years to the present, targeting companies in countries with high technology industries, including the United States, Australia, Belgium, Germany, Japan, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Spain, South Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Targeted industries included, among others, high tech manufacturing; medical device, civil, and industrial engineering; business, educational, and gaming software; solar energy; pharmaceuticals; defense. In at least one instance, the hackers sought to extort cryptocurrency from a victim entity, by threatening to release the victim's stolen source code on the Internet. More recently, the defendants probed for vulnerabilities in computer networks of companies developing COVID-19 vaccines, testing technology, and treatments.The charges were announced by Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers; FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich; U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Washington William D. Hyslop; and Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Seattle Field Division Raymond Duda."China has now taken its place, alongside Russia, Iran and North Korea, in that shameful club of nations that provide a safe haven for cyber criminals in exchange for those criminals being 'on call' to work for the benefit of the state, here to feed the Chinese Communist party's insatiable hunger for American and other non-Chinese companies' hard-earned intellectual property, including COVID-19 research," said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers."Today's indictment demonstrates the serious consequences the Chinese MSS and its proxies will face if they continue to deploy malicious cyber tactics to either steal what they cannot create or silence what they do not want to hear," said FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich. "Cybercrimes directed by the Chinese government's intelligence services not only threaten the United States but also every other country that supports fair play, international norms, and the rule of law, and it also seriously undermines China's desire to become a respected leader in world affairs. The FBI and our international partners will not stand idly by to this threat, and we are committed to holding the Chinese government accountable.""The cybercrime hacking occurring here was first discovered on computers of the Department of Energy's Hanford Site in Eastern Washington. As the grand jury charged, the computer systems of many businesses, individuals and agencies throughout the United States and worldwide have been hacked and compromised with a huge array of sensitive and valuable trade secrets, technologies, data, and personal information being stolen. The hackers operated from China both for their own gain and with the assistance and for the benefit of the Chinese government's Ministry of State Security. This prosecution is occurring as a result of the combined unwavering efforts of the National Security Division of the Department of Justice, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Washington, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We seek justice for these victims and others affected and we intend to prosecute these defendants for their alleged crimes," said U.S. Attorney William D. Hyslop for the District Eastern District of Washington."The complicated nature of cyber investigations is only exacerbated when the criminal is backed by the resources of a foreign government. The nature and value of the material stolen by these hackers cannot just be measured in dollars and was indicative of being state driven. This case demonstrates the FBI's dedication to pursuing these criminals no matter who is sanctioning their activities," said Special Agent in Charge Raymond Duda of the FBI's Seattle Division.According to the indictment, to gain initial access to victim networks, the defendants primarily exploited publicly known software vulnerabilities in popular web server software, web application development suites, and software collaboration programs. In some cases, those vulnerabilities were newly announced, meaning that many users would not have installed patches to correct the vulnerability. The defendants also targeted insecure default configurations in common applications. The defendants used their initial unauthorized access to place malicious web shell programs (e.g., the "China Chopper" web shell) and credential-stealing software on victim networks, which allowed them to remotely execute commands on victim computers.To conceal the theft of information from victim networks and otherwise evade detection, the defendants typically packaged victim data in encrypted Roshal Archive Compressed files (RAR files), changed RAR file and victim documents' names and extensions (e.g., from ".rar" to ".jpg") and system timestamps, and concealed programs and documents at innocuous-seeming locations on victim networks and in victim networks' "recycle bins." The defendants frequently returned to re-victimize companies, government entities, and organizations from which they had previously stolen data, in some cases years after the initial successful data theft. In several instances, however, the defendants were unsuccessful in this regard, due to the efforts of the FBI and network defenders.The indictment charges the defendants with conspiring to steal trade secrets from at least eight known victims, which consisted of technology designs, manufacturing processes, test mechanisms and results, source code, and pharmaceutical chemical structures. Such information would give competitors with a market edge by providing insight into proprietary business plans and savings on research and development costs in creating competing products.The defendants are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets, which carries a maximum sentence of ten years in prison; one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; one count of unauthorized access of a computer, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; and seven counts of aggravated identity theft, which each carries a mandatory sentence of two non-consecutive years in prison. The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencings of the defendants will be determined by the assigned judge.The investigation was conducted jointly by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Washington, the National Security Division of the Department of Justice, and the FBI's Spokane Resident Agency and San Antonio Field Office. The FBI's Cyber Division assisted in the investigation and, along with FBI's Cyber Assistant Legal Attaches and Legal Attaches in countries around the world, provided essential support. Numerous victims cooperated and provided valuable assistance in the investigation.Assistant U.S. Attorney James Goeke of the Eastern District of Washington and Trial Attorney Scott McCulloch of the National Security Division's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting this case.The details contained in the charging document are allegations. The defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

Hey -- Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Dagen -- that's right. And good morning to you.The WHO says that there were more 183,000 new confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide in just 24 hours with the biggest jumps in Brazil, the U.S. and India. The global total stands now at nearly nine million confirmed cases and 468,000 deaths.Here in the U.S. some states breaking previous records for new cases. California reported at least 4,500 new cases and more than 20,000 over the last five days. Texas, 506 new cases have been reported in Austin, Travis County. That brings the total there to over 6,200, the highest increase that county has seen since the outbreak. One new death also reported raising the total to 110. Texas now considered a COVID-19 hot spot with an uptick in infections in Austin and San Antonio which reported 382 new cases over the weekend.But it's a different story in New York City today where thousands are going to head back to work for the first time in months.

Back over to you.MCDOWELL: Thank you so much -- Cheryl.The economic threat from China. This weekend, Maria sat down for an exclusive interview with Attorney General William Barr asking him about the threat posed to the American people by the Chinese Communist Party.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Tell me a bit about what the CCP is doing. I know there's been a real rethinking of the relationship between the United States and China.BARR: The way I look at it, this is a fundamental challenge to the United States. Since the late 19th century, our opportunity and our growth, our prosperity as a country has come from our technological leadership. We've been the technological leader of the world.In the last decade or so, China has been putting on a great push to supplant us explicitly. They want to be the leader in all the future technologies that are going to dominate the economy.And so what's at stake is the economic opportunity of our children and our grandchildren.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Joining me now Indiana Congressman, House Armed Services Committee member and Intelligence Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee member, Jim Banks. Congressman -- good morning to you. Great to see you.What do you make of the Attorney General's comments and what will Congress do about it?REP. JIM BANKS (R), INDIANA: Well, he's exactly right. I don't know that I've ever heard anyone say it as well as the Attorney General said it. This is about our kids, about their future, whether or not they will have a shot at the American dream. China is the greatest existential threat that America faces today, both economically and militarily.And that's why Kevin McCarthy set up the China task force, it's a shame that Democrats won't join Republicans in working together in the House to address this threat. By October 1st we will publish an exhaustive report to the rest of the Congress, to the American people, with a plan of how Congress can work with this administration to develop a road map moving forward to how we can address this threat.But Attorney General Barr is exactly right. Hoosiers have known this all along, by the way, that's why they overwhelmingly elected Donald Trump in 2016 and they're demanding that their elected officials like myself, their senators, their governors, that we all work together to do something about this, address the China threat and put America back in the driver's seat.MCDOWELL: Tom Bevan?TOM BEVAN, FOUNDER AND CEO, REALCLEARPOLITICS: Congressman -- what we're seeing with China has been a long time coming. I mean ever since Nixon (INAUDIBLE) in the 70s so half a century worth of policy toward China and they've been sort of lying and cheating and stealing the whole time. It's part of their business model.So where has Congress been and how did we get to this place over Republican and Democratic administrations over the last few decades?BANKS: As I said, I mean, President Trump is truly the only president, not just the first but the only president in my lifetime to identify China as a threat and to pivot away from the position and the failed hope that somehow China would join us as a westernized, democratic form of government that treated its people fairly, that has open markets.We know after decades of this foolish hope of China becoming that, that that's not going to happen. They will cheat. They will steal. They've stolen our jobs. They've given us this coronavirus. It's time to hold them accountable.How do we -- how do we get to a place in America where our elected officials would do something about it? We're there because the American people are demanding it. If you go out and look around the country and survey the American people -- this isn't Republican or Democrat -- there is a bipartisan demand by the American people to hold China accountable, to return our critical supply chain and jobs back home to America instead of leaving them in China so that we never deal with something like what we've dealt with over the last three months.We're there. The American people are demanding it. But it won't be what you find in the halls of Congress. Unbelievable. In Congress, you find that only one party focused on this threat. Another party is afraid and unwilling to address it because of -- because they're afraid that if they do they somehow appear like they're siding with President Trump in the process who has been very strong on this issue.MCDOWELL: China unleashed a deadly virus on the world and then lied about it. People realize that.And let's talk about China's influence on U.S. education and institutions in this country. Earlier this month a Harvard professor was indicted on charges of lying to U.S. officials over ties to a Chinese-run program with goals to strengthen that country's technological development. A number of staff members at U.S. institutions have faced similar accusations.On "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" back in April, Maria asked Oklahoma Senator Tom Cotton about why the U.S. should reconsider student visas for Chinese nationals. Here's what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SENATOR TOM COTTON (R), OKLAHOMA: Maria -- it's a scandal to me that we have trained so many of the Chinese Communist Party's brightest minds to go back to China, to compete for our jobs, to take our business and ultimately to steal our property and design weapons and other devices that can be used against the American people.So I think we need to take a very hard look at the visas that we give to Chinese nationals who come to the United States to study, especially at the post-graduate level in advanced scientific and technological fields.You know, if Chinese students want to come here and study Shakespeare and the federalist papers -- that's what they need to learn from America. They don't need to learn quantum computing and artificial intelligence from America.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Congressman -- what are you doing about that?BANKS: Yes. We have so much more to do. I introduced the Protect Our Universities Act, which would restrict Chinese nationals from participating in DOD funded or federal government funded research for national security purposes at our colleges.That led to some language being enacted in last year's National Defense Authorization Act. But there's so much more that we should do. I was astonished as a new member of Congress to find out that we don't track foreign students who are involved in research that is sensitive or classified that occurs on our college campuses.Senator Cotton is exactly right. And that's why President Trump just a few weeks ago sent home thousands of Chinese national students who had ties to the Chinese Communist Party, many of which who were involved in this type of espionage or stealing of research or secrets on college campuses.We've got to do a whole lot more. I admit that. But Senator Cotton, myself, we're trying to restrict these students from being involved in places where the they can steal our most important secrets related to our national security.MCDOWELL: Congressman -- great to see you. Thank you for being here this morning. Congressman Jim Banks.Coming up this morning, BarkerGilmore co-founder and managing partner, John Gilmore on the next jobs in America.Realtor and former HDTV host Mike Aubrey on rents dropping in the most expensive cities in the country.And in the 8:00 hour we have Trump campaign senior adviser Mercedes Schlapp on the President's rally in Tulsa Saturday Night.Plus Lady Gaga's dad, a New York City restaurant owner Joe Germanotta on New York City's phase two reopening, allowing for outdoor dining. You don't want to miss it.MCDOWELL: This Fox Business alert: Attorney General William Barr breaking the news to Maria Bartiromo on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" yesterday saying that China is trying to use 5G as leverage over the United States. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARR: If they start leading in some of these fundamental, foundational technologies like 5G, which will be the platform of much of our future manufacturing in the United States, they will have tremendous leverage over the United States. If all our industrial practices and our manufacturing practices are built on a platform that they dominate, they will have ultimate leverage over the west.So I think this is a -- this is a competition for the future. They haven't been competing fairly. And the President has confronted this when no one else has.And the American business community has been a big part of the problem. Because they're willing ultimately, many of them, to sacrifice the long- term viability of their companies for short-term profit so they can get their stock options and move into the gulf resort.That's what's driving some of this. They're not taking the long-term view and the national view, the American -- of maintaining the American strength.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: And Maria also had the exclusive breaking news that during a Senate briefing last week there was a proposal that included the United States acquiring minority stakes in Nokia and Ericsson as part of a larger plan with the E.U. government to challenge Huawei.Lee Carter, where do you stand on this?LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNER: Listen I think seven out of 10 Americans right now believe that we need to stand up to China and bring manufacturing and innovation back to this country and that goes across party lines.And so what I think is really important right now is that we're united on this. and this isn't just an issue about China although that is certainly important. It is an innovation story. America at its heart is an innovative country. We are proud of that and that is something we really need to be focused on.Why we are behind the curve on 5G is another story that we need to get our arms around because it's not just about Huawei and China. It's also about the fact that we haven't invested in the innovation here. And now we're getting caught behind the curve and at the hands of China.And so yes, we absolutely have to do something right now. This is nonpartisan. This is something we should all agree on and we need to get ahead of it.MCDOWELL: Mitch Roschelle -- a long-time professional in the financial services business, a viewer of the show, I won't name the individual but the person e-mailed me a short while ago and said can you find someone who believes that privately-financed systems can compete with government funded enterprises because the privately-funded systems are inherently managed better. The number of your guests who are advocating a Chinese system where the government invests in and aids businesses shocking.What do you say to that?MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER: If you just look at what 5G really is, just go back to the railroads when we industrialized this country or the interstates when we industrialized this country. It's that sort of infrastructure. Having foreign ownership of that infrastructure could in fact be a challenge for us to be competitive.I understand sort of both sides of the argument. I'm not a big fan of the government owning private enterprise. But I think it's vitally important that we get ahead on 5G and don't sort of lead from behind because we're never going to play catch-up. So I think it's all about getting 5G infrastructure out there for business and for consumers.MCDOWELL: What's the quickest way to do it? What's the quickest way to compete? Do we have to become more like China in order to stand up to them? And that kind of turns upside down the idea of the United States.ROSCHELLE: No. I think that's right. I think it's going to require the government working with the private sector and getting the capital needed and getting the regulatory approvals needed to get 5G across this country. And we have to do it quickly because not only is China doing it in China but they're doing it around the world.MCDOWELL: Right. Cheap technology prices, they spy on you.Coming up, the Trump administration taking on the state of New York, inside the firing of one of the top U.S. attorneys.MCDOWELL: Firing fallout. U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Geoffrey Berman announcing he's leaving office just hours after U.S. Attorney General William Barr said President Trump fired the powerful prosecutor.All this came after Berman disputed Barr's earlier claim that he was stepping down, refused to step down -- all this transpired in a letter to Berman. Barr says because you have declared that you have no intentions of resigning, I have asked the President to remove you as of today and he has done so.Senator Lindsey Graham says he won't move forward with replacing Geoffrey Berman until he receives approval from Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirstin Gillibrand.Joining me now is Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano. Judge -- great to see you.We have to point out that it was within the President's power and right to fire Berman. He's not even a -- he's a judicial appointment, never nominated or confirmed by the Senate and this was on the up and up. But what do you make of the certainly messy -- over the weekend?JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Well, good morning -- Dagen.It's always a pleasure to be with you. Messy to say the least. There actually is disputed authority about whether the President can fire a U.S. attorney who was appointed by the judges in the district as opposed to nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate.The problem is there are two statutes by Congress. One saying when you have been appointed by the judges you have that job until someone replaces you who has been nominated by the President, confirmed by the Senate.The other says the President can fire any U.S. attorney he wants.So I almost wish that Geoff Berman had challenged this and that the court ruled with clarity because Dagen -- there are many U.S. attorneys in the United States as we speak who are doing a very good job who have not been nominated by the President or confirmed by the Senate but appointed by the judges in that district, including New Jersey which is the third largest U.S. attorney's office in the country.Now, as for the messiness of it, you know, when the President was asked on his way to Tulsa on Saturday night why did he fire Bill Barr -- forgive me -- why did you fire Geoff Berman, he said I don't know anything about it. Talk to Bill Barr.There does not appear to be a written document firing him, signed by the President. Nevertheless, when he looked at all of this, I think he decided the best thing for me to do for the office is to resign. So he has resigned.He has been replaced by his number two person, a person of like thinking, deeply embedded in the investigations that that office is carrying on. The President has indicated whom he will nominate to replace him. A person with no prosecutorial experience -- I don't think that person will be confirmed by the Senate because of the Senator's very comment, as you pointed out, who's the chair of the Judiciary Committee, that he's not going to consider a nomination that does not have the approval of Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand. I can't imagine that they will give that approval.MCDOWELL: Right.NAPOLITANO: So we're left with a very functioning office that's a little bit demoralized. It's the premier federal prosecutorial service in the United States. It's older than the Justice Department itself.It may be -- it may be investigating the President's personal lawyer who once had that office, Rudy Giuliani. It may be investigating other people (INAUDIBLE) that the President does not want investigated.We won't know that unless and until they drop an investigation and announce it or they charge somebody.MCDOWELL: Just of couple quick things.Chuck Schumer, the Senate Minority Leader has actually called on President Trump's intended nominee, Securities and Exchange Commissions Chair Jay Clayton to withdraw his name.I used the phrase on the up and up. What I meant was that it's within -- was related to my question -- it's within the President's power to fire this individual. We don't know what -- frankly know behind the scenes what motivated Bill Barr to remove Geoffrey Berman or to attempt to remove Geoffrey Berman from the job.But to put an exclamation point on this. There is no expectation that any of the cases currently being investigated in the Southern District of New York would go away and we certainly would find out if that ever happened.NAPOLITANO: That's exactly correct. And that's -- you know, initially, I mentioned New Jersey, this is bizarre -- Dagen.Initially when they asked Geoff Berman to resign, they said you'll be replaced temporarily by your colleague in Newark, Craig Carpenito who is U.S. attorney in New Jersey. Not nominated by the President, not confirmed by the Senate, but appointed by the federal district court judges in New Jersey/Well, that violates the law because the law clearly says when the U.S. attorney leaves for whatever reason, and no matter how he got there or she got there, the U.S. attorney is replaced by the number two person.So the number two person, now the acting U.S. attorney -- whose name escaping me, forgive me, it's female -- will continue to investigate and will continue to operate that office, much as it has been done.If this looks like political interference, if this looks like Bill Barr is trying to stop a bone fide FBI/U.S. attorney investigation, you can only get away with so many of those before the roof falls in.MCDOWELL: Audrey Strauss, Judge. Audrey Strauss.NAPOLITANO: Audrey Strauss -- a good woman, a great lawyer, universally respected amongst FBI agents and federal prosecutors in the United States.Dagen -- thank you for helping with my memory loss this morning.MCDOWELL: And thank you for helping me always. Because again, it's live TV and we do hours and hours and hours of it every day. So Judge -- great to see you. As always.Judge Andrew Napolitano.Coming up, the next jobs in America. The professions set for a major boom as the country focuses on tech. That's next.CASONE: And welcome back. It is Monday, its June 22nd 7:30 a.m. Eastern time.Futures are set for triple digit gains at the open, but we are off the highs of the morning. Dow up 115 right now, NASDAQ up by 70, S&P up by 16 1/4. Stocks were in the green last week despite that sell off that we saw on Friday. As you can see a one percent gain for Dow Jones Industrial for the week.European stocks, though pointing down this morning after erasing earlier losses. The EU and China meeting for a video summit today hoping to ease tensions over coronavirus disinformation.And over to Asia, red across the board on a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the region. As you can see the Kospi down more than 1/2 a percent.And now to some of today's top stories we're following, President Trump expected to sign an executive order expanding immigration restrictions in the coming days. This will reportedly suspend a number of guest worker programs.The order would target H1B and H2B Visas designed for skilled workers in the tech industry and seasonal workers as well as L1 Visas. Those are meant for executives who work for large corporations. And J1 visas are for teaching and work exchange programs. The order is not expected to affect anyone already in the United States.Well, American Airlines says it plans to secure $3.5 billion dollars in new financing as it grapples with travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The company plans to raise $1.5 billion dollars by selling shares and convertible senior notes as well as offering $1.5 billion in senior secured notes that it intends to enter in a $500 million term loan facility. The stock is down 8 1/2 percent in the premarket right now. American expects to use the net proceeds to enhance its liquidity position.Well, Brett Favre comparing Colin Kaepernick to Pat Tillman who walked away from a multimillion dollar NFL contract and died serving his country. The Green Bay Packers legend making the comparison while talking to TMZ.Here's what he said, quote, it's not easy to stop something that you've always dreamed of doing for something that you believe in. Pat Tillman is another guy that did something similar and we regard him as a hero, so I'd assume that hero status will be stamped with Kaepernick as well.And finally, here is a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com. Properties at Walt Disney World and Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort and Campground going to begin to reopen today. Theme parks, though, not scheduled to reopen until July 11.Zoom, Google Meet, and Cisco WebX are the top three video conference apps as the coronavirus reshapes workplace and school culture around the world. And five companies are offering at home coronavirus tests for $109 dollars up to $150 dollars. And those are all your headlines from the newsroom. Dagen, back over to you.MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Cheryl. Cheryl Casone. COVID-19 forcing millions of Americans to work from home. Online privacy becoming an even more important part of doing business.The demand for lawyers with data privacy and cybersecurity backgrounds now growing with many positions paying into the seven figures. Joining me now, BarkerGilmore Co-founder, and Managing Partner, John Gilmore. John, you're essentially a head hunter for attorneys. Tell us more about these jobs and how your company is recruiting.JOHN GILMORE, CO-FOUNDER AND MANAGING PARTNER, BARKERGILMORE: Well, the jobs are, have been growing steadily since actually since, probably 2018, and what we find is that any of these instances, after, for example, the financial crisis, we had a boom, where we were looking for cheap compliance officers for corporations, building their compliance department to meet the new regulations. Well, we're seeing now is work from home is opening up a lot of security, potential breech areas, and we're seeing companies responding to it.We have been finding the need for Chief Privacy Counsel, Chief Privacy Officers, and then as they build their organizations underneath them they look for lawyers who have background in security and data. So, it's not an easy search for us, because the supply is low, and the demand is high, and needless to say its raising the rates for compensation.MCDOWELL: Mitch Roschelle.MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER AND BUSINESS DEVELOPER, PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS: Good morning. I guess one of the questions I have for you is the skills gap, because you touched on something, which is data privacy, cybersecurity. Are we seeing sort of across the board, a big skills gap where we're just not training professionals and sort of nonprofessionals for the jobs of the future?GILMORE: Yeah, that's a great question. Actually, interesting enough that there is no clear path to someone that has this background. They tend to stumble into it from a mentor or some experience along the way. So, we see for example, an intellectual property lawyer that's deep into technology, all of a sudden get routed into data privacy and security, or we maybe have a litigator that's doing some internal investigations after a compliance breach, that tends to have a form a passion for the industry, and make a route that way.So, there is no clear path from the start. So, you don't go law school and say I want to be a data, privacy and security lawyer. Its really as experiences come their way and they tend to dig into it a little bit deeper. That someone ultimately becomes a really solid data, privacy and security lawyer.MCDOWELL: Lee Carter.LEE CARTER, PARTNERS PRESIDENT, POLLSTER AND MASLANSKY: Yeah, I'm really curious too, when you're looking at, we talked about some of the skills gap here, but also you say it's really to recruit for these. Where, outside, what exactly kind of experience, are you recruiting from? And what kind of jobs did they have before?GILMORE: Yeah, I mean, unfortunately for the industry itself, as recruiters, we're playing a bit of musical chairs. We go out and sell the opportunity. So, we go out and find people who will actually have accomplished what they needed from skillset standpoint and a leadership standpoint. You know, take one from one company, bring to another.Again, with the compensation going up and the opportunity for the person to have a seat at the table with the executive team. That draw them in. What we need to have is more people at the junior lawyer stage and good mentorship in the law firms that are doing the training to achieve the demand.When the demand increases even further as things progress from COVID, we're going to have a bit of a problem. It's going to be, you know, the people that can afford the best in the very best, will be able to get them, because they'll recruit them away from another company. And some companies will definitely struggle to attract anyone.MCDOWELL: John, thank you so much for being here. John Gilmore. Pleasure.GILMORE: Thank you very much for having me.MCDOWELL: Coming up, some of America's most expensive real estate taking a hit. The trend in major cities across the country. Next.MCDOWELL: Real estate plunging. Rental prices, the most expensive cities in the country now a lot more affordable. Rents dropping significantly as more people move out of town. New York City, San Francisco, Boston, and San Jose. The priciest place to live in the US all seeing rent declines compared to a year ago. Landlords are scrambling to entice renters, offering perks like Peloton bikes, even months of living for free. Joining us now, Compass Vice President and Realtor, former HGTV Host, Mike Aubrey.Mike, you're in New York City, and I know this is going on in other places, there are moving trucks up and down every block, every weekend, and you can see the empty apartments. And you can see rents dropping. What's the overall impact of that in the coming months?MIKE AUBREY, VICE PRESIDENT, COMPASS: Listen, Dagen, I think if you start looking at this, it's not just residential, its residential and commercial. Really, what we've seen is COVID-19 has sort of leveled the playing field between urban centers and the suburbs. I mean, even before the virus was out there, I think what we saw was bilineal household formation had begun a shift away from urbanization, because I think bilineals were looking for schools and backyard barbecue's.COVID-19 just exacerbated that, and I think that now as people were trying to get a little bit more space, I think that workplaces are seeing that you don't necessarily have to be in a certain location in order to be efficient. I think that you are now seeing that shift. And that shift, I think, is going to be pretty destructive on residential and commercial landlords in urban centers.MCDOWELL: Well certainly here in New York City, it was the coronavirus lockdown, and people asked the question, why am I paying $5,000 dollars a month to rent a 500 square foot apartment when the night life and the city itself is the reason that I live here, and I can't go to a museum, I can't go to the ballet, I can't go to a show, I can't just go in a bar or a restaurant in a normal way and eat.And then you throw in, not the protest, but the looting and the vandalism and the general sense of lawlessness in this city in particular. And my question is, rents are plunging and you're seeing it. When do actual sale prices follow, because the amount you can rent an apartment for, is the central calculation of what you're willing to pay to buy the same property.AUBREY: Sure, I mean listen, I think this, I think that we're already beginning to see that to some extent in urban centers. I mean, the reality is, you know, you talked about culture, restaurants, bars, things like that. What actually keeps people in cities?I think it jobs. That's the tether. And if you don't have to be in a workspace, do you really have to be in that city? I think it's an interesting time. I think as we look at the next two to three years, as companies begin to evolve. If New York City, and Silicone Valley and places like that don't start to offer tax abatement for big corporations, you're going to continue to see this exodus to Southern cities like Charlotte, Austin, Nashville, places like that.MCDOWELL: Well and exodus from New York City to say, Florida because there's one thing that attracts people it's jobs. One thing that drives them away is a downward spiral in terms of what you get for the amount that you're paying in taxes. The more people leave, your tax base flees for the South or Texas of Nevada, and to cover the sky high spending in say New York City, they have to continually raise taxes, and it becomes this downward financial spiral and you're already beginning to see that.AUBREY: You are. I mean, listen, from a commercial standpoint, when you talk about commercial tenants, I think the days of having newsstands, and bodegas and gyms, just isn't going to cut it anymore. I want you to think about how do you attract these commercial tenants to stay in those buildings? I think you're going to need to have something more aggressive.I think you're looking at free parking, childcare for free, sort of wellness concepts for employees that are coming into those buildings. When you look at it from a residential standpoint, you know, like you said, Peloton bikes, but I think that this idea of sign the line type of gifts that used to be a luxury, are going to become a necessity in order for landlords to stay alive.MCDOWELL: I want a Peloton bike for my 500 square foot apartment. I want cheaper rent and one thing that smells bad that some real estate owners are doing is they are withholding inventory. The don't publish it and make it public, so they try to make it look like there aren't as many vacancies in these buildings throughout the city. They're trying to hide the fact that people are running for the hills or the beaches or anywhere but New York City. Mike Aubrey, good to see you.AUBREY: Thanks. You too Dagen.MCDOWELL: Thank you so much for being here. Coming up, Tesla's new ride on display. We check out the new truck making its debut in Los Angeles. Details next.MCDOWELL: Time for the morning buzz. First up, sweet ride. Tesla's cyber truck now on display at the Los Angeles Auto Museum. It marks the first time non Tesla employees can see the truck up close. Lee, your reaction. It looks like a 3-D model that somebody didn't get done with.CARTER: It does look like something out of science fair that somebody would have come up with as a kid theme, like, this looks like the future. I'm also wondering if in the museum they're going to have that hammer or whatever it was that Elon Musk tried to throw at it, and it ended up shattering the windshield. I'm interested to see what people will think of when they get to see it up close, because the reactions of it online and people seeing it was like, oh, this is not an attractive vehicle. But maybe people will like it, who knows.MCDOWELL: I will not bad mouth Elon Musk anymore though, because he's one of the lone voices who stands up for freedom in this country and actually pushes back on a monopoly like Amazon. So, she's like bring it on Elon Musk. Next, Tis a Winner, the Belmont Stakes racing this weekend without fans, Tis the Law taking the first leg of the Triple Crown. He is the first New York bred horse to win the Belmont in about 140 years. Tom, your reaction.TOM BEVAN, PRESIDENT, REALCLEARPOLITICS: Well, I mean, just a sign of what an unprecedented time and year that we're going through. Belmont's usually the finishing leg of the Triple Crown. Now it's the first leg of the Triple Crown, since the Preakness and the Kentucky Derby got postponed to September and October. So, but congratulations, I mean, first New York bred winner in 140 years it's a big deal and we'll see whether he can go the distance for the Triple Crown.MCDOWELL: Yeah, you've been to the Belmont haven't you Mitch, before?ROSCHELLE: I have been to the Belmont and it is a lot of fun, but not when its raining though. I'll tell you that is not a fun place to be when it's raining.MCDOWELL: Yeah, it gets messy. Shall we say. Well speaking of messy. Take a safety sip. Hard seltzer maker Crook & Marker is offering face masks with a little flap for your straw so you can drink and keep your face covered. It's called the TasteMask. Mitch, what do you think of this?ROSCHELLE: Yeah, well it's just two things there, there's the entire hard seltzer craze, which I'm in favor of, but it is before five o'clock. The other thing is, let's just talk about masks in general, my observation is, if you're going to wear them, wear them the right way, and having a little pouch that you can get a straw through, just seems to defeat the purpose of having the mask in the first place.And, as people get out more and more, I'm seeing some really bad mask habits, so, if you're going to wear them, wear them. If you're not going to wear them, that's whole other discussion, but I don't think a face flap is the right answer there.MCDOWELL: Yeah, my favorite, I would say, at least one third, if not more of the people who were wearing masks around New York City, and its most wear them, its below their nose. It only covers their mouth. It's not, it's right here only, okay. We're not going to get upset about that. But Lee, does the polling still break down among political parties of who's in favor of masks and who isn't?CARTER: Yes. And it's baffling to me. The polling around the coronavirus, our behaviors about going back out, going to restaurants, wearing masks, it divides completely on party lines. And I think a lot of it, as much as people are saying it's about the news consumptions, I think it's about our philosophy on life.And I think that a lot of Republicans believe in they the right to make these decisions for themselves, and that's really what it comes down to for whether or not they're going to say that they're going to do it or they believe in safety. It's a different philosophy. But, absolutely on almost every measure, when you look at COVID polling, it is completely divided by a huge number among party lines.MCDOWELL: I just don't like being told what to do, by anybody.CARTER: Exactly.MCDOWELL: But, I'm a mask wearer. I'm a religious mask wearer, just to clarify.CARTER: Me too.MCDOWELL: Still ahead, New York City entering phase two, we talk with Lady Gaga's dad, restaraunt owner Joe Germanotta on how the industry is bouncing back, next hour. Mornings with Maria.Load-Date: June 22, 2020End of Document

Pompeo: Administration May Ban Chinese Apps, Including TikTokThe FrontrunnerJuly 8, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 1070 wordsBodyThe CBS Evening News (7/7, story 9, 0:20, O'Donnell, 4.24M) reported that the "US government is looking at banning TikTok, the popular social media app. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claims users of TikTok and other China-based apps are unwittingly handing over personal data to the Chinese Communist Party."Reuters (7/7) reports that in an appearance on Laura Ingraham's Fox News show Monday night, Pompeo "said...the United States is 'certainly looking at' banning Chinese social media apps, including TikTok, suggesting it shared information with the Chinese government." Said Pompeo, "I don't want to get out in front of the President, but it's something we're looking at." Pompeo added that Americans shouldn't download TikTok unless "you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party."The Washington Times (7/7, Wolfgang, 492K) says "Pompeo cast TikTok alongside Chinese technology giants Huawei and ZTE in warning that Americans' data from the app could easily fall into the hands of Communist Party leaders." Said Pompeo, "We are taking this very seriously, and we are certainly looking at it." On Fox News' Ingraham Angle (7/6), Pompeo said "what the Obama-Biden Administration did with respect to China, it kowtowed, it appeased, turned the other cheek and it left America in a weaker position as a direct result of that failure to lead."CNBC (7/7, Kharpal, 3.62M) reports on its website that Pompeo also said, "Whether it was the problems of having Huawei technology in your infrastructure we've gone all over the world and we're making real progress getting that out. We declared ZTE a danger to American national security. ... With respect to Chinese apps on peoples' cellphones, the United States will get this one right too." According to CNBC, TikTok "has tried to distance itself from its Chinese parent company," ByteDance, and "hired former Disney executive, Kevin Mayer, to be" its CEO earlier this year.Vice President Pence said on Fox News' Special Report (7/7, 1.53M) that "whether it be the stand on Huawei or what we are currently considering with TikTok, this President also made it clear that we are going to preserve the national security interests of the United States of America from being compromised by the Chinese Communist Party."Wray: China Seeks To Compromise US Research On Coronavirus.The Washington Post (7/7, Barrett, 14.2M) reports FBI Director Christopher Wray on Tuesday "stepped up his criticism of China's alleged efforts to steal US technology and use subterfuge to pressure policymakers, warning that China is trying to penetrate American firms working on lifesaving research into the coronavirus." In remarks to the Hudson Institute, Wray said, "At this very moment, China is working to compromise American healthcare organizations, pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions conducting essential COVID research." Wray, however, "did not further detail what he suspects Chinese operatives are doing."O'Brien, Kudlow Warn Against Chinese Investment, Citing Risk Of Further Sanctions.The New York Times (7/7, Swanson, 18.61M) reports, "White House officials on Tuesday warned a federally administered retirement plan for railroad workers against investing in Chinese companies and said that additional sanctions could be on the way in return for China's role in spreading the coronavirus." National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien and NEC Director Larry Kudlow told the US Railroad Retirement Board in a letter that its investments in China were exposing retirees to "unnecessary economic risk" and channeling funds into companies "that raise significant national security and humanitarian concerns." The officials also said it was "a time of mounting uncertainty" over China's relations with the rest of the world that presented "the possibility of future sanctions or boycotts that may arise from a wide range of issues, including the culpable actions of the Chinese government with respect to the global spread" of the COVID-19 pandemic, "the suppression of Hong Kong's democracy."TikTok To Pull Out Of Hong Kong.The Wall Street Journal (7/7, Lin, Xiao, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports TikTok said it would pull out of Hong Kong within a week in light of "recent developments." The announcement came after Facebook, Twitter, and Google announced changes Monday to their operations in the city.Hong Kong Preparing New Restrictions On Internet Use.The New York Times (7/7, Mozur, 18.61M) reports that "as Hong Kong grapples with a draconian new security law, the tiny territory is emerging as the front line in a global fight between the United States and China over censorship, surveillance and the future of the internet." The Hong Kong government is believed to be "crafting web controls to appease the most prolific censor on the planet, the Chinese Communist Party. And the changes threaten to further inflame tensions between China and the United States, in which technology itself has become a means by which the two economic superpowers seek to spread influence and undercut each other."The AP (7/7, Soo, Kurtenbach) reports that on Tuesday, Hong Kong executive Carrie Lam "offered scant reassurance...over a new national security law that critics say undermines liberties and legal protections promised when China took control of the former British colony."US Demands China Release Professor Who Has Criticized Xi.Reuters (7/7, Pamuk) reports that on Tuesday, State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said the Trump Administration is "deeply concerned" about China's detention of Xu Zhangrun, a law professor who has been "an outspoken critic of the ruling Communist Party, and urged Beijing to release him." Ortagus tweeted, "We are deeply concerned by the PRC's detention of Professor Xu Zhangrun for criticizing Chinese leaders amid tightening ideological controls on university campuses in China. The PRC must release Xu and uphold its international commitments to respect freedom of expression."Bolton: Canada Should Not Release Huawei's Meng.Former National Security Adviser John Bolton writes in the Wall Street Journal (7/7, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) that the Trump Administration's request that Canada extradite Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou to face criminal charges reflects the escalating economic conflict with China. Bolton argues that if Canada lets Meng return to China, it would only embolden Beijing.Load-Date: July 8, 2020End of Document

Zoom caught in China censorship crossfire as meetings foiledAssociated Press InternationalJune 12, 2020 Friday 3:52 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 480 wordsByline: ZEN SOO, AP Business WriterDateline: HONG KONG BodyHONG KONG (AP) — Video app company Zoom says that it blocked several meetings and suspended the accounts of three activists at the request of the Chinese government.The company released details Thursday saying that in May and early June, the Chinese government notified it about several online meetings planned to commemorate the crackdown on protesters in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989.China bans public dissent. Zoom said the government told it such activities were illegal and demanded that the company terminate the meetings and the host accounts of the organizers, even though they did not live in China.Zoom then suspended the accounts of U.S.-based activists Zhou Fengsuo and Wang Dan, and Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Lee Cheuk-Yan. It has since reinstated all of their accounts.“Going forward Zoom will not allow requests from the Chinese government to impact anyone outside of mainland China," Zoom said in a blog post dated June 11.The company said it is developing technology that would allow it to block participants based on geography. That would mean it could stop people in mainland China from attending future meetings on Zoom that are deemed illegal by the Chinese government.It did not give details on how it would determine which meetings would fit that description. That raises the issue of Zoom acting as a censor on behalf of the Chinese government.Some international social media companies, like Twitter and Facebook, are mostly blocked inside China.Zoom is not. But it is among many companies subject to close scrutiny by Beijing as they operate across global borders. Issues related to cybersecurity and censorship are particularly acute for those that route through or store data in the Chinese mainland.“Though my account was unblocked, I cannot accept that Zoom will instead block Chinese participants. Shame on Zoom for political censoring on behalf of the Chinese government,” said Lee, who confirmed that Zoom had reinstated his paid account as of Thursday. But he said he plans to cancel it.Lee, who each year helps to organize Hong Kong’s annual candlelight vigil commemorating the 1989 crackdown, earlier said he was locked out of his paid Zoom account on May 22 ahead of a live video talk he organized featuring a fellow activist, Jimmy Sham.“My purpose of opening a Zoom account is to reach out to the mainland Chinese, breaking the censorship of the Chinese Communist Party. With this Zoom policy, it defeats my original purpose ... I have asked Zoom to pay me back the remaining months of subscription,” he said.Zoom is headquartered in San Jose, California, but conducts much of its research and development in mainland China. Use of the virtual meetings app has skyrocketed during the pandemic.Asked at a regular briefing on Thursday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said she was not aware of issues involving Zoom.Load-Date: June 12, 2020End of Document

TikTok Considering Ways To Separate From ChinaThe FrontrunnerJuly 10, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 260 wordsBodyThe Wall Street Journal (7/9, Lin, Li, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports Chinese company ByteDance Ltd. is considering various moves to separate its app TikTok from China, including giving it a non-Chinese headquarters. India has banned TikTok out of concern for cybersecurity and other countries are considering taking action.German Domestic Intelligence Agency Says Data Not Safe With Chinese Companies.The AP (7/9) reports, "Germany's domestic intelligence agency is warning consumers that personal data they provide to Chinese payment companies or other tech firms could end up in the hands of China's government." The agency says that "Chinese government offices have access to data stored in China by companies" and "other apps, web services and mobility providers such as for example (bike sharing) providers" some of which operate in Germany. BfV head Thomas Haldenwang "said German's data isn't safe with Chinese companies because they are required by law to provide the data to their government."OSU Researcher With Ties To China Charged With Grant Fraud.The Washington Times (7/9, Mordock, 492K) reports that a Ohio State University professor "with ties to a controversial group that the Trump administration has accused of stealing U.S. intellectual property was charged with grant fraud, according to an indictment unsealed Thursday." Song Guo Zheng was arrested in late May, the Justice Department said, after he allegedly engaged in "a sophisticated medical grant fraud scheme" to fraudulently obtain more than $4.3 million in NIH grants.Load-Date: July 10, 2020End of Document

Human Rights Watch: Remember Liu Xiaobo by Supporting Rights Activists in ChinaTargeted News ServiceJuly 14, 2020 Tuesday 9:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 755 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyHuman Rights Watch issued the following news release:Three years ago, on July 13, 2017, Chinese Nobel Peace laureate Liu Xiaobo died from complications of liver cancer while guarded by state security officers. Had he lived -- and had the Chinese authorities lived up to their obligations -- he would have been released on June 21 after serving an 11-year sentence for "inciting subversion."Since Liu's death, the Chinese government has become even more repressive - a grim reality marked by the imposition of the draconian National Security Law on Hong Kong on July 1.If Liu were still alive, he would have been able to see close friends recently released from prison: Chen Wei and Liu Xianbin, signatories to Charter '08, a pro-democracy manifesto that Liu Xiaobo organized. Both were released this year after nine and 10 years, respectively, in prison. But Liu would not have been able to see Qin Yongmin and Huang Qi, activists detained when he was in prison and now serving 13- and 12-year sentences on baseless charges.If Liu were alive, he would have learned about the detentions of young activists he had never heard of, such as Cai Wei and Chen Mei, both 27. They have been detained since April for archiving censored materials published on Chinese media outlets and social media platforms related to COVID-19.Human rights activists in China are now enduring their worst persecution since peaceful protesters took to Tiananmen Square and streets across the country in 1989. Yet despite the suffocating political environment, the fight for a democratic, rights-respecting China continues.In February, authorities detained an activist and lawyer, Xu Zhiyong, days after he published an essay criticizing the Chinese government's mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak and calling for President Xi Jinping to resign. On July 6, Beijing police detained a law professor, Xu Zhangrun, who had published scathing articles condemning the Chinese Communist Party's rule.China's human rights activists, lawyers, and academics are not naive about the possible consequences of their actions -- both Xu Zhiyong and Xu Zhangrun had repeatedly said they were prepared for prison. Rather - as they often told me - they felt compelled to act by their anger over injustices, their compassion for victims of abuses, and their solidarity with fellow activists and lawyers. Activists have also expressed a desire to honor the life and legacy of Liu Xiaobo - a friend, a mentor, and a towering figure in China's human rights movement.If Liu were still alive, he might have been heartened to see the world finally waking up to the character of the Chinese Communist Party and the threats it poses to human rights globally.In just the past month, reacting to the arbitrary detentions of an estimated 1 million Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang, the U.S. government adopted the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act sanctioning Chinese officials involved in rights violations in Xinjiang. In late June, 50 United Nations human rights experts banded together in an unprecedented joint call to examine the Chinese government's human rights record.In response to Beijing imposing a national security law on Hong Kong, the U.K. government is broadening visa rights for 3 million Hong Kong residents, and the Canadian government suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong. The U.S. Congress advanced a bill that would require sanctions on foreign banks complicit in Beijing's crackdown on the city. Even governments often reluctant to challenge China on human rights issues, like India and Japan, have expressed concern about Hong Kong.These actions are important, but governments need to keep supporting activists inside the country, the real agents of change. At this dark moment, light for activists in the country comes in the form of governments calling publicly for their release, and for repeal of the unjust laws used to detain them. Governments can uphold those activists' work by considering their ideas -- not just the Chinese government's -- in policy debates. Governments can provide resources to operate inside the country, and a safe haven if activists need to leave China.In the defense statement for his trial, Liu Xiaobo said, "For there is no force that can put an end to the human quest for freedom, and China will in the end become a nation ruled by law, where human rights reign supreme." The international community should do all it can to make his wish true.[Category: International]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7174082 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 14, 2020End of Document

Senator Tim Scott set to reveal the GOP's Justice Act today, leaving Senate Democrats already slamming the plan even before seeing it. They claim is falls short of meaningful reform.The GOP plan comes one day after President Trump signed an executive order on police reform that banned chokeholds in all but the most extreme cases. It also improves information sharing to address mental health issues.The Fulton County, Georgia, district attorney, meanwhile, expected to announce whether to charge the officers involved in Rayshard Brooks' death.

The country making the move due to a serious new outbreak at a wholesale market. The owner claims Covid-19 was spread by imported salmon. The Chinese government says there's no evidence of that. To help contain the spread, though, Beijing is canceling many flights, granting refunds for train tickets and stopping certain taxi services and bus routes. Officials blocked off neighborhoods and shut down schools as well.PG&E pleading guilty to manslaughter in connection with the 2018 Camp Fire.

Governor Andrew Cuomo says that the U.S. Tennis Association will put new safety measures in place, including testing, additional cleaning and extra locker room space.Police reform in focus this morning, certainly. President Trump signing an executive order yesterday in the Rose Garden. It bans officers from using choke holds unless faced with deadly force. It tracks officers with repeated misconduct complaints and provides incentives for departments to deploy non-police experts on issues like mental health or homelessness and addition.This comes as South Carolina Senator Tim Scott is set to introduce his own effort that would track excessive force and no-knock warrants and the federal funds to end choke holds.Today, the House Judiciary Committee is set to markup Democrats' reform bill introduced last week.And joining me right now to walk us through that is a member of that committee, Georgia Congressman Doug Collins.Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks so much for being here.REP. DOUG COLLINS (R-GA): Hey, good morning, Maria.BARTIROMO: Tell us about the Democrat bill and that markup happening today. What are you expecting to zero in on?COLLINS: Well, it's going to be interesting to see what the -- as we go through this, like we saw last week. The problem we're having with the Democrat bill is they sort of put every bill that they could imagine into this bill to try and hit everything that they should have been doing, we should have been talking about over the last two or of three years, when we actually had a police working group actually discussing these things, but now we've waited until it's a situation in which they're trying to bring it out.And instead of dealing with the issues of transparency, dealing with officer training, dealing with the issues that are the things that actually make a difference in communities, we're going to also continue to be, I think, trying to enforce different things that will, frankly, be very difficult for police and local departments to try and implement. And, at the same time, not giving the flexibility.We need what the president did yesterday, and that is talk about transparency, talk about openness, being able to move and make sure that those officers who are not doing it right are not policing our streets anymore, and making sure that they have the ability to do their job. That's what we've got to be a part of.BARTIROMO: So Tim Scott will release a different plan. Tell me where this goes in terms of the timing this week.COLLINS: This week we'll have the markup in Judiciary Committee here in the House, and then there -- I'm assuming that they're going to try and mark -- it will be taken to the floor either late next week or the week after.It's my understanding now that Senator Scott's bill, who I'm proud of, has been working on many things that we've been talking about. It looks like they'll now take that up in the Senate come next week.But, remember, one of the things we've talked about, and I want to go back to what the president said yesterday, and it's something we worked on a few years ago, we actually had a bill, the Criminal Justice and Mental Health Act, but we actually put in a bill that actually helps federal officers and state officers learn how to deal with situations that they've come across nowadays.It's not only just those who are committing bad acts, but you're coming across those who are -- who have mental health issues, addiction issues. And that was a bill that actually began to help them notice the difference so that they can deescalate instead of having these things escalate to situations that are just tragic for all involved.BARTIROMO: Congressman, let me ask you about these Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaing two Justice Department officials to testify that A.G. Barr sought certain cases for political gain. These include more lenient sentencing for Roger Stone and the fuel efficiency deal between large automakers in California.Congressman, your reaction.COLLINS: Here we go again. Really? Chairman Nadler, with everything we've got going on in this country, with everything that we could be focused on - - we could be focused on the tech investigation, or actually be working to make sure that tech is held accountable for the things that they've doing, which we've been trying to do for years, talking about their safe harbor protections that they hide behind every time that they go after, you know, somebody or they try to have their own version of censorship.Why don't we look at the police work working group (ph) that we've been talking about? Why don't we do the issues of immigration? Instead, we're going back to the old salt lick, so to speak, and we're going back to say, we're going to attack the DOJ because we don't like the DOJ.Let's let the election in 2020 happen. And, Jerry Nadler, start being a chairman who actually does the job of the committee and not just something for headlines. This is -- I mean, Maria, we've been talking about this for ages. All they want to do is go rehash old things because they want to get at this president.BARTIROMO: And yet they completely are ignoring a truly criminal investigation underway right now by John Durham where we actually did see politicization of the White House and politicization of the Intelligence agencies, the tools that we use against terrorists with the cabal at the FBI and the CIA in trapping Trump campaign officials.Your colleagues on the left in the Judiciary Committee refuse to look at this.COLLINS: Well, it's -- they have, you know, amnesia on that part. They don't want to go back and discuss that part, because right now they have every power that they want to use to track down the president. They have every power to -- let's subpoena Comey. Let's get them back in there. Let's get McCabe. Let's get Page. Let's get Strzok. Let's get, you know, the whole investigation process going back in here and say, this is what we have actually seen. Let's talk about what the inspector general found. Let's now talk about what -- we know that the inspector -- Attorney General Durham is going through.These are the things, as you said, could actually be done, but we don't want to talk about that. Why? Because it ruins their entire narrative of over two years that led us through a sham impeachment, that led us to investigation after investigation.They don't want people to be reminded and the media -- the mainstream media don't want to be reminded that they bought it hook, line and sinker. When Adam Schiff was telling stories that didn't factually pan out, when Jerry Nadler was railing against the -- everything else, they bought it hook, line and sinker.And now they don't want to go back because they have to admit they were wrong and that the Department of Justice was a corrupt band that was after a candidate for president and trying to ruin the first part of his presidency and have been ever since.BARTIROMO: In fact, Senator Ron Johnson is working on an investigation right now into the transition. The transition is supposed to be a peaceful transition from President Obama to President Trump. I asked former senior adviser to President Obama, Valerie Jarrett, about it yesterday, all of the leaks, to get her reaction to former acting DNI Ric Grennell accusing the Obama administration of blowing the Trump peaceful transition.Watch her -- her reaction to that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson is investigating that transition, the 125 leaks during the first 126 days between the Obama and Trump administrations.What is your reaction to all of these investigations going on right now into the origins of the Russia probe?VALERIE JARRETT, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO PRESIDENT OBAMA: I can say to you this, completely clearly, Maria, that I am so proud of how we handled that transition. And the people who were in the national security space, who were doing their jobs, we should not be politicizing and investigating their work when what they did was consistent with past practices.BARTIROMO: Yes.JARRETT: Party -- both parties throughout our -- throughout our nation's history.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Congressman, she went on to say that Congress has a lot to deal with right now, including 100,000 deaths from coronavirus, and that you should be focused on that.COLLINS: If I was her, I'd want to be focused on anything but that as well.Again, I -- listen, I think we may just be -- put that interview in the -- in the archive and save it, because it's not going to age well. It's not aging well right now because we know the problems and the leaks that nobody were held accountable for.We have Jim Comey saying, we have an opportunity here in the first few days of this administration to go in and do something we would never have dreamed of doing under other presidents, because we think that we can actually force something here to push our political agenda.We go back to the leaks and we found out in the Oval Office, when they talked about unmasking of Flynn, we go through this whole process. You know, look, if I was her, I would not want to talk about this either because it does not shine a very flattering light on the very facts of what happened.You can try and divert it to coronavirus. You can try and divert it to the weather of the day, but you can't divert the facts that what they did was wrong, and what they did was try to disrupt this presidency. And it came back in the FBI, all the way to the candidacy stage.So, look, that's just a sad excuse for not wanting to investigate the truth.BARTIROMO: Congressman, do you think we're going to see John Durham's criminal investigation soon? When are you expecting Durham to be done?COLLINS: I'm -- I'm expecting -- I'm hoping for any day that we wake up and we begin to see this actually begin to be put to bed and actually people be held accountable for what's going on.So I'm hopeful at any time now that we're going to do it, because this needs to happen. And when people want to not -- or play down this, and they don't want to talk about it, they have to realize, again, don't think about this in terms of this -- the upper echelons of a presidential campaign or presidential politics. This could happen to anyone. And if there's not a restraint on what the FBI and the others were doing there, what else were they doing anywhere else? And we've got to make sure that the top is always held accountable for what they're doing.BARTIROMO: Absolutely.Congressman, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks so much.COLLINS: Thanks, Maria, take care.BARTIROMO: We'll keep -- we'll keep watching all of that.And to you.Congressman Doug Collins joining me there.We've got a big show coming up. Later this hour I will speak with Atlas Organization's Jonathan D.T. Ward as China and India face off in a brutal border dispute.And then Sylvia's Restaurant's vice president of communications is here. Tren'ness Woods-Black tells us how she's overcoming the challenges her business is facing in the wake of coronavirus shutdowns.Plus, 8:00 a.m. Eastern, former White House Press Secretary and Fox News contributor Sarah Sanders giving us her take on bias in the media.And then I'll speak with Vista Equity Partners founder, chairman and CEO, Robert Smith on diversity and small business funding.Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big couple of hours coming up.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Markets looking to extend yesterday's gains. Take a look at futures, with a gain this morning of 166 points, the Nasdaq is up 52 and the S&P right now up 17 points ahead of the opening of trading.Stocks soared yesterday after a record jump in retail sales. Dow Industrials were up 526 points yesterday.Joining me right now is the Citi ICG chairman, Leon Kalvaria.And, Leon, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.I want to talk to you about capital markets this morning and what your sense is of business coming back, whether it's IPOs, deal flow, what's your sense of capital markets today?LEON KALVARIA, CHAIRMAN, CITI ICG: Right.Good morning, Maria, and thanks for having me today. Sorry we're not there in person.BARTIROMO: Yes.KALVARIA: The markets have obviously come back significantly since the March lows. The Fed involvement has been significantly and, as a result, firstly the investment grade market came back in size and there was record issuance in the first quarter, going into the second quarter, as companies stabilized their balance sheets. Then the high yield market came back in stages. And then last but not least, massive issuance of secondary equities and IPOs. So, from a market standpoint, we've seen great receptivity for companies that have performed reasonably during this period of time. We had Royalty Farmer (ph) yesterday with an IPO over $2 billion. Warner Music with an IPO close to $2 billion. The sale of P&C's stake in Blackrock for over a billion five. So there's significant investor interest here right now and some level of stabilization in the market and lowering of volatility.BARTIROMO: Leon, isn't it interesting to you that we are officially in recession right now? I mean we're talking about a contraction in the second quarter of up to 30 percent, and yet you're seeing companies doing IPOs, you're seeing markets near record highs. Look at where the Nasdaq is. What do you make of this and what's your view of what's to come in terms of the pipeline for IPOs?KALVARIA: Well, let me start out, I mean the market is looking forward to 2021, 2022. You know, everyone has talked about a "v," a "u," an "l," I don't think people totally understand where the marketplace will be from the standpoint of that. But I think that what we will see here is some level of recovery in terms of the third and fourth quarter. The question really becomes, what happens on the employment side. Obviously, debt is profound and we will see some level of good numbers coming in here, but good is a relative issue, relative to the number of people that are still unemployed. So that's a big focus. And if we end up with an infrastructure bill, that will be significant in terms of hopefully returning people back to work.BARTIROMO: Yes.KALVARIA: For the markets looking forward, I think we'll see more IPO issuance and it will be for companies that have been resilient during this period of time and some, in fact, have outperformed.BARTIROMO: Yes, because it's a bifurcated situation. I mean we had some very good retail sales numbers yesterday, 17.7 percent gain in retail sales. You also have certain things like, you know, the digital economy doing -- doing very well. But then there are others filing for bankruptcy in retail like JC Penney, Neiman Marcus, J. Crew, Pier One.So tell us the sectors that you believe the growth is going to be in and where do you see the most activity, whether it's deal flow, IPOs, stocks, whatever it is, what are the areas that you see activity right now?First and foremost, I think some of the retail bankruptcies were companies that were impaired coming into the crisis and the crisis simply accelerated badly their demise. If you look forward right now, areas like FinTech (ph), I think that FinTech will accelerate development that would have occurred two or three years from now and I think we'll see significant impact in that sector right now in terms of consolidation and M&A.Secondarily, you'll see consolidation is, is in the energy sector, where, obviously, there are a number of impaired companies sitting there and they need to be consolidated and brought into some level of a framework that they can operate in this kind of environment right now.So those are two areas. The consumer products sector may see some consolidation. Obviously, eating at home has had a significant impact on some of those companies.BARTIROMO: Right.KALVARIA: And I think we'll see some great, great potential transactions in that sector.BARTIROMO: All right.KALVARIA: I don't want to say we're totally bullish here right now, but there's a number of companies that have come out of this well positioned and this has accelerated their growth.BARTIROMO: OK.Leon, it's great to have you this morning. Always good to get your insights. We so appreciate your time. Thank you, sir.Leon Kalvaria from Citi.KALVARIA: Thanks a lot, Maria.BARTIROMO: And we'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Tracking your data. "The Wall Street Journal" out with a new piece this morning, tech firms are spying on you. In a pandemic, governments say that's OK. The paper identifies dozens of local governments using data from smaller companies that market tracking information to keep an eye on people as businesses reopen.Joining me right now is Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.Judge, this does not sound good.JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: No.Good morning, Maria.It does not sound good at all. It is basically hundreds of local municipalities and cities and -- and the 50 states violating the Fourth Amendment right to privacy by surveilling the movements of people without search warrants.Now, surveillance is a search, meaning, if the government wants to follow you for whatever reason, they have to go to a judge and present probable cause of crime. The only other way to follow somebody is a FISA warrant. That -- this has nothing to do of with FISA or with foreign terrorism or an allegation of foreign terrorism.But for the governments to license the use of apps from private entities that will follow you for the government and then the government to accumulate that information, no matter how beneficial or salutary the government claims its behavior is, the government says it's doing this because it wants to know where people congregate and where they're close to each other, even though we're on the downside of the Covid slope, the government simply can't do that and it can't get away with it.BARTIROMO: Yes.NAPOLITANO: But, Maria, unless someone can show that they were spied on and they were harmed, they can't even get into court to challenge it.BARTIROMO: Well, this is a dangerous, slippery slope, that's for sure. And, you know, earlier I had on Wilbur Ross and I talked to him about how these four Chinese telecom companies sold technology to U.S. carriers over decades. That gave the Chinese communist party access to government corporate personal data conversations, all proprietary information flowing through those networks, and it happened for two decades because they sold us this equipment and these companies trade on the New York Stock Exchange, by the way. So we're actually funding it. It's absolutely extraordinary.NAPOLITANO: You --BARTIROMO: And then you've got the conservatives -- yes, go ahead, Judge.NAPOLITANO: No, you're right and the secretary is right. The government's job is to protect our rights. One of those rights that it is supposed to protect is the right to privacy. In the case that you and Secretary Ross talked about, the government itself permitted our most vicious and dangerous enemy to violate our privacy.BARTIROMO: Yes. Right.NAPOLITANO: In this case, that "The Wall Street Journal" has written about this morning, the government itself is the actual violator of the privacy.BARTIROMO: Yes. And then there's also --NAPOLITANO: So the culture in government is, do anything you can to avoid the Fourth Amendment.BARTIROMO: But we're also talking about censorship this morning, Judge. NBC News verification center.NAPOLITANO: Yes.BARTIROMO: Who knew they had a verification center. They're forced to backtrack after allegedly pushing Google to ban ads on a conservative website. This report says that the tech giant planned to demonetize both ZeroHedge and "The Federalist" over what they're calling racist content. But NBC had alerted Google to "The Federalist" themselves. So it's basically NBC trying to put "The Federalist" out of business.NAPOLITANO: Yes.BARTIROMO: Google reviewed the issue and stated this on Twitter. "The Federalist" was never demonetized. We worked with them to address issues on their site related to the comment section.So now we're looking at the comment section. It's been removed. We consider this matter resolved and no action will be taken.But, I mean, taking away the comments section, what do you think, real quick, Judge, we've got to jump?NAPOLITANO: You know, look, I think that all censorship is repugnant to the First Amendment. Even private censorship.BARTIROMO: I agree.NAPOLITANO: Even non-government censorship. But the president is right, NBC is in the business of silencing those that disagree with it by tarnishing them with the brush of racism.BARTIROMO: And Google is so big that it can do it. There you go. Judge Andrew Napolitano, always a pleasure to see you, sir.NAPOLITANO: Yes.BARTIROMO: Thank you.We will take a break. When we come back, a brutal border dispute. China and India are facing off in one of their worst border standoffs in decades. People are dead.And then airlines forced to adapt to the pandemic. The latest changes making -- with their food and beverage services to keep fliers safe. All that right after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, June 17th. Your top stories right now, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.Markets are higher. We're looking for another rally this morning when the opening bell happens. They're going to extend yesterday's big move. The Dow Industrials this morning now at the highs of the morning, up 180 points. That's two thirds of 1 percent. The Nasdaq's up 54, the S&P is up 19.On top of a big rally yesterday, sparked much by the stronger than expected retail sales numbers we brought you yesterday, 17.7 percent reported on retail sales for the month of May. Dow Industrials at the close up 526 points, better than 2 percent. The Nasdaq up 169, and the S&P up 58.Global markets this morning also with a firmer zone. European indices mostly higher. Inflation slowing in the Eurozone this morning. May consumer prices were out, falling a tenth of a percent month over month. The FT 100 is up 38, the CAC quarante is up 60, and the DAX index is up 91 points right now.In Asia overnight, markets were mostly high with the exception of Japan. We had Japan reporting May exports were down 28 percent year over year.Meanwhile, in China, Beijing is closing schools, blocking off certain neighborhoods and canceling flights as it sees a spike in coronavirus cases once again.Meanwhile, this, several airlines are banning alcohol now from the friendly skies in an effort to stop the spread of coronavirus.Cheryl Casone with those details now.Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Maria.As if flying during a pandemic isn't stressful enough, you're going to have one less option to relax while you're on-board. Delta is banning the sale or consumption of booze on-board domestic flights, as well as flights to Mexico, Canada, the Caribbean and Central America. American Airlines is going to limit alcohol and food depending on the length and destination of the flight. First class and international passengers will still get served their alcohol.In the U.K., Easy Jet and Virgin Atlantic are not going to serve alcohol for now. Meantime, Southwest Airlines is extending its policy to leave middle seats open on flights through the end of September to curb the spread of Covid-19 and will now ask passengers to fill out a health declaration before they board the plane.Well, at least 3,400 jobs are being eliminated at AT&T as the company looks to accelerate cost cuts amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The carrier is also closing 250 stores. The layoffs target technical and clerical positions. AT&T made the announcement as more consumers shop online after lockdown orders forced the company's retail stores to close. The pandemic seems to be really accelerating the overall $6 billion cost cutting push that they announced back in October of last year. We're taking a look at the stock. It's up about a half a percent in the premarket. This is one of the most heavily indebted companies in the United States right now.And then finally here's a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com.The University of Virginia is changing its athletic logos after criticism they referred to the school's history with slavery.McDonald's is bringing back some of its menu items, possibly the salads and the chicken tenders that were cut to speed up service when the coronavirus hit the United States.And, finally, Nathan's Famous July 4th Hot Dog Eating Contest is a go. It's going to take place as scheduled, but without a live audience. Maria, it will still take place on Coney Island.And those are your headlines from the newsroom.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you.Meanwhile, we are looking at China. Rising tensions on the India-China border now. India says 20 soldiers are now dead after a clash with Chinese troops. This area is a long disputed zone in the Himalayan Mountains. The conflict is now the worst military confrontation between the two nations in decades. India's prime minister calling for a meeting to discuss the situation on Friday.Joining me right now to talk about that is Atlas Organization founder and author of "China's Vision of Victory, "Jonathan D.T. Ward.And, Jonathan, it's good to have you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.Secretary Pompeo, last week, when he joined me on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" said that China is using this opportunity, this pandemic, as an opportunity to gain more ground. And as a result, they invaded India.What can you tell us about the situation, which is on -- which is happening as we speak. Sorry, pardon me.JONATHAN D.T. WARD, FOUNDER, ATLAS ORGANIZATION: Good morning, Maria. It's great to be here.So, I mean, first of all, the most important thing here I think is that this is the first use of China's military to kill soldiers from a neighboring country in the 21st century. I mean in the 25th (ph) century they went to war with pretty much every neighbor they had, including India in 1962. But now, as they've been talking about preparing to fight and win wars, they're building an ever more capable military. And there, for the first time, we have the first instance of interstate violence, you know, caused by China.So it won't be the last one. You and I have been talking about that for a long time. I mean China's pressing its claims all over the region. But here what it's doing most significantly is this is really going to be a turning point in China-India relations. I mean China-India relations have always been tense. But in 2018, there was the Wuhan summit and Xi and Modi got together to try and diffuse, you know, problems in the relationship after the Doklam Himalayan crisis. And, you know, there was the spirt of Wuhan. I mean this is the Wuhan prior to Covid. And that was meant to put diplomatic energy into the relationship. But that's going to be gone now. I mean the Indian public has long been very, you know, unfriendly towards China essentially because of 1962 and other broken promises. But this, I think, is another real turning point.So China is losing its relationship with the United States and also losing its relationship with India. So as it loses its relationships at the world's two most important democracies, you can imagine a very, you know, fractious geopolitical environment for the 2020s.BARTIROMO: Where does the U.S. -- Jonathan, where does the U.S. stand in this? Will the U.S. aid India? I know that this is one area that some people believe the manufacturing supply chains that the U.S. administration are hoping to come out of China could end up landing in India.WARD: Well, that would be the right thing to do. I mean what we really have to be doing is moving our supply chains out of China. You know, China's fundamentally taking the entire civilian economy through made in China 2025 and civil military fusion and repurposing this for military power. So, at the end of the day, we can't have our corporations or banks, you know, contributing to China's militarization and conflicts in the region.So, ultimately, India would be a good destination. And I think businesses are going to have to put as much energy into figuring out how India works in the 2020s as they did in to figuring out how China works in the 2000s and 1990s because, at the end of the day, the U.S.-India relationship is a relationship that you can build into. I mean we are going to be geopolitically aligned. There's, you know, this -- this important space for the two, you know, most significant democracies to come together and build this alignment that can bring other of regional powers in.BARTIROMO: Yes.WARD: And CEOs and institutional investors have got be a part of this. They can't keep betting and doubling down on China.BARTIROMO: What's your take on the telecom story? I want to ask you about Huawei and 5G. In the last hour I spoke with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross about news this week that the commerce department will allow U.S. companies to work with Huawei on 5G standards. And I wondered why the change. Here's what the secretary told me last hour.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Will this move normalize an elevated company that has ties to the Chinese government? We know that this is a state run company and that there are back doors and the data goes back to the Chinese communist party.Why the change?WILBUR ROSS, COMMERCE SECRETARY: Well, the change is really simply a clarification. It isn't that we're doing something to help Huawei.The idea of this is to make sure that standards are symmetrical, that they're worldwide, and that with 5G they facilitate the interconnectedness of everything. Every person, every thing, every factory, every process. That's the whole idea of 5G.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And then there is also the story of the Chinese telecom companies having sold technology to U.S. telecom companies decades ago, which basically enabled them to spy on our networks, Jonathan.Your reaction?WARD: Right. Well, I guess this new move on Huawei has to do with standard setting. I mean China, at this point, having achieved such substantial market share internationally through its telcos and tech companies is looking to advance standard setting and international bodies and the concern would be that if -- if we restrict our engagement with them in that way, we will be left off the table. But that shouldn't prevent us from going after Huawei in every possible way. I mean that all has to move forward full force, particularly on semiconductors. I mean that's the biggest question there's going to be is to what extent are these export controls and the rest of the sanctions program going to impact and limit the abilities of our companies to actually do material things with Huawei because, you know, Huawei is a dangerous actor.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well --WARD: Part of the CCP's critical infrastructure program.BARTIROMO: It's about spying. It's about -- it's about spying. It's also about stealing intellectual property. We know that the National Institutes of Health fired 54 researchers as ongoing investigations reveal 93 percent of them failed to disclose any links to the Chinese communist party.I should add that that Harvard professor who was indicted is pleading not guilty to hiding ties to China. He was the head of the chemistry department at Harvard and he was getting paid by the CCP, Jonathan, real quick.WARD: Right. I mean we have to go after things like the 10,000 talents program. I mean China has recruitment programs that they deploy globally in order to bring not -- you know, not only intellectual property, but -- but minds themselves and people's skill sets to helping build China.So, yes, we have to be very careful with that sort of thing.BARTIROMO: Jonathan, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks so much. We will see you soon.Dr. Jonathan wards joining us, "China's Vision of Victory" author.Coming up, small businesses fighting to stay afloat. I'll speak with the communications vice president of the world famous family owned restaurant Sylvia's on how the nearly 60-year-old restaurant is overcoming the coronavirus shutdown.Then, lights, camera, action. Filming resumes today for popular CBS soap opera "Bold and the Beautiful," but not without social distancing restrictions. Let's see how the drama is adapting to its -- to new love scenes. Wait till you hear this.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Restaurants reopening across the country, but not in New York City, where outdoor dining remains off limits. In Harlem, world famous family owned restaurant Sylvia's has been dishing out legendary soul food for nearly 60 years. The restaurant's namesake, Sylvia Woods, opened the doors back in 1962 and the restaurant has stayed open during the coronavirus pandemic for pick-up and delivery orders.Joining us right now is the vice president of communications for Sylvia's Restaurant and Sylvia's granddaughter, Tren'ness Woods-Black.Tren'ness, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.Are you ready to welcome customers back? Tell us how business has gone in the middle of all of this pandemic, even if it was just pick-up.TREN'NESS WOODS-BLACK, VICE PRESIDENT OF COMMUNICATIONS, SYLVIA'S RESTAURANTS: Listen, we are more than ready to welcome our customers back. We've been happy to see everyone support us with take-out and delivery. We even took it a step further by starting a Sunday food pantry, along with the National Action Network and the Care Organization to just be able to give back to this community that has loved on us for so hard and for so many years. So we're excited to do that. And we're happy when we're able to actually be able to touch our customers inside the dining room. But we know that's going to be some times -- some time away.BARTIROMO: A couple of months ago we did a -- we did a segment in the studio with you.WOODS-BLACK: Yes.BARTIROMO: And you brought all this food. I mean, it was beyond delicious. Have you -- have you changed the way you operate because of the pandemic? Have you had to lay anybody off? Have you had to change the menu, change the way you operate in terms of social distancing rules, et cetera?WOODS-BLACK: Absolutely. Absolutely. We have done all of the above. Some items we had to take off for a period of time because food, the price on food has gone up so, so much due to the pandemic. So a favorite at the restaurant are our smothered short ribs of beef. And we literally, you know, didn't feel comfortable passing that additional cost off to our guests.So we've had to do a lot of modifying. A lot of restaurants in the community weren't able to pivot to an online and delivery format. You know, we're still working it out, trying to figure out how do you translate that Sylvia's hospitality via take-out, you know, without you being in the restaurant.BARTIROMO: Yes.WOODS-BLACK: But I think a combination of making sure that the recipes are authentic and consistent, as well as having our food pantry that gives out Sylvia's food products, as well as packaged items from the Care Organization, definitely helps.BARTIROMO: Well, the pantry was a great idea and it's interesting because your audience, your clientele is so loyal to Sylvia's and you were just as loyal back to them by saying, we're not going to pass on these price increases to you. I love that loyalty there. But the foot traffic has to be an issue, right? You were getting a lot of foot traffic and that just feeds on itself.How big of an impact has the loss of foot traffic been, Tren'ness?WOODS-BLACK: Oh, my God, this time for us has been one like we've never seen. And the truth of the matter is, unfortunately, a lot of our business neighbors have closed due to the impact of not having that foot traffic.Prior to Covid, Sylvia's had 117 employees and we've had to lay off the majority, like others in our industry. And it's just been a heart-breaking, heart-wrenching time.BARTIROMO: Oh.WOODS-BLACK: We're operating just on take-out and delivery alone, abbreviated menu, very long hours. Our family and our staff family that are still with us are literally working around the clock just to make ends meet. We're open every day from 11:00 to 8:00 p.m. But not having our guests inside the restaurant has hit us deeply.BARTIROMO: Yes.WOODS-BLACK: You know, we're very fortunate because we do own our property.BARTIROMO: That's good.WOODS-BLACK: But those who have rent to pay, you know, it's virtually impossible.BARTIROMO: Sure. Unbelievable.WOODS-BLACK: Restaurants work on a very small margin, and there's already a lot of legislation that we had to deal with.BARTIROMO: Yes.WOODS-BLACK: And just last week Mayor de Blasio wanted us to, you know, look at loans that, you know, would increase payroll amount to like $20 an hour and things of that nature --BARTIROMO: Right.WOODS-BLACK: And we're like, wait a minute, do you not realize, like, we're in the middle of a pandemic.BARTIROMO: Yes.WOODS-BLACK: So, we're just thankful. We're working with City Meals on Wheels to do senior call --BARTIROMO: OK.WOODS-BLACK: Campaign so that you can virtually volunteer in our pantry.BARTIROMO: That's terrific. I love that. I love that. Tren-ness, thank you. I really look forward to the time that I can come back to your restaurant.WOODS-BLACK: Oh, Maria, thank you.BARTIROMO: And Tren'ness Woods-Black, good luck and -- absolutely. And we look forward to you -- we're rooting you on from afar, Tren'ness. We'll see you soon. Thank you so much.WOODS-BLACK: I appreciate it. Take care. Stay healthy.BARTIROMO: Please stay with us. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Time for the "Morning Buzz.""The Bold and the Beautiful" resuming production today. This popular CBS soap opera will begin filming in Los Angeles for the first time since March with Covid-19 protection measures in place.So, how do you do love scenes with the social distancing? Love scenes in some instances will feature the actual husbands and wives of the actors. Interesting -- interesting change there.Dagen, your reaction.MCDOWELL: It's one of the only, quote, soap operas that's still on the air. "Young and the Restless" and "Bold and the Beautiful." And I actually watched it when I was younger and still, more recently, with my mother. And I can name those characters. So it's just a very interesting take because you get -- need a little steam on your soap opera and that's how they're doing it.BARTIROMO: Well, I used to watch -- I grew up watching "All My Children," which was so good, with my sister. But, I mean, they're actually using your actual husband and wives when they have love scenes. I thought that was really -- really interesting.MCDOWELL: Yes.BARTIROMO: All right, Zoom exhaustion. Employees across the country are tiring of the video conferencing app, apparently. Some saying that it's been rough adapting to this new way of corporate communication according to "The Wall Street Journal."Alli, do you have Zoom fatigue?MCCARTNEY: I started with Zoom fatigue. My team has decided we are not using it anymore, staring at ones self while trying to make eye contact with a camera is getting old. I'm definitely with you.BARTIROMO: Well, I heard that Microsoft Teams is very good also. We -- I know we did a segment earlier about Zoom and the fact that the servers are in China.Governor Huckabee, your thoughts?HUCKABEE: Well, I think everybody's tired of all of the distancing and the Zoom and we're looking forward to being able to see people again.And I want to comment on a story, I know it's out there, and that is that there are a lot of focus on all of the people who are at odds with each other.BARTIROMO: Yes.HUCKABEE: There's some wonderful videos of people sharing love, compassion, and respect for each other. I think we need more of that.BARTIROMO: For sure.HUCKABEE: Aa lot more of it.BARTIROMO: I agree with you. One hundred percent.We'll be back with more of that.MORNINGS WITH MARIA continues.

Years of Chinese espionage led to closure of the Consulate: USCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 24, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 826 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration's decision to close the Chinese Consulate in Houston followed years of frustration over Beijing-led criminal and covert activity to steal trade secrets and conduct maliciously influential operations across the United States.While two Chinese citizens were convicted last year of trying to steal trade secrets in the U.S. energy capital, three administration officials who spoke to the press Friday noted that the total activity done through the Houston Consulate was the "tip of the iceberg" regarding concerns about China.As evidence of this problem: The FBI currently has about 2,000 active cases related to Chinese counter-espionage operations in the U.S., an official said in the video conference.But by presenting the closure of the Houston Consulate as a result of years of work, officials sought to separate their decision from the current tensions ranging from the coronavirus pandemic to Beijing's growing control over Hong Kong.Instead, the U.S. wants to send a broader signal that it will be less patient with Chinese initiatives to conduct espionage, particularly on economic and intellectual property issues. That change is partly because U.S. policy is increasingly run by hard-line officials within the Trump administration, such as Secretary of State Michael Pompeo."For the foreseeable future, the Chinese government's intellectual property theft and foreign-influenced efforts will be treated not only as individual criminal matters or disagreements over economic policy, but as national security and strategic issues," said Sumon Dantiki, former federal cybercrime officer and senior adviser to the FBI director.China rejected U.S. accusations that its consulate was a central pillar of espionage and retaliated on Friday by ordering the closure, within 72 hours, of the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu City, a key outpost for watching events in Tibet.The U.S. move followed weeks of increasing pressure on Beijing by Trump administration officials, culminating in a Speech by Pompeo on Thursday in which he called the Chinese Communist Party a "Frankenstein" threatening the free world.On Friday, the administration said the Chinese government used its consulate in Houston and other U.S. cities to conduct operatives to commit visa fraud while conducting espionage, pressure elected officials and business leaders to support favorable policies to Beijing, and conduct a program called "Operation Fox Hunt." The aim of this program has been to pressure dissidents to return to China, according to the three officials, who called for not to be identified.Another official described the U.S. measure as an attempt to sweep years of "broken glass" with respect to China's promises to stop its espionage activities in the U.S.Chinese activities directed from Houston were considered particularly aggressive and followed recent accusations that the Chinese government was trying to steal medical research from U.S. institutions to develop a coronavirus vaccine.The Houston Consulate was also being used to advance the Chinese Thousand Talents program, which was specifically designed to recruit Chinese citizens to the U.S. to rob companies, officials said."This is further proof that companies and research entities in a wide variety of sectors, including medical research and energy, thatthey deal with confidential data, intellectual property or innovative technology, now they are directly in the crosshairs of the economic espionage of sophisticated foreign governments," said Dantiki, who is now a partner at the law firm King &Spalding; in Washington.U.S. efforts to take strong action against economic espionage include at least two recent examples from the Houston metropolitan area. Chinese citizen Shan Shi was convicted in federal court last year for conspiracy to steal deep-sea trade secrets for the benefit of a Chinese-based company called CBM-Future New Material Science and Technology Co. Ltd.Hongjin Tan, a Chinese citizen who worked for a U.S. oil company, was arrested in late 2018 and charged with stealing trade secrets from his employer. He was sentenced to two years in federal prison earlier this year.On Friday, however, there were signs that tensions between the U.S. and China may have reached their highest, at least for now. The closure of the Chengdu diplomatic compound was not the most aggressive measure Chinese officials could have taken, as the U.S. also has consulates in cities such as Shanghai and Hong Kong.In addition, a U.S.-sought Chinese investigator who took refuge at the country's Consulate in San Francisco was arrested Friday. U.S. Police had been searching for Juan Tang, an investigator at the University of California, Davis, accused of lying about his military service in China. Officials refused to detail the circumstances of Tang's delivery to the police.Original Note:Years of Chinese Espionage Prompted Consulate Closing, U.S. Says©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: July 25, 2020End of Document

Barr lambastes Apple in China speechPolitico.comJuly 17, 2020 Friday 2:15 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 712 wordsHighlight: The attorney general also suggested that U.S. corporate leaders who advocate for pro-China policies at the Chinese government's behest could run afoul of lobbying laws.BodyAttorney General William Barr on Thursday criticized corporate America's relationship with the Chinese Communist Party - while singling out Apple once again as an example of a "double standard" in how tech companies treat the U.S. government versus Beijing.He also hinted at the possibility that American business leaders who advocate for the party's political interests at its behest could face prosecution under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a U.S. law that requires people to disclose lobbying for foreign governments. And he said American businesses take great risks when they do business in China. "The ultimate ambition of China's rulers isn't to trade with the United States; it is to raid the United States," he said in a speech in Michigan. "If you are an American business leader, appeasing the [People's Republic of China] may bring short-term rewards. But in the end, the PRC's goal is to replace you."Barr zeroed in on major American tech companies' relationships with the Chinese government. "Over the years, corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the CCP," he said. Then he focused on Apple - which relies heavily on manufacturing partners based in China - and criticized it for what he described as acquiescence to the Chinese Communists. Barr noted that the company removed privacy apps from its Apple store in China, yanked the Quartz news app after the Chinese government complained about its coverage of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, and announced it will move some iCloud data to servers located in China. Barr then paused, lowered his voice, and broke from his prepared remarks to bring up the Justice Department's recent success getting into the cell phone of a terrorist who shot eight people at a Pensacola naval base. Apple didn't assist DOJ's efforts to access the communications, he said, which revealed the shooter had been in touch with Al Qaeda operatives the day before the attack. Apple has long refused to give U.S. law enforcement "backdoor" access circumventing its devices' encryption, citing privacy concerns. "Do you think when Apple sells phones in China that Apple phones in China are impervious to penetration by Chinese authorities?" Barr continued. "They wouldn't be sold if they were impervious to Chinese authorities. What we've asked for is when we have a warrant from a court, that we should be able to get into those cell phones. That's the double standard that has been emerging among American tech companies." Barr has repeatedly invoked the Pensacola case - using it to lambaste the company during public appearances in January and May - but has yet to follow the Obama-era Justice Department's example of suing Apple in an attempt to force its cooperation in a terrorist probe. (That case ended inconclusively after the DOJ revealed that it had found another way to break into a deceased shooting suspect's iPhone.)Barr also hinted Thursday that the Chinese government has pushed American business leaders to support specific China-friendly candidates and policies. And he said such advocacy could be illegal. "You should be alert to how you might be used, and how your efforts on behalf of a foreign company or government could implicate the Foreign Agents Registration Act," he said. "FARA does not prohibit any speech or conduct. But it does require those who are acting as the 'agents' of foreign principals to publicly disclose that relationship and their political or other similar activities by registering with the Justice Department, allowing the audience to take into account the origin of the speech when evaluating its credibility."Barr's speech, delivered at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum in Grand Rapids, Mich., was the latest in a series of addresses on China from senior Trump administration officials. Barr said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will soon speak on the topic. And he seemed to relish likely pushback from Chinese officials. After FBI Director Chris Wray spoke on China last week, Barr said the director told him a CCP leader called his speech "particularly disgusting.""I told him I was going to aim today to be despicable," Barr said, to chuckles. "But I'll settle for especially disgusting."Load-Date: July 17, 2020End of Document

A virologist fled China and revealed how the regime hid information about the coronavirus: "Thousands of lives could have been saved"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 12, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 739 wordsBodyLi-Meng Yan's story didn't begin on April 28 last, when he was about to board his plane bound for the United States. Prior to that, the epidemiologist at Hong Kong University of Public Health had planned her escape, realizing she had to do her best to say what she knew about coronavirus to the world, and that she could not do so in her country.In a FOX News interview, Yan claimed that the Chinese government knew of the new coronavirus time before officially announcing about the wuhan outbreak. He also recounted how his superiors silenced his research on the subject whose findings, revealed in time, could have helped save lives.In addition, it stated that it was they who had an obligation to tell the world, given its status as a reference laboratory of the World Health Organization specializing in influenza viruses and pandemics, especially when the virus began to spread in the early days of 2020.Laboratory in Wuhan, China (Photo by JOHANNES EISELE / AFP) ((AFP)/)Exiled in the United States, Yan claimed that the government of the country where he was born is working to destroy his reputation and accused the authorities of launching a cyberattack against him, with the aim of silencing her."The reason I came to the United States is because I have to give the message of truth about COVID-19," he told FOX from where she remains hidden. He added that if he tried to tell his story in China he would have ended up "missing or murdered."Yan, who claims to be one of the first scientists in the world to study the new coronavirus, received a request in 2019 from his WHO supervisor and consultant, Dr Leo Poon, to conduct a secret research on SARS-like coronavirus that had emerged in China later that year.Epidemiologist Li-Men Yan"China's government refused to allow foreign experts, including those in Hong Kong, to investigate in China," he said. He added, "Then I turned to my friends for more information." Yan had an extensive network of professional contacts in several hospitals in mainland China, having grown and completed much of his studies there.A friend, a scientist at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in China, knew first-hand the cases and allegedly told Yan on December 31 about person-to-person transmission long before China or WHO admitted that such a spread was possible.On 9 January 2020, WHO issued a statement saying, among other things: "According to the Chinese authorities, the virus in question can cause serious illness in some patients and is not easily transmitted among people... There is limited information to determine the overall risk of this reported group."The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, at the press conference on COVID-19 - 9 March 2020 (WHO/)According to the FOX interview, Yan recounted that in the midst of these discussions between colleagues on the particular and new virus, he nevertheless noticed an abrupt change of tone among his colleagues. Those of the city of Wuhan, whowould later become the center of the outbreak, remain silent, and asked others not to look for more details."We can't talk about it, but we need to wear masks," recalls the scientist her medical colleagues asked.At that time, transmission of the virus was beginning to increase dangerously, and cases had already been reported outside China. In addition, Yan began to receive threats to stop investigating. After sharing the information with a Hong Kong blogger living in the United States, Li-Meng Yan decided to leave Hong Kong bound for Los Angeles on April 28 to not return.Li-Men Yan during the interview with FOX NewsDespite Yan's allegations, China maintains that its management of the pandemic was adequate, that the reaction was swift, and that many lives were saved. WHO also denies making mistakes at this time.Li-Meng Yan's accusations have caused the University of Hong Kong, where he worked, to have deleted his website and posted a statement informing him that he is no longer a member of the team. Despite all this, the scientist has assured that she will continue to report on the results of her research, which would prove to her that China did not tell the whole truth about COVID-19.MORE ON THIS TOPIC:China first disseminated images of Wuhan's mysterious laboratoryA new study proves that COVID-19 is air-transmittedUS issued travel alert to its citizens in China: "There is a high risk of arbitrary detention"Load-Date: July 13, 2020End of Document

They say vatican was hacked by China ahead of talks with BeijingCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 29, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1184 wordsBodyBy David E. Sanger, Edward Wong and Jason HorowitzWASHINGTON - Chinese hackers infiltrated the Vatican's computer networks in the past three months, in an apparent espionage effort before the start of delicate negotiations with Beijing.The attack was detected by Recorded Future, a company based in Somerville, Massachusetts. The Chinese Communist Party has been waging a broad campaign to strengthen its control over religious groups,in which government leaders have regularly referred to as an effort to"synize religions"in the country.China officially recognizes five religions, including Catholicism, but the authorities often suspect that religious groups and the faithful undermine control of the Communist Party and the state and threaten the country's national security.Chinese hackers and state authorities have often used cyberattacks to try to gather information about groups of Buddhist Tibetans, Muslim Uighurs and Falun Gong practitioners outside China.But this seems to be the first time that hackers, which Recorded Future's cybersecurity experts boast of working for the Chinese state, have been publicly caught hacking directly into the Vatican and the Holy See Study Mission in China, the Hong Kong-based group of de facto Vatican representatives who have played a role in negotiating the status of the Catholic Church.The Vatican and Beijing are expected to begin talks in September on the control of the appointment of bishops and the status of houses of worship as part of the renewal of an interim agreement signed in 2018 that reviews the terms of the Catholic Church's operations in China.The series of intrusions began in early May. An attack was concealed within a document that appeared to be a legitimate vatican letter to Monsignor Javier Corona Herrera, the chaplain who heads the study mission in Hong Kong, Recorded Future said in a report to be published on Wednesday.It was an ingenious hoax: an electronic archive that appeared to be in the official stationery of Archbishop Edgar Peña Parra. The letter carried a message from Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Vatican secretary of state, second in command of the Pope and an old driver of the Chinese agreement that has defended the deal. In his message, Parolin expressed the Pope's sadness at the death of a bishop.It is unclear whether the letter was fabricated or is a real document that the attackers obtained and then linked to malware that gave them access to the computers of The Hong Kong Church offices and Vatican mail servers. Recorded Future concluded that the attack was most likely related to negotiations on the extension of the 2018 agreement.In a recent interview with an Italian television show, Archbishop Claudio Maria Celli, one of the main negotiators of the agreement, said that with the interim agreement expiring in September, the Holy See "wants to continue this step, wants to move forward".Matteo Bruni, the Vatican spokesman, did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday night, and senior Vatican officials with experience in dealing with China refused to comment because they said they did not have enough information about the alleged hacking.The revelation comes at a time when the Trump administration is in an almost daily confrontation with China over the management of the coronavirus pandemic, the closure of missionsBeijing's campaign to reclaim vast swaths of the South China Sea and American efforts to limit Chinese technological advances in the United States and its allies, especially for the installation of state-of-the-art communications equipment.But there is no indication that the Trump administration has been involved in the report on the attacks on the Vatican.Recorded Future concluded that the attack was carried out by a state-sponsored group in China, which he called RedDelta. He said the tactics used by the group were similar to those of other state-sponsored hacking operations that had been identified in the past. But there were also new techniques and new computer codes, and identifying the true source of a hacking is difficult.The revelations will surely anger the Vatican as its relationship with the Chinese government has been enormously delicate,especially because of China's crackdown on Hong Kong. When the Vatican issued comments prepared on 5 July for Pope Francis' blessing in St. Peter's Square, it included a message to the people of Hong Kong, saying that the current confrontation "requires courage, humility, non-violence and respect for the dignity and rights of all. I hope that social and especially religious life will be expressed with full and true freedom, as envisaged by several international documents."But in the end, the Pope didn't utter those words when he spoke.Negotiations between the Vatican and Beijing would continue with the 2018 interim agreement. The agreement, the details of which are still largely unknown, aimed to lay the groundwork for a process by which the Pope and the Chinese authorities could agree on the bishops appointed at the head of China's official churches. As part of the agreement, Francis agreed to recognize the bishops who had been appointed by the Chinese government.At the time, both sides said it was a starting point for deeper talks, and the Vatican praised it as a rapprochement between the official churches of China and the Holy See. In China, churches of various Christian denominations, including Roman Catholicism, are those controlled by the Chinese government, which appoints or approves clerical leaders, or clandestine leaders. The clandestine Catholic Churches have been loyal to the Vatican, and are supervised by bishops appointed in secret by the Pope.It is said that 2018 allowed Beijing to nominate candidates for bishops for the official churches, but he gave the Pope the final say on the appointments. It was understood that this was the process that progressed after the Pope recognized the seven bishops appointed by Chinese officials. These bishops had been excommunicated by the Vatican.Critics of the agreement denounced the Vatican for dealing with authoritarian government and giving Beijing greater legitimacy, potentially allowing it more influence over religious life from China's 10 to 12 million Catholics. Some prominent American politicians, such as Senator Marco Rubio, R-Fla., have been among those proofing the Vatican to refrain from dealing with the Chinese Communist Party.Under the rule of Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, the party has narrowed its control over the religious and spiritual life of the nation as part of an impulse that Xi has led to increased party oversight in almost every aspect of society. Officials in southeastern China have imposed particularly harsh restrictions on the practice of Christianity. Between 2014 and 2016, the authorities of Zhejiang Province,where Xi was head of the party, they ordered the crossings of 1,200 to 1,700 churches to be torn down, according to officials and residents of the area.David E.

Employee At Ohio State University Charged For Hiding Ties With China While Accepting US GrantsThe Daily CallerJuly 9, 2020 Thursday 10:29 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: USLength: 591 wordsByline: Marlo Safi, Culture Reporter, marlo@dailycaller.comMarlo Safi is a 2018 graduate of the University of Pittsburgh. When she is not reporting on subjects like religion and culture, she is cooking or writing about cooking.Author ImageBodyLink to ImageA professor and researcher with ties to multiple American universities has been arrested for hiding ties with the Chinese government and using federal funding to carry out research and recruit talent for China, a Justice Department statement said.Song Guo Zheng, 57, was arrested in Anchorage May 22 while trying to board a flight to China. Zheng allegedly lied about his ties with China to his employers or the National Institutes of Health, and accepted taxpayer-funded grants, according to the statement.Zheng is listed as a former professor or researcher in the medical schools of multiple universities, including Penn State University and the Ohio State University. The Ohio State University confirmed to the Daily Caller that Zheng is an employee of the University and was put on unpaid leave as the university proceeds toward termination.“Ohio State has been and continues to assist federal law enforcement authorities in every way possible. We cannot comment further at this time due to the ongoing law enforcement investigation,” a representative said. Zheng was a participant of the 'Chinese Talent Program,' or the Thousand Talents Program, which has resulted in violations of U.S. law like espionage, theft or trade secrets, and grant fraud among many other scientists who've been involved in the program. (RELATED: Most Scientists Who Lost Jobs At National Institute Of Health Due To Probe Into Foreign Ties Worked For Chinese Government) A Harvard University professor charged with lying about his role in a Chinese talent recruitment program must post a US$1 million cash bond, a judge ruled Thursday. https://t.co/8Nquq036i4 #China #espionage #lawsuit - Jodi Xu Klein (@jodixu) January 30, 2020An affidavit filed with the complaint alleges that Zheng has been participating in the talent program since 2013 and used research conducted in the U.S. to benefit Beijing.“Yet again, we are faced with a professor at a U.S. University, who is a member of a Chinese Talent Plan, allegedly and deliberately failing to disclose his relationship with a Chinese university and receipt of funds from the Chinese Government in order to obtain millions of dollars in U.S. grant money designed to benefit the health and well-being of the people of the United States - not to be hijacked to supplement the research goals of the Chinese Communist Party,” said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers. The U.S Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio believes Zheng was preparing to flee the country after learning his employer was beginning a probe into whether he was complying with the rules in taxpayer-funded grants. At the time of his arrest, he was carrying multiple pieces of luggage with cell phones, laptops, several USB drives, silver bars, and expired Chinese passports for his family along with deeds for property in China. “The taxpayers of the United States are the real victims when researchers defraud our government and exploit our system to benefit China,” FBI Cincinnati Special Agent in Charge Chris Hoffman said in the statement. Zheng's arrest follows that of multiple other professors and researchers at American universities who hid their ties with the Chinese government.Among the most recent cases was that of former Emory University professor Dr. Xiao-Jiang Li, who was sentenced in May after pleading guilty to charges that included accepting at least $500,000 in Chinese government funding that he never reported on federal income tax returns while applying for NIH research grants.Graphic NEW ORLEANS, LA - MARCH 30: A general view of the Ohio State Buckeyes logo on the exterior of the Mercedes-Benz Superdome during practice prior to the 2012 Final Four of the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament on March 30, 2012 in New Orleans, Louisiana.

Amazon says email to employees banning TikTok was a mistakeAssociated Press State & LocalJuly 10, 2020 Friday 11:12 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWS; STATE AND REGIONALLength: 862 wordsByline: TALI ARBEL, AP Technology WriterBodyRoughly five hours after an internal email went out Friday to Amazon employees telling them to delete the popular video app TikTok from their phones, the online retailing giant appeared to backtrack, calling the ban a mistake.“This morning’s email to some of our employees was sent in error," Amazon emailed reporters just before 5 p.m. Eastern time. “There is no change to our policies right now with regard to TikTok.”Company spokeswoman Jaci Anderson declined to answer questions about what caused the confounding turnaround or error.The initial internal email, which was disseminated widely online, told employees to delete TikTok, a video app increasingly popular with young people but also the focus of intensifying national-security and geopolitical concerns because of its Chinese ownership. The email cited the app's “security risks.”An Amazon employee who confirmed receipt of the initial email but was not authorized to speak publicly had not seen a retraction at the time of Amazon's backtrack.Amazon is the second-largest U.S. private employer after Walmart. Moving against TikTok could have escalated pressure on the app in a big way, particularly if other companies did the same. The U.S. military already bans TikTok on employee phones and the company is subject to a national-security review of its merger history.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this week that the government was “certainly looking” at banning the app, setting off confused and irritated posts as well as jokes by TikTok users.Chinese internet company ByteDance owns TikTok, which is designed for users outside of China; it also makes a Chinese version called Douyin. Like YouTube, TikTok relies on its users for the videos that populate its app. It has a reputation for fun, goofy videos and is popular with young people, including millions of Americans.But critics have cited concerns, including the possibility of TikTok censoring videos, such as those critical of the Chinese government, sharing user data with Chinese officials, and violating kids’ privacy. TikTok has said it doesn’t censor videos based on topics sensitive to China and it would not give the Chinese government access to U.S. user data even if asked.TikTok said earlier in the day that Amazon did not notify it before sending the initial email around midday Eastern time Friday. That email read, “The TikTok app is no longer permitted on mobile devices that access Amazon email." To retain mobile access to company email, employees had to delete the TikTok app by the end of the day.“We still do not understand their concerns,” TikTok said at the time, adding that the company would welcome a dialogue to address Amazon’s issues. A TikTok spokeswoman declined to comment further Friday evening.TikTok has been trying to appease critics in the U.S. and distance itself from its Chinese roots, but finds itself caught in an increasingly sticky geopolitical web.It recently named a new CEO, former Disney executive Kevin Mayer, a move experts said could help it navigate U.S. regulators. And it is stopping operations in Hong Kong because of a new Chinese national security law that led Facebook, Google and Twitter to also stop providing user data to Hong Kong authorities.Pompeo said the U.S. government remains concerned about TikTok and referred to the administration's crackdown on Chinese telecom firms Huawei and ZTE. Washington has tried to convince allies to root Huawei out of telecom networks with mixed success. President Donald Trump has also said he is willing to use Huawei as a bargaining chip in trade talks. Huawei has denied that it enables spying by the Chinese government.A U.S. national-security agency has been reviewing ByteDance’s purchase of TikTok’s precursor, Musical.ly. Meanwhile, privacy groups say TikTok has been violating children’s privacy, even after the Federal Trade Commission fined the company in 2019 for collecting personal information from children without their parents’ consent. Concerns aren't limited to the U.S. India this month banned dozens of Chinese apps, including TikTok, citing privacy concerns, amid tensions between the countries.Amazon may have been concerned about a Chinese-owned app’s access to employee data because the U.S. government says China regularly steals U.S. intellectual property, said Susan Ariel Aaronson, a professor at George Washington University and a data governance and national-security expert.Part of Amazon’s motivation with the ban, now apparently reversed, may also have been political, Aaronson said, since Amazon “doesn’t want to alienate the Trump administration.”Seattle-based Amazon and its founder, Jeff Bezos, are frequent targets of Trump. Bezos personally owns The Washington Post, which Trump has called “fake news." Last year, Amazon sued the U.S. government, saying that Trump’s “personal vendetta” against Amazon, Bezos and the Post led it to lose a $10 billion cloud computing contract with the Pentagon to rival Microsoft. Meanwhile, federal regulators as well as Congress are pursuing antitrust investigations at Amazon as well as other tech giants.__AP Business Writer Joseph Pisani contributed to this report.Load-Date: July 10, 2020End of Document

Happy Monday, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Monday, June 29th. Your top stories right now at 6 a.m. on the button on East Coast. Coronavirus deaths surpassing half a million across the world. This as cases spike in an alarming rate in the United States hot zones; multiple states pausing or rolling back reopening plans now.Futures are pointing to a higher opening this morning on this, beginning of a shortened trading week from Wall Street. Dow Futures up 140 points, and the NASDAQ is negative but just about three points, but the S&P 500 right now up 11.25 points. This after Friday's sharp selloff wiping out NASDAQ gains for the week. The Dow, the S&P 500 also down on the week. As you can see, it was a week that saw the Dow down 3 percent, as was the NASDAQ, and the S&P 500 down almost 3 percent.Facebook ad boycotts, the list of major companies pulling advertising dollars from the social media giant is growing, costing the company billions. The stock is under pressure this morning, as you can see, down about 2.25 percent right now.Boeing takes flight tests of the 737 Max begin this week. The stock is up on the news this morning in the premarket, up close to 4 percent. And the Federal Reserve shopping list, the Central Bank releasing names of companies that it is purchasing corporate bonds from, including automakers, telecommunications companies, even beverage giant Coca-Cola.Plus, China takes more steps to clamp down on Hong Kong's freedoms, and Beijing says it will impose visa restrictions on Americans with what they call egregious conduct on Hong Kong related issues."Mornings with Maria" is live right now.Global markets this morning look like this. European indices slightly higher this morning, with the FT 100 up a third of a percent; the CAC quarante (ph) in Paris up about 16 points, also a third of a percent; and the DAX Index in Germany higher by 84 points, that is two-thirds of 1 percent.In Asia overnight, it was right across the board as the coronavirus cases surpassed 10 million cases now worldwide. Worst performer overnight was Japan. The Nikkei averaged down two-and-a-third percent, as you can see.Now, some of the top stories that we are watching this morning. The number of global coronavirus cases surpassing the 10 million mark with the number of deaths topping 500,000. The U.S. is the worst affected country with more than 2.5 million cases and more than 125,000 deaths.Several states hitting records for new daily coronavirus cases. Meanwhile, as of yesterday, Florida reporting over 8,000 cases, Texas surpassing 5,000, and Arizona nearly reaching 4,000 cases there. At least 17 states nationwide are either pausing or reversing their reopening plans as of yesterday.In California, Governor Gavin Newsom is ordering bars to close in seven counties, including Los Angeles. Bars, breweries and pubs that serve food also asked to enforce stricter dine-in rules or to do just takeout or patio services.The four former Minneapolis police officers charged in George Floyd's death are due back in court today. All are expected to appear at the same hearing and could all enter pleas today. Minneapolis police also announcing new rules for body camera video. Officers will no longer be allowed to view the video before finishing a police report. The change coming days after the city council voted to dismantle its police force.President Trump meanwhile pushing back on a "New York Times" report, which focuses on Russia offering bounties to Taliban fighters to kill American troops in Afghanistan. The President tweeted this. "Intel just reported to me that they did not find this info credible and therefore did not report it to me or the Vice President. Possibly another fabricated Russia hoax, maybe by the fake news "New York Times," wanting to make Republicans look bad," writes the President."The New York Times" reporting that the President and National Security Council discussed the Russian bounties in late-March. Congress is demanding more information. The Trump administration is set to brief select members of Congress on the report later today.Meanwhile Boeing reportedly set to begin critical test flights for the 737 Max jet that's happening as soon as today, the FAA approving the flights as Boeing looks to return the 737 to service later this year. The jet will be put through a series of extreme maneuvers over Washington State. Pilots will also test changes to the software blamed for two deadly crashes that grounded the 737 in March of last year. Ahead of the opening bell, Boeing shares this morning are up 3.5 percent.Let's take a look at markets this morning. Futures edging higher ahead of the open. Coronavirus cases surging in certain states, fueling concerns about economic reopening and the recovery. Friday selloff, of course, wiping out NASDAQ's gains for the week. The Dow, the S&P 500 also down for the week. And of course, this is the kickoff to the end of the quarter. The quarter ends on Tuesday.Joining me right now is Federated Hermes Senior Equity Strategist, Linda Duessel. Also during the conversation this morning is pollster and the President of Maslansky & Partners, Lee Carter; PWC Partner, Mitch Roschelle; and RealClearPolitics White House Reporter, Philip Wegmann.Great to see you, everybody, this morning. Thank you so much for being here.And Linda, let me kick it off with you. First off, we are here approaching the end of the quarter. Are you expecting any window dressing, any end-of- quarter moves that could lead the direction of this market right here?LINDA DUESSEL, FEDERATED HERMES SENIOR EQUITY STRATEGIST: Yes, I think so. I think that we end the quarter and a little bit more nervous about what the future holds. And a lot of people have been piling into the cyclicals in these last several months, they've had a fantastic run. I think some money would be taken off the table, and we at Federated Hermes have done the same actually.BARTIROMO: And July 4th right here around the corner next weekend. Here we are at the half point of the year. What do you expect in the second half?DUESSEL: Well, the summertime is historically is a grind. It's historically a time when you give back. Give and take June has been just a range of S&P, 3,000 to 3,200. We went way ahead of probably what we should for the year. And so, to expect a pullback to 3,000 looks like some excellent support here for a while. But most people expect a pullback. Consensus expects 10 percent pullback. Maybe S&P 2,900.If consensus expects that, and maybe we don't get that much off, I would think that we should have some sort of pullback that would be a very nice viable one, and we should move into the end of the year just with more and more certainty about this virus and what it means, and just lots of evidence that there really is stimulus behind all the Fed to (inaudible) and another stimulus coming from our government very difficult to be a barren here.BARTIROMO: Yes. And Mitch Roschelle, before we get to that, we've got the June employment report coming out this week on Thursday morning. The economy expected to add 3 million jobs, up from May's gain of 2.5 million. You've also got some key earnings due out, like Macy's. So, Mitch, tell me about the week that we're in here because there's a lot of economic data. And we're expecting an increase in jobs.MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER: And I think I - you also have on Tuesday Powell and Mnuchin before the House Financial Services Committee. And I think, to Linda's point, there is a lot of focus on stimulus that will continue to come from the Fed and perhaps fiscal stimulus that could come from Congress. So I think all ears are going to be on that.And I want to dig deeper on to that with Linda. What is the market looking for in terms of potential another round of stimulus coming from the administration and from Congress? And what, if anything, is baked into the market in terms of an expectation there?DUESSEL: Well, the consensus is in and around $1 trillion. And I think some are pushing for $1.5 trillion. I don't think that the market is expecting that there'll be a big infrastructure plan, more money being just pushed - just direct fiscal stimulus directly out to again the small businesses and individuals to continue what looks like it would be a July 31st money just leaving.And I mean, the bad news is there's still 20 million people unemployed. And I really do hope we get a good employment number. That's the real, I think, the beg linchpin here. So that sort of support - lots of discussion that there won't be targeted support for various industries. And I think in and around a trillion dollars, you should get bipartisan support for this even though it's an election year. I think that the market looks--BARTIROMO: So, Linda, that's sort of the - that's sort of the question mark right now because you've got now more states either pausing or stopping their reopening. And that's putting in question what this recession looks like and the recovery. White House Trade Adviser Peter Navarro weighed in on the economy with me yesterday on "Sunday Morning Futures." Here's what he said about a rebound.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Larry Kudlow was with me last week on "Mornings with Maria" on Fox News. And he said 20 percent growth in the third quarter, 20 percent growth in the fourth quarter. Is that possible?PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE TRADE ADVISER: First of all, we are going to have a strong rebound from the depths of the China virus depression. But it's also true that we are going to face many years of working our way through these structural adjustments that are going to happen in our urban areas as well as in key sectors like hospitality, entertainment, sports, and education.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Linda, are you in the V camp in terms of a pretty good snapback for this economy? And which industries would you be allocating capital to in the second half of the year?DUESSEL: Well, we've been in the - I guess, the swoosh type of a recovery, but wondering more and more if it is going to be a V-shaped recovery. And I mean, going to what Navarro has said, it's really unfortunate to small businesses. It's just - we're having here in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where we're headquartered, where they're slowing down and they're telling the bars and restaurants, you know, you have to keep your mask on until the minute that your food comes to the table. It's like a death mail to so very many of the restaurants.But the bigger picture for the economy and - and I think what is really interesting is that the average wage of the social distance people have lost their jobs is just $35,000. This hurts the lowest income cohort, which is where we really need to keep the stimulus going.We really need to try to get those jobs back for the economy as a whole, though, has shown that it's been doing much better remotely - working remotely than many, many would have thought, and in terms of an industry and a sector that really, really needs to get involved in this, and that people have been very negative about. It would be the financial sector. It's such a big piece of the marketplace.And if we're really going to grow out of this range, we need financials to come in, we need the market to believe in them. That's the one where we think, as a value group, it's probably one of the best in terms of secular worries for creative destruction and a good place to potentially look to put money if you're bullish.BARTIROMO: All right. Well, we'll leave it there. We just heard from the Fed on banks, of course, that the - no - I guess there's some limitations in the third quarter in terms of buybacks, no buybacks, and dividends. Limitations there. But certainly the stocks are trading actively.Linda, it's good to see you this morning. Thank you so much. Linda Duessel.DUESSEL: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Joining us this morning with a market that has taken up speed, picked up speed, is up 101 points right now on the Dow Industrials. We'll slip into break. We are just getting started this morning.Coming up, North Carolina Republican Congressional candidate Madison Cawthorn on his landmark campaign. Don't miss that. That's coming up.And then in the 7 a.m. hour, our new segment, the "Word On Wall Street". I'll be joined by Cornerstone Macro's Nancy Lazar; Washington Crossing Advisors' Kevin Caron; and Belpointe Chief Strategist, David Nelson. We'll all discuss top market news to look out for this week. That's coming up.And then looking sharp online, one company looks to tell your suits using artificial intelligence. Don't miss a moment of it. Quick break. We'll be right back.Coming up. Author Gordon Chang is here to talk about China's response to the global pandemic. Next hour, my interview with the Milken Institute Chairman, Michael Milken, on the pandemic's impact on the future of healthcare. So all coming up right here.Plus, Walmart's new bonus for frontline workers. We have to take a look. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Unrest in Hong Kong. The Chinese government announcing that it will now impose visa restrictions on all U.S. individuals who are involved in the Hong Kong situation. This is days after the U.S. imposed sanctions on Chinese officials accused of curbing freedoms in Hong Kong. The move coming as the Chinese government is examining a national security law that would tighten its control over the region. That is the Chinese Communist Party getting more aggressive.On "Sunday Morning Futures," I spoke with Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton about this and China's aggression, how the coronavirus is being used by the CCP as a tool to gain more ground.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: China, you have said and others have said, is using this COVID pandemic as an opportunity to gain more ground. Can you tell me about it?SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AK): The Chinese Communist Party is certainly using the pandemic to try to assert claims and take very aggressive action against almost all of its neighbors. Just go around the horn. You start it in India, where high up in the Himalayas, China has essentially invaded India.And then in Hong Kong, they've passed legislation that violates their international commitments, their commitments to the people of Hong Kong that is essentially going to turn Hong Kong into the same kind of police state the Mainland China is.And in the South China Sea, they've taken aggressive action against our partners, countries like the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam. They've repeatedly invaded the airspace, in recent weeks, of Taiwan. And just this past week, they've taken aggressive action against Japan in the East China Sea. China is becoming more aggressive than ever.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now, the author of "The Coming Collapse of China" and "The Great U.S.-China Tech War", Author Gordon Chang.Gordon, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks so much for joining us. We were showing those pictures before Senator Cotton. And what we saw was the militarizing of the border of China and India. So, yes, they seem to have used this pandemic as an opportunity to gain more ground while the rest of the world was dealing with the pandemic.GORDON CHANG, "THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA" AUTHOR & "THE GREAT U.S.-CHINA TECH WAR" AUTHOR: Yes. Well, first of all, in the initial stages of the epidemic, they then started this mass diplomacy to try to get goodwill. But that's changed into, what others call now, wolf-warrior diplomacy, which means that along China's southern and eastern borders, we've seen a number of disturbing and aggressive acts, including, as Senator Cotton said, the incursions below the line of actual control, the killing of 20 Indian soldiers on June 15th, and all of those boat-bumping and other incidents in the South China Sea, East China Sea, increased tempo of dangerous intercepts of the U.S. Navy and the global commons, this is becoming really worrisome, as China lashes out against almost everybody.BARTIROMO: Gordon, what are you expecting this week? We've got an anniversary coming up in terms of the anniversary of the handover on Wednesday. Do you think that's going to create more unrest?CHANG: Well, China has - the Hong Kong authorities at China's direction has denied a permit for what has become an annual tradition, the July 1 march by people in Hong Kong. Many people expect that by July 1, China is going to pass the national security law for Hong Kong, bypassing the Hong Kong legislature. This is going to be draconian.As Senator Cotton said, this is essentially the imposition of totalitarian police controls on Hong Kong, making it really no different than the mainland in many respects. So we've got to be concerned. Because people in Hong Kong right now don't want this. We have seen like Jimmy Lai, Martin Lee, Joshua Wong protest. And we should be giving refuge and asylum to people in Hong Kong.BARTIROMO: Yes. That's pretty incredible that this upcoming anniversary on Wednesday, July 1, we're going to get a new law before we actually see the anniversary, overnight. So - then there is the Uyghur population.The Chinese Communist government has taken extreme measures to control the birth rate of the Uyghur Muslims. A new investigation from "The Associated Press" shows widespread efforts, including pregnancy checks, sterilization, abortions on hundreds of thousands of women. Some China experts even calling this demographic genocide, Gordon.What's your take? We know that a million Uyghurs are currently locked up because they are Muslims or Tibetan and they want to study their own religion, but the CCP won't allow them to. Now this?CHANG: Yes. This is forced birth control, forced sterilization, forced abortions. In many cases, the sterilization is accomplished through torture. This is horrific. And this, indeed, does meet the definition of genocide.Now, this is, of course, in addition to those internment camps, which really are concentration camps. You've got at least 1.3 million Uyghurs and Kazakhs and other minorities there. This is worse than what the third right did prior to the mass exterminations. And I don't understand how we can have normal relations with a country like this.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, AG Barr compared Xi Jinping and what's going on in China to Nazi Germany. You're right.Gordon, it's good to see you this morning. Thank you so much, sir. We'll keep watching, obviously--CHANG: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: --a very important fundamental story for the world.We'll take a break. When we come back, the "bucks" stops here. "Starbucks" adding its name to the growing list of companies boycotting Facebook, the fallout, coming up. Then the new way NBA players to make a statement. It is making buzz this morning, and we've got it. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The economic impact of the 2020 election, the stock market has been under pressure, under - recently. But under President Trump, it has been, of course, green across the board. Some investors worried that a blue wave at the ballot box will reverse economic gains. I spoke with Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton yesterday on "Sunday Morning Futures," and he warned of the economic fallout of a Joe Biden victory in November. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: I've got this Cowen & Company report here. And Cowen & Company tells its clients that if Biden were to win, Elizabeth Warren will be the key voice on economic policy.COTTON: Joe Biden doesn't really have much of an agenda. Joe Biden is hiding on in his basement. He has been a weather vane for the Democratic Party fads and fashions for the last 50 years. That's why it was always soft on communism, the Soviet Union. That's why he always voted to outsource our jobs to China. Why, he still, to this day, so that China is not one of our competitors.But that means when he gets in office, he is simply going to be a vessel for the radical left of the Democratic Party. Whether it's Elizabeth Warren's economic policies or the mobs that we see in the streets tearing down statues in an instance of mob violence or passing a D.C. statehood bill.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Lee Carter, all of those things happening now in terms of that D.C. statehood. The House wants that to happen - the Democrats in the House, anyway. I've got that town report here, Lee. And what's your take on this in terms of what a Biden administration would look like? We look at all of the polls, Lee, and Donald Trump is trailing Joe Biden.LEE CARTER, POLLSTER & MASLANSKY + PARTNERS PRESIDENT: Yes. I think the polls right now are not looking good for the President. But I think it's really capturing sentiment overall. What's happening right now with the economy, with COVID, with racial tensions, the police, everything right now is making Americans feel very, very nervous.Now, so what I think we're seeing is more of American sentiment. And the same thing applies to a generic rule as it does to Biden versus Trump. So there really isn't anything right now that is specific to Joe Biden that's making him win. He is quiet. We don't know what his policies are going to be. We don't know who his running mate is going to be. We don't know if he's going to go to the far left or not at this moment.If he does go too far to the left, I think it's actually going to hurt him in the polls because the way the polls are swinging right now is really in the independent vote. The independent vote is losing enthusiasm for the President. Republican vote is staying strong. And a Democrat vote never with the President to begin with. So I think we're going to see a big shift as we see what Biden is really going to be running on. We don't know yet.BARTIROMO: Well, Philip Wegmann, we don't know yet because he hasn't communicated a strategy, but we know what Elizabeth Warren wants to do, and she's supposed to be the key voice on economic policy. She's talked about a wealth tax. She's talked about higher marginal rates - tax rates. She's talked about breaking up companies, the banks and technology as well.PHILIP WEGMANN, REALCLEARPOLITICS WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: And to shore up his left link, Joe Biden brought in Elizabeth Warren and others, adopted those economic policies. I expect, as we get closer and closer to November, Trump is going to zero in on them.You'd remember, his argument at the beginning of this year was the economy is doing well, you have no choice, you try to paint it as a binary decision. And with Elizabeth Warren and (inaudible) Joe Biden, the argument from Trump is going to be we can rebuild or we can get much, much worse by going down this progressive threat.BARTIROMO: Right.All right. We'll take a break. When we come back, the "Word On Wall Street," our new segment, debuting this morning, where we take a look at the top stories affecting your money and markets.Plus, North Carolina Republican Congressional candidate Madison Cawthorn is here talking about his groundbreaking campaign, what he hopes to bring to the House. That's coming up. Stay with us.MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, June 29th.Let's take at markets this morning, it is 6:31 A.M. on the East Coast, we are looking at the mostly higher open for Wall Street this morning despite the surge in coronavirus cases, the Dow Industrials are now up 87 points, the S&P 500 is up 4.75. The NASDAQ is negative, it is down about 24 points right now. This after Friday selloff wiped out any gains for the NASDAQ for the week, the Dow and the S&P 500 also lower on the week to the tune of about 3 percent decline on the week across the board.This, of course, is the end of the quarter. This week, global markets right now are slightly higher. Take a look at European Indices, where we see money moving into stocks there, the FT 100 is up 20 points, the CAC crunches up 5 and the DAX Index is higher by 46.In Asia overnight, it was red across the board. The coronavirus cases have surpassed ten million worldwide, ten million. The major indices in Asia down about 2 percent, Nikkei averaged down two and third percent.Well a protester now charged with murder in a deadly shooting in Louisville in a demonstration. Cheryl Casone, with the details now. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR: That's right, Maria. And good morning. The Kentucky man is accused of firing into a crowd that were gathered to protest the death of Breonna Taylor. Police say Steven Lopez shot and killed a 27-year-old photographer during Saturday night demonstration. Bystanders shot back at Lopez striking him in the leg. He was taken to the hospital and arrested. Lopez is not facing multiple charges, including murder.Well, a pioneer in fracking industry has filed for bankruptcy. Chesapeake Energy, the largest U.S. oil and gas company to seek bankruptcy protection during the COVID-19 pandemic, has about $7 billion in debt right now. The company was also hit with sharply lower oil and gas prices following the coronavirus outbreak and a price war between the Russians and Saudis.Take and look at the stock in the pre-market up about a quarter percent. And it has plunged more than 90 percent though for the year.Well, the global entry program will reopen enrolment centers starting next week. Those offices have been closed since the mid-March due to the pandemic. New security measures will be in place, including face masks for applicants and workers, reduced seating in waiting areas and plexiglass barriers at the service counters.However, New York residents still aren't eligible. The Department of Homeland Security ban New Yorkers from the program back in February over the state's green light law. That allows illegal immigrants to apply for driver's licenses.And, by the way, here's a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com, Starbucks is pausing all ads on social media because the company says more must be done to create welcoming and inclusive online communities. The decision that part of the official Stop Hate For Profit boycott, we should add.Hourly Walmart employees in U.S. received another coronavirus bonus of $300 for fulltime employees and a $150 for part-time, and temporary employees amid the pandemic.And just in time for summer, Chick-Fil-A is introducing its new mango passion tea lemonade, and they are bringing back their peach milk shake. All of that, Maria, starts today as temperatures heat up across country. And those are your headlines from here. Back to you.BARTIROMO: That sounds good, Cheryl, thank you so much.Meanwhile this, not even close, a stunning political upset in North Carolina. 24-year-old newcomer Madison Cawthorn defeating President Trump's pick in the Republican primary runoff for the congressional seat vacated by the White House Chief of Staff, former Congressman Mark Meadows.Cawthorn, winning by more than 30 percent against Lynda Bennett, who had a clear fundraising edge and plenty of high profile endorsements with her as well.Joining us right now from North Carolina is North Carolina Republican Congressional Candidate, Madison Cawthorn. Madison, great to have you this morning. Congratulations on your victory.MADISON CAWTHORN (R) NORTH CAROLINA CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: Good morning, Maria, thank you so much. You know what, our victory is very sweet but we're looking forward to the next battle in November.BARTIROMO: Were you surprised you had all of these endorsement on the other side? You, obviously -- you'll be 25, the actual age needed in August, right? Were you surprised that you won so much?CAWTHORN: We will be having a constitutionally and eligible birthday party come August, I'm very sure. But, you know, we knew that we were going to win we had a very -- we have a grassroots campaign. So we have a finger on the pulse of the district. And so, you know, we kept this whole campaign local. We didn't care about big name endorsement or being shackled into any kind of PAC money. All we were worried about was the people in Western North Carolina. But we didn't know we were going to win by that much, so it was a welcome surprise.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, the reason that I bring up your age is you're going to be turning 25 right before the election, and that is the minimum age to serving Congress. Have -- do you feel that you've resonated with young people? And give us your message to those critics who say you're too young to work in Washington along sides some of these others who have been there decades.CAWTHORN: Well, you know what, first of all, I'm not sure that people being there decades is actually a good thing for our country. I mean, Nancy Pelosi has been in office for longer that I've been alive. But then when we also start to think about, you know, if I'm too young to be able to serve, and at the signing of declaration of independence, James Madison was 25 years old, Alexander Hamilton was 21 years old and both of those men went on to really craft what our country was going to become.And so, I don't believe it's unheard of for somebody to step up in uncertain times because, you know, I don't really think there's any time to wait, Maria. Our country is in dire times. And if it doesn't have somebody come out to help and someone to lead a patriot revolution of this young -- younger generation, then I feel like we're going to have a generational team bomb go off in the Republican Party.BARTIROMO: That's terrific. So I understand President Trump called you after your victory. What did he say to you? Tell us how your conversation went with the president.CAWTHORN: He did. So I was in the car with my fiance driving back from the victory party, and my phone is connected to Bluetooth. But then his -- after we go to the switchboard operator on Air Force One, his signature voice comes blaring over all of the speakers. So it was really, really fun and memorable moment.But, you know, he gave me -- he really congratulated me, defined it as beautiful. I'm really looking forward to getting to work with him. He invited me up to Oval Office here in a couple of week. So I'm looking forward to being his biggest supporter.And I really wanted to stress to admit, by no means do I think --BARTIROMO: SoCAWTHORN: Ma'am, go ahead, Maria.BARTIROMO: No. No. Please continue.CAWTHORN: I wanted to stress to the president that I, by no means, believe that my victory was a referendum on his influence in his district because I will stress that over 99 percent of my voters will be voting for President Trump.BARTIROMO: So let me ask you, Madison, what do you want to do now? I mean, your leadership will be important during the very vulnerable time for our country. We've got, you know, infrastructure being destroyed, statues coming down, looting continuing, some peaceful protesters but some not so peaceful as well. What is going to be the strategy? What would you like say to President Trump at this point to bring back law and order in this country?CAWTHORN: Well, number one, is for -- I think we need to leave Seattle completely alone. I think there's no better picture of how -- what the radical left really wants and what's going on in this autonomous zone that they set up and just absolute lawlessness and anarchy. I believe the far fringe left is calling for this whole defund the police movement. Because what they want to do is create anarchy so the American people cry out for a savior. And then they can create a federalized policing force that can be all over the country, which is just another step closer, tyranny.And so my message to President Trump is to continue to bring a message to young people of freedom and of personal responsibility and conservatism.BARTIROMO: And you yourself are a small businessman, right? You are the Owner and the CEO of a real estate investment company. Do you worry that the economy is going to have a tough time getting out of this shut down? What's your take on getting us through this?CAWTHORN: I do believe that we are -- the economy is going to have a hard time getting out of this. I think at this point, it's starting to become politically motivated. You know, very few people I think had a problem with shutting the doors to their businesses, you know, that first few weeks, because we just wanted to help our fellow Americans.But now that we're seeing -- as we are seeing cases continue to rise and I think that's primarily because of all of these protest and riots we've been seeing, which it's just makes sense that we'll see cases go up, we are seeing the death rate go down thankfully. And so not to mitigate the human suffering that we're feeling but I believe we can now, at this point, if not, binary choice. We can have a structured reopening of our economy while still protecting American lives.BARTIROMO: And, Madison, real quick before you go, I know you were nominated to the U.S. Naval Academy, but, of course, your plans were derailed after that tragic automobile accident you had. Has that changed you in a big way, Madison?CAWTHORN: It absolutely has. You know, I had everything ripped away from me just while I was taking a nap in the passenger seat of a vehicle and then ran into concrete wall. But, you know, coming within an inch of death, it really teaches you who you are deep down. And I think it really instill a level of grit and perseverance that have been hard for me to get otherwise. But I think what it most importantly taught me was empathy, how to recognize people who are hurting.BARTIROMO: And partially paralyzed in a wheelchair, you were showing incredible leadership, Madison, we'll be watching. Thanks so much. We appreciate you joining me this morning.CAWTHORN: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: Madison Cawthorn joining us there. We will be watching you come November.Coming up, Michael Milken, will join me next, to talk about the pandemic's impact and the future of the healthcare. Wait until you what the chairman of Milken Institute have to say about that.Then turning around the jobs market, how more job seekers are looking outside their chosen field. It's all coming up rights after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.We continue our focus on the next jobs in America, the labor market looking at Americas turbulent reopening with great anticipation. The pandemic turning the job market upside down, forcing many to look to industries for jobs other than what they were doing before.Joining me right now is Glassdoor Chief Economist Andrew Chamberlain. And, Andrew, it's great to have you this morning. What do you see as the next jobs? What jobs are you seeing in the most demand right now?ANDREW CHAMBERLAIN, GLASSDOOR, CHIEF ECONOMIST: Well, during this unusual time, the jobs that are attracting the most attention are jobs that help people navigate everyday life during a pandemic. Anything that can be done working from home seems to be in demand most. So these include things to our manager with no one eating out, everyone buying from homes, that's obviously booming. Anything related to E-commerce and warehouse worker, these are jobs like order selector, folks in warehouses who box things up and get them into your house, those jobs are way up on Glassdoor. And also a public health adviser, as big companies try to figure out how to navigate a pandemic and I.T. specialists.These are people just figuring out how to make sure Americans can work from home, have good broad band and keep doing their jobs.BARTIROMO: Mitch Roschelle?MITCH ROSCHELLE, FOX BUSINESS PANEL MEMBER: Andrew, some of those jobs may require skills that the individuals don't have from their previous jobs. So what if anything can be done to sort of rescale our workforce and what suggestions do you have for people who are looking for job who need to pick up some new skills quickly?CHAMBERLAIN: Well, one thing that helps see how skills will play into this is when you look at restaurant servers. These were some of the workers most impacted by the pandemic as their jobs disappeared overnight. And what they were doing for jobs on Glassdoor today, they're putting into jobs that required similar kinds of skills but (INAUDIBLE) impacted by the pandemic and shutdowns.So these were jobs, some delivery driver roles, things that really easy to scale up and get into. I don't think people are going to be making dramatic occupational changes. It takes a long time to (INAUDIBLE) and moving something you've never been moved into before. But what is really important is that, throughout a (INAUDIBLE) hardly ever change jobs in occupations and when they do, they usually don't go back to their old jobs.So what this means is, there might be a whole generation of restaurant workers and other frontline retail clerks in non-essential businesses that might never be going back to those jobs.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Andrew, it's great to have you this morning, thanks very much for your insights. Andrew Chamberlain, joining us on next jobs in America.CHAMBERLAIN: Thank you.BARTIROMO: A quick break and then word on Wall Street. Our new segment this morning debuts where we're taking a look at the top stories affecting markets and your money.Plus, the real golden years, meet the world's oldest golden retriever who is making a buzz this morning. Wait until you see it. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Time for the morning buzz. First up, boycotting social media. Starbucks halting advertising on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram over hate speech concerns on the platform. While the coffee company is not affiliated with the Stop Hate For Profit initiative, other major companies have also join this global boycott, including Unilever, Verizon and Coca-Cola.Lee Carter, will this convince social media to change the censorship practices or not?LEE CARTER, POLLSTER AND MASLANSKY PARTNERS PRESIDENT: You know I'm not sure. I mean pressure is really on. We have over 180 companies have joined in on this boycott. And so it's a real big challenge, because this isn't just asking them to change a few practices. They're changing their business model fundamentally.But the theory behind most social media companies is that they're not meant to be editorial, that the content is owned by the people who are posting it. They're not meant to be arbiter's content. It's going to be completely change the business model, it's going to change the regulation, it's been change everything about the companies (INAUDIBLE) change their business model as a result of it.So this is much more than just about asking Facebook or other social media platforms to make them shift. You're actually asking them to change the kind of company they are, and that's really what's at play right now.BARTIROMO: Yes. Unless it happens through market share because Devin Nunes and some others in Congress are pushing parlor, parlor.com as an alternative to Twitter, we'll see if it gains some ground there.Next stop, social justice in the NBA. The players association, the league have reportedly reached a deal which allows players to replace their names on back of their jersey with a social statement when the season resumes on July 30th.Phillip, do you think this is kind to deter any fans?PHILIP WEGMANN, REALCLEARPOLITICS WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: I think that, frankly, the NBA would have a lot more credibility on this issue if they were willing to condemn the horrific human rights abuses that you mentioned earlier in the show. They were willing to overlook those when they were trying to ink a deal with China worth billions of dollars, they turned the other way. But now, they are trying to make a statement about - in this country. I think they have a lot more credibility if they condemn injustice everywhere regardless of how much money was on the line.BARTIROMO: It's a fair point. What's happening to the Uyghurs in China is just really horrific right now, a true tragedy.Finally, golden retriever reaching golden years, Mitch. Augie, celebrated her 20th birthday this year. She was adopted by her current owners at age 14. And although Augie initially had kidney issues through diet and supplements, she's actually stayed healthy and happy, and there she is. Mitch, you have a retriever, right? Charlie is 11.5 years old. Is he going to make it to Augie's age?ROSCHELLE: We would only hope and pray. The best part of that story, Maria, is that the family that has Augie adopted her when she was 14. I think she was getting too old for the family that had her and to keep her. And she has lived for another six years, which is a great story. I know we're big fans of adopting dogs on this program, but don't overlook the fact that you're going to adopt senior dogs as well.BARTIROMO: That's ad good point and I love Charlie, I watch Charlie in your Instagram feed all of the time, Mitch. There's Augie.Still ahead, what is word on Wall Street, find out next, as we take a look at the top stores affecting your money and markets top of the 7:00 A.M.Plus, my interview with the Milken Institute Chairman, Michael Milken, is coming up talking about future of healthcare. He is also talking about structural change in the economy, which is here, what he says about the reopening, Mike Milken coming up.

Singaporean man pleads guilty to spying for China in the USCNN WireJuly 25, 2020 Saturday 1:27 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 660 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN) BodyHONG KONG (CNN) --  A Singaporean man living in Washington D.C. has pleaded guilty to being an "illegal agent of a foreign power," prosecutors said Friday. Jun Wei Yeo, also known as Dickson Yeo, worked for Chinese intelligence for four or five years, recruiting Americans with access to sensitive information over the internet and commissioning them to write reports, which he then passed on to Beijing. "The Chinese Government uses an array of duplicity to obtain sensitive information from unsuspecting Americans," United States Assistant Attorney General John Demers said in a statement. "Yeo was central to one such scheme, using career networking sites and a false consulting firm to lure Americans who might be of interest to the Chinese government. This is yet another example of the Chinese government's exploitation of the openness of American society."His guilty plea comes amid an ongoing crackdown on Chinese operatives in the US. On Friday, a Chinese military-linked scientist who had been hiding out in the country's San Francisco consulate surrendered to US authorities. Her arrest followed the shuttering of the Chinese consulate in Houston, which Washington has linked to espionage operations and Intellectual Property theft. That move sparked a major backlash from Beijing, which has ordered the closure of the US consulate in Chengdu, which it also accuses of being a hub of spying operations. Fake consultancyAccording to prosecutors, Yeo was recruited by Chinese intelligence during a trip to Beijing around 2015, when he was studying for a doctorate from the National University of Singapore. He was offered money in exchange for political reports and information, and later asked to sign a contract with China's military, the People's Liberation Army (PLA). While he did not sign the contract, Yeo continued to work with Chinese intelligence operatives, who increasingly requested he focus on obtaining "non-public information" from the US, related to issues such as artificial intelligence and the ongoing US-China trade war. Yeo met with his intelligence handlers dozens of times, and when he traveled to China for these meetings he was regularly taken out of the customs lines and brought into a separate office for admission into the country, which he told prosecutors was intended to "conceal his identity when he traveled into China."As he increasingly targeted the US, Yeo set up a fake consultancy website and began soliciting resumes, receiving hundreds, including many from US military and government personnel with security clearances, which he would pass on to his Chinese handlers. One person he recruited in this way was a civilian working for the US Air Force on the F-35B military aircraft program, with a high-level security clearance. This person, who has not been identified by prosecutors, was having financial problems, and Yeo commissioned them to write a report for him.Yeo moved to the US around January 2019, after which his handlers told him not to communicate with them for fear of interception. When he had to get in touch, Yeo was told to do so from a local coffee shop. It's unclear how and when Yeo was arrested, but he was charged this year with acting as an "illegal agent of a foreign power without first notifying the Attorney General," and subsequently pleaded guilty. He is due to be sentenced in October, and faces up to 10 years in prison. "Today's guilty plea underscores the ways that the Chinese government continues to target Americans with access to sensitive government information, including using the Internet and non-Chinese nationals to target Americans who never leave the United States," Michael R. Sherwin, acting US Attorney for the District of Columbia, said in a statement. "We will continue to prosecute those who use deceptive practices on the Internet and elsewhere to undermine our national security."TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Zoom admits it took down US-based protesters' accounts at China's behest and promises not to enforce similar censorship requestsBusiness Insider USJune 12, 2020 Friday 06:42 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 585 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Isobel Asher Hamilton)Highlight: Zoom said from now on it will "not allow requests from the Chinese government to impact anyone outside of mainland China."BodyAP Photo/Mark Lennihan• Zoom said on Thursday it deactivated the accounts of multiple US-based human rights activists at the request of the Chinese government.• Zoom said it blocked the hosts' user accounts because it doesn't have the functionality to block individual accounts by location.• It promised going forward it will "not allow requests from the Chinese government to impact anyone outside of mainland China."• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.Zoom has admitted it blocked the accounts of Chinese human rights campaigners because China asked it to.Axios reported Wednesday that an account belonging to Zhou Fengsuo, a US-based human rights campaigner who was a student leader during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, had            been suspended after he hosted an event commemorating the protests.Initially Zoom said it had suspended Zhou's account to comply with "local laws," but was not specific about which local laws were being enforced. In a blog post published on Thursday, Zoom confirmed it was the Chinese government which had forced it to shut down multiple human rights users' accounts after they hosted meetings about Tiananmen Square. The meetings were attended by Chinese users, which meant they fell under Chinese censorship laws forbidding the discussion of Tiananmen Square. Zoom said in its blog post that it shut down the meetings because it does not have the capability to block users individually by country."We could have anticipated this need. While there would have been significant repercussions, we also could have kept the meetings running," the company said.It has since reinstated the users' accounts and says it is working on functionality to block users based on their geographical location. "Going forward Zoom will not allow requests from the Chinese government to impact anyone outside of mainland China," it promised.News of Zoom blocking the accounts prompted Republican Senator Josh Hawley to write a letter to company CEO Eric Yuan, asking whether Zoom is trying to "curry favor" with China's Communist Party.The senator also recalled in April when Zoom said it had "mistakenly" routed some users' calls through servers in China, sparking privacy and security concerns.In some ways the news of Zoom censoring Tiananmen Square memorials mirrors concerns by US lawmakers around the wildly popular shortform video app TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance. Reports surfaced last year that TikTok's moderators had been instructed to censor mentions of politically contentious issues and events including Tiananmen Square, sparking fears that this could mean China's censorship laws could be enforced against users outside of China.The key difference is that while TikTok is owned by ByteDance, Zoom is an American company."One would have thought that a supposedly American company whose claim to fame is serving a fast, virtually seamless video chat would value free speech. But your company appears to have chosen censorship instead," writes Senator Hawley.NOW WATCH: How waste is dealt with on the world's largest cruise shipSee Also:• Zoom deactivated the US-based account of a Tiananmen Square protester after an online commemorative event• Internet goliath Tencent is building a city the size of Midtown Manhattan in China, complete with grass-covered rooftops, offices, and apartments.

China faces almost everyoneCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 4, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1366 wordsBody"China is no longer afraid of anyone. The times when the Chinese people were subordinate to others and lived dependent on the whims of others are over to never return." This is how Zhang Xiaoming, the deputy director of the Hong Kong Affairs office within the Chinese government, boasted during a press conference wednesday on the draconian National Security Act for Autonomous Territory. That day this rule came into force, which has immediately aggravated the already significant tensions between Beijing and the West. Another in the series of international clashes that China has recently starred, with increasing assertiveness and despite the covid-19 pandemic.In recent months, the list of incidents seems to grow almost daily. Two weeks ago, his army clashed with India's in the bloodiest border incident in more than 50 years. In the South China Sea it has collided with the Philippines and Vietnam: this week, both countries have cried out against "hugely provocative" Chinese military maneuvers. The United States has sent two aircraft carriers to the area this weekend to support "a free and open Indo-Pacific region," amid mutual recriminations between Washington and Beijing to encourage tensions in the area. Previously, Beijing has had frictions with Japan around the islands that are both contesting in the East China Sea; their fighters have flown the skies near Taiwan on several occasions.Beyond its immediate borders, Beijing has engaged in a dispute with Australia over the investigation of covid-19 origins; with Canada, she is engaged in a sour fight after accusing two Canadians arrested in apparent retaliation for the arrest in Vancouver of Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou. The diplomacy of masks and attempts to politicize Chinese humanitarian aid caused severe irritation in many countries. Differences with the EU over Hong Kong, human rights or trade policy were highlighted during the video conference summit two weeks ago. And relations with America are going from bad to worse.Phrases similar to those of Zhang, the senior Chinese government official in Hong Kong, are increasingly heard, and more strongly, from the mouths of the wolf warriors ( warrior wolves), the new litter of Chinese diplomats led by Foreign spokesman Zhao Lijian and defending, in harsh language, Beijing's positions from social media - Twitter , especially despite being banned in his country- and any other pulpit.China asserts that its movements are purely defensive, and that it merely reacts to pressure from others. No pressure "can undermine his determination and willingness to safeguard national sovereignty," Zhao stressed of Hong Kong this week.Allowing Beijing to exert pressure on other countries is neither new nor something that other states do not do. But it is a long-rising trend as its power has increased. According to data from Ketian Zhang, an adjunct professor at George Mason University in Virginia ,USA and a specialist in international relations from China, nine episodes of coertion, most of a military nature, occurred in the 1990s. Between 2010 and 2017, they surpassed twenty, almost all of an economic and diplomatic nature.In part, this more recent phase of Chinese assertiveness may be due to the coronavirus pandemic, in the opinion of some experts. To a desire to seize the opportunity while the world is distracted by the fight against the disease, but also to respond to the internal situation that has created the disease.Within China "Xi [Jinping, the Chinese President]it puts a lot of pressure on the pandemic, the economy and the management of the virus at first," says Taylor Fravel, a Chinese Defense Policy Expert at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Beijing's more aggressive attitude would seek to "dispel any sense of China being weak" right now.And in part, this renewed affirmation of its position comes due to the climate of rising global tensions, and the chinese government's conviction that decoupling, the separation of economic and technological ties with the United States, is not only inevitable but even advisable, to avoid dependencies that could jeopardize its interests."Even if ties with the United States are deteriorating - and that's something that has accelerated during the pandemic - that's not going to mean moderation on the issues that China really cares about," Says Fravel. Rather, quite the opposite: "When China senses that it is challenged in any of its sovereignty disputes in this era, it will respond with a very hard line," the expert stresses.As China has become more assertive, the response to its international behavior is growing. Australia has announced a military spending of $186 billion (about 165.4 billion euros) for the next decade, an increase of 40%. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has warned that the Indo-Pacific region will be "the focus of the dominant global strife of our age." Japan, according to the Nikkei newspaper, will deepen its intelligence collaboration with Australia, India, the United Kingdom and France to - among other things - share data on Chinese troop movements. Taiwan reopens its offices in the US territory of Guam. The Quad, the informal security partnership formed by Japan, Australia, the United States and India, gains new strength after the border king in the Himalayas. The latter country has just proposed the purchase of military equipment from Russia worth 4.6 billion euros.Mistrust also extends to the economic level. Among other measures, this week New Delhi has banned 59 Chinese apps, including the popular TikTok, in a step that the short video app estimates can cost you $6 billion. The UK has changed its mind about Huawei's involvement in its 5G network. Japan and Taiwan have announced incentives for their companies to leave China, and the United States is calling for a new layout of the supply lines.Moreover, the United States and the European Union find that, despite the transatlantic divergences of the Trump era, their positions are becoming closer to Beijing. European Foreign Policy Representative Josep Borrell proposed a bilateral dialogue on China last month. "US and European views on China - both its behavior and its political response - are converging. The Chinese Party State that the UNITED States and the EU face is very different now from the one they both sought to collaborate with over the past four decades," says the Report Dealing with the Dragon: China as a Transatlantic Challenge, published this week and produced by the US Asia Society, George Washington University, and Germany's Bertelsmann Stiftung.Not wholesale, or more obvious now, the pressure that China can exert is no longer hugely calculated. According to Ketian Zhang, "he is more likely to exercise coercation when he perceives a great need to establish a reputation as a country that is firm and determined in defending its national security interests." Or also as a warning gesture: "kill a chicken with theto scare the monkey," according to Chinese expression, or pressure one country to take note of others.This pressure has limits. China cooks "as long as it does not jeopardize something it wants or needs, if the state (which it presses) has something China wants." If the economic cost is high, Beijing is less likely to be very assertive. Moreover, even if it has, on the one hand, an interest in building a firm country reputation in its interests, on the other "it does not want an alliance against it, and aspires to a stable and prosperous economic climate. Both are in tension and there is no way to combine them," she says.Looking ahead, if the trend towards disconnection continues, decoupling, in the long run "if China does not depend as much as before, economically, on the United States, Japan or the European Union, then it will have fewer restrictions or concerns, and we could see more of this coercive behavior," Zhang says.In this regard, the former German fighter to China and current vice-president of the Council on Foreign Relations, Volker Stanzel, one of the authors of Dealing with the Dragon, speaks: "Disconnection will benefit no one. We have to defend the system and convince China not to happen."Load-Date: July 5, 2020End of Document

Also joining the conversation this morning is Fox Business's Dagen McDowell; Michael Lee Strategy Founder, Michael Lee; and Forbes Media Chairman, former Republican presidential candidate, Steve Forbes.It is great to see everybody this morning. Thank you so much for being here.Tom, let me get your thoughts on what we heard from the Fed yesterday and then, of course, all of this news of a spike in coronavirus cases. What are you seeing from the money end of it? How are the investment flows?TOM LYDON, ETF TRENDS CEO: Absolutely. It's a tale of two worlds. Absolutely here, Maria, we've got one of these situations where tough economic news, surely earnings concerns, however investors remain confident, we've seen over $225 billion in new money going to ETF's this year, which is a great parameter for consumer confidence, investor confidence.But - and you point out a very important thing. The money has been going into a certain sector of the market, work-from-home stocks, traditional FAANG stocks, where you had Microsoft in there. And you look at the NASDAQ 100, which makes up 48 percent of the NASDAQ 100, just those six stocks. They continue to do very, very well, this work-from-home stocks.We as a country are doing the best in this environment and actually thriving. And many of these tech companies are moving up their growth plans because of this environment. There's some other ETFs like ARKK innovation ETF, and cloud computing by Global X, CLOU, which has companies like Twilio, Zoom, Spotify, all companies that we're hearing hit new highs as this market and the internet market and work-from-home market continues to expand.BARTIROMO: Yes. And of course, we're moving into the earnings season. Michael Lee, jump in here. We're going to get the banks next week. The second quarter earnings season will begin flowing. Will that start to dictate where market is at next?MICHAEL LEE, MICHAEL LEE STRATEGY: Yes. It's going to be really interesting how the bank outlook comes out with what's going on with interest rates, loan loss reserves, and the economy falling off a cliff and coming back.Tom, my question for you is, what has been the most surprising flow into ETFs' last two weeks' earnings sector, either in equities or fixed income that's really shocked you?LYDON: Well, the great thing is, Michael, as you know, the Fed has really stepped up and bought ETFs in the corporate and the high-yield side. Areas of Fallen Angels, where they've really supported some of these high-yield stocks in the form of ETFs, to really provide this backstop. And then back to the technology side, it's just amazing the amount of money that's flowing into the QQQ than NASDAQ 100 ETF.Again, one thing to remember, the S&P 500, almost 20 percent is made up of those FAANG stocks. And if the FAANG stocks weren't there, we wouldn't see the rebound that we've seen. The average S&P 500 stock is still down 10 percent year-to-date, where overall the QQQs are up 22 percent. So we've really got this bifurcation in stocks across the U.S.BARTIROMO: Yes. That's a good point, Tom. Let me ask you about the backdrop. Did you hear anything out of all of the Fed speakers that we heard from yesterday about where we are in this economic recovery and when you expect normalization?I keep saying that Larry Kudlow told us two weeks ago that the third quarter will see growth of 20 percent. That's a - that is a real difference from what we're seeing in the second quarter, which is, of course, contraction. When do you expect growth once again in this economy?LYDON: It's really unclear because most companies aren't giving us the transparency that we've expected in the past, Maria, and you know that. I think one thing we can be confident of, though, is if the Fed and the government need to step in again, they've kept some powder dry. And we can expect that to happen--BARTIROMO: Yes.LYDON: --and you can see that confidence in Wall Street.BARTIROMO: It's interesting they've kept powder dry when you're talking about up to $10 trillion in stimulus between the government and the Federal Reserve.Steve Forbes, jump in here.STEVE FORBES, FORBES MEDIA CHAIRMAN & FORMER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDAT: Tom, I'm wondering, would the tech part of the market be hit by the prospect, when would it be hit by the prospect of the Democrats if they win the White House and the Senate? I'm surprised the market hasn't taken that possibility more into consideration with their policies of less - more, more regulation, higher taxes, all the things that bring about slow growth. Why isn't the market reacted more to that possibility when you look at the polls?LYDON: Steve, it's a great point. I think the only saving grace here is these technology companies has enabled America to actually thrive in many cases during these challenging times. You think about the financial adviser industry. 350,000 financial advisers around the country forced to work from home, run their businesses, deal with their clients, a lot of handholding going on while their kids are running around. But because of technology today and companies that we've just talked about, they are able to operate, where maybe 10 years ago, that wouldn't happen.So I think when you look at the support the technology sector has from America, that's going to continue regardless of who is in the White House, but obviously, there'd be a lot of concerns as we get closer to November if it looks like the Democrats are strong.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll be watching certainly, Tom. It's good to have you this morning. Thanks so much.LYDON: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: Tom Lydon joining us there. We'll see you soon, Tom.We are just getting started this morning. We've got a lot coming up. Coming up this hour, meet Brock Pierce, a cryptocurrency entrepreneur and former child actor, now running for president. We will get his 2020 platform, coming up.And then, next hour, Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is here to talk about the recent spikes in crime across the country, what can be done about it.In the 8 a.m. hour, New York Congressman Lee Zeldin joining me, talking about the FBI's pushback on Chinese cybercrimes. We heard from the Director of the FBI yesterday. And this morning, the Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf is here talking about the increasing violence and combating China.All coming up right here. Much more ahead. But first up, Dr. Mike (ph) is here to talk about the toxic hand sanitizers, how your blood type could affect your coronavirus risks. You don't miss that. Then, show on the water, a plan for a floating movie theater, making a buzz this morning.Stay with us. A lot coming up. You're watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. FBI alert, Director Christopher Wray warning that Chinese efforts to steal American information are growing at a shocking rate, calling them one of the largest transfers of wealth in human history. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRISTOPHER WRAY, FBI DIRECTOR: We've now reached a point where the FBI is opening a new China-related counterintelligence case about every 10 hours. Of the nearly 5,000 active FBI counterintelligence cases currently underway across the country, almost half are all related to China.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Wray added that if you are an American adult, China has likely already stolen your personal data.Joining me right now is American Enterprise Institute Research Fellow, Zack Cooper.Zack, it's great to have you this morning. Thank you so much for being here. Another really important speech yesterday from the FBI Director, Christopher Wray. This follows a similar speech recently from Robert O'Brien, and you're going to get another speech from the Secretary of State and the Attorney General within the next two weeks. We see the threat. Our audience understands the threat. We've been talking about this for over a year in terms of what China and the Communist Party has been doing. What is the U.S. going to do about it?ZACK COOPER, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE RESEARCH FELLOW: That's a great question. What we saw in 2015 is the Chinese promise they were going to stop this behavior. And as you saw yesterday from Director Wray, it hasn't stopped. If anything, he would argue that it has accelerated.I think the administration is going to come under increasing pressure to put this at the top of its agenda, and that's going to put more pressure on the trade deal. There were provisions in the trade deal to try and address this, but if the behavior is continuing, then I think it's going to be difficult for the President to continue forward with that deal.BARTIROMO: So one of the things here is that China is trying to leap ahead of the United States in significant technology advancements like AI, quantum computing, et cetera, but they're not doing it in terms of working with the United States or trying to educate its people about this. They're just stealing it. I mean, this is the first time we have seen a major government have as an official strategy, espionage and theft, but that's exactly what the Chinese Communist Party is doing.COOPER: That's right. And I think, to stop it, we're going to have to really put the relationship on the line. And that's what the Obama administration tried to do in 2015 that weren't willing to actually pull the trigger and put the penalties on the Chinese that would have been required. And now that's going to be the task up to the Trump administration. They've taken real action recently.They have put in places, Director Wray outlined, a whole investigation that has gone after many, many people who've been involved in this behavior back in China. Many of them are associated with state-owned enterprises with the government directly, even with the People's Liberation Army and its cyber- hacking areas. But that hasn't been enough.And I think this is just going to be a bigger and bigger issue, particularly as people think about the scope of this behavior. As Director Wray has said and others, this is the largest theft of anything in human history, something like $250 billion in intellectual property theft a year from China.BARTIROMO: Yes. And what they're doing is they're using our intellectual property that they stole and then they are using it to actually compete against the very companies that they've stolen the intellectual property for. A couple of months ago, I mentioned that they are stealing data about our medical advancements, and then they're actually filing patents with that information that they just stole to try to beat the very companies that they stole it from to get a patent. It's actually incredible.What about the Thousand Talents Program? Because this is one of the issues where China has really exploited? These Thousand Talents Program, the Chinese government tries to entice scientists to secretly bring our knowledge and innovation back to China. How do you stop it? Do you do away with the Thousand Talents Program or the Schwarzman Scholars program?COOPER: Well, I think we've got to differentiate between those exchanges that I think are fine and not problematic. And then things like Thousand Talents, where I think there really are serious questions to be asked.Director Wray outlined a whole series of individuals who were part of the Thousand Talents Program, they were incentivized to bring information back to China, to bring knowledge and know-how to China, and in some cases, do it covertly.So, one case that he outlined yesterday, an individual got $50,000 a month covertly to bring information and build an organization back in China to do the same thing that he was being paid by the U.S. government to do here in the United States. That kind of behavior absolutely has to stop.BARTIROMO: Right.COOPER: And I think we have to differentiate that--BARTIROMO: Yes.COOPER: --from what I think is the positive work, which is - some Chinese students being here and studying and bringing money into our university systems.BARTIROMO: Right. And that's - and that's the trick. How do you differentiate who's working for the CCP and who isn't? I don't think you actually can. What about this issue that the White House officials now warning a federally-administrated retirement plan for railroad workers against investing in Chinese companies, saying additional sanctions could be ahead in return for China's role in spreading the coronavirus.National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien and the Director of National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow, wrote this letter. "The NRRI Trust's investment in PRC exposes the retirement funds of railroad workers to significant and unnecessary economic risk."Zack, this is similar to the Thrift fund, where the President wrote to the Thrift fund and said, stop investing into companies that are either sanctioned or working for the Chinese military, building equipment that may very well be used against the United States one day.COOPER: That's right. I think this is just the beginning. We're going to see more pressure on folks to divest from these kinds of funds because they think that there's real risk inherent in them and inherent in doing business in China, especially when many of those companies haven't been audited.BARTIROMO: Exactly. Zack, great to see you. Thank you so much, Zack Cooper.We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. No likes. Civil rights leaders and activist groups slamming Facebook and CEO Mark Zuckerberg this morning, after a meeting focused on social media and the site's handling of hateful content and the current advertising boycott. The group is claiming that Zuckerberg seemed to show no sign of taking steps to curb questionable speech on Facebook.Dagen McDowell, your thoughts?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: Facebook's own auditors, it was an outside legal team that looked into this, essentially said the same thing that Facebook is doing too little on civil rights concerns that has been too reactive and slow in addressing hate speech, voter suppression, other problematic content on the platform. This is in "The Wall Street Journal" today.But we've known this for years. And now you have advertisers boycotting Facebook. They're essentially using the current mood and their own virtue signaling as cover to cut cost during a pandemic when they would probably be cutting cost anyway. These advertisers are trying to seem noble, righteous, and just, when people were committing suicide and murder on live streams on Facebook literally for years, where a man killed his infant child on Facebook three years ago. Where were all of these companies then?In terms of civil rights, I will point to this, that these companies, these progressive towers of wealth of prosperity, Google and Facebook to name two, have all but locked out black Americans when it comes to their hiring during their entire existence. These rich liberals are actually the problem, but they get a pass from the media. When will that end? And the numbers bear this out.If you look at Facebook's overall workforce, 3.8 percent of its workforce is represented by black Americans. In technical jobs, it is 1.5 percent. So that's where - if you want to talk about spreading the wealth, opportunity in this country and really lifting up all people, that's your problem, and it starts at the top of these liberal left-wing technology companies.BARTIROMO: yes. Rather than destroying infrastructure and taking down statues, let's put real money to work in terms of helping lower-income communities. Where is the actual work in terms of changing and making the workforce more diversified? You make a great point.MCDOWELL: I asked a top technology executive that - probably it was a couple of years ago. I asked him that privately. And I said, you grew up in a rural part of the country, why don't you put tech centers in that where you grew up to give - these areas, even before the pandemic, among black men, they had unemployment rates that were 20 percent or even higher, and the response to that was (inaudible). It's just disgraceful.BARTIROMO: Yes. Instead, we have - instead, we have in rural areas of America right now, Huawei. And now we are realizing the threat that is Huawei. And that is what is being used. There's infrastructure in this country in rural areas of America, and those people are being surveilled by Huawei.Coming up, a new warning over hand sanitizers. We want to report to you the additional risks that you need to look for when you buy your hand sanitizer. Then, some airlines are ready to serve you alcohol again, but there is a catch. That's next. Stay with us.MARIA BARTIROMO, ANCHOR, MORNINGS WITH MARIA: Welcome back, good Wednesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, July 8th. Let's take a look at the markets this morning, 6:31 a.m. on the East Coast. Investors eyeing the coronavirus spikes across the country, rising tensions with China this morning and seeing a mixed performance on Wall Street.The Dow futures are down 54 points, the Nasdaq is up 13, that momentum continues there, but the S&P 500 is also weaker this morning, down 3 and a quarter. This after a selloff yesterday, ending the Nasdaq's 3-day streak of record highs. Take a look at yesterday's close with the Dow down 396 points at 4 O'clock on Wall Street, the Nasdaq was down 89 and the S&P was down 34.Global markets this morning, mostly lower, red across the board in Europe, U.K. Finance Minister this morning announcing the latest recovery plan. It is expected to include tax cuts and vouchers to boost spending at restaurants and pubs. We'll get more information later today from the Finance Minister in the U.K. In Asia overnight, markets were mixed, the Shanghai Composite extending a winning streak to 7 days in China.The rally continues for stocks after the government said they want a bull market in place. Shanghai Composite up 1 and 3 quarters percent. Now, the Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts briefly hospitalized last month after hitting his head in a fall. Cheryl Casone with those details now. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: That's right, Maria, Chief Justice John Roberts hit his forehead while he was going for a walk near his Maryland home. This happened back on June 21st and he needed stitches at the time. A Supreme Court spokeswoman says the doctors ruled out a possible seizure, and the fall was likely due to light headedness due to dehydration at the time.Now, the Chief Justice was released the next day. But the fall reportedly not related to two previous seizures that he's had. This had been reported in 1993 and again in 2007. He was hospitalized for that second seizure. All of this revealed in "The Washington Post" and confirmed by the court. Roberts has been in the spotlight after playing pivotal roles in several high-profile cases at the court. They're now racing to finish up their term.Well, retailers are feeling the financial pinch from the COVID-19 pandemic. Ascena Retail Group, which is the owner of Lane Bryant and Ann Taylor reportedly plans to file for bankruptcy protection and close at least 1,200 of its 2,800 stores this week. Shares of Ascena Retail Group tumbled more than 8 percent yesterday as this news was breaking. And there's also news on Levi Strauss.That company plans to lay out 700 workers amid plunging revenue and growing losses. The company actually lost more than $360 million in its latest quarter. In a statement, the company said all the trends appear to be improving sequentially, the ultimate health and economic impact of COVID-19 pandemic remains highly uncertain. Levi Strauss after that number in that report coming out, stock is down more than 5 percent.And here is a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com. For the first time, Apple's new iPhones are reportedly going to be sold without a charger or ear-buds to offset any cost increases with the upgraded models. Under Armour reportedly wants to sell MyFitnessPal app just five years after its acquisition of that app. And by this, Maria, you mentioned this Delta and American Airlines are resuming alcohol service, but it's only going to be for first and business class customers.American is only offering alcohol to main cabin customers on international flights that are more than 2,200 miles. I guess it makes sense. It's hard to drink with the mask on a plane, Maria. Those are your headlines.BARTIROMO: Yes, it does. Cheryl, thank you. Well, the mask is on, Dr. Anthony Fauci says that he is, quote, "strongly" in favor of mandating face masks at the local level to protect against COVID-19. He's urging Americans to stay vigilant.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY & INFECTIOUS DISEASES: It's a false narrative to take comfort in a lower rate of death. There are so many other things that are very dangerous and bad about this virus. Don't get yourself into false complacency.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: One expert says that Americans will likely need to wear masks for, quote, "several years". Joining me right now is family medicine physician, Dr. Mikhail Varshavski, a.k.a, Dr. Mike, and Dr. Mike, it's great to see you, thank you for being here. What do you think about this mask issue? Are we going to be wearing masks for years to come?MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, FAMILY MEDICINE PHYSICIAN: Great to see you, Maria. You know, I think we have to as Dr. Anthony Fauci says, we have to respect this virus. We've gotten very complacent in the safety that we're seeing that there's a lower death rate despite the fact that we're having more cases. But the reason why that's problematic is even though we're having less deaths or at least a lower death rate, we're seeing more and more morbidity which means higher hospitalizations, worst outcomes for those patients over time because any time they get sick with the virus, obviously, you're having symptoms in those moments, but you also have lasting illness.When you come out of an ICU setting, just because you didn't die doesn't mean all is well. So we are going to be wearing these masks for the extended future, especially when the flu season comes around. The Fall is really close, Maria, and we're going to have the common cold, the flu, coronavirus mixed in there, it's going to be really a difficult time for our hospital systems. So, the things that we can control, we should control and that means wearing your mask.BARTIROMO: Yes, I think it's really funny what the journal wrote about yesterday, and that is that Dagen McDowell, you saw this op-ed, the Japanese routinely wear masks and they wear masks to ward off -- ward off hay fever and colds, and because of that and the constant wearing of masks, they've actually been able to avoid the worst effects of this pandemic without mandatory lockdowns, Dagen, because they're used to wearing the masks, they always wear the masks.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: And Dr. Mike, like it or not, you have a long way to go, the medical community to convince people that they need to wear a mask because, oh, I think that you need to highlight actual proof that wearing a mask prevents the spread of this illness. I went into a grocery store in the rural south and maybe half the people in the store were wearing masks. You're supposed to.The grocery store chain says that you're supposed to, can't come in, but they're not policing it, and people -- and you'll get into a fist fight if you tell somebody to put a mask on.VARSHAVSKI: Yes, really, what's upsetting to me, Dagen, is, you have individuals on one side who are yelling at folks who are not wearing masks. And that's not a good approach, that's not going to convince anybody to do something. And frankly, in the medical community, we dropped the ball in the beginning by telling folks to not wear masks. We're seeing that these aren't going to protect you.We actually did that correctly because at the time, we didn't have evidence that those without symptoms can be spreading this virus so much. But as we've learned more, we've updated our guidance --BARTIROMO: Yes --VARSHAVSKI: But because of this change, we've confused folks, we've scared some people away, but I urge the general public, trust in the CDC, we're out in your best interest. We want to protect you, we want to limit the --BARTIROMO: Yes --VARSHAVSKI: Spread of this virus, and while wearing a mask is really uncomfortable, it's not pleasant for a long period of time. It is not dangerous to your health, and it does shorten the spread of this virus.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, it does protect you and everybody around you. I want to ask you about blood type, and blood type playing a role in the COVID protection. People with type 0 blood are 35 percent less likely to develop severe coronavirus symptoms, while those with type A blood are 45 percent more likely to see severe symptoms. This is according to a new study, Dr. Mike, what do you say about this? Should we be concerned about the blood type impact here?VARSHAVSKI: Yes, I don't think this has any practical applicability to the general public because we've seen different results in different studies, and while some blood types truly do see higher risks and some see lower risks, there's no full-proof protection. I don't want someone who is blood type O --BARTIROMO: Yes --VARSHAVSKI: To think, oh, I can walk around without a mask, hi-fiving everybody and it's all going to be --BARTIROMO: Right --VARSHAVSKI: Well. No, this is really for researchers to look into potential avenues for us to create treatments for COVID-19, nothing more.BARTIROMO: All right, what do you make about these hand sanitizers and the dangers to some of them. The FDA has banned 5 more sanitizers in the United States for using methanol as an active ingredient. Now the FDA is warning that ingesting this chemical could lead to death. This follows the FDA banning 9 other products for the same reason. Dr. Mike, what should we look for in a sanitizer, what are the best sanitizers and what do we avoid?VARSHAVSKI: Yes, Maria, from the beginning of this pandemic, we've been saying at least 60 percent alcohol-based hand sanitizers, but methanol is not one of the acceptable uses of this type of alcohol. Why? Methanol can actually penetrate your skin if you ingest it by making contact with your mouth, it can lead to nausea, vomiting, headaches, blindness, even fatalities if you ingest --BARTIROMO: Wow --VARSHAVSKI: Enough of it. What you should be looking for is for ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, also known as rubbing alcohol. These are acceptable forms of alcohol in your hand sanitizer, not methanol. It's really a shame that companies are trying to cut corners to make a profit during this pandemic, we've seen it with price gouging with masks, now with the additions of sub-standard alcohol like methanol, and these companies should really be punished.BARTIROMO: That's terrible, well, thankfully, the FDA is out with their list of what to watch for. Thanks for going through with us. Dr. Mike, it's good to see you, thank you so much, I know we're going to see you later on in the show to talk about if we really need 10,000 steps a day to stay healthy. That's what we've been told, we're going to talk about it later on in the show, Mike, thank you so much. But first --VARSHAVSKI: Thank you --BARTIROMO: You might have seen him in "First Kid", now he's running for president. I'll be speaking to the candidate Brock Pierce about his platform and cryptocurrency background. It's all right here next, stay with us. Plus, show on the water, a plan for a floating movie theater making the buzz this morning. You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.(MUSIC)BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Throwing his hat in the ring, back in the '90s, Brock Pierce played the son of a sitting president in the Disney film "First Kid", now he's running for the White House as an independent. Joining us right now is the former child actor, bitcoin entrepreneur and now presidential candidate Brock Pierce. Brock, it is great to have you this morning, thank you so much for being here. Congratulations on everything, tell us why you're running, what's your platform?BROCK PIERCE, BITCOIN ENTREPRENEUR: Well, I'm running because I'm deeply concerned about the state of our nation right now. I feel we're very polarized, I feel this nation is very much divided, and I think we need messages and I think we need leadership that can reunite us as a country, and that's the big part of it as I think there's an opportunity to deliver an important message for all of us to focus in, we're on really basic principles.You know, what's up with -- what's right, what's wrong? You know, what are our values? What are our principles? What do we stand for? And as we decide what we stand for, we have a foundation that will allow us to be less manipulative and hopefully find a path forward together, harmonization of the left and the right.BARTIROMO: So, how are you going to deliver that message? What are the messages that you feel need to be delivered, it needs to resonate? Give us the focus of your campaign. Why should you be president?PIERCE: Well, I'm a small business entrepreneur making big things out of nothing, and I think entrepreneurs built this nation, and I think entrepreneurs and innovators are the ones that are going to get us out of our current situation. For example, most of my career has been in technology. I think there's no question that technology has affected all of our lives, and it's only going to continue to do so exponentially.In this day and age, if we want to build a 21st century economy, if understands that -- you need to understand the tools of the 21st century.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, I think that's a good point. There are other people who feel that there's room for them, look at Kanye West, how do you differentiate yourself from him, he's also an entrepreneur, he also feels that there should be messaging out there that's different than there is right now?PIERCE: Kanye and I are clearly tapping into the same thing, and we're really excited to see his running as well. Hopefully, collectively, we can deliver a powerful message to the American people when at a time where I think we need it. I mean, COVID-19 has brought us together around a shared issue in a way that I don't think we've ever been brought together before. Great time to be delivering a different message --BARTIROMO: Yes --PIERCE: A message that will allow us to move forward.BARTIROMO: Let me bring in Steve Forbes, he too ran for president. Go ahead, Steve.STEVE FORBES, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, FORBES: Getting to a more technical level, how are you going to get on the ballots of 50 states since many in the filing deadlines have passed. Have you filed with the bureaucracy, the Federal Election Commission and the grubby things like that, and also are you prepared for the really intense examination of everything you've done in the past, everything you've done will be held against you. I can tell you from experience, are you prepared for that?(LAUGHTER)PIERCE: Well, I'm definitely prepared for the scrutiny and understand that through this process that every mistake that I've made in my life will be deeply investigated, put under a magnifying glass, but I'm an open book, and I'm certainly prepared to answer any questions related to any of the decisions I've made in my life, and clearly I've made mistakes, I've got the battle scars to prove it.But I think those battle scars have given me the fortitude and determination to do what we're doing here. In terms of your question about the FEC, yes, we have filed and approved from a ballot perspective, we think that we'll be on a majority of the ballots, and that is the immediate sort of work that we have to do right now as those deadlines continue to hit over the next dozen or so weeks.BARTIROMO: Brock, are you still dealing in cryptocurrency? Do you see cryptocurrency as the future for America?PIERCE: Well, I see block-chain technology as something that can positively impact the world and our nation specifically. The currency aspect of that is a tool that can deliver financial inclusion, an idea that we could have ubiquitous financial inclusion in a way where everyone has access to financial tools. In this day and age, if we were going to redesign Maslow's hierarchy of needs, it would likely include having a computer or a cellphone, an internet connection and basic financial tools.About one-third of the population on the planet today doesn't have basic financial services, yes, we have another third of the population today has a limited access to financial services, things like credit. And that problem also very much exists here in our country today. Whenever you're driving around and you see those check --BARTIROMO: Yes --PIERCE: Cashing stores or payday loans, there's a large percentage of the population of this country that do not have the basic tools necessary for the pursuit of happiness. Other things or other core tenets of the technology --BARTIROMO: Yes --PIERCE: Is transparency.BARTIROMO: Sure. This is a really important point, and I know that you'll be able to communicate that quite well. Brock, it's great to see you, we'll be watching your campaign, best wishes, thank you, sir.PIERCE: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Brock Pierce joining us there. Quick break, much more ahead. First, a programming note. North Carolina congressional candidate Madison Cawthorn will join us Friday live as part of our panel. Don't miss it, he'll be with us for -- at 7:00 a.m. on Friday, and we will talk with him about the campaign as well. We're back right after this short break.BARTIROMO: Time for the Morning Buzz, first up, we know drive-in movies, but how about dive-ins? A new socially distant floating movie theater set to open on Paris' Seine River. Next week, movie goers can watch films on the river in boats that seats two to six people. Michael Lee, would you watch a movie from a boat? This looks pretty cool actually.MICHAEL LEE, MICHAEL LEE STRATEGY: Yes, this looks fantastic. I think this is one of the -- one of the great ideas that's come out of this coronavirus crisis that the world is going through, that's probably here to stay. I'd love to watch a movie sitting on a river as long as I've had some bug spray.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, and as long as you're not sitting there floaty and moving, and then you get dizzy, well, there's that. All right, how about this, cheers to wining your room. Sonoma Valley Hotel trio introducing a new robot appropriately named Rosey Robot that would deliver wine to guests rooms without having to contact another person amid coronavirus. No contact.The robot also able to deliver snacks, towels and anything guests may need -- oh, Dagen, here we go, robots taking over.MCDOWELL: It's not -- well, how is this robot useful because anybody with half a head stops at the Vino Depot or the liquor store on the way to the hotel. So you already come with bottles in your suitcase --(LAUGHTER)So, I don't need anybody to deliver Vino to my hotel room.BARTIROMO: OK, but it will make your life easier, but that's the whole thing. Robots are just doing everything.MCDOWELL: Yes.BARTIROMO: The fright of what this is going to look like in 50 years --MCDOWELL: Yes --BARTIROMO: Living with robots. All right, finally this. Insider out of the list of America's favorite candies based on the decade you were born. So what was your favorite candy, from the '40s, Americans enjoyed Tootsie Rolls and M&Ms. Children of the '50s snacked on Good and Plenty and Charleston Chews. The '60s was all about fruit with Dum-Dums and Starbursts. The '70s enjoyed Reese's Cup and Pop Rocks, and the 1980s loved Reese's Pieces and Sour Patch. Steve, what's your fav?FORBES: Well, I think the candy where I grew up with was M&Ms, it melts in your mouth, not in your hands, came out of World War II.(LAUGHTER)I think that this thing is great. And by the way, my kids learned about presidents with Jelly beans. Ronald Reagan liked Jelly beans, and we used that. That was a big candy in the late '70s and early '80s to teach about American history. So candies more than an energizer can be --BARTIROMO: Love it --FORBES: Teacher as well.BARTIROMO: I'm sticking with Hershey's with Almonds, my favs. Steve, thank you, we'll be right back.Load-Date: July 8, 2020End of Document

U.S. could restrict WeChatCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 13, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 556 wordsBodyMEXICO CITY, July 13.- Amid intense scrutiny over TikTok, as a potential national security risk in the United States, the Chinese multipurpose app developed by the firm Tencent that offers free messaging and calling services, WeChat, is now also in the sight of Washington. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told the "Fox Business" portal last Sunday that "[TikTok] and WeChat are the biggest forms of censorship on the Chinese mainland, and therefore expect strong action on this." Navarro argued that "all the data found in those mobile apps that children have so much fun with and seem so convenient, go directly to servers in China, the Chinese military, the Chinese Communist party and the agencies that want to steal our intellectual property." In this regard, WeChat declined to comment on the subject. For its part, the TikTok short video application, indicated through a statement to TechCrunch media that "protecting the privacy of our users' data is a critical priority for TikTok" and that it "has never shared the data of TikTok users with the Chinese government, and would not do so if asked". According to the web portal, the biggest difference between restricting the two applications, is the demographic that will be affected, this because outside the People's Republic of China, WeChat is mainly used by Chinese dispersion and foreign companies with presence or connection in China, while TikTok is mainly used by young local users around the world. Also, while WeChat drives countless daily activities in China, from paying in a restaurant to booking a doctor's appointment, the app's feature is primarily limited to sending messages outside China as foreign competitors play their part in other respects. It is for this reason that it is unclear how the U.S. restriction will be applied, assuming that the American nation decides to do so. However, some users of the messaging app have started to consider other alternatives to WeChat, so as not to lose touch with their family and friends at home, especially in this time of pandemic. In the event that Apple App Store or Google Play removes the messenger owned by Tencent, U.S.-based users could switch to another regional store to download the app. Similarly, if it were an IP address ban, they could access the application through virtual private networks (VPNs), tools that are familiar to many in China to access online services blocked by the Grand Firewall of Beijing. VPNs are not necessarily used to combat censorship. It is not uncommon to see Chinese abroad setting up their IP address in their home country to stream programs on Chinese video platforms that are not available abroad due to licensing restrictions. The message from the White House's trade adviser came shortly after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo revealed that the U.S. government seeks to ban TikTok. TikTok has been working to distance itself from its Chinese partnership through efforts such as data storage in the United States and Singapore, as well as reviewing its corporate structure. He noted in his statement that "our U.S. head of information security has decades of security and law enforcement experience in the United States. TikTok's parent company is a private company backed by some of the best-known U.S. investors, who hold four of their five seats on the board."Load-Date: July 14, 2020End of Document

Twitter Deletes A Giant Trove Of Chinese Accounts, Many Of Which Propped Up China's COVID ResponseThe Daily CallerJune 11, 2020 Thursday 11:18 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: DAILY-CALLER-NEWS-FOUNDATION; techLength: 594 wordsByline: Chris White, Tech Reporter, chris@dailycallernewsfoundation.orgChris is a Missourian trying to find news angles in the blank spaces of life. Also go Chiefs!Author ImageBodyLink to ImageTech experts who worked with Twitter to remove 170,000 accounts tied to the Chinese government say the profiles promoted deceptive content regarding the coronavirus pandemic.The accounts were “spreading geopolitical narratives favorable to the Communist Party of China,” Twitter wrote in a blog post announcing the move, which comes as the company faces            withering criticism from the Trump administration for not doing enough to target pro-China propagandists. The company removed them for violating the platform's manipulation policies.“Narratives around Covid praise China's response to the virus while tweets also use the pandemic to antagonize the U.S. and Hong Kong activists,” an analysis of the tweets by the Stanford Internet Observatory noted, according to a CNN report Thursday on Twitter's decision.Twitter removed 23,750 accounts that compromised the core network, which were highly engaged and posted frequently, and another 150,000 accounts that were merely designed to promote the core group's content.The amplifier accounts had few followers and were “strategically designed to artificially inflate impression metrics,” Twitter noted.Israeli data firm Next Dim located two tweets from pro-China accounts with small followings that were liked and reposted hundreds of thousands of times in March, The New York Times noted in a report Monday discussing the group's findings.Link to ImageTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey testifies before the House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on Twitter REUTERS/Chris Wattie/File PhotoNext Dim's findings raise the potential that a giant crew of social media influencers intervened to help the tweets go viral, the report noted. (RELATED: Israeli Data Firm Reportedly Finds Two Mundane Tweets That Could Reveal Extent Of China's COVID Twitter Campaign)Next Dim located a March 12 tweet from user @manisha_kataki, who            posted a video of workers spraying streets in China with disinfectant and wrote: “At this rate, China will be back in action very soon, may be much faster than the world expects.”Another user with the handle @Ejiketion retweeted the post along with the video the next day, telling his Twitter followers that Westerners are meanwhile “washing our hands LOL.” The account has since been deleted, according to TheNYT. Both tweets received more than 382,000 retweets and 1.1 million likes, many of them within the first two days.Twitter's blog post Thursday did not mention the fate of one of China's largest and most prolific promoters of misinformation.China's deputy director of the Foreign Ministry's Information Department Zhao Lijian was one of the first Chinese officials on Twitter to push a theory suggesting the virus originated at a U.S. Army base that houses and researches infectious diseases. The theory accelerated after Chinese embassy accounts in France and Jordan retweeted Zhao's post, the data showed.Officials believe coronavirus, or COVID-19, originated in Wuhan, China, before spreading worldwide before reportedly killing 110,000 people in the United States. Twitter applied a fact-check label to his March tweet in May, but Zhao's account has not yet been removed.Twitter has not responded to the Daily Caller News Foundation's request for comment regarding why Zhao's account is still active.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

US targets Chinese officials for Xinjiang human rights abusesCNN WireJuly 10, 2020 Friday 9:16 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 953 wordsDateline: (CNN) Body (CNN) --  The Trump administration has taken action against Chinese officials for their involvement in human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region, where Uyghur Muslims and other minority groups have been detained and tortured.Those targeted include including Chen Quanguo, the Communist Party secretary for the region.On Thursday, the Departments of State and Treasury imposed sanctions on a number of officials, including Chen, Party Secretary of the Xinjiang Political and Legal Committee (XPLC) Zhu Hailun and the current Party Secretary of the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau (XPSB) Wang Mingshan. The move comes amid escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing. "The United States will not stand idly by as the (Chinese Communist Party) carries out human rights abuses targeting Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, and members of other minority groups in Xinjiang, to include forced labor, arbitrary mass detention, and forced population control, and attempts to erase their culture and Muslim faith," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement announcing visa restrictions against the three officials, which block them and their families from entering the US.According to the US State Department, the Chinese government has detained "more than one million Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of other Muslim minority groups" who are reportedly "subjected to torture, cruel and inhumane treatment such as physical and sexual abuse, forced labor, and death." The top US diplomat recently condemned this "brutal campaign of repression" as "a human-rights violation on a scale we have not seen since World War II."At a press conference Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said China would approve "reciprocal measures" in response to the new sanctions."The US decision is a serious interference in China's internal affairs and is a grave violation of international relations. And it is deeply detrimental to China-US relations. We reject and condemn that," Zhao told reporters.In recent months, the Trump administration has increased its aggressive rhetoric and actions towards China on all fronts, including clamping down on Chinese media entities, going after Chinese pharmaceutical and research cybertheft and accusing the Chinese government of seeking to "remake the world" in its image.Pompeo said he was "placing additional visa restrictions on other CCP officials believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, the unjust detention or abuse of Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, and members of other minority groups in Xinjiang."The US Treasury Department designated Chen, Zhu and Wang,as well as the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau and former Party Secretary Huo Liujun Thursday.Under the designations, "all property and interests in property of the entity and individuals named above, and of any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by them, individually, or with other blocked persons, that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons, are blocked and must be reported to OFAC.""The United States is committed to using the full breadth of its financial powers to hold human rights abusers accountable in Xinjiang and across the world," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.Regional experts noted that in the past the US has steered clear of going after CCP officials, making this round of sanctions significant. "The US has often stopped short of targeting Chinese Communist Party officials and in this case you are finally seeing that is being done," said Olivia Enos, an expert at the Heritage Foundation. "The guy who is responsible for the severe human rights abuse is being held to account. This is huge."Chen was the "architect" of the repressive polices pursued by Beijing in Tibet, which were then applied to the Xinjiang region and enabled "rapid internment," Enos explained.In his statement, Pompeo said that Chen -- who is also a member of the Chinese Politburo -- "oversaw extensive abuses in Tibetan areas, using many of the same horrific practices and policies CCP officials currently employ in Xinjiang." There has been wide congressional support for these sanctions on both sides of the aisle. The Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act was passed overwhelmingly in Congress and signed by the President last month."Beijing's barbarous actions targeting the Uyghur people are an outrage to the collective conscious of the world," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at the time. "This House of Representatives, in a very strong bipartisan way, we are sending a message to the persecuted that they are not forgotten. We're saying to the President of China: you may tell these people that they are forgotten, but they aren't."The Uyghur Human Rights Project praised the targeted sanctions in a statement Thursday."At last, real consequences have begun. This comes at the 11th hour for Uyghurs," said UHRP Executive Director Omer Kanat,. "A global response is long overdue. Now there is finally action by one government. Will other countries wait until it is indeed too late?"Other human rights groups are also calling on other countries to do more and target Chinese individuals in order for the sanctions to have the greatest impact. "Putting sanctions on specific Chinese officials changes their calculations, but also that of other officials who would be put in these positions of power in the future," said Maya Wang, a China senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. "And that is why it is important for these sanctions to be coordinated among other governments because that would make them more effective in the future."TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

China Denies Funerals for Soldiers Killed in India Skirmish: SourceUSNEWS.comJuly 13, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; World Report; Vol.; No.Length: 989 wordsByline: Paul D. ShinkmanHighlight: Beijing is working to hide any evidence of the violent June encounter in the Galwan River Valley, according to a U.S. intelligence assessment.BodyThe Chinese government is pressuring the families of soldiers who died in a violent border clash with India in June not to conduct burials and in-person funeral ceremonies in an attempt to cover up an episode that Beijing appears to consider a blunder, according to a U.S. intelligence assessment. [READ:Source: China Ordered Attack on Indian Troops]The Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs has told families of those who died in the Galwan Valley clash that they must forgo traditional burial ceremonies and cremate the soldiers' remains and that any funeral services should be conducted remotely, not in person, a source familiar with the assessment tells U.S. News. Though the government has used the threat posed by the spread of the coronavirus as a pretext, the assessment concludes that the new rules are a part of a deliberate effort by Beijing to undermine public awareness and erase any enduring reminders of the violent clash. The incident late in the day on June 15 -- which each claims the other initiated -- followed months of troop movements by both sides in the strategically consequential mountain region of northern India and southwest China. Outrage continues among the population in India at the offensive, which many analysts believe will force New Delhi to shift its careful balance in foreign relations toward closer alignment with the U.S. and its allies. China reportedly fears that images of gravestones for its fallen soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, or PLA, could further stoke those sentiments if spread on Chinese or international social media. "The reality is they don't want to create martyr soldiers," says the source, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive material. "So they have banned functions where friends and families can pay their respects for the PLA deceased." But concern among Chinese citizens has apparently already spread. The Guardian reported in late June, citing anonymous intelligence officials, that people using Chinese social media were sharing pictures of funeral processions for Indian troops and wondering why their countrymen didn't receive similar honors. China has encouraged the practice of cremations and no ceremonies during the pandemic for public health reasons. The intelligence assessment indicates those concerns are separate from Beijing's interest in downplaying the soldiers' deaths. The Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not immediately respond to requests for comment. China has previously exploited deadly incidents to build strong nationalistic support at home, such as the 2001 collision between a Chinese fighter jet and a U.S. spy plane near the southern Hainan Island or the accidental U.S. bombing in 1999 of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. However, the deadly clash in mid-June, in which soldiers from both sides engaged in brutal hand-to-hand combat in contested territory within the Himalayas, has largely disappeared from Chinese media and official statements. Many analysts see that silence, along with reports of the new burial rules, as an indication that Beijing did not intend for the June encounter to escalate as it did and remains concerned about the implications. [READ:Anti-China Mood Grows Across India]"If the Chinese really want to use this to forge national unity, then we would see this all over Chinese media," says Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "The Chinese are being very careful about what is reported. They would like to avoid major damage to their relationship with India. And if this becomes something that is very prominent in the Chinese media, it could take on a life of its own." The latest revelations about burials are consistent with China's ongoing policy of controlling reporting nationally about events along its border, Glaser says. China still has not confirmed how many of its soldiers died as a result of the clash, though U.S. News previously reported that American intelligence believes 35 perished, along with at least 20 among the Indian military. A spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs referenced the region where the clash took place briefly on Friday, saying only that both sides have taken "effective measures to disengage" from the contested Galwan Valley after a meeting between commanders from both sides. It remains unclear whether either China or India has indeed withdrawn troops and personnel from the strategically critical but largely inhospitable region where both have bolstered civil infrastructure such as roads. The Chinese government's latest concerns extend to the Chinese festival of Tomb Sweeping Day next April, when families visit the graves of their ancestors and loved ones to pay respect, according to the assessment. The annual holiday, known locally as the Qingming Festival, falls shortly before the Chinese Communist Party celebrates the 100th anniversary of its establishment in July. Paul Shinkman is a national security correspondent.

HUAWEI AS A RISK TO NATIONAL SECURITYCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 6, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 462 wordsBodyAn outrageous issue that the U.S. government plans to place on the agenda of Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is that of technological infrastructure, internet control and all communications in this underdeveloped country in the south. To be more specific: the unease that causes THE American authorities to dominate Huawei's Chinese dominate that sophisticated ecosystem across the region, from Carso Tower and its headquarters in Santa Fe. Yet and their Silicon Valley heroes, Americans have failed to reach the understated geniuses of Shenzhen and Shanghai.The Americans recall that a close reading of the provisions of China's National Intelligence Act shows that it is broad enough to allow the Chinese government to force Chinese companies like Huawei to assist it in its espionage activities.Section 7 of the Chinese National Intelligence Act obliges "all organizations and citizens" to "support, assist, and cooperate with national intelligence efforts in accordance with the law" and "protect national intelligence work secrets" without any apparent limitation on the type of assistance that the Chinese government may require, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) reports , by its acronym).The FCC filed a report a few days ago, concluding that Huawei poses a national security threat to the integrity of communications networks and the communications supply chain. "This conclusion is based on our finding that Huawei is highly susceptible to coertion by the Chinese government; the risks highlighted by US policymakers and the intelligence community, as well as allied nations and communications providers; and the known security risks and vulnerabilities on Huawei computers."As we have told you in this space, it is not the first time that Huawei has been singled out as a tool of the Chinese government to spy on and politically control enemies.The U.S. Department of Commerce has Huawei on its list of entities "for which there is reasonable cause to believe, based on specific and articulated facts, that the entity has been involved, is involved or presents a significant risk of being or engaging in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States".In addition, in February 2018, leaders from the six major U.S. intelligence agencies recommended avoiding the purchase of Huawei or ZTE products or services.Huawei's founder, Ren Zhengfei, belonged to the Army, his daughter is detained in Canada, arrested precisely on her scale as she came to Mexico, and the company's leaders in the region hide behind advertising campaigns that make them look like another brand of smartphones for the masses. The truth is that the eyes are on his no longer so discreet operation in Latin America.Load-Date: July 7, 2020End of Document

US Religious Freedom Ambassador Sanctioned By China Describes Beijing's Attacks On FaithThe Daily CallerJuly 30, 2020 Thursday 10:51 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc.

Chris Smith, were sanctioned by China earlier in July in response to the U.S.'s sanctions placed on Chinese officials over the treatment of religious minorities. Brownback emphasized the critical nature of the sanctions, which he describes as an aggressive response.Link to ImageA policeman stands guard in front of the Tiananmen Gate with the portrait of Mao Zedong in Beijing 24 April 2001, as police tightened security around Tiananmen Square to prevent followers of the outlawed Falungong spiritual group from protesting and possible self-immolation on the eve of the anniversary of the 25 April, 1999 demonstration. (GOH CHAI HIN/AFP via Getty Images)“We're responding aggressively, more aggressively and clearly than any other nation in the world,” he tells the Caller. “We put sanctions on politburo members, which is a very strong statement, when we sanctioned Chen Quanguo.” Quanguo is the party secretary of the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR), and has reportedly gained a reputation as an ethnic policy innovator by pioneering a range of methods for securing CCP control over ethnic minorities in the region, according to the Jamestown Foundation. Other targets of the sanctions included Xinjiang official Zhu Hailun and police boss Wang Mingshan, along with their immediate families.The Chinese government has allegedly created a high-tech surveillance state using facial recognition and artificial intelligence to monitor religious minorities, who often have to operate in underground worship groups to evade the government's strict controls, which include replacing images of Jesus Christ or the Virgin Mary with pictures of President Xi Jinping. Uighur Muslims have also been detained in more than 1,300 concentration camps in Xinjiang for wearing long beards or refusing alcohol. The camps have transitioned from reeducation to forced labor, with reports of torture and rape.All religions - including Christianity, Islam, and Tibetan Buddhism - have been targeted in government campaigns to “sinicize” China. “They're trying to either eliminate religion or co-opt it to have it run by the communist party, one of the two,” Brownback said. “They either want to do away with it or they want to run it.”Link to ImageAn ethnic Uyghur woman walks by the closed Islamic school on July 1, 2017 in the old town of Kashgar, in the far western Xinjiang province, China.

(Photo by Kevin Frayer/Getty Images)The U.S. has cracked down on Chinese government influence within the country, an effort reflected by the frequent investigations into university researchers and professors who have lied about ties with Beijing while accepting federal funding. Chinese tech companies like TikTok and Huawei have also faced scrutiny by lawmakers concerned about possible national security threats.While there were “episodic and regional” attacks on the faithful in China before President Xi Jinping, Brownback says that under his authority, the attacks have become more institutionalized. “Under Xi, it's gone national, hardline, and high tech,” he says. “I think it's a sign of weakness. The thought that in 2020 you'd have 1 million Muslims in concentration camps primarily because of their faith is unthinkable, and by a global power. And yet that's the situation we have today.”Link to ImageThis photo taken on June 2, 2019 shows buildings at the Artux City Vocational Skills Education Training Service Center, believed to be a re-education camp where mostly Muslim ethnic minorities are detained, north of Kashgar in China's northwestern Xinjiang region. (GREG BAKER/AFP via Getty Images)The human rights abuses paired with other sources of tensions - including the recent security law implemented by China in Hong Kong - has escalated the relationship between the two global superpowers“We've blocked products from certain companies, we've sanctioned tech companies. Tech was used in digital oppression, and we've responded aggressively and are building alliances to bring other nations along on the sanctioning of China for religious and human rights abuses in Xinjiang but also in Tibet and against Christians and Falun Gong members,” he adds. Brownback also hinted at the potential for much more legislation to follow on the subject, specifically targeting parts of supply chains that may depend on forced labor. More than 180 human rights groups and labor unions have called on major apparel brands to end the use of forced labor in Xinjiang, where they alleged many global brands, ranging from Nike to Victoria's Secret, have ties with suppliers implicated in forced labor. Several of the brands denied using forced labor at any point in their supply chain in statements to the Caller.

US accuses Chinese hackers in targeting of COVID-19 researchAssociated Press InternationalJuly 21, 2020 Tuesday 10:36 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; POLITICAL NEWSLength: 1075 wordsByline: ERIC TUCKER, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) — Hackers working with the Chinese government targeted firms developing vaccines for the coronavirus and stole hundreds of millions of dollars worth of intellectual property and trade secrets from companies across the world, the Justice Department said Tuesday as it announced criminal charges.The indictment does not accuse the two Chinese defendants of actually obtaining the coronavirus research, but it does underscore the extent to which scientific innovation has been a top target for foreign governments and criminal hackers looking to know what American companies are developing during the pandemic. In this case, the hackers researched vulnerabilities in the computer networks of biotech firms and diagnostic companies that were developing vaccines and testing kits and researching antiviral drugs.The charges are the latest in a series of aggressive Trump administration actions targeting China. They come as President Donald Trump, his reelection prospects damaged by the coronavirus outbreak, has blamed China for the pandemic and as administration officials have escalated their denunciations of Beijing, including over alleged efforts to steal intellectual property through hacking.The indictment includes trade secret theft and wire fraud conspiracy against the hackers, former classmates at an electrical engineering college who prosecutors say worked together for more than a decade targeting high-tech companies in more than 10 countries.The hackers, identified as Li Xiaoyu and Dong Jiazhi, stole information not only for their personal profit but also research and technology that they knew would be of value to the Chinese government, prosecutors say.In some instances, the indictment says, they provided an officer for a Chinese intelligence service with whom they worked email accounts and passwords belonging to clergymen, dissidents and pro-democracy activists who could then be targeted. The officer gave help of his own, providing malicious software after one of the hackers struggled to compromise the mail server of a Burmese human rights group.The two defendants are not in custody, and federal officials conceded Tuesday that they were not likely to step foot in an American courtroom. But the indictment carries important symbolic and deterrence value for the Justice Department, which decided that publicly calling out the behavior was more worthwhile than waiting for the unlikely scenario in which the defendants would travel to the U.S. and risk arrest.The hacking began more than 10 years ago, with targets including pharmaceutical, solar and medical device companies but also political dissidents, activists and clergy in the United States, China and Hong Kong, federal authorities said.The charges were brought as Trump administration officials, including national security adviser Robert O'Brien and Attorney General William Barr, have delivered public warnings about what they say are Chinese government efforts to use hacking to steal trade secrets for Beijing's financial benefit and to covertly influence American policy.The hacking is part of what Assistant Attorney General John Demers, the Justice Department's top national security official, described as a sweeping effort to “rob, replicate and replace" strategy for technological development.In addition, he said, “China is providing a safe haven for criminal hackers who, as in this case, are hacking in part for their own personal gain but willing to help the state — and on call to do so."The criminal charges are the first from the Justice Department accusing foreign hackers of targeting innovation related to the coronavirus, though U.S. and Western intelligence agencies have warned for months about those efforts.Last week, for instance, authorities in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom accused a hacking group with links to Russian intelligence of trying to target research on the disease, which has killed more than 140,000 people in the United States and more than 600,000 worldwide, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.The indictment describes multiple efforts by the hackers to snoop on companies engaged in coronavirus-related research, though it does not accuse them of success in any theft.Prosecutors say Li in January conducted reconnaissance on the computer network of a Massachusetts biotech firm known to be researching a potential vaccine, and searched for vulnerabilities on the network of a Maryland firm less than a week after the company said it was conducting similar scientific work.Li also probed the networks of a California diagnostics company involved in developing testing kits, and a biotech firm from the same state that was researching antiviral drugs.Hacking of vaccine information slows down research as the institution must scramble not only to fix the breach but also to ensure the data it has accumulated has not been altered, Demers said.“Once someone is in your system, they can not only take the data, they can manipulate the data," Demers said. “We do worry to that extent that there could be a slowdown in the research efforts of that particular institution.”The indictment was returned earlier this month in federal court in the Eastern District of Washington, where the hacking outlined by prosecutors was first discovered at the Department of Energy's Hanford site.“If it can occur there, we all must know that it can occur anywhere,” U.S. Attorney William Hyslop said of his district.The Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not directly respond to the indictment but pointed to remarks made last week by the Foreign Ministry spokesperson, who described China as the victim of “groundless speculations" but also a country whose scientific prowess means it does not need to “secure an edge by theft."Ben Buchanan, a Georgetown University professor and author of “The Hacker and the State,” said that though the U.S. has made clear its views on what kinds of economic espionage are permitted and not permitted, it is unclear where it draws the line on espionage related to the coronavirus or what kind of espionage the U.S. might conduct.He said he was not sure that this indictment, without other meaningful consequences, would get China to cease its activities.“The upside of spying in this way is simply too high for many governments to pass up,” Buchanan said in an email._____Associated Press writer Frank Bajak in Boston contributed to this report.Load-Date: July 21, 2020End of Document

Remarks by PDAS Chung at Trinidad & Tobago American Chamber of Commerce Annual General MeetingTargeted News ServiceJune 12, 2020 Friday 9:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2131 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad and Tobago BodyThe U.S. Embassy in Trinidad and Tobago issued the following remarks on June 11 by Julie J. Chung, principal deputy assistant secretary of Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, at Trinidad and Tobago American Chamber of Commerce annual general meeting:I want to thank you for the kind invitation to address your annual meeting. I would have preferred to be with you all in person, but the realities of COVID-19 made that impossible. I look forward to a time when I can visit.I met AMCHAM's Chief Executive Officer, Nirad Tewarie, back in February at the Atlanta meeting of the Association of American Chambers of Commerce in Latin America and the Caribbean. That was the genesis of this invitation for me to speak with you today.I would like to focus on our Growth in the Americas initiative and how it can work for Trinidad and Tobago. I would also like to lay out our priorities and concerns regarding China and Venezuela.Growth in the AmericasGrowth in the Americas is part of the U.S. government's positive economic agenda for the hemisphere. It seeks to apply the coordinated expertise of the entire U.S. government to catalyze private sector investment in energy and infrastructure.Growth in the Americas started in 2018 with a focus on increasing private investment in energy infrastructure, but now, in its expanded form, it encompasses all types of infrastructure, including airports, ports, roads, and telecom networks, among others.The urgent need to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and spur post-COVID economic recovery make the impulse behind Growth in the Americas all the more relevant. Restoring jobs and growth require creating the enabling conditions to attract private sector investment. That is after all where the most innovation, growth, and job opportunities come from.You don't need me to tell you the best way to attract private sector investment. But I would boil it down to three things: transparency, stability, and predictability.Transparency means bidding, tendering, contracting and related procurement processes that are open for the public to see. We support governments regionwide passing and implementing procurement legislation to improve transparency.Predictability means standing by the agreements made by your predecessors and having faith that your successors will honor yours. It also means consulting with business leaders like AMCHAM, before passing legislation and regulations that will impact business.Stability doesn't just mean economic stability, but bureaucratic stability too. For example, the rules should be the same for everyone to obtain necessary permits, and the process should take the same amount of time for everyone.Governments in the region are aware of the public hunger for quality public infrastructure and services procured in a transparent, efficient, and timely way, and are taking steps to meet these demands.For example, I would note the efforts by the eastern Caribbean states to work with an American company in Ohio to deploy software tools to buy medical supplies for COVID response in a quick but transparent way that tracks expenditures and provides market leverage and logistical coordination. That procurement software serves immediate needs but will also help future hurricane response and ordinary government purchases.But much more needs to be done to attract skittish investors to Trinidad and Tobago, and to the Caribbean. How often have we seen issues in the region such as: projects that do not survive a change in administration; opaque tendering processes; arbitrary taxation, and excessive Customs delays.Growth in the Americas seeks to respond to these issues by rawing on the expertise of a broad arc of our agencies.In Panama, for example, the United States Treasury Department experts helped a public utility modernize its accounting, resulting in a two-notch improvement in its bond rating that will save Panama at least $40 million in debt service costs and attract higher quality investment.It is important to point out that the Growth in the Americas initiative encompasses all of Latin America and the Caribbean. Sharing best practices through technical exchanges is one of our best tools under the initiative for high income countries such as T&T. Specific topics have included government procurement, water management, and spectrum auctions.I think many of you are aware that the new International Development Finance Corporation, or DFC for short, which took over from the old OPIC, cannot provide project financing in high income countries. That DFC limit comes from Congress.But the U.S. Export-Import Bank is available for loan guarantees and other project financing support.I would encourage AmCham T&T members to reach out to Matt Ciesielski, the economic officer at our embassy, who also sits on your board of directors, to discuss specific obstacles to investment to start the conversation on what Growth in the Americas-related activities might make the most sense in your country.I would also note that Growth in the Americas works alongside a number of other initiatives we have developed to deepen our engagement with your region. The U.S. Caribbean 2020 strategy, for example, covers a broader arc of issues - security, health, energy, education, prosperity, and diplomacy. And of course there are longer-standing programs that remain vital such as the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative, ten years running now with over $600 million in assistance toward reducing crime and trafficking in the Caribbean. As I am sure you know, T&T is the biggest beneficiary of the separate Caribbean Basin Initiative's trade preferences; more than $5 billion of your products have entered the United States duty free since 2013 under this program.China's InfluenceI am not here today to say don't do business with China. Our largest companies have global supply chains that include China. I am here to emphasize the partnership between the United States and T&T. That we are your largest trading partner shows the strength of our relationship.As neighbors and partners, we have a strong interest in the well-being and prosperity of Latin America and the Caribbean. In coordination with democratic partners, we are working to strengthen responsible governance, promote transparency, and ensure respect for human rights. Unfortunately, Chinese State-Owned Enterprises do not abide by these values that we share.I can assure you the United States has a long-cherished tradition of friendship with the Chinese people. Regrettably, the communist government in China today is not reflective of the people of China.Among our concerns are the Chinese government's approach to lending and development, and its motivations. A region hungry for infrastructure investment and short on finances finds Chinese concessional loans attractive, but the opacity of Chinese deals threatens to reverse the region's hard-won gains for transparency, the rule of law, labor rights, and the environment.One Trinidad example is the closure of the NAPA (National Academy for the Performing Arts) for more than a year in 2014 due to a litany of construction defects that raised serious health and safety concerns.As Trinidad seeks to modernize its physical, digital and energy infrastructure, it is important for both the government and private sector companies to stay alert to the dangers of debt diplomacy and a disrespect for transparency and even national sovereignty.The United States remains committed to the promotion of pro-market economies and open societies, and continues to work with our partners to uphold global best practices. We want to see a prosperous China that transacts business with the rest of the world on a fair set of reciprocal terms and allows its people to flourish.Venezuela and U.S. PolicyThe Maduro regime, according to the Venezuelan constitution, is illegitimate, period. This is not an ad hoc U.S. government policy decision. Venezuela's 2018 national election was illegitimate and left the presidency vacant. According to the Venezuelan constitution, the next in line is the president of the National Assembly. Yet the illegitimate Maduro regime has refused to abide by its own constitution and Nicolas Maduro has refused to peacefully transfer power.Instead, the Maduro regime has plundered Venezuela's wealth for private gain, impoverished its people, caused one of the largest forced displacements in recent history with now over 5 million refugees, and has been a key factor in the instability of the continent and the region. When we look at the growing number of refugees in South America and the Caribbean - including in Trinidad and Tobago- it is the Maduro regime and its continued persecution of its people and gutting of its institutions that are to blame.As important as it is to work together to assist these vulnerable people, we must also work together to help them achieve their aspirations to return to a Venezuela that's democratic, prosperous, and safe.Our goal in Venezuela is clear: the return of the National Assembly; a New Council of State that will serve as the executive branch; a new cabinet; and new presidential and national assembly elections under conditions recognized internationally as free and fair, and a gradual lifting of sanctions so that the new government will be allowed to function. Until that time, however, our sanctions remain in place, and I know the Trinbagonian business community is concerned about the reputational risk caused by sanctions.The purpose of our sanctions is to identify those entities that are providing material support to the illegitimate Maduro regime. It is critical that the Trinbagonian business community track and comply with U.S. sanctions to the full extent possible.ConclusionI wanted to close with a note on COVID-19. A year ago none of us could have predicted the stress and dislocations of the pandemic. Now we are turning to focus, in coordination with our partners, on how to restart our economies.I have been impressed with how Trinidad has been managing the crisis, balancing public health and economic concerns, and has become a leader in the Caribbean and indeed the world for its phased re-opening of the economy.Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the U.S. government has committed more than $1 billion in emergency health, humanitarian, economic, and development assistance aimed at helping governments, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations fight the pandemic. This includes nearly $112 million for the Western Hemisphere and over $21 million for the Caribbean.In addition to this direct funding from the U.S. Government, our All-of-America approach is helping people around the world through the generosity of American private businesses, non-profit groups, charitable organizations, faith-based organizations, and individuals, who have now provided more than $11 billion in donations and assistance globally, more than any other nation.Some things will change in the wake of this crisis. Countries large and small are taking a close look at their supply chains. Complex "Just in Time" global supply chains have revealed their fragility, especially when it comes to certain kinds of medical goods.The United States government is certainly looking carefully at these issues, and so is the U.S. private sector. Some companies may ultimately seek to "near shore" or "on shore" more facilities, but it is too soon to say what changes we will see. Some such supply chain adjustments may be to the benefit of our regional neighbors poised, through efforts to foster business and investment, to seize the initiative.It is precisely in such challenging times when we must hold on most tightly to our core shared values of responsible governance, transparency, and respect for democracy and human rights. These are the shared values that will enable us to restore and expand prosperity.And we will promote these values in a variety of fora, including discussions such as this one today.Seeking out private sector input and policy recommendations is something the United States government takes very seriously. This is why the United States supported the creation of the Americas Business Dialogue (ABD) following the 2012 Summit of the Americas in Colombia. The ABD coordinates private sector perspectives across the region to inform regional policy dialogues, including at the the highest-level. This input along with input from civil society help keep the Summit process focused on practical solutions.In 2021, the United States will host the Summit of the Americas, just as T&T did in 2009. I assure you as host we will work hard to take private sector perspectives into account as we lead the Summit of the Americas process.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7140751 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: June 12, 2020End of Document

US/China.- Singaporean declares himself guilty of spying on the UNITED States on China's ordersCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 25, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 477 wordsBodyMADRID, 25 (EUROPA PRESS)A Singaporean citizen has pleaded guilty on Friday to act under the direction of Chinese intelligence officials to obtain confidential information from U.S. officials, the U.S. Department of Justice has announced.Yeo Jun Wei, also named Dickson Yeo, pleaded guilty in a federal court in Washington, D.C. on the charge of acting within the United States as an "illegal foreign agent."Court documents collected by The Straits Times indicate that the defendant used his political consultancy in the United States as a front to collect information for Chinese intelligence, in an operation focused on U.S. military and government employees with security clearances on professional social networking sites.Yeo paid them to write reports that he said were intended for clients in Asia, but were actually sent to the Chinese government without their knowledge.The defendant enrolled in 2015 as a PhD student at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, where he investigated China's activity for small states along his career on the new trade route that the Asian giant is developing in Asia.The defendant was recruited in 2015 by Chinese intelligence agents during a visit to Beijing, where he made a presentation on the political situation in Southeast Asia, according to court documents.In a "statement of fact" filed in court and signed by Yeo, who admitted that he was "fully aware" that he was working for Chinese intelligence, the defendant admitted that he met with agents dozens of times and received special treatment when traveling to China."Although these operatives used pseudonyms in their interactions with Yeo, they were opened about their affiliation with the Chinese government. One of the agents told Yeo that he and his boss were working for the main intelligence unit of the People's Republic of China," according to the note.His Chinese superiors asked him to obtain private information about the U.S. Department of Commerce, artificial intelligence, and the US trade war and even ordered him to start a fake consulting firm in 2018.Yeo was arrested in November of that year when he returned to the United States on a mission to snout confidential information to a US military officer working at the Pentagon, according to the documents.The United States and China are going through a new episode this week in their long diplomatic crisis, marked by the mutual closure of consulates and, as far as the US is concerned, the arrest of four investigators accused of infiltrating the Chinese Army after lying about their military past when they entered the country.Washington confirmed on Friday the arrest of Juan Tang, the last of four alleged members of this group of investigators "who had applied for visas while hiding their true affiliation with the Army," said U.S. Deputy Attorney General John C. Demeters on Thursday.Load-Date: July 26, 2020End of Document

Industry Voices — Paolini: Protecting the US, or isolating it? The long-term effects of US policies on HuaweiFierceWirelessJune 8, 2020 Monday 3:56 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 1190 wordsByline: Monica PaoliniHighlight: The U.S.'s moves against Huawei could cause fragmentation of global standards and technology development.BodyMuch has been written about the impact that the U.S. Commerce Department sanctions announced on May 15, 2020 will have on Huawei. In the short term, they will blunt Huawei's growth for sure. But the prevailing view among media and analysts is that the sanctions will not ultimately take the company out of business.But this is not what I want to talk about here. Much less attention has been drawn to the impact of the policy on the United States. My reflections below are about the long-term implications for the U.S. market and technology, not the political underpinnings of the new policies.Huawei will not simply disappear if it cannot use U.S. components and IP. It will fight tooth and nail with the support of the Chinese government and a huge home market – it is a matter of survival and of national pride. It may take time, but Huawei will find a way to replace U.S. vendors and to further increase R&D investment to secure a broader IP footprint. Huawei already spends $8.38 billion(about 15% of revenues) on R&D, nearly twice as much as Ericsson and Nokia combined ($4.46 billion).The impact on the U.S.Huawei is the largest vendor in wireless, and China is the largest wireless market in the world. The U.S. sanctionsand Huawei and China's reactions to them will have repercussions worldwideand pose specific risks to the wireless industry in the US:The most immediate effect will be that U.S. device and infrastructure suppliers will see a decrease in sales because of being unable to sell to Huawei or its partners – notably, but not exclusively, TSMC. This is going to especially hurt chipset and components companies such as Qualcomm, Intel and Broadcom, but also smaller companies such as Finisar or Oclaro. In the long term, the emergence of technologically strong non-US suppliers may erode the U.S. leading role in the semiconductor market.RELATED:TSMC plans Arizona chip plant with U.S. officials pushing the moveBut the disruption will go beyond the semiconductor sector, especially if China decides to retaliate. It may affect companies like Apple, with 14.8% revenues from China. The Chinese may decide to buy Chinese and ditch their beloved iPhones, even if there is no outright ban on their sales.To remove or minimize dependency on the United States, Chinese vendors (and, preemptively, others too, perhaps) will step up their R&D investment to develop technologies based on domestic IP. China and other emerging countries such as India have a huge pool of well-educated engineers, software developers and other technologists who might find coming to the U.S. less attractive. Many of them may choose to remain in their countries and build a wireless industry less dependent and subservient with the support of local operators and governments. The center of gravity for technological innovation in the long term may shift away from the U.S., and protectionism will hasten the pace of this change.In addition, the U.S.'s moves against Huawei could cause fragmentation of global standards and technology development. Inclusivity and convergence to global standards has been essential to the growth of wireless technologies, even though it invariably requires hard compromises from everybody. Could Wi-Fi have become the most widely used wireless technology without a global standard and spectrum harmonization? Creating a polarized technology environment, where vendors and operators have to carefully guard who they can and cannot work with, will make it harder for them to collaborate and agree to compromise. Marginalizing China in standards bodiessuch as 3GPP would most likely create competing standards. The resulting standard fragmentation will hurt not just China and the U.S. – and not just the wireless industry.In addition, protracted and escalating economic warfare could spread beyond China and the U.S.because vendors across the globe may want to reduce their dependency on U.S. or Chinese componentsand will want to preserve access to both the Chinese and U.S. markets. If technological leadership becomes more distributed across countries, regional ecosystems may emerge. More geographic diversity will increase the competition for U.S. companies (and possibly for Chinese ones too).Openness as an alternative to protectionismInstead of shutting doors to single out individual players, opening up the wireless ecosystem to a more varied set of vendors is going to be more beneficial to the U.S. market, especially since we do not have a domestic tier-one wireless infrastructure vendor, but a rich milieu of innovative and creative companies that deserve to have their seat at the table and succeed.As wireless operators build their 5G networks, an open environment encourages a wider selection of vendors to work side by sideand promote technological innovation and increases cost efficiency. It will also strengthen the commitment of all players to global standards and to open-source platforms.This approach also puts pressure on incumbent Tier 1vendors to open to competition and reduce the dependency of operators on them. Indeed, this is one of the reasons why operators have been pushing toopen interfaces and expand the ecosystem. Under pressure from mobile operators, Tier 1vendors like Nokia and Ericsson have come to accept the challenge and participate in organizations such as the O-RAN Alliance, which is committed to the evolution towarda more open and disintegrated access network.Notably, Huawei is not a member of the O-RAN Alliance and refrains from participating in some open source and ecosystem-wide initiatives. This may do more harm to the company in the long term: it may lose acceptance as a result of market forces that can be more difficult to bypass than policies.Transparency and securityWith more players and more open interfaces, and transparency built in the networks, it will be not only easier, but necessary, for all to stay vigilant about each other. This will make it possible to expose – and harder to conceal – security, privacy and safety breaches.Network disaggregation, distributed architectures, virtualization and, more generally, open interfaces are far more effective at ensuring fair competition, security and performance excellence in our networks than bans and trade barriers. A global open ecosystem allows us to retain the technological leadership we have built using talent from all over the world. We should be pushing the technology boundaries forward, not backward.Monica Paolini, PhD, is the founder and principal of Senza Fili.

War between Britain and Huawei: Chinese giant threatens to leave kingdom without cell phones or electricityCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 7, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 934 wordsBodyHuawei,the Chinese technology company that intends to build the 5G network in Britain, is going to be abandoned by Boris Johnson's government, under the excuse of US sanctions and security issues in the island's most sensitive structure. But the real reason is his revenge for Chinese security law on his former Hong Kong colony, to break dissent against his hegemony, against which England has few instruments to stop it.Faced with British pressure, China is threatening the kingdom with a reality: it can leave it without cell phones and without electricity because of the degree of penetration in recent years into British infrastructure projects, including their nuclear production.If Britain removes Huawei's equipment from Britain's 5G infrastructure, it can create serious problems for the 4G network of cell phones, plus signal outages, which can cost the industry up to 2 billion pounds, according to industry experts."This is highly frustrating for operators," said James Bardford, the director of Enders Analys.According to him, telephone operators have already started discussions with Huawei's competitors. But the problem is that most British networks are building their 5G above the 4G infrastructure, which they already have in operations. That means they will be forced to remove the 4G and 5G equipment if the government decides to cancel the incorporation of Huawei. A move that will increase your costs.For analysts, the problem is that in the process there will be periods when 4G does not work. "If this threat of eliminating 5G is carried out, there will be serious disruptions in 4G, beyond a slow 5G launch in the country," they warn.Vodafone had warned the British government that the kingdom's leadership in 5G would be lost if companies were forced to spend time and money replacing equipment. BT and Vodafone would have ordered until 2030 to remove Huawei equipment from their G5 network now.Boris Johnson's government is preparing to publish a review of its decision and the impact that economic sanctions on Huawei are going to have, forcing the Chinese company to abandon the project before Christmas. Last January, Johnson had authorized it, against the opinion of several MPs of her own party and former heads of the British intelligence services.Now GCHQ, the world's largest listening centre in Britain, is going to revise its initial conclusions that the risk posed by Chinese technology could easily be managed.Huawei is posting daily notices in British newspapers reporting that it is a "friend" of its users and is just a Chinese company, separate from the government and its intelligence services.But the United States, a British transatlantic ally, argues that Huawei has "very close ties to the Chinese government and its military apparatus." Huawei replied that this decision was based on "an insinuation and a mistaken assumption.""This is an open market but I don't want to see our critical national infrastructure at risk of being controlled by a potentially hostile state," Prime Minister Johnson said. "Then we have to think carefully as we proceed now, " he argued.At least 60 Conservative MPs from the British House of Commons want to impose limits on Huawei's kit. They believe that extending that period to 2029 "is inconceivable."Sensitive nuclear projectsBut MPs have another big concern: it's the British exhibitionChina in its nuclear power and its link to electricity production at nuclear power plants in Britain. For them, China has gone too far in its relationship in technology to the kingdom. The China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN), a state-owned energy company, has invested 3.8 million pounds in Britain, primarily at the Hinkley Point plant, which is under construction in Somerset.During Theresa May's rule, she was concerned about CGN's 33.5 percent stake in the project. The same company is seeking approval to build its own nuclear reactor at Bradwell in Essex.There are other Chinese companies with interests in the British energy system: China Huaneng Group is another state-owned company, which is building a giant battery factory in Wilshire and owns the Intergen operating plant. In the North Sea, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation has operations in the most important oil and gas fields.Sir Ian Duncan, a former British Army intelligence officer and former partisan leader, said he supported a "zero-turn campaign" by British companies in Britain's critical energy infrastructure. He admitted that the government is "faced with a dilemma" of accepting Chinese technology and money."China is now not a diplomatic country with tolerance and fair play or responsible sense of justice. They are an unreasonable government, infernally inclined towards domination," Sir Ian said.Christopher Steel, a former MI6 chief in Moscow who discovered the link between Russia and Donald Trump in the US election campaign, now denounces china's seeking to seduce the most important British political elite: from Lord Michael Heseltine, former vice premier Tory to Tony Blair, a former prime minister. They called them "useful idiots" or "potential full-time agents."In its defense, Huawei argues that they are an independent company, with its employees as owners and without interference from the Chinese state.The kingdom's security is at stake at this hour,after China and Britain signed an agreement in 2016. They have now invested 3.6 billion pounds in the British economy and have 100 engineers and technical experts working at Hinckley Point C to build the first of two EPR operational reactors in the world.London, correspondentLoad-Date: July 8, 2020End of Document

Continue reading Chinese users saw Zoom as a window through the  Great Firewall Zoom Video Communications has gained a following in China in recent months from users ranging from underground churches to feminists who saw it as a rare way to connect with the world beyond      the reach of state censors.KEY POINTS:Zoom has surged in popularity in China, as a way of users being able to communicate freely without Communist Party censors interferenceZoom s mobile app has been downloaded 5.4 million times from Apple s China store since the beginning of the yearThe Chinese government heavily regulates the internet, in a system widely dubbed the Great FirewallHowever, some see moves by the company to suspend users based on subject matter as the closing of that windowOn Friday, the company said it had suspended accounts of three US and Hong Kong activists at Beijing s request after they had tried to commemorate the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square      crackdown, but that they had since been reactivated. The US company also said it was developing technology to enable it to remove or block participants based on geography.The Chinese government heavily regulates the internet, in a system widely dubbed the Great Firewall, saying this is needed to maintain social stability. All Chinese social media platforms are      required to censor public posts deemed illegal. For us, the biggest challenge has been how to reach people within China because of the firewall, and Zoom for a while looked like a ray of hope,  said US-based Humanitarian China founder Zhou      Fengsuo, whose account was suspended.The conferencing tool, originally designed for business use, saw Chinese user numbers surge in tandem with its global popularity amid the global coronavirus pandemic, a rare feat given how      Western peers such as WhatsApp, Google Meet and Facebook are blocked in China s cyberspace. This is some 11 times the number over the same period in 2019, according to research firm      SensorTower.While most Chinese users turn to Zoom for conference calls and casual chats, some have seized the chance to discuss potentially sensitive topics, from patriotism to feminism.Some state-approved and underground churches use Zoom to hold services. Zoom is not the only software, but we feel it s rather more accessible,  said Xiao Meili, a feminist activist who held a Zoom talk in April on the #MeToo movement. Before, some friends recommended Tencent conference   but everyone would feel like you shouldn t say anything that s slightly sensitive,  she said, referring to a tool offered by the Chinese      tech giant behind WeChat.INSIDE THE FIREWALLIn March, Youth Lectures kicked off a series of Zoom talks, the first of which was led by Chinese University of Hong Kong professor Chow Po Chung, on freedom of speech in China. Chow s mainland      China account on the Twitter-like platform Weibo has been deleted multiple times.Other anonymous groups hosted lectures from a #MeToo activist and a gender-activist on their work in mid-May.New York-based Lu Pin, whose influential Feminist Voices accounts on Weibo and WeChat were shut by authorities in 2018, said Zoom was a way to connect a Chinese audience to the outside world. You don t have to climb the firewall, people in China and outside of China both can connect to it,  she said.There are few alternatives, she said. This is not a multiple-choice question. If you re a Chinese person, if you don t use this, what will you use? Zoom s China users had already been subject to new constraints since last month when the company announced that free users would no longer be able host meetings, and new registrations were      limited to some enterprises.See Campaign:https://www.platformexecutive.com/product/weibo-profile-and-strategic-swot-analysis/Contact Information:Tony Munroe and Pravin CharTags:, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: August 27, 2020End of Document

U.S. orders closure of China consulate in HoustonCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 22, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 822 wordsBodyThe United States ordered the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston, which it accuses of being the "heart" of an espionage network, a decision known amid rising tensions between the two powers. The measure was announced Wednesday by the Chinese government, which considered it a "provocation" and threatened "retaliation," a harbinger of an even further deterioration of relations between the two powers, confronted by hong Kong's controversial security law, accusations of espionage, or the situation of the Uighur minority in northwest China, among other differences.The State Department upheld the decision and said the decision was taken "in order to protect American intellectual property and americans' private information." "The Vienna Convention says that state diplomats must 'respect the laws and rules of the host country' and 'have a duty not to interfere in the internal affairs of that state,'" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement. American diplomacy added that, in the past, the communist regime had conducted "massive espionage" in the United States and interfered in domestic politics, put pressure on economic leaders, and "threatened Sino-American families residing in China." Over the course of a visit to Denmark, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave no details, but reiterated his accusations of Chinese theft of European and American intellectual property, which he said is costing "hundreds of thousands of jobs." Pompeo mentioned the case of Chinese hackers who were allegedly charged in the United States on the eve for attempting to steal data on the development of COVID-19 vaccines and breach the systems of hundreds of Western companies. "President Trump has said 'enough'," insisted Pompeo, who threatened new sanctions for every instance that Beijing does not "behave" according to Washington's wishes."We are setting clear expectations of how the Chinese Communist Party should behave. And if it doesn't, we're going to act to protect the American people, our national security, and our economy and jobs," he said. "The actions you are seeing have been taken by President Trump and we will remain committed to this." An adviser to President Donald Trump, Kellyanne Conway, said he is not happy with the way he handles the coronavirus pandemic, so the closure of the consulate is a message about it. "I think the president has made it very clear that he is not happy with China. (By) the fact that China's virus has arrived in the country and spread across the world with very little information, and honestly, with little transparency on China's part," Conway said, according to a reuters report. "We still do not receive information from China. We don't know the numbers of cases, deaths, etc.," he added. Several Houston media outlets reported that firefighters went to the consulate Tuesday night because there would be documents burning in the building. Local police confirmed on Twitter that smoke was seen but that relief teams "are not allowed to enter the consulate compound." Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said the mission was operating normally and declined to comment on press reports.China has five consulates in the United States. Houston's, Texas, was the first opened in 1979, the year of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. It has 900,000 Chinese citizens registered in its records. Closure "is a political provocation (...) that severely violates international law," said a spokesman for Chinese diplomacy, Wang Wenbin. "China condemns thisoutrageous and unjustified decision," the spokesman added, threatening Washington with "retaliation." In addition to an embassy in Beijing, the United States has five consulates in mainland China and one representation in Hong Kong. The Global Times, the Nationalist Chinese newspaper, on Wednesday published a Twitter poll to ask foreign netizens to choose which U.S. consulate to close in retaliation Although it appears to be unrelated, the decision to close the Houston consulate comes after the indictment in the United States of two Chinese accused of computer attacks on companies working on looking for a vaccine against the new coronavirus. The US Secretary of Justice on Tuesday announced the indictment of Li Xiaoyu, 34, and Dong Jiazhi, 33, "two Chinese hackers working with the Chinese Minister of State Security." However, they were not arrested and are initially in China. Beijing rejected these accusations. "The Chinese government is a fervent advocate of cybersecurity and always opposed cyberattacks," said Chinese diplomacy spokesman Wang Wenbin, who called on the United States to "immediately cease its slander and defamation." In full tension with Washington, China also warned its students in the United States on Wednesday, more than 300,000, of the risk of "arbitrary interrogations" by US police.

Tik Tok wants to stand out from ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 27, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 623 wordsBodyThe TikTok platform, which is popular among American teenagers, is increasingly under scrutiny by U.S. regulators and lawmakers, who fear that users' personal information will fall into the hands of the Chinese government. The owner of the application, ByteDance, has repeatedly denied the allegations against TikTok about alleged collection of user information for the Asian giant's authorities.For its part, the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs unanimously approved an initiative on July 22 to prohibit the use of the TikTok social network application on government-owned devices. In the midst of this situation, the implementation has taken six steps that seem to show its commitment to the United States and show its operational independence from its Chinese owner and the Government of the Asian country, according to Fortune magazine.By the beginning of 2020, TikTok had 500 full-time employees in the U.S., a figure that has already reached 1,400 people. On Tuesday, the video hosting service has announced that it plans to hire 10,000 new employees in the U.S. in well-paid positions for a three-year term, according to CNBC. In addition to creating new jobs, TikTok also hires lobbyists to act on his behalf in Washington and persuade lawmakers that he is committed to U.S. regulations and is not connected to the Chinese government. According to The New York Times, this year the company has already hired more than 35 of them.In addition, last March TikTok announced the creation of a transparency center in its Los Angeles office to "provide outside experts with the opportunity to see directly how TikTok teams do challenging but critically important work to moderate content on the platform." TikTok was criticized last year for censoring content that is politically sensitive to the Chinese government, something that denies video hosting. In November, TikTok blocked the account of a U.S. user who criticized the Chinese government for its policies on Uighur ethnicity, according to The Verge. The user was unlocked and the company said that "an error of human moderation" caused the removal of the video.The company has also worked hard to locate its business in the U.S. and has hired Kevin Mayer, who was the head of Direct-to-Consumer &International;, a business division of Walt Disney, as CEO of TikTok. "TikTok is led by an American CHIEF Executive Officer, with hundreds of employees and key leaders in security, protection, products and public policy in the United States," a company spokesman told CNBC this month.After the Chinese government enacted a controversial national security law in Hong Kong, Google, Facebook, Twitter and other networks announced that they were curbing some operations in the region while they were reviewing the law. For his part, TikTok announced on 6 July that "in the light of recent events", he was completely withdrawing from the territory of Hong Kong. Some analysts argue that the decision to withdraw from Hong Kong was a direct response to the law and an effort by TikTok to draw distances from Beijing,although the company did not name the controversial law as the reason for its actions.Some US-based ByteDance investors are in talks with ByteDance's administration in China to buy a majority stake in TikTok, The Information reported Tuesday. This potential sale would make TikTok a majority owned by U.S. shareholders rather than Beijing-based ByteDance. In this way, the company could possibly convince U.S. lawmakers that a total ban on TikTok is not necessary in the country.(With information from the international news agency Sputnik)The entry Tik Tok is wanted to be unchecked from China was first published in Diario La República.Load-Date: July 28, 2020End of Document

Ecuador defends biosecurity measures in shipments to China after covid findCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 12, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 290 wordsBodyEcuador on Sunday defended biosecurity protocols in its export products, after China reported detecting traces of coronavirus in shrimp containers of Ecuadorian origin."We support our shrimp exporters with Chinese government-recognized safety and biosecurity protocols," Ecuadorian representative Lenín Moreno posted on his Twitter account.China said Friday that it discovered traces of coronavirus in shrimp containers from Ecuador.Moreno added that he sent a letter to President Xi Jinping "to find joint solutions, normalize the situation and maintain our international prestige in that market."In the Chinese ports of Dalian and Xiamen, the Customs Administration tested samples of a container and packages of white Pacific shrimp that tested the new coronavirus positive."The finding does not constitute a risk of contagion," the Ecuadorian government replied in a statement, noting that "Ecuadorian export products, and in particular those in the food segment, comply with all biosecurity protocols, both national regulation and international standards."For this reason "shipments from our country to different markets around the world have been maintained, even during the global pandemic," he added.Ecuador is one of the most hit Latin American countries with 67,870 cases, including 5,047 deaths. Authorities also report 3,292 likely deaths from the virus.According to the Ecuadorian government, "China Customs notification does not constitute a sanction on the country, nor to Ecuadorian shrimp in particular."According to figures from the Central Bank of Ecuador, China is the third largest trading partner in the South American country with $1,494 million in exports in 2018, behind the United States and the European Union.dsl/mlsLoad-Date: July 13, 2020End of Document

Continue reading TikTok pulls out of Hong Kong due to new security lawPompeo says US  certainly looking at  banning TikTokTikTok says it will stop offering its social video app in Hong Kong after the region adopted a new national security law granting expanded powers to the mainland Chinese government.  In light      of recent events, we ve decided to stop operations of the TikTok app in Hong Kong,  a spokesperson tells Axios.Global tech companies operating in Hong Kong have expressed concern that the new law could force them to comply with China s draconian censorship standards and possibly send user data to the      mainland. Google, Facebook, and Twitter have already stopped processing requests for user data from the Hong Kong government.RELATEDChina s new national security law and what it means for Hong Kong s future, explainedTikTok is owned by ByteDance, a major Chinese internet company. But it has been at pains to differentiate the Western app from its parent and Douyin, the Chinese version of the platform. While      TikTok has long argued that it never shares data with the Chinese government, the new Hong Kong law would likely have undermined the company s case if it continued to operate in the region.TikTok continues to face scrutiny in the US and beyond. Tonight, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox that the government is  certainly looking at  banning TikTok and various other Chinese      social media apps. TikTok was also banned in India last week alongside dozens of other Chinese apps amid increased tensions between the countries.See Campaign:https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/6/21314900/google-facebook-twitter-hong-kong-government-data-chinaContact Information:Sam ByfordTags:, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: August 13, 2020End of Document

The Shanghai composite is up better than 3 percent overnight.Joining the conversation this morning, Dagen McDowell, Lee Carter and Steve Forbes.Great to see everybody this morning.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Great to see you.STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Good to be here.LEE CARTER, POLLSTER AND PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS: Good to see you.BARTIROMO: And some of the top stories that we are watching this morning.The Trump administration and Congress set to start negotiations today on a fourth coronavirus stimulus bill to help struggling Americans and businesses. This relief package being debated today.President Trump's chief of staff, Mark Meadows, telling me on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" yesterday Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy will all be meeting at the White House today.The Trump administration reportedly opposes a Senate GOP proposal to spend billions of dollars for state run testing and tracing.Meanwhile, the number of Covid-19 cases is soaring in parts of the country.Today talks get underway as President Trump says he would consider not signing the relief measure unless it includes a payroll tax cut.The search for a killer is underway this morning after a federal judge's son is shot and killed and her husband left in critical condition inside of their New Jersey home.

At least 12 police officers are hurt at riots hit the city and protesters throw rocks and bottles at officers. One of those officers is now in the hospital. Two others have been -- two people so far have been arrested.The peaceful protests quickly turned violent as rioters took to the streets, breaking windows of this Amazon store and looting other businesses. The group also vandalized a police precinct. Police say rioters threw a device into the precinct's lobby, igniting a small fire. It was quickly extinguished and no injuries were reported.Yesterday, Florida logged more than 10,000 coronavirus cases. That made it a fifth day in the row -- in a row for the sunshine state.

The country's acting health minister citing the recent spike in coronavirus cases for that decision.Top NFL players including Patrick Mahomes, Drew Brees and JJ Watts criticizing the league on social media for its Covid-19 protocols with training camp due to start soon. Mahomes tweeting, getting ready to report this week hoping the NFL will come to agreement with the safe and right protocols so we can feel protected playing the sport we love. Hash tag we want to play.And Drew Brees says this, we need football. We need sports. We need hope. The NFL's unwillingness to follow the recommendations of their own medical experts will prevent that. If the NFL does not do their part to keep players healthy, there is no football in 2020. It's that simple. Get it done, NFL, writes Drew Brees.All right, time for the "Word on Wall Street." At look at what top market experts are watching this morning related to your money. We're keeping a close eye on earnings, of course, and a new round of coronavirus stimulus.Joining me right now is Mayflower Advisors Managing Partner Larry Glazer, along with Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Senior Vice President of Investments Jim Lacamp and Lebenthal Global Advisors President Dominick Tavella.Great to see everybody. Thanks so much for being here, gentlemen.DOMINICK TAVELLA, PRESIDENT, LEBENTHAL GLOBAL ADVISORS: Good morning.JIM LACAMP, SVP, MORGAN STANLEY WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Thanks for having us.LARRY GLAZER, MANAGING PARTNER, MAYFLOWER ADVISORS: Good morning.BARTIROMO: Jim, let me kick it off with you.Futures right now are mixed ahead of a big debate on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers are getting back to work today. They're going to be working on a fourth round of Covid stimulus. A lot of ideas on the table. What is your expectation in terms of the impact on markets?LACAMP: The impact is going to be huge. And the stimulus discussions are going to be extremely important, Maria, because of how you're going to do this. There's a lot of people that don't like the way we did it the last time because it paid people more not to go to work and a lot of employers said, I can't get them back in the -- in the office. So how they do this is going to be very important.And beyond that, investors are going to have to look at some major things going on here, inflection points. And I think we're going to see some backing and filling here, not -- and investors are OK with getting nickeled and dimed, they just don't want to be drawn and quartered.But I don't think that's going to happen here. We do have a calendar issue. At the end of July, through the early October, it's historically a very tough time in the markets, particularly in election years. Election issues are going to loom large. Are we going to see a corporate tax hike? Are we going to see a capital gains rate tax hike? All of these things that will be discussed are in the election. That's really important too.I mentioned the stimulus. So we have some issues right in front of us, not to mention the fact that the disease seems to still not be ameliorating here. It seems to be getting worse. And you've got a lot of states that are now making decisions, are we going to shut back down.BARTIROMO: Yes.LACAMP: Therefore, the green shoots that we've seen in this economy may prove to be ephemeral, they may be an apparition and investors are going to have to ride through this over the next few months. The markets look OK, though. I -- I think we might be combatting (ph) the bill (ph).BARTIROMO: Well, have investors -- have investors started to focus -- have investors started to focus on the possibility that policies could change? You know, you just mentioned that taxes are going to go higher. They will go higher should Joe Biden become president. He has already promised that.LACAMP: Right.BARTIROMO: Do you think markets have reacted to that yet or will we see that if people start to believe that he, in fact, will win?LACAMP: I think the issue for the markets, Maria, is they -- is they have factored the fact in that they expect a full economic recovery. In other words, we built it, now we're expecting the economy to come. But with the disease doing what it's doing, it might not be coming.BARTIROMO: Yes.LACAMP: The investors seem to be OK that the Fed is going to continue the stimulus. That's a positive.BARTIROMO: Yes, no, I'm talking about the election. I'm talking -- I'm talking about the election.LACAMP: Yes. Yes.BARTIROMO: Right now I'm talking about the election. I understand what you're saying in terms of the coronavirus.LACAMP: I think it's too early for the market to be --BARTIROMO: OK.LACAMP: Yes, I think it's too early for the markets to be reacting to the election --BARTIROMO: That's the bottom line, you think it's too early to react to --LACAMP: A week is a really long time in economic terms, in political terms.BARTIROMO: OK.Earnings season is rolling on. We know that.LACAMP: Pardon me.BARTIROMO: We're in the middle of earnings season.LACAMP: Right.BARTIROMO: You've got Dow components, eight Dow components reporting earnings this week, along with heavy-hitters like Tesla, Biogen, Twitter. We will also get airlines like United, American and Southwest.Larry, access the situation for us. What are you watching and expecting in terms of the earnings story?GLAZER: Sure, Maria.Look, we know it's going to be the worst earnings season in 12 years, but don't let the dog days of summer distract investors from opportunities in the second half of the year. You know, baseball's back, so we call it the Yogi Berra kind of market, where if you see a fork in the road, you take it.And what that fork really means is a rotation that we saw last week out of some of the big growth names into some of the value names. We saw Amazon underperforming. We saw Netflix underperforming. But we saw value names starting to come back.And this morning you see it with Chevron buying Noble. Energy earnings are a disaster and that where the opportunities are. So for earnings season, of course you're going to get through IBM, you're going to get through Microsoft, you're going to get through Intel, all of which should be all the focus for investors, not Covid, not the noise in Washington. We've got to see what happens after earnings season. A third of these companies won't even give you guidance because this earnings season is a pass. But use that opportunity for investors to move into some of the value names, like financials that reported last week where the earnings weren't quite as bad as people thought.BARTIROMO: Yes.GLAZER: And that's where the value is. And it's an exciting second half of the year, but it's going to look totally different than the first half of the year, Maria.BARTIROMO: So -- so do you want to do that through specific names or through ETFs?GLAZER: You know, Maria, there's a lot of opportunities here in sectors within the market. And, look, the Fed's not going away any time soon. Look, we've got a stimulus package in Washington. We know that income is going to be very hard to find. So it's a yield desert.BARTIROMO: Right.GLAZER: Rising growth -- rising growth of dividends. So VIG is one way to play that. VCIT.BARTIROMO: OK.GLAZER: Maria, you talk about taxes. Municipal bond ETFs like MUV. Taxes are going up, so we want to have tax shelters anywhere we can get them because taxes are going to be a problem and it is going to be a focus for investors in the second half of the year.BARTIROMO: Yes.GLAZER: Shelter yourself from taxes, Maria.BARTIROMO: All right.So we're also waiting for this round four of the coronavirus stimulus package. But investors are also bracing for the possibility of a Biden presidency. One major point of contention is his plan to raise corporate taxes.Dominick Tavella, weigh in here. What does a Joe Biden presidency look like? We just heard that, you know, we haven't really seen a focus yet on the market -- for the markets. Are investors looking at the election and trying to navigate it now 106 days away or it's too soon, as Jim told us?TAVELLA: It's -- it's just starting, Maria. We're literally just starting to get questions on the subject. Clients are calling up. But there would be a dramatic effect on these markets. We saw what happened when we had the corporate tax cut. We could literally price into the market if -- if x amount of dollars were cut in taxes, earnings would go up by x too and we literally could price that into earnings -- future earnings of the S&P 500 and we watched the S&P explode to the upside.If they cut -- raise corporate taxes, this is not hard math. Corporate earnings are going to come down. Net profits are going to come down for the S&P 500 and you cannot possibly have a significant increase in the S&P 500 next year like most investors are expecting.Throw into that regulation, financial regulations, environmental regulations and you could have a significant comeback in GDP going forward. So this is significant and investors are just starting to price this into the model.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll have to keep watching that.Gentlemen, thank you so much, Larry Glazer, Jim Lacamp, and Dominick Tavella. Great conversation, gentlemen. We so appreciate it.We'll slip in a break.When we come back, coming up later this hour, don't miss it, we've got a big show coming up, former senior advisor to the Clintons, Mark Penn, on the race for the White House.Plus, his expectations for the Durham report. The Durham investigation may very well yield indictments sooner rather than later.Then at 8:00 a.m. Eastern, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee on schools reopening.And the Council of Economic Advisors Acting Chairman Tyler Goodspeed here as stimulus talks kick off with Congress back in session today.Plus, it is Insta-Star week. We are going to be talking to one top influencer this morning about her brand and how she's exposing the world to some of the most outrageous behavior on airplanes. Don't miss it.Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.The debate over going back to school heating up this week. President Trump ordering state and local leaders to reopen schools or risk losing federal funding. On "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES," White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows weighed in on how to open schools safely this fall.Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARK MEADOWS, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF You'll see some new initiatives coming out this week as the president is not only leading but will continue to lead and step up in a number of fronts.One of those that you mentioned just earlier, Maria, is about our schools. How are we going to open our schools and make sure that moms and dads don't have to worry about the safety of our children that are going back to schools? And so there will be over $70 billion that this president has already authorized to work with Congress, to try to make sure that we not only keep the classrooms safe, but the teachers safe and the students safe.BARTIROMO: Right.MEADOWS: And you'll see a very broad five to six points in terms of what we will be doing in terms of making sure that our schools are safe.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Big issue here, Lee Carter. Obviously that money was already earmarked for schools. The president wants these schools to open before committing any additional funding.Your reaction?CARTER: So I think that one of the defining issues of this election is going to be which candidate makes people feel the most safe. The issue of school safety and kids going back to school is one of primary concern to parents. Two in three parents are concerned about their kids going back to school.The issue I think both candidates have right now, while the president and Joe Biden, who also issued his plan last week, is that it's really lean on details. It's great to say that we want kids to go back to school in practice. We've got to talk about what that looks like. What are the social distance requirements? What are the classroom sizes? What are the number of teachers that we need per student? What are the changes going to be? Are we going to alternate days?The truth of the matter is, there are a huge number of Americans who need schools to be open because they provide child care and because they provide meals for our children. And so if we can make that a priority for those people who need it the most, I think it's going to be really important.The big difference between the president and Joe Biden's plan is the president is pushing the states to make decisions, what's right for them, and I think that's the right thing to do because this virus is impacting different states differently at different times right now and so we're going to have to look at this at a the local level.Joe Biden is trying to say that, let's put the same parameters across the whole country. But, again, very, very lean on details. And I think that's going to be a big issue because what are we really talking about. When it comes to the safety of our children, you want to know exactly what it is that they're recommending.BARTIROMO: Of course. Absolutely.Dagen, what do you think?MCDOWELL: Here are the details. More science in favor of reopening schools. As "The New York Post" editorial board reports today, the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine are the latest to issue a report calling for in-person instruction. This follows up on the American Academy of Pediatrics doing the same thing.Let's talk about the long-term, devastating impact on younger children who are not interacting with one another and particularly special needs children where online education just simply doesn't do the same work for them.One more thing, and I will point -- which "The Wall Street Journal" wrote about a few days ago, that without -- when you try to open an economy without child care and without schooling, you are basically setting back women in this nation for a generation because they will have to stay at home to take care of their children and ultimately leave the workforce.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: There's one quote that says it is a recipe for a generational wipe-out of women's careers.BARTIROMO: Wow. Yes. It's true. It's all connected.All right, we'll keep talking about this important issue.Coming up, protecting American history. More protests erupting over the weekend and the Christopher Columbus statue was vandalized in Chicago. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy vowing to take action. He's working on a bill on that. We've got the details.And then Kanye West giving two of his brand partner's ultimatums. What he said during his first campaign event coming up.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.The Christopher Columbus statue in Chicago's Grant Park was vandalized over the weekend. This as violent clashes erupted between protesters and police resulting in several police injuries.House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy telling me on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" yesterday he's put forward a bill that will protect statues and monuments moving forward.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: What is your responsibility, as the leader of the GOP, to get law and order back in place in this country?REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Well, every American should be scared right now because what you just showed the country was Joe Biden said, yes, he is for defunding the police. You've got Congresswoman Omar who wants to dismantle America. Then you've got Nancy Pelosi who's allowing them to destroy America from statues and on.We have a responsibility for rule and law and for justice. And what we're watching the Democrats doing, watch what Nancy Pelosi just said the other day. She thinks what's happening is -- in Portland is a graffiti problem. No, it's a mob problem that is overrunning. You have people across this nation scared to death. You have young children being murdered because of what they're doing to the police department.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCCARTHY: This is wrong. I introduced a bill --BARTIROMO: So your bill -- your bill does what?MCCARTHY: When law --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCCARTHY: Our bill will withholds federal grants for cities that do not uphold and protect the statues because the cities have the responsibility for law and order, not to leave these precincts, not to allow the mobs to rule our communities.BARTIROMO: OK. Well yes.MCCARTHY: We have to stand up to this.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Judge Andrew Napolitano.Judge, it's great to see you.Your thoughts on this proposal?JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:Well, you know, Congress gives away a lot of money and always attaches strings to the money and the Supreme Court has said to the cities and states that receive the money, if you want the money, you accept the strings, as long as the strings are rationally related to the purpose of the money. So if I think Congressman McCarthy, in that correct -- in that respect is correct. If Congress is going to give x million dollars to the Portland Police Department, the strings are they have to enforce basic law.BARTIROMO: Yes.NAPOLITANO: I have argued that the police have a moral and legal obligation to enforce the law, even when the politicians tell them not to. But that's not the case in Portland. In Portland when the mayor says don't enforce the law, the law does not get enforced.So Kevin McCarthy is doing what he can given the limited federal role in local law enforcement.BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, these statues are property, right? I mean what types of charges are the vandals facing at this point if they are caught and prosecuted?NAPOLITANO: Well, if it's owned by the federal government, of course Congressman McCarthy is talking about a property that's not owned by the feds. If it's owned by the feds, believe it or not, it's 10 years in jail for defacing federal property, whether you deface a building or whether you deface a statue. I don't know what the penalty is for doing this in Oregon.But think about it, it is the destruction of property paid for and owned by the taxpayers. And it's going to require a lot of money to repair. So the least that is imposed on the defendant is the cost of repair. And there's almost always incarceration. And when it's done in a group, meaning there was some planning, plotting, collective effort to do that, the group, when convicted, goes to jail as well.But these -- these rules are applied differently throughout the country, Maria. In some places like Portland, where the political figures actually derive political support from the people that are doing the rioting and their supporters, they don't want to enforce the law.BARTIROMO: Yes.NAPOLITANO: They want to let these people get away with this stuff. So the feds are doing what they can.BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly.All right, Judge, thank you for your insights, as always. Great to see you, sir.Judge Napolitano joining us there.A quick break and then coming up, 2020 in focus. We are now just over 100 days away from the election. New Fox News polls this morning show the race is narrowing in key areas. We're going to zero in when we come back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Monday, July 20th. A look at the markets right now, 7:31 a.m. on the East Coast.Congress returns to Washington today with just two weeks to make a deal on a fourth round of coronavirus relief. Futures are searching for direction this morning. There are important meetings happening at the White House about the next relief package.Dow futures down 27 points this morning. The Nasdaq is up 25, and the S&P 500 is down 5 points. Investors also eyeing results from a key vaccine study today. That may very well be a market mover as well.Last week the Dow, the S&P 500 were up for a third week in a row, but the Nasdaq snapped a two-week winning streak last week and traded down on the week as you can see.Global markets this morning are mixed. Take a look at European indices as we keep a close eye on the European Union as the debate over a coronavirus recovery package there goes into day four. The FT 100 down 37, the CAC quarante down 2, the DAX index in Germany is higher, it is up 62 points right now, about one half of 1 percent.In Asia overnight markets were mixed there was well, although China continues this massive rally underway. Stocks in China rising after regulators raise the cap on how much insurers can invest in equities. They are doing everything they can to get a long-standing rally in stocks in China.

I am not on the board at GAP. And that has to change today or I walk away.(END VIDEO CLIP)DEANGELIS: All right, West, who officially launched his bid for the presidency last week, signed a 10 year deal with GAP just last month.

New Fox News polls this morning show that Joe Biden is still ahead of President Trump but by a smaller margin than a month ago. Additionally, President Trump holds a five point lead among men in the United States, while Biden holds a 19 point lead among women.Joining us right now is former Clinton senior adviser, MDC Partners CEO and Stagwell Group President and Managing Partner Mark Penn.Mark, great to see you. Welcome back.Your reaction to these polls this morning? How do you address the current race for the White House?MARK PENN, CEO, MDC PARTNERS: Well, I think that we're seeing a little bit of what I expected, which is some snapback here from some of the extreme figures that we saw. And I think this race is going to continue to tighten because there are a lot of people who supported President Trump who left President Trump as the virus got worse. And the big question is, how is the president going to handle the virus? That really is what is driving his numbers up or down.BARTIROMO: So you think that's what this is going to be in the next 100 days, the president's handling and what Joe Biden has to say about the virus and leadership there?PENN: Well, it's the number one issue. If you look at what's transformed America, there have been obviously the -- the emergence of issues related to race, but people still, by over two to one, put the virus as the number one issue, and President Trump receives below 50 percent, around 40 percent ratings, on both of those. And when Trump was doing pretty well, just two months ago, he was receiving just about majority ratings on the virus. And so where is kind of more of the sense of command and control of the virus. I think that's what people are looking for. They're looking for that kind of leadership.I don't think we've seen Biden's numbers move at all because Biden really hasn't come out and started his race. But Trump has to, as I've always said, it's Trump v Trump, come back and take command of the virus if he's going to see his numbers improve. Otherwise, I think he's in real jeopardy at this point.BARTIROMO: Do we know Biden's plans in terms of his own agenda? Let's talk about his vice presidential pick, for example. On "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" I spoke with the former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon about who he thinks will be on the ticket. Watch this. Got to get your take.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Who do you think Joe Biden will choose as his vice presidential candidate?STEVE BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST: Well, I think the polling internal to Biden. I think the number one thing they're looking at is somebody that can't -- that can't throw him off the -- where he's going right now. So I think, you know, whether it's Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, I think they're looking at a number of candidates.I don't think it's going to matter at the end of the day who his VP is because, really, I think Joe Biden's the one that's going to get smoked out. If President Trump continues to drive action, then Biden's going to be smoked out and going to have to really confront President Trump on the hustings, you know. And I just don't think he's going to stand up.BARTIROMO: Yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: So, Mark, who do you think it is? We know Kamala Harris is being looked at, possibly Susan Rice, possibly Elizabeth Warren.PENN: Well, I hate playing this game. But if I had to guess, Kamala Harris probably is the number one. I think because she has been a former prosecutor. She's not perceived as too far to the left. I think Elizabeth Warren would be perceived as much farther to the left, raise more questions about the ticket.I mean, you know, usually when you run, you're supposed to kind of go more to the left during the primaries and then move more to the center during the actual election itself because, after all, the general election voters are much more to the center.BARTIROMO: Yes.PENN: You've seen this strange pattern where Democratic nominees often do the opposite.BARTIROMO: And, Mark, once again, we have not heard a peep from the left in terms of the wrong-doing at the top of the FBI over the origins of the Russia probe. John Durham is working on his investigation. We are expecting some news out of this investigation around Labor Day. That's what AG Barr told me, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows joined me yesterday on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" and he made a few predictions that former federal officials should expect to hear from Durham soon.Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: When are we going to hear from John Durham? Will there be indictments, sir?MARK MEADOWS, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: Well, I think the American people expect indictments. I know I expect indictments based on the evidence I've seen.Lindsey Graham did a good job in getting that out. We know that they not only knew that there wasn't a case, but they continued to investigate and spy, and, yes, I used the word "spy," on -- on Trump campaign officials and actually even doing things when this president was -- was sworn in and after that and doing it in an inappropriate manner. You're going to see a couple of other documents come out in the coming days that will suggest that not only was the campaign spied on, but the FBI did not act appropriately as they were investigating. It's all starting to come unravel -- to unravel. And I tell you, it's time that people go to jail and people are indicted.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Mark Penn, what's your take on this? We know that they knew that the dossier was garbage. It was bar talk as early as January 2017 based on the declassifications we saw Friday. The FBI sub source told -- I'm sorry, the sub source told the FBI agents that it was just bar talk and it wasn't true, and yet they still used that dossier to defraud the FISA court and get renewals to continue spying on the Trump campaign while the president was sitting in the -- in the Oval Office. I mean this is during his presidency, Mark.Your reaction?PENN: Well, we've seen one smoking gun after another here. I mean it's time for some indictments to come down. We know the clearest one is the lawyer who simply changed the e-mail related to Carter Page, getting rid of the "was serving" as a -- as an agent and put in "not," right. So what's taken so long here?BARTIROMO: That's right.PENN: But the recent material that came out on Friday now says that the government knew all along that this dossier was a crock and so that this should have gone absolutely nowhere instead of a two year independent counsel investigation which seems to have just been about persecuting associates of Trump rather than actually finding anything about Trump, Russia collusion, that was known as non-existent. It's really quite incredible.BARTIROMO: Yes. It's quite incredible.And what do you hear from the media, Mark? Not a peep. Even behind closed doors there's Peter Strzok marking up a "New York Times" article saying, well, that's wrong, that's wrong, that's wrong, all their headlines. We still have no evidence of any of this. And yet a lot of those people, what, they got Pulitzer prizes. They actually got Pulitzer prizes for their report on the Russia probe.PENN: Right. Even Peter Strzok, who is at the center of creating an insurance policy, is saying that "The New York Times" has no real evidence for the story that they are reporting about Trump associates talking to agents of kind of the -- of -- of Russian -- of the Russian government and that the story itself is false. Even Peter Strzok is saying that it's false.BARTIROMO: Right. What a joke.PENN: This was really false from the -- from the beginning.BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.Mark, great to talk with you this morning. Please come back soon. Thank you, sir.Mark Penn joining us there on all of the above.PENN: Take care.BARTIROMO: Coming up, the spying threat from China. TikTok under pressure because of its Chinese ownership. What you need to know to protect yourself with these Chinese apps. Why the administration is right to look into banning Chinese-owned apps. We're going to get into it.And then Instagram's biggest names and their biggest stars. We're looking at one influencer who's trying to get her followers to be better airline passengers. Her unbelievable stories from 35,000 feet coming up.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Banning Chinese apps. Earlier this month India banned 59 of Chinese apps following tensions along their shared border. Twenty soldiers dead in India after the Chinese Communist Party invaded India. The apps include TikTok, WeChat, Weibo, Baidu Map and Alibaba owned UC Browser. "The Washington Examiner" walked through the reasons why the ban was an effective move, including that it protects against surveillance and theft by Beijing. It's easy to enact and has an immediate economic effect on Chinese companies aiming to go public.Joining me right now is Disruptive Tech Research Founder and Chief Analyst Lou Basenese.And, Lou, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for being here.LOU BASENESE, RESEARCH FOUNDER AND CHIEF ANALYST, DISRUPTIVE TECH: Good to see you, Maria.BARTIROMO: What's your reaction? Walk us through these apps and the threat of national security around them.BASENESE: Look, I think "The Examiner" was spot-on in their diagnosis here. We're living in a world where wars are fought with bits and bytes, not bombs and bullets anymore. Data access is critical to finding out where people are moving, what their preferences are. And I really think this is an opportunity for the U.S. government to secure our digital borders where we haven't done before.And, frankly, it's our own fault. I mean, as individuals, we're terrible with privacy. And we've talked about this before, how FaceBook, from day one, has always invaded our privacy and we've given it up freely. And I think this is an instance where India's showing that the state needs to intervene to protect, you know, the interest of the state when the individuals aren't going to do that.BARTIROMO: Well, it sounds like the United States is poised to also ban TikTok, among others apps.Steve Forbes, jump in here because many people believe that this -- you know, TikTok, WeChat, is just another opportunity for the Chinese Communist Party to gather information, gather data on American citizens and continue to surveil whoever they can.FORBES: Yes. And you also have questions rising up of something all of us love these days, and I'd love to get Lou's opinion on it, and that is Zoom. What's the future of Zoom given its presence in China and concerns about security?BASENESE: Look, I have two concerns about Zoom. One, I think you're putting a finger on is the security. And they had security issues, right? There -- there were Zoom calls that were getting hacked into as -- as a number of Zoom users, I think it ballooned to something north of 300 million. So they've seen tremendous growth.There's no way that they've been able to invest in security measures. And, quite frankly, that's probably endemic across the entire digital world that we've criminally under invested in cyber security and now we're trying to play catchup.You know, the other thing -- the problem with Zoom is it's got a market valuation that's completely off the charts. It's trading for a market camp that's worth more than the entire video conferencing space on a whole.So, look, I think what we're seeing is we've become so used to being connected but we've never really thought through the implications from a national security standpoint.BARTIROMO: Yes.BASENESE: At least on the individual level. And we're too free with just scrolling and clicking off on a user agreement without thinking about what we're agreeing to.BARTIROMO: Right. Well, I mean, look, the other issue -- and I'm glad that Steve brought up Zoom because the servers are in China. It's another opportunity to spy. But it's also propaganda. You know, I spoke with Senator Kennedy this weekend and he said these Confucius centers are all propaganda. Same with WeChat or -- or TikTok. If you are an individual in America who says -- goes to the Confucius center and says, oh, tell me about the new national security law in Hong Kong, no, we're not going to do that. And that's not happening.Tell me about Tiananmen Square. No, we're not going to do that. I mean it's total propaganda and editing out information. There's that as well.BASENESE: No, you're right. And that's the thing, right, we should not be surprised. We know -- China has been playing this game from day one. They've been censoring, blocking, controlling information flow. Why should we think twice about doing the same to protect our own interests?BARTIROMO: Yes.All right, Lou, great to have you this morning. Thanks so much.Lou Basenese joining us there.BASENESE: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: Stay with us. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Time for the "Morning Buzz."First up, getting paid for your spare change. There's a nationwide shortage of coins. So Community State Bank in Wisconsin has launched a coin buyback program. For every $100 in coins you turn in, the bank will give you a $5 bonus. You don't even need to be a bank customer to participate in this program.Lee, do you have some spare change around? I know I do.CARTER: I sure do. We keep them in containers all over the house.I think this is a great idea. And I love these -- these ideas when you see businesses and communities coming together to solve a real challenge that's out there. There's a coin shortage. People can use some extra cash right now.When you -- when you read more about it, you'll see that a lot of folks are saying, look, I don't even need the bonus, give it to the businesses that need it. I think this is amazing, amazing example of Americans and communities coming together to solve a problem.BARTIROMO: I agree with you. I love it.Next up, the future of fast food. KFC is working the world's first lab produced chicken nuggets, turning to a Russian 3D bioprinting company to help produce what they're calling the meat of the future.Oh, God.Steve, what do you think about this one, bioprinted chicken?FORBES: It sounds creepy, especially if they're still using animal parts so it's not vegetarian. So I don't want to egg them on, on that. It reminds me of those fake milkshakes they used to have at fast food places. They finally had to put some real milk in there. This sounds like the same thing. Yuck.BARTIROMO: I mean, really, I'm all into eating healthy, but, you know, let's just stick to real food.And then there's Taco Bell, Dagen. Don't believe the rumors. It's keeping - -FORBES: Yes, (INAUDIBLE) organic.BARTIROMO: Exactly. Taco Bell is keeping the Quesarito according to the fast food chain. The menu is being simplified to make things faster, safer and easier for workers and customers. Items being removed from the menu include grilled steak soft taco, the 7-layer burrito and the beefy Frito burrito.Dagen, restaurants are still having to make these adjustments due to the coronavirus.MCDOWELL: I just was informed that one of our producers, Rachel, has never been to a Taco Bell --CARTER: What?MCDOWELL: And I think that that is deeply, deeply disturbing. I'm not sure that I trust her any longer.That being said, I used to eat the Nachos Bell Grande with extra cheese every day for lunch when I was in college. That plus beer. And I was 30 to 40 pounds heavier than I am right now. So maybe that's why --BARTIROMO: Oh, my gosh.MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly. So it's a -- it's a double-edged sword.BARTIROMO: You can't -- you can't do that every day, I know that.All right, still ahead, outrageous behavior at 35,000 feet. We are going to be talking to one of the top Instagram influencers about her brand and how she's exposing the world to the craziest behavior on airplanes.That's all right here next hour MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.Stay with us.Load-Date: July 20, 2020End of Document

All Rights ReservedLength: 436 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Isobel Asher Hamilton)Highlight: Eric Schmidt, now an advisor on the US government's Defense Innovation Board, said some of Huawei's practices have damaged national security.BodyRichard Brian/Reuters• Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt told the BBC that Chinese tech giant Huawei has compromised US national security.• Schmidt is an advisor on the US government's Defense Innovation Board.• The US government has repeatedly accused Huawei of spying for the Chinese government, which Huawei denies.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.Google's former CEO Eric Schmidt thinks China has used tech giant Huawei to spy on the the US.Speaking on a BBC radio documentary due to be aired Friday, Schmidt said: "There's no question that Huawei has engaged in some practices that are not acceptable in national security."There's no question that information from Huawei routers has ultimately ended up in hands that would appear to be the state," he said, adding that "however that happened, we're sure it happened."Schmidt, a technical advisor on the US government's Defense Innovation Board, likened the company to national spying agencies such as the NSA by saying its operations are a form of "signals intelligence."Schmidt was Google's CEO from 2001 to 2010, but stayed on at the company as an advisor until February this year, when he took up government roles.Huawei's UK chief Victor Zhang said Schmidt's claims were "simply not true.""Huawei is a private company, 100% owned by its employees. Huawei is independent from any government, including the Chinese government," he told the BBC.Huawei has repeatedly denied accusations from the US government that it is used as a spying proxy by the Chinese government. Accusations that it's a national security threat are part of a US political strategy in its trade war with China, it says. The Trump administration placed Huawei on a trade blacklist in May 2019, but the company has been granted multiple temporary licenses since then. A week after Trump blacklisted Huawei, he said the company could make up part of a trade deal. In an            excerpt from an upcoming new book, Trump's former national security advisor John Bolton says Huawei            formed part of Trump's strategy to strike a trade deal and secure re-election.NOW WATCH: Why electric planes haven't taken off yetSee Also:• Here's an exclusive look at the pitch deck used by Universal Quantum to raise $4.5 million to take on Google and build the 1-million qubit computer• How tech companies from Google to Salesforce are planning to reopen offices and bring employees back to work in the wake of the coronavirus crisis• Google has created a special task force to help improve the company's racial equity, and a leaked memo reveals employees suggested more than 500 changesLoad-Date: June 18, 2020End of Document

US INDICTS TWO CHINESE HACKERS FOR VAST, 10-YEAR GLOBAL THEFT CAMPAIGNStates News ServiceJuly 21, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 603 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:By Paul EckertA U.S. grand jury has indicted two hackers affiliated with China's Ministry of State Security for a 10-year global campaign in which they broke into computer systems of hundreds of companies, and recently targeted firms researching a coronavirus vaccine, the Justice Department said Tuesday.The 11-count indictment alleges Li Xiaoyu, 34, and Dong Jiazhi, 33, stole terabytes of data over a decade from high technology companies in the United States, Australia, Belgium, Germany, Japan, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Spain, South Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.The charges are the latest in a series of Trump administration actions targeting China, ranging from sanctions over China's imposition of harsh security laws in Hong Kong and over human rights abuses against Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang to public denunciations of Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea.The pair from Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) and the Guangdong State Security Department (GSSD), also allegedly targeted non-governmental organizations, dissidents, clergy, and democratic and human rights activists in the United States, Hong Kong and China, said the grand jury in Spokane, Washington."China has now taken its place, alongside Russia, Iran and North Korea, in that shameful club of nations that provide a safe haven for cyber criminals in exchange for those criminals being 'on call' to work for the benefit of the state," said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers.Hackers like Li and Dong work to "feed the Chinese Communist party's insatiable hunger for American and other non-Chinese companies' hard-earned intellectual property, including COVID-19 research," Demers added as he announced the charges."Today's indictment demonstrates the serious consequences the Chinese MSS and its proxies will face if they continue to deploy malicious cyber tactics to either steal what they cannot create or silence what they do not want to hear," said FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich."The FBI and our international partners will not stand idly by to this threat, and we are committed to holding the Chinese government accountable," he added.Li and Dong cast their net widely to allegedly steal data from high-tech manufacturing, industrial engineering, solar energy, pharmaceuticals and defense. Recently, they probed computer networks of companies developing COVID-19 vaccines, testing technology, and treatments, the indictment said.U.S. Attorney William D. Hyslop for the Eastern District of Washington, said the hacking was first detected at the Department of Energy's Hanford Site in eastern Washington."The hackers operated from China both for their own gain and with the assistance and for the benefit of the Chinese government's Ministry of State Security," he said.Michael McCaul, lead Republican of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, hailed the indictments as "a powerful message to those who are intent on exploiting this pandemic: We will identify you and we will prosecute you.""The CCP has been hacking U.S. companies and the U.S. government for years in what FBI Director Wray has called 'one of the largest transfers of wealth in human history.' Today, we made it clear these actions will not be tolerated," said McCaul.The two hackers, who are not in U.S. custody, were charged with computer fraud, conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, unauthorized access of a computer, and aggravated identity theft. The offenses carry penalties from two years to 20 years in prison.Load-Date: July 22, 2020End of Document

Hundreds gathered outside the home of Mayor Lori Lightfoot last night, demanding the city defund police as the White House announced plans to send federal agents to the windy city and other cities across the country to help combat the recent surge in violence.And overnight, an iconic statue of Christopher Columbus was removed from Chicago's Grant Park. It was taken down by the city, not the protesters who tried to tear down the controversial statute just last week.To the latest on the coronavirus, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is delaying the response of the next round of the relief package. It will now be rolled out next week. McConnell saying the White House wanted more time to review final details.The $1 trillion package is expected to include $105 billion for reopening schools this fall, $15 billion for day care center assistance, $16 billion for coronavirus testing as well as tracing.Johns Hopkins University finding that more than 4 million confirmed cases of the virus are here in the U.S., with more than 144,000 deaths.And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention releasing new guidelines for reopening schools this fall. The recommendation, they stress the importance of getting students back in the classroom. They include social distancing, masks, hand hygiene, increased classroom space, disinfecting of surfaces, and the use of pods to keep students together during the school day.President Trump who has been calling for schools to reopen wants Congress to approve $105 billion for aid for schools in the next stimulus bill. Trump has also said parents whose kids' schools remain closed should use the money to send them to private or charter schools instead, but he says kids learn best in the classroom, Dagen.MCDOWELL: Lauren, thank you for that. Lauren Simonetti, we'll see you shortly.Futures are under pressure this morning amid escalating tensions with China. All your major market gauges, mostly down for the week. The Dow and NASDAQ erasing their gains after yesterday's sell off. The S&P 500 on pace for its fourth straight weekly gain.Joining me now, Kadina Group President Gary B. Smith. Also joining the conversation all morning long, UBS Financial Services Private Wealth Advisor Alli McCartney, The Federalist commentary writer Emily Jashinsky and Michael Lee Strategy's Michael Lee.Gary, let's kick it off with you. Yesterday, pressure on technology stocks. Do you think this is the beginning of the comedown for these high flying names?GARY B. SMITH, PRESIDENT, KADINA GROUP: Honestly, Dagen, I think the beginning was July 13th. If you look at all the charts, just take Amazon for example, which doubled, doubled.I couldn't believe it when I looked at the chart and realized it doubled from the March low until the 13th. It hit an all-time high then, it came back down sharply. Then we had one great reversal backup and now it looks like, yes, all these tech stocks, no matter what chart you look at, you can look at that, you can look at Facebook, you can look at Netflix. They're all in that group that make up seemingly 99% of everyone's portfolio. It looks like they're going to have a pretty good sell-off.MCDOWELL: Gary, what's the trigger here? Again this morning, it has headlines about tensions with China shutting down the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu. But I want to remind people, this is after the Houston Consulate was shut down by the United States because of, well, theft of intellectual property, the indictment of two Chinese nationals for hacking American firms involved in coronavirus research. Is it that, is that the lack of stimulus coming out of - coming from Republicans, what is it here?SMITH: Well, I don't think it's a lack of stimulus, by the way, just to touch on that briefly, they already spent $3 trillion. We don't even know there was an article in - opinion letter, I guess, in The Wall Street Journal this morning by Ron Johnson. It says we don't even know how we spent the first $3 trillion, and now we want to spend another trillion.So I don't think it's that, I think in this case, Dagen, the sell-offs or the market pullbacks are normally one of two things. It's the big event, a terrorist attack or something, or it's the steady drip of downbeat stuff.You kind of touched on between your headlines and what Lauren was reading. You pretty much hit all of them. You got - people wake up and they see these protests in these big cities. That doesn't endear compen (ph).You see unemployment rate going up. I was just reading this morning the AMC Theaters chains, they're not even going to open back until August. You touched on the school, the school openings or delayed openings. Even in Florida, they - looks like they're going to delay until - push back another two weeks. That's got to hurt the economy.When the schools don't open, you've got to take care of your kids, you can't go out, you can't do things. So I think it's all this. And then of course, you talked about the tensions with China. None of this is saying, "Hey, let's go out, the economy's great and buy stocks."MCDOWELL: Alli McCartney?ALLI MCCARTNEY, PRIVATE WEALTH ADVISOR, UBS FINANCIAL SERVICES: There have been a lot of allegories made to the tech bubble, given what we've seen with the predominance of these really five stocks, and perhaps Tesla. How do you think that is? Do you think that's a fair comparison?DAGEN: So Gary B, I got to jump in here. Since we work together, Gary and I have worked together more than 20 years and we both worked together at TheStreet.com, which was the very first standalone financial publication on the Internet. So we've lived through that bubble; but continue.SMITH: No, no - exactly. That goes back since, gosh, before the year 2000. So Dagen is still 37 and I have continued to age, and I died - picture Dorian Gray in Dagen's basement somewhere.But the point is, Allie, I think that you are right. I wouldn't say it's a tech bubble; sounds so damning, but yes, it looks like that. You look up what is driving, when the market goes up, particularly the S&P, it's those stocks because they are just bigger and bigger because of their market caps percentage of the - like I said in the intro, everyone's bubble - those start to come down even though the whole market might not be coming down.They make up such a big percentage, it makes a dramatic change. And yes, when you have a stock like a Netflix or an Amazon, almost doubling in the course of four months, yes you're going to expect some pain on the way downMCDOWELL: Gary B, great to see you as always. Gary B. Smith.SMITH: Nice to see you, Dagen.MCDOWELL: Yes, it's been - I think we've been working together since '99, '98, something like that. Time flies when you're having fun. Gary, take care of yourself, we'll see you soon.We're just getting started this morning.

Former New York City Police Department Commissioner Howard Safir on his take on the unrest hitting major cities across the country.And it's still Insta-Star$ Week, we wrap it up looking at one account making fun of life's everyday worries. You don't want to miss it.But first, 2020 in focus. President Trump canceling the Republican Convention in Jacksonville. You're watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, 45TH US PRESIDENT: I looked at my team and I said, the timing for this event is not right, just not right with what's happened recently; the flare-up in Florida. To have a big convention is not the right time. I have to protect the American people. That's what I've always done. That's what I always will do.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: That was President Trump yesterday canceling next month's Republican National Convention events in Jacksonville, Florida. Joining me now, the Trump Presidential Campaign Principal Deputy Communications Director, Erin Perrine. Erin, how soon - or far in advance did you know about this? Was it in the making for days, if not weeks?ERIN PERRINE, PRINCIPAL DEPUTY COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: Well, President Trump didn't make the decision when it came to canceling the Jacksonville portion of the convention. He had been in conversations for a few days regarding this, and ultimately he made the decision to be able to cancel that and for us to make sure that. However, we celebrate his renomination as the Republican nominee for President; we will do so in a big fashion.MCDOWELL: Does it hurt? Does it hurt fundraising? Does it hurt enthusiasm? Does it hurt the campaign at all?PERRINE: No, this doesn't hurt the campaign at all. The President's enthusiasm within the Republican Party remains at a record level and we know that this is a President who breaks records. He's been doing it all across the board. When it came to the primaries, when it's come to fundraising, we raised $20 million just this week with an online fundraiser. So I would say that the enthusiasm for President Trump remains sky high.MCDOWELL: How do you make up ground - in the latest Fox News poll that came out yesterday at 6:00 p.m., Joe Biden, the former Vice President tops President Trump in battleground states, Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania. And if you look back four years ago, I'll just bring up the fact that President Trump won, it was Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania combined by less than 78,000 votes. So you've got some ground to make up.PERRINE: Well, the only poll ultimately that matters is the one on Election Day. We have had an organization on the ground in all of those states that you just mentioned for over a year now, making sure we can contact voters, register them, get new volunteers on board to share President Trump's message directly with the voters. In a state like Wisconsin, Joe Biden just hired a State Director to be out there. We haven't left Wisconsin since 2015.And so, we know we're having a competitive race, but we always run this campaign like a point behind, because we want to win and we want to make sure that President Trump gets the opportunity to secure America's greatness for another four years.MCDOWELL: Emily Jashinsky, jump in here.EMILY JASHINSKY, COMMENTARY WRITER, THE FEDERALIST: Yes, I'm curious what the straw that broke the camel's back was with this convention. Because there obviously were known concerns about Florida for a while and I think it caught some people off-guard, the announcement yesterday. So I'm curious what was that real precipitating factor? Was it a combination of everything at once?PERRINE: Well, President Trump has been thinking about this for a little bit now and he made the decision ultimately to pull back on Jacksonville. We've seen a spike in COVID cases there and ultimately the President's focus remains what it's always been, which is the safety and health of the American people. And so, he decided against us having the convention in Jacksonville. It was entirely his decision and it was entirely the right call.MCDOWELL: Well, and if you're in business, you would not continue to spend money on preparing for something, if the likelihood is rising that it's going to be canceled. So you don't throw money into a sinkhole, if you will.Let's move on to Vice President Joe Biden sitting down with President Barack Obama in a new video for what was deemed socially distant chat. They touted their accomplishments in office and took swipes at President Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, 44TH US PRESIDENT: You're going to pay attention to the science and you're not going to quit on trying to actually bend down the curve of disease and transmission rates.JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This guy has generated a sense out there that people are waking up to that. He ran by deliberately dividing people.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: President Trump responded on Hannity last night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I wouldn't be there if it weren't for those two. If they did a good job, I wouldn't. I've ran against what they did and I won. Biden and Obama, I'm here, I'm in the White House because of them(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: All this after Joe Biden call President Trump "The first racist President" and Charlamagne tha God, one individual pushing back on Joe Biden, you can't really - I won't repeat exactly what he said, but what do you say to that?PERRINE: There are a couple of points to point - points to make when it comes to the Obama-Biden conversation. One, it's really rich for someone like Joe Biden who gave a eulogy at a Grand Cyclops of the Ku Klux Klan's funeral to talk about sowing racial division in this country.And when Obama and Biden were actually faced with a pandemic in this nation, the swine flu, they stopped testing and they stopped reporting testing, because as they admitted, they said well, we already know what it is, it's a pandemic, so why waste the resources on it?Can you imagine the heads exploding at CNN or MSNBC or any other network if President Trump stopped testing? We don't have to guess what America would look like under Joe Biden. We lived it.And President Trump is right when he says he is in the White House because America rejected the Obama-Biden legacy. They rejected those eight years, and that's why President Trump is President.MCDOWELL: Here's Charlamagne tha God's quote, "I really wish Joe Biden would shut the F up forever and continue to act like he's starring in the movie A Quiet Place, because as soon as he opens his mouth and makes noise, he gets us all killed. Okay, there's already so many people who are reluctantly only voting for Joe Biden because he's the only option and because Donald J. Trump is that trash." So that was the full quote. So, you've got Charlamagne weighing in on it. Erin Perrine, thank you so much. I appreciate you being here.Coming up, protests hitting Chicago. Hundreds gather outside Mayor Lightfoot's home demanding she defund the police. Was asking for spare change - The U.S. Mint sending out an urgent plea as the country deals with a nationwide coin shortage.MCDOWELL: Chaos in the streets of Chicago last night as protesters took aim at Chicago's Mayor Lori Lightfoot. Protesters rallied outside of her home, demanding the Chicago Police Department be defunded and rallying against President Trump's move to send federal agents to the crime-plagued city. Emily, murder day - murders in that city day-after-day, shootings day- after-day, and this crowd wants to defund the police.JASHINSKY: They are acting on a fantasy and it is an absolutely dangerous fantasy, and what's particularly dangerous about it this time around is that there seems to be serious momentum. You have this big demonstration outside the Mayor's home. And if Mayor Lori Lightfoot is not an ally to your cause on the far left, maybe you have gone a little bit too far to the left. This would cause - if this proposal were seriously implemented, which is - it's basically impossible.But if it were seriously implemented, the lives that would be lost in Chicago, the businesses that would suffer because of this where people have put their blood, sweat and tears into for years, it's almost hard to comprehend the loss of - the loss of life and safety and all of these things, if this fantasy were enacted. But, what's true (ph) is when you see the momentum behind it this is around.MCDOWELL: And by the way, one thing I just want to point out, there's been certainly a back and forth between the Mayor in Chicago and President Trump, and federal agents coming into the city. But these agents are working in an investigative role, and it is perfectly within the purview and the power of the federal government to send agents into any city or state to investigate federal crimes.80% of gang activity is drug activity. Guess what? Drug activity is a federal crime. If it's a racketeering organization or enterprise, anything that those organizations do, that is a federal crime. And if you read into the details and certainly the people in the mob and other talking heads on TV don't do that - but if you read into what these agents are doing in Chicago, it is very interesting that they are looking - using special technology, say from ATF meant to study ballistics evidence to connect and solve shootings. Agents will bring cases in Federal Court where they can pursue longer sentences.What if this works, Emily? What if this works? That the federal agents working in - working in connection with local authorities can stop some of these crimes and charge some of these murders?JASHINSKY: I think you've raised a really good point and the question is, is that - do these protesters want that to happen? I mean, do they - we've seen some of their proposals for instance, as to how we should investigate rape if police were to be defunded and it's stunning. It is stunning and I can't imagine that people would actually, genuinely want to live in that world. So I think you've raised a really good point about stuff that could actually be helpful and could actually be useful.In some of these cities where it's getting to a point, especially as we've seen these crimes during the pandemic spike, that it have to, this is dire in some of these cities and to see people wanting to go in the opposite direction, it's really kind of mind boggling to be honest.MCDOWELL: And just to clarify, the reason that I get so hot under the collar about this and my face turns red, even though I love Chicago, I've never lived there. I love the Pacific Northwest, never lived there. But I do live in New York City and I've been a resident here for more than a quarter of a century. And it is dangerous and is getting more dangerous by the day.And you have basically a Mayor and even a Governor who are a cocktail of arrogance and idiocy, arrogance and ignorance. And it is like milk of magnesia and gin. It is disgusting. Meanwhile, people who I know are getting robbed and attacked when they're trying to come to work. That's why I'm so angry.Coming up, online retail battling the coronavirus pandemic. Affirm CEO and PayPal Co-Founder, Max Levchin, next on his company's exclusive deal with e-commerce giant Shopify.Well, baseball is back. President Trump's celebrating America's pastime with one of its all-time greats.DAGEN MCDOWELL, ANCHOR, MORNINGS WITH MARIA: Welcome back, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo, it's Friday, July 24th. Let's take a look at where the markets are at 6:30 a.m. Eastern. We have losses across the board, although slight. The markets moving down on the news that U.S.-China relations are worsening, that's putting pressure on global markets. Checking the futures in -- the markets in Europe, you can see losses across the board there. Growing tensions between the U.S. and China leading to those losses, red across the board in Asia as well.The Nikkei closed for the trading day, but you had a steep loss of almost 4 percent in Shanghai. The family of civil rights icon and Congressman John Lewis releasing plans for his memorial and funeral. Lauren Simonetti has the details. Lauren?LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS: Hi, Dagen, John Lewis will be remembered with a week-long celebration of life, that will include stops in Alabama, Atlanta and Washington D.C. Celebrations kick off tomorrow in his hometown of Troy, Alabama. On Sunday, his body will cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma for the very last time. From there, he will lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda from Monday to Wednesday. He'll be laid to rest in Atlanta during a private funeral on Thursday. The civil rights icon and Congressman died from pancreatic cancer last week. He was 80 years old.Disney is making changes to its movie schedule, next month's release of the live action version of "Mulan" has been delayed indefinitely. Also, Disney says, it is delaying the release of future installments of "Avatar" and the "Star Wars" series by a year. Several other releases that have fallen victim to the pandemic include "A Quiet Place II", "Top Gun: Maverick" and "Spider Man: Far From Home" sequel. So, all they get pushed back and pushed back.And here's a look at what's trending this morning on foxbusiness.com. President Trump is expected to sign an executive order today aimed at lowering drug prices. Coronavirus forcing Ascena Retail Group, that's the parent of Lane Bryant and Ann Taylor to file for bankruptcy and close some stores. And Facebook taking on Zoom and Google Meet by rolling out a new feature that allows users to live-stream video calls with up to 50 people. Dagen, back to you.MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Lauren. Credit card alternative Affirm scoring an exclusive deal with e-commerce giant Shopify; a firm providing a safe opportunity for Shopify customers to buy now, pay later. Maria sat down with the firm's CEO and the co-founder of PayPal, Max Levchin.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARA BARTIROMO, MORNINGS WITH MARIA: Give us a sense of what's going on during this pandemic. I would imagine being home has actually triggered a big growth spurt at Affirm. Tell us about it.MAX LEVCHIN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AFFIRM: Yes, that's exactly right. As you might expect, folks still need to buy lots of different things, and these days they're doing it primarily from their couch. And we are one of the best, and certainly in my bias opinion, the best way of conducting transactions, especially if you want to pay overtime and not get trapped into fees or hidden charges. So that, that's resulted in massive growth, both the consumer side where we've seen demand go up as high as 300 percent in some categories, from the early days of the pandemic and the merchant side, as this is probably more interesting one, merchants are scrambling to move their businesses to be predominantly online. And so we've seen sign- ups go up 40 percent since March on the merchant side.BARTIROMO: Look over the longer term, Max, for us, and what do you think this economy's going to look like when we get out of this, and over the long term as we see this digital economy penetrate even more? You know, I mean, whether it's e-commerce or getting deliveries of food, people are behaving differently, and those people who weren't doing everything digitally obviously are being forced to now.LEVCHIN: Yes, I think the best way of thinking about it is really as if we just skipped two to five years of digital economy growth. The sort of, you know, visualize your favorite e-commerce growth chart, you can immediately notice that it's being growing pretty steadily, it's about double digit, low double digit rates year-on-year-on-year, you know, just rolling along and slowly taking over our lives. But we just skipped probably five years in at least a couple of different dimensions.Number, we taught a whole bunch of people that it's completely OK to buy things online that they just didn't buy online before. Two, we dragged into kind of the modern way of shopping -- all the folks that said, you know, I'm too old and I'm not interested or it's just not for me. And then finally, all these businesses that have stayed in the brick and mortar world as kind of -- you know, because that's where they've always been, have now said well, we have no choice. We have to get on it.We have to be predominantly online, you know, digital economy first. Which is, you know, something that really creates companies like Shopify and all the other merchant platforms, they're now experiencing a surge of demand.BARTIROMO: Yes, so tell me more about the Shopify deal. I was reading some of your comments, and you mentioned small business and why this really moves the needle there as they try to reinvent themselves. How does the Shopify deal work, Max?LEVCHIN: So, we've always had a really great integration with Shopify where any merchant could install which shoppers call an app and a firm, you know, super-transparent pay over time would be available to their customers. We've now taken it one giant step further, basically making our integration ubiquitous. Any merchant on Shopify can flip a switch and every consumer that comes through their digital store will be able to use Affirm without any kind of work on either side.So, it's a giant leap for us, rightly and more importantly, it's just a really big step towards fulfilling our mission which is fundamentally to reinvent credits and certainly provide a viable alternative to credit cards.BARTIROMO: And has the product rolled out yet?LEVCHIN: Not quite. We've been working on it with our Ottawan friends for a while though, so it's in the final stages of getting tested and make sure it's ready for prime time.BARTIROMO: Do you think this partly has to do with what we're seeing in the market? I mean, is this why you wanted to do this kind of arrangement, because you see the consumer behavior changing?LEVCHIN: Absolutely. I think -- you know, I've been -- I've been doing this Affirm project now, pretty large company, not just a project for almost a decade. And the original idea and you're one of the very first people to talk to me about it, was this hunch that millennials and gen-zers are going to want a different way of paying. They're going to want more transparency. They're going to need trust. They don't like bankers. They think that 2008 was caused by Wall Street.They're going to seek a better way, something that's more honest and more in tune with their view of the world. And it's really worked.BARTIROMO: How would you assess the economy right now, and in particular, the small business customers that you're hearing from?LEVCHIN: I think of course, many are in survival mode, especially the ones that are deeply dependent on foot traffic. Many are very focused on just maintaining cash flow. I think today, the word of the day is more sales, making sure that the product you have is flying off the shelves, so you can reorder, you can continue, you know, moving forward. Affirm is a tool in that department. We help consumers pay for things they wouldn't necessarily feel comfortable for paying for right now.And so, in that sense, we are -- we see ourselves as an ally to the small business, but I think it's tough out there. I think people are struggling to maintain cash flow, and we're doing our best to help them.BARTIROMO: Let me get your take on markets here. I mean, this market will not quit, even in the face of the shutdown, we are in a recession. People are expecting growth in the second half of the year, but this market keeps on going up. Any thoughts on these levels in terms of valuations in this stock market?LEVCHIN: I do think that we're seeing a little bit of American optimism at work, where this is not a secular national decline of the American economy. It is a pandemic. It hit us very hard and the economy is suffering. Many companies are taking market share. If you think to a digital economy, obviously, you know, brick-and-mortar is down a lot, but a lot of that a lot moves over online pretty quickly and figures itself out.And so from the point of view of predominantly non-digital businesses, they're down 60 percent, 70 percent, maybe 80 percent, depending on which segment you're in and you get -- even if half of that moves online, that results in, you know, quadrupling or tripling of some of the digital players. And so, this changes the creed unfairly to some companies, and I think that a very disruptive, but the market is paying attention to those who are winning and unfortunately to those who are losing.BARTIROMO: You look at the growth story, it's like, you know, Amazon, people are just betting on growth. Look at Tesla, your former colleague at PayPal and what Elon Musk has done. We reported yesterday on Musk's earnings report, but whether or not he's saying, look, we're only going to pay half the rent at some of the -- at some of the showrooms. Your thoughts on the incredible skyrocketing situation at Tesla?LEVCHIN: You know, Elon continues to amaze. I think one thing that I think maybe unites a lot of the old PayPal folks is that we've all lived through a lot of stress. We were there during one of the very first dot-com collapses, we've seen 2001, 9/11, up close. You know, that's when we were trying to scale our company. And so, we're all pretty good under pressure. I think that's what Elon is showing, I'd like to believe that's what all of us took away from that company.BARTIROMO: I love that sentiment, Max. It really is and it's true. All of you have just gone on to such incredible things. Congratulations, we love hearing from you, Max. Thanks for joining me.LEVCHIN: Thank you.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Coming up, China retaliates. Beijing closing one U.S. Consulate in a key Chinese city. The fallout straight ahead. Plus, poking fun at life's everyday worries, the Insta-stars making you laugh even when you want to cry. You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.MCDOWELL: Breaking news overnight, Chinese retaliation, Beijing shutting down the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu Province in western China. This comes after the Trump administration forced the closure of China's consulate in Houston, which is supposed to happen by 4:00 p.m. today. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling on American allies and the Chinese people to rise up against Beijing and, quote, "more creative and assertive ways" in a speech yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE, UNITED STATES: Just this week, we announced the closure of the Chinese Consulate in Houston because it was a hub of spy and a loss of property.(APPLAUSE)And state for a minute, every level, all across the world, there's engagement of a Chinese government horse, simply demand fairness and reciprocity. Our focus can't just be about getting tough. That's unlikely to achieve the outcome that we desire.We must also engage and empower the Chinese people as they are a freedom- loving people who are completely just sick for this Chinese Community Party.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Joining me now, American Enterprise Institute Research Fellow, Zack Cooper. Listening to the Secretary of State's words, is this a possibility?ZACK COOPER, FELLOW, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE RESEARCH: Well, I think it's unlikely that the administration is going to change the Communist Party's path at the moment. Xi Jinping appears just determined to push on every front, internationally, almost every border issue that China has, has sprung up over the last few months, and they've even been pushing further into Australia and Europe with coercive practices.So, I think it's going to be very difficult for the administration to get China to change its behavior at this moment.MCDOWELL: What do you think happens in terms of the escalation of tensions between the United States and China? What we're seeing now is the Houston Consulate for China is closed, and they retaliate this back and forth. How dangerous is this tit-for-tat, even though obviously justified here in the United States. You're stealing secrets, stealing intellectual property, the U.S. is not going to stand by and let it continue to happen.COOPER: Many in Texas have been worried about Chinese intellectual property theft for years. It has been a hub of concern. So I think it's not surprising that Houston was the target out of all of the Chinese Consulates. But I have to say, I'm surprised the administration went as far as they did and actually closed it down. We'll see what the Chinese do today by the end of the day.They haven't promised that they'll actually close down the consulate. I actually think the Chinese overnight moved to sort of de-escalate the situation a little bit by closing down Chengdu. They could have chosen another U.S. Consulate in China that does more business, that does more than just visa stamping. This was kind of a de-escalation on their effort, on their part, I think. An effort not to see this actually spiral further out of control.MCDOWELL: Mike Lee?MIKE LEE, FOX BUSINESS: Yes, hi, Zack. How close do you think the U.S. is to taking aggressive action against members of the Communist Party, such as asset seizures and sanctions against individual members that are active in the United States?COOPER: I think we're getting there pretty quickly. We've already seen these threats over Hong Kong and Xinjiang. I think there are a couple of steps that would prompt action. One would be a real crackdown in Hong Kong using substantial force against protesters. That's certainly not out of the question. And we've already seen them go after pulp here, remember.So, you know, the administration is taking the gloves off here, they're willing to go after those Communist Party members, senior members, after their families I think in some cases, and certainly after their travel ability and their bank accounts. So yes, this is -- this is just a real step change. We've never seen anything like this, certainly over the last 50 years.MCDOWELL: On that note, Zack, before we go, I'll point out there's the news that the Chinese tycoon who is a party -- Communist Party insider, Ren Zhiqiang, on the name pronunciation, I'm horrible, he was expelled from the party after publishing an essay that targeted the Chinese leader Xi Jinping and he -- prosecutors actually preparing corruption charges against him. So it's certainly sending a chill through the ranks of the wealthy and the elite in Beijing.COOPER: Yes, Xi Jinping has used this corruption campaign to go after his internal opponents, whether they've been particularly corrupt or not. And so, you know, I think this corruption campaign is going to continue, we're just going to see it accelerate if anything.MCDOWELL: Great to see you, Zack, thank you so much for being here this morning. Zack Cooper joining us. Coming up, baseball back, President Trump celebrating America's past time with one of its all-time greats. Plus, Dr. Anthony Fauci throwing out the first pitch, I gave it a shot, the nation's leading infectious disease expert should stick to medicine. That's making the buzz this morning.MCDOWELL: It's time for the Morning Buzz. First up, baseball back, opening day started with a wild pitch from Dr. Anthony Fauci. The Yankees went on to beat the Washington Nationals 4-1. Maybe Dr. Fauci has gotten some pointers from Maria Bartiromo, she threw one right over the plate at Yankee stadium. President Trump who will get his turn on the mound at Yankee stadium next month. Michael, throwing out the first pitch, tough. What did you make of yesterday? Are you excited?LEE: Yes, look, I think Dr. Fauci's pitch was, you know, pretty much on par with a lot of the advises given throughout the pandemic. I'm excited for baseball. There was something going around Twitter last night that said all the Yankees and Nationals kneeled during the national anthem. That's not true. They all stood forward for those that are worried about it, and it's great to see the president out there with the "Sandman", the long-time relationship, one of the greatest baseball players ever and a devout Christian. So, I'm looking forward to seeing the president throw out the first pitch at Yankee stadium.MCDOWELL: And while fans are not in the stadium, you can tune into Fox and Fox Sports tomorrow for an exciting lineup of games from around the country. Take your pick. I think folks will be watching all of them. Next, got some spare change, the U.S. Mint wants it. The coronavirus has led to a coin shortage. The U.S. Mint asking people to go out and use their coins and try and pay with exact change. They hope this move will put more coins in circulation. Emily(ph)?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All right, yes, good luck with that. I was going to say people who go taking -- go get a hot dog at a baseball game, but they're not able to do it yet. This is an interesting point about how the pandemic has accelerated some trends that are already in motion, and I think the move away from actual physical change is clearly one of those elements in all of those trends.MCDOWELL: I do -- I pay with my phone now. So I don't have --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes --MCDOWELL: I don't have to carry money with me anywhere. Tips. I have 20s for tips. I like to tip a lot. Finally, dogs are blowing up on the internet. The coronavirus has brought a rise in puppy adoptions and many of those dogs are making a huge splash on Instagram. Ella Bean the dog has over 125,000 followers. She is not alone, the puppy account Harlow and Fosters has over 85,000.Many others are rising in popularity. Does your dog, Allie(ph), have its own Instagram account?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, Ray Ray we all -- she actually does not have his own Instagram account. But my son just told me that since I only have 120 followers, I should just rename it and give it to the dog, and he'll be much more popular --MCDOWELL: Yes, by the way, that's D-dog, D-dog and Chazzy(ph) are with my dad right now, and they're an utter nightmare. So stay with us, everybody. We'll be right back.Load-Date: July 24, 2020End of Document

Zoom Blocked A US User's Account To Abide By A Chinese Law. Here's Why That's A ProblemThe Daily CallerJune 11, 2020 Thursday 09:18 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: DAILY-CALLER-NEWS-FOUNDATION; worldLength: 887 wordsByline: Chris White, Tech Reporter, chris@dailycallernewsfoundation.orgChris is a Missourian trying to find news angles in the blank spaces of life.

Zoom has not explained why he was reinstated.• Zoom is susceptible to Chinese manipulation as much of its infrastructure is located in the communist nation, foreign policy expert Christian Whiton told the Daily Caller News Foundation • Reports of Zoom's decision to block and later reinstate the account come after researchers found that the company was routing calls through China's servers. Zoom confirmed Wednesday evening that the video conferencing company removed a U.S.-based account after it commemorated the Tiananmen Square Massacre.Zoom removed the account to comply with local law inside China, which prohibits discussion about the three-decade-old massacre, the company said.The company acknowledged removing the account of activist Zhou Fengsuo, a former student leader of the Tiananmen protests in 1989 who organized the May 31 event through a paid Zoom account associated with a nonprofit he founded called Humanitarian China.Zoom's move reveals a huge problem the U.S. has in dealing with China's massive censorship network, according to Zhou. “I was shocked and disappointed over what happened,” Zhou told The New York Times on Thursday.Roughly 250 people based in the United States            attended the event before Zoom shut down Zhou's account on June 7.“Just like any global company, we must comply with applicable laws in the jurisdictions where we operate,” a Zoom spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday, according to Axios, which initially reported on the removal. (RELATED: Zoom Targets Activist Group That Held An Event Commemorating The Tiananmen Square Massacre: Report)“When a meeting is held across different countries, the participants within those countries are required to comply with their respective local laws,” the spokesperson added. “We aim to limit the actions we take to those necessary to comply with local law and continuously review and improve our process on these matters. We have reactivated the US-based account.”Link to ImageSmall toy figures are seen in front of diplayed Zoom logo in this illustration taken March 19, 2020. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/IllustrationZoom has not replied to the Daily Caller News Foundation's request for comment addressing why the company reinstated Zhou despite initially removing him over concerns related to China law. Zhou, meanwhile, wants answers.“We can't stand that an American company put Chinese-style restrictions on users in the U.S.,” he told the Times. The deeper problem is China's byzantine censorship network, called the Great Firewall, which “enslaves the Chinese people” and is “the fatal flaw for an open and free internet,” Zhou noted.China's Great Firewall allows the country's officials to control what people see and read online, effectively sheltering Chinese citizens from observing what's going on abroad. Foreign companies must abide by strict censorship rules dictating what can be said. They're required to provide data to censors who police China's version of the internet.Zoom began allowing unpaid users in China to join meetings but not host them. Such a change paved the way for a user in the U.S. to host a meeting allowing users inside China to join.  Zhou said he advertised the Tiananmen event on Chinese social media two days before it occurred.Zoom faces growing scrutiny regarding its ties to China, which prohibits discussion of the protest and the government's violent response to the demonstrations. The company            acknowledged in April routing calls through Chinese servers. (RELATED: FBI Asks Public To Report Child Sexual Abuse During Zoom Meetings Through New Online Questionnaire)Foreign policy analysts argue that Zoom's work inside China is making the company susceptible to manipulation.“Encryption experts have said its security is dubious, and it has relied on programmers and encryption keys located in China,” Christian Whiton, a senior fellow for strategy and trade at the Center for National Interest, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “[I]t is now clear that the company's reliance on China means it is susceptible to Chinese political pressure.”Whiton added: “This episode will only deepen suspicions about Zoom the company hoped to overcome.”Other experts are making similar observations. China is prepared to force companies like Zoom into self-censoring to avoid coming down too hard on them in a publicly, according to Dean Cheng, a Chinese political and security affairs expert at the Heritage Foundation.“From the Chinese government's perspective it's not just about Zoom,” Cheng told the DCNF. “Ideally from the Chinese perspective, the next company that comes along won't even issue licenses and accounts to known dissidents,” he added, referring to China potentially pressuring Zoom over Zhou's account.“For China, self-censorship - people choosing not to challenged China from the get-go - is much better than China having to crack the whip,” Cheng concluded.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

America's top tech CEOs can't agree on whether China steals from themCNN WireJuly 30, 2020 Thursday 9:44 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 533 wordsDateline: SAN FRANCISCO (CNN Business) BodySAN FRANCISCO (CNN Business) --  It's a question that gets to the heart of escalating tensions between the United States and China: "Do you believe that the Chinese government steals technology from US companies?"And it was put to the CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google by Rep. Greg Steube, more than four hours into Wednesday's five-and-a-half hour Congressional antitrust hearing. The answers were somewhat varied."I don't know of specific cases where we have been stolen from by the government," Apple CEO Tim Cook said. "I know of no case [of] ours where it occurred ... I can only speak to firsthand knowledge," he added.Google CEO Sundar Pichai initially followed his lead. "I have no firsthand knowledge of any information stolen from Google in this regard," he said. (Pichai later issued a correction, acknowledging a China-linked cyberattack on Google in 2009 in which the company said some of its intellectual property was stolen.)Amazon's Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man, said he had "heard many reports of that," though he added that "I haven't seen it personally." Mark Zuckerberg was far more unequivocal. "I think it's well documented that the Chinese government steals technology from American companies," the Facebook CEO said. Steube's question carries enormous significance in the United States. The issue of intellectual property theft is central to the geopolitical dispute between the United States and China, and protecting IP has been one of Washington's core demands throughout the trade war. The United States has long said that intellectual property theft has cost the US economy billions of dollars in revenue and thousands of jobs. Chinese officials, meanwhile, have repeatedly rejected accusations that foreign companies are treated unfairly, arguing any tech secrets handed over were part of deals that had been mutually agreed upon.Zuckerberg's remark, meanwhile, marked a notable shift in tone for one of America's foremost tech executives. In previous years, the Facebook CEO has made plenty of overtures to the Chinese government, which at the time drew widespread criticism.On Wednesday, presenting Facebook as an American champion against China's tech industry was a key part of Zuckerberg's testimony. "If you look at where the top technology companies come from, a decade ago the vast majority were American," the Facebook CEO said. "Today, almost half are Chinese."The Trump administration has already largely blocked Chinese telecom giant Huawei from working with American suppliers, and says it's "looking at" banning the hugely popular short form video app TikTok. Zuckerberg on Wednesday labeled that app, which is owned by Chinese tech firm ByteDance, one of Facebook's main competitors.But when Steube followed up his initial question by asking for recommendations on how Congress could "better protect" American companies from "aggression and government intervention abroad" in places such as China and Europe --- neither Zuckerberg nor any of his peers had an answer. Steube waited for around 15 seconds of awkward silence before yielding the rest of his time. TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

UK plans to remove Huawei from its 5G network and France will heavily restrict itCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 6, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1036 wordsBodyBleak stage for Huawei and its 5G technology. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson would be ready to start phasing out the Chinese company's use of technology for the country's 5G network this year, The Telegraph advanced this Sunday. If confirmed, there would be a change in the telecommunications policy announced last January by the prime minister, when Johnson said it would allow Huawei to play a "limited" role in the UK's 5G network.According to the newspaper, the government agency dealing with communication and intelligence in the United Kingdom (GCHG) has reconsidered the guarantee previously granted that the alleged risks posed by the Chinese technology giant can be managed safely. Johnson is therefore expected to present a report this week that concludes that the new US sanctions on Huawei, which prevent the Asian company from using US patent-based technologies, will force the Chinese firm to use "unreliable" Chinese technology that could make that risk impossible to control.Huawei's reaction hasn't been kept waiting. Victor Zhang, Huawei Vice President in the UK, has assured that they are working closely with their customers "to find ways to manage the restrictions that the US proposes so that the UK can maintain its current leadership at 5G. As always, we remain open to dialogue with the Government." The manager added that they believe "it is too early to determine the impact of the proposed restrictions. Restrictions that also have nothing to do with security, but with market position."Huawei's head of international media, Paul Harrison, was much more critical of the situation and Twitter said that "the US should respect that the UK can choose its own telecoms strategy after Brexit." "Has the European Parliament been replaced by the White House?" asked the executive, who believes that the only thing the U.S. is after is achieving China's 5G technology leadership.The Telegraph said the British report arrives as Johnson faces its biggest opposition in Parliament so far, with Conservative members threatening a parliamentary "insurgency" if the British government does not take a tougher stance on Huawei and China.It is assumed that the GCHQ National Cyber Security Centre report marks a "fundamental change" and does not allow Huawei to market share the 5G network of up to 35% as stated in January. British officials would also be examining Huawei equipment installed in other infrastructure outside 5G.If Huawei's phase-out plan is finally announced, the UK will join other countries that have set aside Chinese telecommunications equipment suppliers for security reasons, after the US has accused them of maintaining "close ties to the Chinese government and military apparatus." Along with the US, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Taiwan have also kept Huawei out of the 5G deployment.Although Huawei's equipment is cheaper than those of its foreign counterparts, according to multiple reports, concerns about security backdoors and increasing pressures from the US have caused many governments to fail to contemplate their installation.The UK's decision to allow Huawei to participate in the deployment of its 5G network is "not written in stone" and is beingrevised following the new U.S. sanctions announced in May, as acknowledged Monday by Minister Oliver Dowden, Reuters reports. As Dowden told Sky News, these sanctions, designed to restrict Huawei's ability to obtain advanced microchips for 5G equipment, can have a significant impact on supplier reliability and, therefore, "we constantly review our security to ensure that we have the best possible security for our telecommunications network."Huawei Vice President in the UK has insisted that "all of our world-leading products and solutions use technology and components on which the UK government conducts strict oversight. Our technology is already widely used in 5G networks across the country and has helped connect people during confinement."More restrictions also in FranceIn addition to the United Kingdom, France also questions Huawei in Europe. According to the economic newspaper Les Echos on Monday, the country will severely restrict the use by Huawei equipment operators in the deployment of 5G mobile networks for sovereignty and independence reasons. And, although the director-general of the National Information Systems Security Agency (Anssi), Guillaume Poupard, told the aforementioned newspaper that "there will be no total ban" for Huawei, he has explained that telecos that do not use Chinese group teams not to use it in the future. For those who already have Huawei material on their networks, they will receive "three to eight years" authorizations.Poupard insisted that it is not an attack on one or the other manufacturer, but that "the issue is only sovereignty", because manufacturers "are not the same" and there are not the same risks when talking about Chinese or Americans. Anssi's manager added that there is no anti-Chinese racism in that decision, but that "the risk is not the same with European and non-European manufacturers." It has thus confirmed that European operators Nokia and Ericsson will not be prohibited.In France, operators Bouygues Telecom and SFR already have Huawei equipment in their networks and the temporary limitations of authorizations for that manufacturer's material, which will require a renewal within a few years can pose cost-effectiveness problems. Both have warned that they will seek compensation from the state if the use of Chinese group equipment is restricted, Efe reports.For Poupard, what will be done with 5G in France is "a compromise" between the development of these networks in "economic conditions acceptable to operators and also sovereigns, which allow us not to be dependent on such or that manufacturer or country".Another country that could also add to restrictions or ban on the use of Huawei equipment for 5G networks is India. The government last week announced a ban on 59 Chinese applications, including TikTok, and is experiencing rising border tensions with China. The Indian government has already ordered state-owned telecom companies BSNL and MTNL to abandon Chinese equipment from their 4G upgrade plans.Load-Date: July 7, 2020End of Document

Microsoft negotiates purchase of Chinese video giant TikTokCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 31, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 403 wordsBodyMicrosoft is negotiating the purchase of the popular Chinese video app TikTok, which has become a mass phenomenon, but which Donald Trump's government was considering banning in the United States because it might pose a national security and privacy issue for Americans, the New York Times reported.The sources consulted by the journal did not specify where the talks are, which could lead to the entry of the microsoft giant into the shareholding of the application, owned by the Chinese company ByteDance,valued at about $100 billion.The Trump Administration was considering, among other measures, forcing ByteDance to dispose of assets in the United States, especially TikTok, which it acquired in 2017.According to The Wall Street Journal, the decision to force ByteDance to carry out such divestment would already be made, although the president himself, in statements to the media, hinted this Friday that there is nothing definitive at the moment."We're looking at TikTok. We could ban TikTok," said the president,who assured that there were different options on the table.Another measure against the Chinese company, creator of Tuotiao, China'slargest news portal, which was shuffled by the US government was to include ByteDance on the list of foreign entities that cannot purchase products and services in the United States without prior authorization. ChinaU.S. lawmakers began to look at TikTok with the astronomical rise in its popularity in the United States and to worry about the possibility that the Chinese government could influence the company and the Chinese government may in turn cede data from Americans or promote certain content to influence U.S. policy or other areas.These suspicions against TikTok also coincide with increased tensions between China and the United States over industrial espionage and commercial disagreements.Sources consulted by NYT also ensured that TikTok has also considered the acquisition of U.S. investment funds such as Sequoia Capital or General Atlantic.TikTok, founded in 2014, has grown with the purchase by ByteDance to have 800 million users worldwide and be a benchmark in viral video of teens and celebrities.TikTok has an army of 35 "lobbyists" or lobbying experts who try to dissuade the US government from disassociating it from its Chinese parent company, while having hired high-profile figures such as former Disney senior executive Kevin Mayer as CEO.Load-Date: August 1, 2020End of Document

Trump says US 'may be banning' China-owned video app TikTokAssociated Press State & LocalJuly 31, 2020 Friday 9:53 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; POLITICAL NEWSLength: 581 wordsByline: TALI ARBEL, AP Technology WriterDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump said Friday that his administration is weighing action against TikTok, a popular Chinese-owned video app that has been a source of national-security and censorship concerns.Trump's comments came after published reports that the administration is planning to order China’s ByteDance to sell TikTok. There were also reports Friday that software giant Microsoft is in talks to buy the app.“We are looking at TikTok," Trump told reporters at the White House. “We may be banning TikTok. We may be doing some other things. There a couple of options, but a lot of things are happening. So we’ll see what happens.”Reports by Bloomberg News and the Wall Street Journal citing anonymous sources said the administration could soon announce a decision ordering ByteDance to divest its ownership in TikTok.There have been reports of U.S. tech giants and financial firms being interested in buying or investing in TikTok as the Trump administration sets its sights on the app. The New York Times and Fox Business, citing an unidentified source, reported Friday that Microsoft is in talks to buy TikTok. Microsoft declined to comment.TikTok issued a statement Friday saying that, “While we do not comment on rumors or speculation, we are confident in the long-term success of TikTok.”ByteDance launched TikTok in 2017, then bought Musical.ly, a video service popular with teens in the U.S. and Europe, and combined the two. A twin service, Douyin, is available for Chinese users.TikTok's fun, goofy videos and ease of use has made it immensely popular, and U.S. tech giants like Facebook and Snapchat see it as a competitive threat. It has said it has tens of millions of U.S. users and hundreds of millions globally.But its Chinese ownership has raised concerns about the censorship of videos, including those critical of the Chinese government, and the potential for sharing user data with Chinese officials.TikTok maintains it doesn’t censor videos based on topics sensitive to China and it would not give the Chinese government access to U.S. user data even if asked. The company has hired a U.S. CEO, a former top Disney executive, in an attempt to distance itself from its Chinese ownership.U.S. national-security officials have been reviewing the Musical.ly acquisition in recent months, while U.S. armed forces have banned their employees from installing TikTok on government-issued phones. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said earlier this month that the U.S. was considering banning TikTok.These national-security worries parallel a broader U.S. security crackdown on Chinese companies, including telecom providers Huawei and ZTE. The Trump administration has ordered that the U.S. stop funding equipment from those providers in U.S. networks. It has also tried to steer allies away from Huawei because of worries about the Chinese government's access to data, which the companies have denied it has.The Trump administration has stepped in before to block or dissolve deals on national-security concerns, including stopping Singapore's Broadcom from its $117 billion bid for U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm in 2018 in an effort to help retain U.S. leadership in the telecom space. It also told China's Beijing Kunlun Tech Co. to sell off its 2016 purchase of gay dating app Grindr.Other countries are also taking action against TikTok. India this month banned dozens of Chinese apps, including TikTok, citing privacy concerns, amid tensions between the countries.Load-Date: July 31, 2020End of Document

FBI considers China's espionage to be the biggest threat to the USCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 8, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 302 wordsBodyWashington, 8 Jul (EFE).- The FBI is convinced that the Chinese government's acts of espionage and ongoing theft of information pose the greatest long-term threat to America's future.In an arraignment at the Hudson Institute, a well-known Washington idea lab, FBI Director Christopher Wray discussed Chinese-American relations Tuesday, which are not going through their best, both politically and commercially.The FBI director called China "the greatest long-term threat to our nation's information and intellectual property and to our economic vitality," noting that the FBI has more than 2,000 open investigations linking the Chinese government.At one point in his speech and according to U.S. media, Wray said Chinese hackers have moved quickly to attack U.S. pharmaceutical and research institutions trying to advance the fight against coronavirus.In a near-hour speech, the FBI manager described a far-reaching campaign orchestrated by Beijing of economic espionage, data theft and monetary theft, and illegal political activities, using bribery and blackmail to influence U.S. politics."Now we've reached a point where the FBI is opening a new China-related counterintelligence case every 10 hours," Wray said in words that CNN plays.The FBI director said Chinese President Xi Jinping had also spearheaded a program called "Fox Hunt," aimed at Chinese citizens living abroad who are seen as threats by the Beijing government, with the aim of intimidating them."We are talking about political rivals, dissidents and critics seeking to expose China's extensive human rights violations," he said. "The Chinese government wants to force them back to China, and China's tactics to do so are shocking.""China is engaged in a statewide effort to become the world's only superpower by any means necessary," he added.Load-Date: July 9, 2020End of Document

INDONESIA REJECTS CHINA'S OFFER FOR SOUTH CHINA SEA TALKSStates News ServiceJune 5, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 984 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Indonesia on Friday rejected a Chinese offer for negotiations on the South China Sea, as Jakarta reiterated that it had no overlapping claims with Beijing in its exclusive economic zone.The Chinese government, in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Antnio Guterres on Tuesday, acknowledged it had no territorial dispute with Indonesia but said the two countries had overlapping claims over maritime rights in parts of the South China Sea.Beijing's letter was in response to a diplomatic note sent by the Indonesian government to the U.N. chief on May 26, in which Jakarta rejected China's Nine-Dash Line map or claim of historical rights to nearly all of the contested waterway."Based on UNCLOS 1982 Indonesia does not have overlapping claims with the PRC, so it is not relevant to hold any dialogue on maritime boundary delimitation," Damos Dumoli Agusman, the director general of international law and treaties at Indonesia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service, on Friday.He was referring to a January 2020 statement from the ministry confirming that Indonesia had no territorial dispute with Beijing in the South China Sea based on the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)."It was stated that we reject (any negotiation)," Damos said.In its letter to the U.N. this week, China argued that its maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea were "established in the long course of historical practice and consistent with international law," including UNCLOS."There is no territorial dispute between China and Indonesia in the South China Sea. However, China and Indonesia have overlapping claims on maritime rights and interests in some parts of the South China Sea," China's permanent mission to the United Nations said in the letter, a copy of which was posted on the mission's website."China is willing to settle the overlapping claims through negotiation and consultation with Indonesia, and work together with Indonesia to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea," the letter said.Indonesia has insisted that China's claims are "unilateral" and have no legal basis in international law.No international legal basisIn the letter sent to Guterres last week, Indonesia spelled out the Indonesian government's support for a 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, when the court sided with the Philippines in a case that Manila brought against Beijing over a territorial dispute in the South China Sea."Indonesia reiterates that the Nine-Dash line map implying historic rights claim clearly lacks international legal basis and is tantamount to upset UNCLOS 1982," said the letter from Indonesia's Permanent Mission to the United Nations, referring to a boundary on Chinese maps that encompasses Beijing's claims in the maritime region.A spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Jakarta used the letter to indicate that China's Nine-Dash Line had crossed boundaries set by Indonesia's exclusive economic zone (EEZ)."We never know what China's intentions are in establishing a Nine-Dash Line. It may have the potential to create conditions that disrupt what was determined by Indonesia from a long time ago," ministry spokesman Teuku Faizasyah told BenarNews on May 29. "Therefore, we need to inform these matters by communicating our position openly to the international community."The Indonesian letter was the latest in a flurry of documents from members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and China following a Malaysian submission to the U.N. in December 2019. The Malaysian government claimed sovereignty over an extended continental shelf in the South China Sea off its northern coast, potentially an area with significant undersea resources.On Thursday, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi reiterated her country's stance on the issue."In a diplomatic memorandum sent on 26 May 2020, Indonesia reaffirmed its consistent position in responding to China's claim to the U.N. that could affect Indonesia's EEZ (exclusive economic zone) and also emphasize the need for full compliance with UNCLOS 1982," Retno told reporters during a virtual press conference.'Not an apples-to-apples thing'Meanwhile, an international maritime law researcher at the University of Gadjah Mada (UGM), I Made Andi Arsana, described China's offer for negotiation as illogical."Indonesia's claim is based on international law while China's claim is unilateral. It's not an apples-to-apples thing," Arsana told BenarNews, adding that Indonesia should not and would not agree to bilateral talks or negotiations on the issue.Hikmahanto Juwana, an international relations professor at the University of Indonesia, said the Chinese response was consistent with its playbook."Indonesia should never allow itself to be lured into negotiating. So far, Indonesia has consistently refused and will never want to negotiate with China," he said.The Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, and Vietnam all ASEAN members are among countries that, along with China and Taiwan, have competing claims in the South China Sea.Indonesia is not among the claimant countries, but in early 2020 and in 2016, tensions flared between Jakarta and Beijing over the presence of Chinese fishing boats swarming in South China Sea waters near Indonesia's Natuna Islands.In 2002, the 10-nation ASEAN bloc and China agreed on a Declaration of Conduct, which was a statement of principles on how parties should behave in the South China Sea. But completing a more detailed and binding Code of Conduct (CoC) has proved much harder to establish.Negotiations began in earnest in 2016 with a tentative deadline for acceptance in 2021. A draft of the text of the agreement has been released.Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Load-Date: June 6, 2020End of Document

Nicolas Maduro's regime is using Chinese technology to further control VenezuelansCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 23, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 809 wordsBodyA report by the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Commission said China is using cyberspace so that Nicolas Maduro's authoritarian regime can make the most of the Asian giant's hardware and services to further control Venezuelans.The document, led by Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, says Venezuela has Internet equipment as well as mobile networks, intelligent monitoring systems and facial recognition technology developed and installed by Chinese companies.In addition, dictatorship officials have traveled to China to participate in seminars on information management.According to the missive, the regime "uses these technologies to censor and control its critics by blocking social media platforms and political content, using prorgimen commentators to manipulate online discussions, track and stop government critics, and access data from human rights organizations."According to the text, the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE helped the regime to create the card of Venezuela's homeland, a card that critics have denounced to serve to exercise greater social control of the population.Employees of the entity that manages the card system, ensure that the database keeps date of birth, family, employment and income information, properties, medical history, benefits received from the state, social media presence, political party affiliation and voting records.ZTE has also endorsed the Maduro regime to build six emergency response centers in big cities and centralize government video surveillance, re-told the Voice of America media outlet.The report signed by Menéndez was commissioned by important members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and drafted after reviewing documents and conducting interviews with former government officials and non-governmental experts, as published by local media el Nacional.The documenta notes how the Chinese government would be forming a legal system to strengthen the Communist Party's manipulation of the tools of "digital authoritarianism and exporting it outside its borders.""The People's Republic of China is advancing to build and expand digital authoritarianism through economic, political, diplomatic and coercive means at home and abroad," the document explains.Chinese Communist PartyThe Senate investigation also refers to reports that countries such as Ecuador, Serbia, Zimbabwe, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Pakistan "have or seek to acquire Chinese information and communication technologies" to integrate into their national infrastructures.As in the case of Venezuela, in Ecuador, the report notes, two Chinese companies, Huawei and China National Electronics Import &Export; Corporation, developed a surveillance system under the government of former President Rafael Correa.ZTE and Chinese technology company Huawei are at the forefront of developing the telecommunications infrastructure of new 5G mobile networks, and their tentacles reach all over the world, including Latin America.Not only has China been willing to break into smaller markets, but Chinese companies manage to deliver better prices than Western firms, the report says.Washington has pressured its allies not to use the teams of the giant of theHuawei telecoms on 5G networks and is succeeding, particularly in Europe. However, in Latin America many of whose countries have business with Beijing, the result could be another.Brazil, another U.S. partner, will soon have to decide whether Huawei will remain involved in its 5G infrastructure, the report notes.Huawei, among other things, plans to build a smartphone assembly plant in the state of Sao Paulo.In that context, the legislator Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of President Jair Bolsonaro, said that we still have to see how Brazil handles Huawei's presence in its 5G networks, El Nacional continued.Meanwhile, in Mexico and Argentina there are plans for the first 5G networks to rise in 2020 and both countries consider allowing Huawei to participate, the text adds.The relationship between the cited nations, the Senate report says, demonstrates China's intentions to "establish, expand, internationalize and institutionalize a model of digital governance that this report describes as digital authoritarianism."Finally, the investigation recalls that the United States does not have a domestic 5G supplier and other countries are looking for alternatives to the Chinese variant of subsidizing Huawei and offering much lower prices, which it considers unfair competition.It therefore recommends that "the United States find, develop, and follow policies that will open the way for the domestic industry to become a leading player in all facets of 5G dominance in the future."MORE ON THESE TOPICS:Chavista collectives brutally beat those who breach quarantine in VenezuelaThe Delaware Supreme Court upheld the legitimacy of the CITGO boards appointed by Juan GuaidóLoad-Date: July 24, 2020End of Document

CHINESE BOAT SUPERVISOR CHARGED FOLLOWING INDONESIAN CREWMAN'S DEATHStates News ServiceJuly 15, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 876 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:The supervisor of a Chinese fishing boat has been arrested on charges of assault and human trafficking after the death of an Indonesian crew member whose corpse was discovered last week, police in Indonesia's Riau Islands said.Indonesian authorities detained two Chinese boats as they sailed near Singapore on July 8 after police received a tip that the body of the Indonesian sailor later identified as Hasan Afriandi, 20 had been kept in cold storage on one of the boats for a week.A Chinese national, Song Chuanyun, 50, has been named a suspect in connection with Hasan's death and was moved to a police detention cell on Friday night, according to Arie Dharmanto, the chief criminal investigator for police in Riau Islands province."The suspect is in police custody for further questioning," Arie told BenarNews on Tuesday, adding that other crew members were being questioned as well.Citing information from other sailors, Arie said Song and the boat's captain allegedly assaulted other Indonesian crew members. The captain has not been named as a suspect but is being investigated by police.Brig. Gen. Ferdy Sambo, director of criminal investigations at the National Police, alleged that Song had frequently mistreated crew members, including Hasan."The supervisor assaulted the victim with his feet and hands," Ferdy told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Arie said Song would be tried in Indonesia because the alleged assault occurred in Indonesian waters. If convicted, Song could face up to 20 years in prison.Last week, a Chinese government spokesman challenged the claim to prosecute the case, saying the two boats were in international waters."China asks the Indonesian side to take concrete, effective measures to protect the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese fishing vessel and crew members, and deal with the matter as properly and quickly as possible," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian in response to a question at his press briefing on July 10.Hasan's case marked the latest incident where Indonesians linked to Chinese fishing boats have died.Officials reported at least eight deaths since November 2019 including some where the corpses were thrown overboard. Surviving crewmen have complained of harsh conditions.The boats involved in the most recent incident were sailing off Nipa Island near Singapore when they were stopped and their crews detained by Indonesian Coast Guard ships last week, police said.Destructive Fishing Watch (DFW) Indonesia, an NGO, said an Indonesian working aboard the Lu Huang Yuan Yu 118 called its 24-hour hotline to report the death of a compatriot who allegedly had been physically abused. DFW passed the tip to a team of police, naval and coast guard personnel.Hasan's body was discovered on the other boat, Lu Huang Yuan Yu 117."Apparently the body was moved from one ship to the other, which is owned by the same company," DFW coordinator Mohammad Abdi Suhufan told BenarNews last week.Muhammad Haris, chief physician for the Riau Islands police, said an examination of Hasan's body found bruises, scars and a spinal injury."Organs such as the lungs, heart and the appendix showed signs of chronic disease," Haris told the Tribunnews website.The Chinese embassy in Jakarta did not immediately respond on Tuesday to a BenarNews request for comment.Previous deathsIn May, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi condemned the alleged mistreatment of the Indonesian sailors and summoned China's ambassador to Jakarta to respond to her concerns. She asked the Chinese ambassador to explain why sailors' corpses had been thrown overboard.Retno was reacting to a South Korean media report showing an Indonesian crew member who had said three bodies were thrown into the sea between December 2019 and March. The report alleged that Indonesian crew members were sometimes forced to work 30 straight hours while standing and were given only six hours to eat and sleep before resuming their duties.On June 5, two Indonesian sailors jumped from a Chinese-flagged fishing boat as it sailed in the Malacca Strait, according to officials. They were rescued off Karimun, an island in the Riau Islands, and taken there the next day after drifting for seven hours.Six days later, Retno urged the Chinese government to conduct "transparent and fair" investigations into the deaths of Indonesian crew members who allegedly were subjected to harsh treatment akin to forced labor.Last week, Central Java police spokesman Iskandar Fitriana Sutisna said two top executives at a labor recruitment agency had been formally charged with human trafficking and would stand trial. The pair and others allegedly recruited Indonesians to work on the Chinese fishing boats.In addition, investigators have named nine people as suspects in the case, according to the Riau Islands police. Arie said investigators are trying to track down a Singapore citizen who is suspected of being a broker as well.Indonesian police previously reported arresting five people from four labor agencies in connection with previous cases.Police did not release details about those arrested.Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Load-Date: July 15, 2020End of Document

Center for Strategic & International Studies: Can Telephones Race? 5G and the Evolution of TelecomTargeted News ServiceJune 16, 2020 Tuesday 8:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4557 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Center for Strategic and International Studies issued the following report:By James Andrew Lewis, senior vice president and director for technology policy programThis report is divided into three sections, which are published separately. The first, presented here, looks at the environment for competition by exploring how 5G creates wealth, the standards contest, and the effect of technological change in telecommunications as we move to an "open" environment. The second will discuss the strengths and weaknesses of two key national competitors in Europe and China. A final section to be published later concludes by assessing U.S. strength and recommending elements of a comprehensive national approach to 5G strategy.The growing recognition that technology builds national power has led to a narrative of a "race" between the United States and China. China is now what the European Union calls a "systemic rival" and technology is a central part of this rivalry. China has recognized the advantages of being a leader in technology and uses statist economic policies and espionage to obtain an advantage. Fifth-generation mobile technologies (5G) have become one of the most high-profile domains where this competition is playing out.Key Points- The United States is not losing the 5G "race." S. (and Japanese) technologies are essential for 5G infrastructure.- The United States is holding its own in the standards bodies and is well placed to repeat the commercial success it had with- 5G technologies meet the growing demand to create and move new knowledge faster and more efficiently than- 5G creates wealth by enabling new enterprise services for industry and by building the network that will support the internet of things.- The "killer app" for 5G has not been created, but this will change as entrepreneurs explore newly available 5G capabilities and develop services and products to use it.- Telecom is changing in ways that make Huawei hardware less important. The telecom supply chain depends on semiconductors and software--all areas where the United States has a substantial lead over China. In some cases, there are no Chinese- The problems attributed to a 5G "race" are overstated. The United States needs policies to speed deployment and reduce risk, but the larger issue is how to deal with an increasingly hostile China in a new kind of nonmilitary competition.Is It a Race?The "race" metaphor has a long history--the race to the moon or the arms race. It is appealing because it lends a sense of drama and highlights competition. Its shortcoming is that it obscures that we are talking about business competition where the primary actors are companies, not governments. If there is a race in 5G, the United States is not losing. In fact, it is well-positioned to take advantage of 5G technology, just as it did with 4G. U.S. companies are strong performers in 5G, but one might not always gather this from the stream of stories where the United States is "falling behind." Lurking behind alarmist announcements of a 5G race between the United States and China is a not unreasonable concern that China will do whatever it takes to win while the United States is distracted by internal problems.The 5G issue has become politicized, and this shapes perception. First, contrary to some reporting, the United States has not been rebuffed in Europe. Interviews with colleagues in the United Kingdom and Europe show there is broad agreement with the United States on the risks of using Huawei. Where there is disagreement is over how to manage risk. The UK decision, not being reconsidered, is best seen as a partial ban on Huawei because it blocked Huawei from two-thirds of its network and from being used in sensitive areas around government and military installations. More restrictions are likely. Other European countries are committed to maintaining supplier diversity and avoiding Huawei market dominance (if they can find a way to do this without putting the China market at risk). Recent decisions by key European countries have led to the selection of European 5G suppliers, both on grounds of security and quality of equipment.Security cooperation coexists with economic competition. Economic competitors in Europe and Asia see 5G as a chance to gain market and technological leadership. Countries have different models for how to succeed: China with heavy, state-centric investment, espionage, and predatory trade practices; the European Union with intra-European coordination; and Japan and Korea with accelerated national strategies for investment and research. The United States, with its strong semiconductor and software sectors, relatively flexible spectrum management process, and its "app" economy, has an advantage and its companies and entrepreneurs gained valuable lessons from the 4G experience.The United States is not losing the 5G "race." U.S. (and Japanese) technologies are essential for 5G infrastructure. The United States is holding its own in the standards bodies and is well placed to repeat the commercial success it had with 4G.Each competitor has different plans for 5G. 5G will play a central role in the development of smart and self-driving cars, and all countries with an automotive industry will compete in this. Germany intends to use 5G for industrial applications as part of its Industry 4.0, and its strong manufacturing sector may give it an advantage. South Korea also benefits from having a strong app economy, but its main advantage in 5G comes from Samsung, the telecommunications equipment and semiconductor giant. Chinese companies have already created valuable consumer apps, like WeChat, and a strong developer base, and they will also pursue industrial and enterprise applications. China had an advantage in developing apps for the internet of things since its companies are the source of many of these products. But Chinese companies also face trust issues, since any Chinese-made device that connects to the internet could be exploited by Chinese intelligence agencies.How 5G Creates WealthMarkets follow their own logic, and national strategies, unless carefully designed, can be redundant or even an obstacle. National strategies that allow companies to compete with each other tend to produce better outcomes. The metrics for success are revenue, return on investment, future expected returns, and market share. The ultimate metric is growth in national income produced by 5G.Two centuries ago, farming produced wealth. A century ago, wealth came from heavy industry. Today, knowledge creation is the source of wealth. Knowledge creation drives economies more than the production of physical goods. Some call this the "conceptualization" of production.1 The creation of ideas, knowledge services, and other intangible products is the best way to create wealth. The result of knowledge creation is data, and the ability to move vast amounts of data rapidly around the world to meet business and consumer needs creates demand for telecommunications services. National competitiveness in this environment depends on the ability to create and move new knowledge faster and more efficiently than competitors, and then to use that knowledge to produce new goods and services. 5G technologies meet this growing demand.Knowledge creation is the source of wealth. . . . Some call this the "conceptualization" of production.5G could be the start of another round of innovation and growth similar to what we saw with the arrival of the internet, but for this to happen, 5G must be accompanied by "complementary investments." These include the invention of new products and services that make use of 5G networks and the development of new business models and processes.2 The United States is strong here, but so is China. The need for complementary investments and business innovations put the race metaphor in context because what companies and countries do with 5G is more important than how quickly or how "much" 5G they have. So far, the "killer app" for 5G has not been created, but this will change as entrepreneurs explore newly available 5G capabilities and develop services and products to use it.Understanding the economic benefits of 5G requires understanding where it fits in the tech ecosystem. It is important to divide the 5G market into segments and look at each segment both in terms of profit and security. There are the producers of 5G technologies, including telecom hardware--the leaders here are Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia, and Samsung. There are the companies that make the chips and software that are the essential components for telecom hardware. These are mainly American and Japanese. There are the consumer-facing networks and apps we know from our smartphones and there will be an increasing number of enterprise applications such as smart seaports and factories.Who makes the technology is important for national security, and how the technology is used is more important for economies.3National competitiveness in this environment depends on the ability to create and move new knowledge faster and more efficiently than competitors, and then to use that knowledge to produce new goods and services. 5G technologies meet this growing demand.4G, 5G and the App EconomyDiscussions of a 5G "race" can focus on the wrong metrics. The race metaphor often relies on 5G deployments. A better metric is the development of software and applications that will ride on the new 5G networks. It is not the number of 5G cell towers or the number of consumers carrying 5G phones that will drive economic growth. Many industries can use 5G services to be more efficient and innovative, and innovators can create the new services and products that 5G can enable. What counts is how people use 5G to make money.The fourth generation of telecommunications equipment (4G) let smartphones (essentially small mobile computers married to a radio) connect to the internet. 4G technology paid dividends throughout the U.S. economy. Smartphones created the "app economy," offering new services to consumers and generating rapidly growing revenue. 5G will expand the potential market for the app economy. U.S. entrepreneurs initially captured 91 percent of the world's mobile app downloads and U.S. companies created the operating systems on 9 out of 10 smartphones worldwide. While both Europe and China are gaining market share in the app space, U.S. companies still lead in revenue.4Other countries saw the United States' 4G successes and want to duplicate it in 5G, but this requires more than being fast at installing cell towers. It requires an ability to innovate in software applications, something U.S. entrepreneurs are good at doing, but companies in other countries--WeChat (China) and, at a smaller scale, Spotify (Sweden) and Shopify (Canada)--are strong competitors. Germany is also strong in developing industrial apps. China's app developers are particularly good (if the Chinese government does not get in the way), and the real race is in the nascent competition over who will write the 5G industrial and service apps for the global economy.Another way to make money from 5G is to sell the technologies that enable it. This is where much of the public attention has focused because of the security risks. There are five companies that sell telecom network technologies--Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia, ZTE, and Samsung--but they sit atop multinational supply chains for critical components that are largely American and Japanese. Without U.S. technology, Huawei will be hard-pressed to make 5G infrastructure products, and this was likely the intent of the recent Commerce Department rule changes.Another way to make money is to sell 5G services--this is what telecom companies will do. The most "disruptive" way to make money, and the way that probably offers the best outcomes for economic growth, is to create applications (apps) that take advantage of 5G services. When we say application, people may think of Angry Birds or some other consumer product. 5G will "industrialize" the app economy and expand it beyond games and other consumer programs, and this is where the opportunities for economic growth will appear. Initially, the most important market segment for 5G will be enterprise applications that allow companies to operate more efficiently and productively. Examples of these enterprise apps would include supply chain management systems, customer relationship management systems, and knowledge management systems.The real competition will be in writing the software applications that take advantage of 5G so that companies with access to 5G services more are profitable. Consumer applications are less important in this space--people can already watch videos on their phones and are unlikely to pay more for a slightly faster speed. In contrast, the enterprise and industrial applications that 5G can support will be the space for growth. The German firm Trumpf is developing Axoom, an industrial app designed to let companies manage smart factory solutions.5G (and Wi-Fi) will enable connections between sensors, data, and powerful internet computing resources. Innovators can take advantage of these connections to create new services and applications. These will include new enterprise and industrial applications such as smart hospitals or factories. Self-driving cars are part of this and 5G will speed up their use. U.S. companies are strong here, but so are European and Chinese companies.Europe and China have announced they intend to dominate 5G the way the United States dominates 4G, and U.S. companies face new competition, but success depends on making products and offering 5G products and services that appeal to the market. It is not credible to expect the nimble, well-resourced, and entrepreneurial U.S. tech sector to be squeezed out of profitable markets where they currently lead.The policies that promote success in each of these markets are different. For 5G infrastructure and technology producers, the focus of competition is over intellectual property, standards, and patents. Policy should encourage and support R&D, protect intellectual property, and ensure a level playing field in international standards and trade. The best metric is how well a country gains the full advantage in the growth and income that 5G can provide.The Standards ContestStandards are a battleground, but in 5G it is a battle where the United States is holding its own and retains the lead. Standards are the guidelines that companies use to build their products. They can create a stream of revenue for the holder, funding research, and jobs. The core of the contest remains research, patents, and standards.The definition and development of 5G standards is an international activity intended to identify the best technologies for wireless communication standards. 3G and 4G standards were developed by a partnership of global standards organizations, with dozens of companies from around the world attending meetings in standards bodies to agree on new technical solutions. Similarly, the private 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) develops standards for 5G.China has politicized the international standards process. This reflects a long-term strategy by the Chinese government. Interviews with executives from numerous U.S. companies identify this as a plan to dominate standards processes to give Chinese companies an advantage. Technology built to Chinese standards can also create cybersecurity risks. The standards-setting process is complicated, which makes it easy to exaggerate China's success, but there should be no doubt about China's intent. Anecdotal reports from attendees at international standards meetings tell of greatly expanded Chinese participation.Standards bodies use voting to make decisions. Chinese companies face intense pressure to vote the party line to support Chinese proposals even if they are technologically inferior. In the summer of 2018, for example, the chairman of Lenovo was forced to apologize publicly and promise never again to vote for a non-Chinese standard after Lenovo representatives voted in favor of a technologically superior U.S. proposal instead of a Chinese proposal. This is not how the standards process is supposed to work, but China will flout norms to gain dominance.China was unable to dominate the first round of 5G standards discussions, but it will be back in force in upcoming rounds. We should not be surprised that China's telecoms and high-tech industries play a more significant global role than in the past.5 China has displaced Europe as a center of economic power, invests heavily in R&D, and the Chinese government is desperate to increase the national ability to innovate. It is, after all, the second-largest economy in the world and will necessarily play a larger role. The issue is not a greater role for China but China's efforts to manipulate the standards process. The United States will need to work closely with Western partners to ensure the standard process remains politically neutral.Interviews with private sector representatives find that opinions about the 5G standards process differ on the prospects for success of this Chinese effort. The majority say that Western companies are holding their own against a Chinese onslaught, but a sizable minority point to the risk of China's efforts to politicize and overwhelm standards setting to gain the advantage. At this time, while there is increasing pressure from China, U.S. firms, along with their European, Korean, and Japanese counterparts, continue to lead. The majority of interviewed experts believe that the United States is holding its own in the standards process.A crucial element for maintaining the U.S. presence in standard bodies is to make clear that export control regulations do not prevent U.S. companies from participating in international standards discussions. The Commerce Department needs to immediately clarify that standards participation remains exempt from export regulations. This is a self-inflicted wound that the United States must avoid if it is not to be displaced in standards setting.Open 5G Architecture and Future TelecomWe can better assess the risk to national security and the future of economic competition if we take technological change into account. Telecom is changing in ways that will make Huawei hardware less important. The most visible aspect of this change is the Open Radio Access Network Alliance (O-RAN), an industry group developing architectures and software that will enable virtualized networks (e.g., those using software to provide services rather than proprietary hardware, the way that music-playing software replaced CD players)), relying on commodity computers, specialize software, and standardized interface.Telecommunications technology is now going through a transition similar to the transition in computing that began 30 years ago with the introduction of the internet.Telecom technology used to be static, changing slowly. It relied on specialized hardware. New technologies like cloud computing6 were layered on top of existing equipment and protocols. This is now changing as software-based, "open" network technologies begin to offer the same functions as conventional telecom technology. The shift has major implications for security and business as this disruptive technology can provide cheaper and more agile services using a supply chain open to any supplier.7One way to think about this is to compare it with computer networks. At their cores, these are essentially a combination of semiconductors and software. In very simple terms, your computer connects to servers and routers that then connect to the internet. These connections work irrespective of the manufacturer, so one company can make the computer, another can make the server, a third the connecting software, et cetera.A simplified (and arbitrary) portrayal would divide 5G networks into four parts: device, RAN, core, and cloud. An "end device" such as a mobile phone or a car, connects to a "Radio Access Network" (RAN) cell towers RAN connects devices to the telecom networks. The core of these networks use specialized routers, switches, and other packet handling technologies to aggregate and manage billions of calls. Some core processing (along with billing and other functions). Most of this is now done in the cloud (the cloud refers to managed computing resources that can be accessed over the internet). In 5G, some processing will move to the RAN, creating both opportunities and risks for security by providing hostile actors better access to data unless the 5G network is carefully designed to manage this--something that some say is impossible.Put simply, your phone connects to a cell tower that connects to a network that uses specialized computers and cloud services to route calls and manage your account.Telecommunications technology is now going through a transition similar to the transition in computing that began 30 years ago with the introduction of the internet.The telecom supply chain relies on areas where the U.S. has a substantial lead over China. In some cases, there are no Chinese competitors. The lower prices of this approach mean that service providers are already moving towards software-defined networks, where software replaces specialized hardware, and the lower capital expenditure requirements of an open architecture make it attractive.In contrast, current telecom technology relies on proprietary systems that are vertically integrated. Vertical integration is an arrangement where major components and software are provided by a single company as opposed to different companies providing different parts that are horizontally integrated. The existing market for vertically integrated systems of the kind made by Huawei is being eroded by the development of new, modular products (a more sophisticated version of the "plug and play" that consumers are familiar with).The companies that make the modular components for an open architecture telecom network involve both familiar names and new startups. Qualcomm, Intel, and Samsung make chips. Microsoft (which has built a huge 5G lab in Redmond) writes operating system software. Cisco, Sienna, Xilinx, Nokia, Fujitsu, and NEC make other essential components, as do a number of new companies, such as Altiostar, or InnoEye, and firms that are well-established in the telecom space, such as Airspan. Many of these companies along with telecom service providers have banded together in the O-RAN Policy Coalition (or other groups) to develop common approaches to the new technologies.The shift to open and multi-vendor modular systems puts Huawei at a disadvantage. Chinese companies have done a good job persuading many governments and telecom companies that only they can supply an integrated 5G solution, from handset to core. This is not true, but many believe it. What Chinese suppliers do offer are government-subsidized prices, meaning substantially lower prices that are attractive in the developing world and even Europe, despite the recognized risks.For example, a northern European country decided to use Huawei in its national carrier instead of its previous Nordic supplier. According to European telecom sources, Huawei came in with a bid that was perhaps 30 percent lower than its competitor (and it is possible that Chinese intelligence agencies helped Huawei discover the price of its competitor's bid--this is a standard Chinese practice8). A 30 percent savings gave economics priority over security in government decision-making. The dilemma for this European country will be to avoid being locked into older telecom technology. The open approach is more scalable, has lower capital costs, and makes it easier to shift network resources to meet demand. While an "open" architecture to provide advanced 5G telecom services can be cheaper and easier to modernize in the future, open architectures require an ability to integrate technologies from different suppliers into a working telecommunications network. This will slow adoption in some countries until the technology is more mature.It is important that we do not underestimate the difficulties posed by integrating new technologies into telecom networks so as to be able to serve tens of millions of customers with the same level service they get now. One advantage of existing technologies is that they are proven to deliver this level of service.Another is that they pose little challenge for integration, as opposed to multiple technologies developed by multiple vendors. Integration and scalability are major issues and suggest that the next generation of telecom technology is still some ways off. However, the supply chain for telecom will depend on semiconductors and specialized software, all areas where the United States has a substantial lead. In some cases, there are no Chinese competitors. Estimates of how long this telecom transformation will take can range from three years to a decade. The shift puts Huawei at a disadvantage. China will of course invest to catch up (accompanied by increased espionage), but money alone won't remedy China's lag in software and semiconductors.5G as a Mirror for Our FearsHuawei is a symptom of a larger problem, and 5G is a symptom of larger fears. We face, for the first time in decades, a powerful, unscrupulous, well-resourced opponent who has publicly declared their intent to displace us. We are not ready for this fight and do not have a strategy to respond to this challenge. Increasing the defense budget will not help the United States win. This is a competition over markets and technology, and strategies that cross the intersection of economics and security will not at first be easy for the United States to construct.Huawei is a symptom of a larger problem, and 5G is a symptom of larger fears. We face, for the first time in decades, a powerful, unscrupulous, well-resourced opponent who has publicly declared their intent to displace us.China is not our technological peer, but it is making immense efforts to change this. The United States needs to act in response. We have seen some efforts in the last few years, but more needs to be done, including a revitalized science and technology base and a coordinated approach with our allies on how to respond to China's espionage, unfair trade practices, and efforts to reshape global rules to better accommodate authoritarianism. China has realized, as previous generations of American leaders had realized, that strength in creating new technologies confers both power and influence.

US closes Chinese consulate in Houston, raises bilateral tensionsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 22, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 688 wordsBodyThe United States ordered the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston, which it accuses of being the "heart" of an espionage network, a decision known amid rising tensions between the two powers.The measure was announced Wednesday by Beijing, which considered it a "provocation" and threatened "retaliation," a harbinger of further deterioration of relations between the two powers, confronted by hong Kong security law, accusations of espionage, and the situation of the Uighur minority in northwest China, among other differences.The consulate was closed "to protect American intellectual property and Americans' private information," Washington explained without giving further details.State department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said that, in the past, the communist government had conducted "mass espionage" in the United States and interfered in domestic policy, put pressure on economic leaders, and "threatened Sino-American families residing in China."The United States made that decision because of the "persistent theft of American technology by representatives and agents of the Chinese government," said Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun.He also mentioned "diversions in the college exchange system" and behavior by Chinese consulate officials in Houston that is considered "incompatible with normal diplomatic practices."On a trip to Denmark, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo once again denounced the "intellectual property theft" by the Chinese Communist Party, both in the United States and Europe.Pompeo mentioned the case of Chinese hackers who were allegedly charged in the United States on the eve for attempting to steal data on the development of covid-19 vaccines and breach the systems of hundreds of Western companies."President Trump has said 'Enough'," insisted Pompeo, who threatened new sanctions for every instance that Beijing does not "behave" according to Washington's wishes.Marco Rubio, Republican chairman of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, said that China's consulate in Houston is "the heart of a vast network of spies and chinese Communist Party influence operations in the United States."According to the senator, an ally close to Trump, for that reason the closure of that diplomatic dependency should have been decided "long ago.""Spies have 72 hours to leave, under penalty of arrest," Rubio wrote on Twitter.Several Houston media outlets reported that firefighters went to the consulate Tuesday night because there would be documents burning in the building.Local police confirmed on Twitter that smoke was seen, but that relief teams "are not allowed to enter the consulate compound."During Biegun's appearance in Congress, several senators complained about the inefficiency of the measure."To be closed must be a means, not an end," protested Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez. "We're like on the Titanic," Republican Mitt Romney said. "We put the music very loud but we're losing," he added.- "Outrageous action" -China has five consulates in the United States. Houston's, Texas, was the first opened in 1979, the year of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.It has 900,000 Chinese citizens registered in their records.Closure "is a political provocation (...) that severely violates international law," said Chinese diplomacy spokesman Wang Wenbin, who said Beijing can retaliate.In addition to an embassy in Beijing, the United States has five consulates in mainland China and one representation in Hong KongKong.Although it seems unrelated, the decision to close the Houston consulate comes after two Chinese in the United States indicted computer attacks on companies working to seek a vaccine against the new coronavirus.The US Secretary of Justice on Tuesday announced the indictment of "two Chinese hackers working with the Chinese Minister of State Security."However, they were not arrested and are initially in China. Beijing rejected these accusations.China also warned its students in the United States on Wednesday, more than 300,000, of the risk of "arbitrary interrogations" by US police.lxc-sbr-tl-map/bar/cls/pc/mb/piz/gm/mlsLoad-Date: July 23, 2020End of Document

Hong Kong police make first arrests under new security lawAssociated Press InternationalJuly 1, 2020 Wednesday 3:51 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 1373 wordsByline: ZEN SOO, Associated PressDateline: HONG KONG BodyHONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong police made the first arrests Wednesday under a new national security law imposed by China’s central government, as thousands of people defied tear gas and pepper pellets to protest against the contentious move on the anniversary of the former British colony's handover to Chinese rule.Police said 10 people were arrested under the law, including a man with a Hong Kong independence flag and a woman holding a sign displaying the British flag and calling for Hong Kong's independence — all violations of the law that took effect Tuesday night. Others were detained for possessing items advocating independence.Hong Kong police said on Facebook that they arrested some 370 people on various charges, including unlawful assembly, possession of weapons and violating the new law, which was imposed in a move seen as Beijing’s boldest step yet to erase the legal firewall between the semi-autonomous territory and the mainland’s authoritarian Communist Party system.The law, imposed following anti-government protests in Hong Kong last year, makes secessionist, subversive, or terrorist activities illegal, as well as foreign intervention in the city’s internal affairs. Any person taking part in activities such as shouting slogans or holding up banners and flags calling for the city’s independence is violating the law regardless of whether violence is used.The most serious offenders, such as those deemed to be masterminds behind these activities, could receive a maximum punishment of life imprisonment. Lesser offenders could receive jail terms of up to three years, short-term detention or restriction.Wednesday's arrests came as thousands took to the streets on the 23rd anniversary of Britain's handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997. For the first time, police banned this year's annual march. Protesters shouted slogans, lambasted police and held up signs condemning the Chinese government and the new security law.Some protesters set fires in Hong Kong's trendy shopping district, Causeway Bay, while others pulled bricks from sidewalks and scattered obstacles across roads in an attempt to obstruct traffic. To disperse protesters, police shot pepper spray and pepper balls, as well as deployed water cannons and tear gas throughout the day.Hong Kong’s leader strongly endorsed the new law in a speech marking the anniversary of the handover of the territory — officially called the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.“The enactment of the national law is regarded as the most significant development in the relationship between the central authorities and the HKSAR since Hong Kong’s return to the motherland,” chief executive Carrie Lam said in a speech, following a flag-raising ceremony and the playing of China’s national anthem.“It is also an essential and timely decision for restoring stability in Hong Kong,” she said.A pro-democracy political party, The League of Social Democrats, organized a protest march during the flag-raising ceremony. About a dozen participants chanted slogans echoing demands from protesters last year for political reform and an investigation into accusations of police abuse.The law’s passage Tuesday further blurs the distinction between the legal systems of Hong Kong, which maintained aspects of British law after the 1997 handover, and the mainland’s authoritarian Communist Party system. Critics say the law effectively ends the “one country, two systems” framework under which Hong Kong was promised a high degree of autonomy.Britain’s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, told reporters Wednesday the law “is a clear and serious violation” of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the agreement that paved the way for the former British colony’s handover to Chinese rule.The law directly targets some of the actions of anti-government protesters last year, which included attacks on government offices and police stations, damage to subway stations and the shutdown of the city’s international airport. Acts of vandalism against government facilities or public transit can be prosecuted as subversion or terrorism.Pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo said in a news conference that the security legislation does not follow the rule of law and is a dire warning to the free press.“This would tell you that they want not just to get us, but to intimidate us into inaction, into a catatonic state,” Mo said.Hong Kong's police force said they would consider any flag or banner raised by protesters calling for Hong Kong's separation from China to be illegal as well as an expressions of support for independence for Tibet, Xinjiang or the self-governing island democracy of Taiwan that China claims as its own.Police will use a new purple flag to warn protesters if they display banners or shout slogans that may constitute a crime under the law.Concerns have also been raised over the fate of key opposition figures, some of whom have already been charged for taking part in protests, as well as the disqualification of candidates for Legislative Council elections scheduled for September.In Beijing, the executive deputy director of the Cabinet’s Hong Kong affairs office, Zhang Xiaoming, said Hong Kong people are allowed to criticize the ruling Communist Party but cannot turn those complaints “into actions.”“What happened recently in Hong Kong has shown a deviation from the right track of the ‘one country, two systems’ (framework),” Zhang told reporters Wednesday. “To some extent, we made this law in order to correct the deviation ... to pull it closer to ‘one-country.’”Schools, social groups, media outlets, websites and others will be monitored and their national security awareness will be raised, according to the law, while the central government will have authority over the activities of foreign non-governmental organizations and media outlets in Hong Kong.The law says central government bodies in Hong Kong will take over in “complicated cases” and when there is a serious threat to national security. Local authorities are barred from interfering with central government bodies operating in Hong Kong while they are carrying out their duties.Security legislation was mandated under Hong Kong’s local constitution, but an earlier attempt to pass it in the city’s legislative body in 2003 was shelved because of massive public opposition. Beijing finally decided to circumvent the Hong Kong legislature and have the law passed Tuesday by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, China’s rubber-stamp parliament.President Xi Jinping signed a presidential order putting the law into effect, and it has been added to the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s constitution.The law’s passage comes after Hong Kong’s legislature in early June approved a contentious bill making it illegal to insult the Chinese national anthem.On Wednesday, Raab, the British foreign secretary, announced the UK would extend residency rights for up to 3 million Hong Kong residents eligible for British National Overseas passports to five years from the current six-month limit. After five years, they could apply for settled status and then apply for citizenship 12 months later.The U.S. is moving to end special trade terms given to the territory. The Trump administration has also said it will bar defense exports to Hong Kong and will soon require licenses for the sale of items that have both civilian and military uses.The U.S. Congress has also moved to impose sanctions on people deemed connected to political repression in Hong Kong, including police officials.China has said it will impose visa restrictions on Americans it sees as interfering over Hong Kong.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denounced the threat of a visa ban as a sign of “how Beijing refuses to take responsibility for its own choices" and said the law's adoption “destroys the territory’s autonomy and one of China’s greatest achievements."Beijing’s “paranoia and fear of its own people’s aspirations have led it to eviscerate the very foundation of the territory’s success," Pompeo said in a statement.Taiwan on Wednesday opened an office to facilitate migration from Hong Kong.___AP video journalist Johnson Lai in Taipei and producer Wayne Zhang in Beijing contributed to this report.Load-Date: July 1, 2020End of Document

House Passes Rep Malinowski's Provision Barring Exports to China That Can Be Used to Violate Human RightsTargeted News ServiceJuly 22, 2020 Wednesday 7:10 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 570 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Tomaz Malinowski, D-New Jersey, issued the following news release:The House passed Representative Malinowski's bipartisan amendment to the FY 2021 National Defense Authorization Act prohibiting American companies from exporting products and services to China that could be used to commit human rights abuses, including against China's Uyghur minority. As the Chinese government continues to imprison over a million Uyghurs in concentration camps, while subjecting its people to increasingly sophisticated surveillance, the amendment will ensure that American companies are not complicit in Chinese repression.The amendment will require the US government to:* Establish a list of items that could be used by the Chinese government to suppress human rights, including through surveillance of communications, tracking individuals' location, restricting access to the internet, facial recognition, biometrics, detention of dissidents and forced labor in manufacturing.* Require American companies to request a license to export any of those items to China--and deny those requests except in rare circumstances.* Work with like-minded allies to coordinate our regulation of exports to China of those items and services.In recent years, a number of U.S. companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, Intel, Thermo Fisher, and Hewlett Packard, as well as several American universities, have exported goods and services to Chinese security agencies or to Chinese companies involved in domestic surveillance. The House approved a provision restricting this practice in December 2019 as part of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2019, but it was removed by the Senate before that bill was signed by the President.The amendment was submitted with bipartisan support from Representatives Sherman, Curtis, Gallego, Wagner, Omar, Yoho, Yvette Clarke, Gallagher, Andy Levin, Crenshaw, Castro, Cohen, Connolly, Deutch, Waltz, Dingell, and Cicilline."When we see a government loading people onto trains to take them to concentration camps simply because of who they are, we have a moral obligation not just to say something, but to do something. Today, the House sent a clear, bipartisan message that no American company may be an accessory to genocide," said Representative Malinowski (D-NJ)."This sends a clear message that U.S. technology should not be used to further one of the most egregious human rights abuses of our time," said Representative Brad Sherman (D-CA). "Thanks to Rep. Malinowski for putting forward this important amendment.""This bipartisan amendment will help the United States protect the Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in China. It is vital that we prevent the export of technologies used by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to engage in techno-authoritarian oppression in Xinjiang," said Representative John Curtis (R-UT)."The Chinese Communist Party is engaged in rampant human rights abuses in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region, where it is using a dystopian surveillance regime to repress an estimated one million Uighur Muslims and prevent them from practicing their faith. The United States must not be complicit in China's persecution of religious minorities. This provision will free American companies from the fear that their products and technologies are being used to prop up a surveillance state," said Representative Ann Wagner (R-MO).Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7183048 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 22, 2020End of Document

China tells US to close Chengdu consulate in growing spatAssociated Press InternationalJuly 24, 2020 Friday 2:40 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWS; POLITICAL NEWS; STATE AND REGIONALLength: 892 wordsByline: JOE McDONALD, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) — China ordered the United States on Friday to close its consulate in the western city of Chengdu, ratcheting up a diplomatic conflict at a time when relations have sunk to their lowest level in decades.The move was a response to the Trump administration's order this week for Beijing to close its consulate in Houston after Washington accused Chinese agents of trying to steal medical and other research in Texas.China appealed to Washington to reverse its “wrong decision,” and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the current difficulties are completely created by the U.S. side.Chinese-U.S. relations have soured amid a mounting array of conflicts including trade, the handling of the coronavirus pandemic, technology, spying accusations, Hong Kong and allegations of abuses against Chinese Muslims.“The measure taken by China is a legitimate and necessary response to the unjustified act by the United States,” said a foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin.“The current situation in Chinese-U.S. relations is not what China desires to see. The United States is responsible for all this,” Wang said. “We once again urge the United States to immediately retract its wrong decision and create necessary conditions for bringing the bilateral relationship back on track.”Wang said some consulate personnel “interfered in China’s internal affairs and harmed China’s security interests” but gave no details. He said Beijing complained “many times” to Washington about that.Also Friday, the U.S. State Department sent out a notice warning Americans in China of a “heightened risk of arbitrary detention.”“U.S. citizens may be subjected to prolonged interrogations and extended detention for reasons related to ‘state security,’” the notice said.Americans may be detained or deported for “sending private electronic messages critical" of the Chinese government, it said. The notice gave no indication of what prompted the warning.On Tuesday, the Trump administration ordered the Houston consulate closed within 72 hours. It alleged Chinese agents tried to steal data from facilities including the Texas A&M medical system.The ministry on Thursday rejected the allegations as “malicious slander.” It warned the Houston consulate's closure was “breaking down the bridge of friendship” between the two countries.The United States has an embassy in Beijing and consulates in five other mainland cities — Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Shenyang and Wuhan. It also has a consulate in Hong Kong, a Chinese territory.The consulate in Chengdu is responsible for monitoring Tibet and other areas in the southwest inhabited by nonethnic Chinese minorities that are considered especially sensitive by Beijing.Asian stock markets, already uneasy about the uncertain pace of recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, fell Friday on the news of the closure.China’s market benchmark, the Shanghai Composite Index, lost 3.9%. Hong Kong’s main index declined 2.2%.“Alongside the eviction of the Houston Chinese Consulate, the risk of the U.S.-China conflict escalating into a ‘Cold War’ is worrying,” Hayaki Narita of Mizuho Bank said in a report.The consulate in Chengdu was in the news in 2012 when Wang Lijun, the police chief of the major city of Chongqing, visited and told American officials his concerns about the death of a British business associate of the wife of Chongqing's Communist Party secretary, Bo Xilai.That prompted the British Embassy to ask for a new investigation, which led to the arrest and conviction of Bo's wife. Bo was later dismissed and sentenced to prison.The consulate was surrounded by police while Wang was inside. He later emerged and was arrested and sentenced to 15 years on charges of corruption and defection. The U.S. government has refused to confirm whether Wang asked for asylum.In March, American reporters for The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal were expelled from China. That was in response to the Trump administration's decision to limit the number of U.S. visas for Chinese employees of state media.Operations of nine Chinese state media outlets in the United States have been required to register as “foreign missions” due to their ties with the ruling Communist Party. That doesn't affect their ability to conduct reporting but requires them to report their staff and real estate holdings as they would if they were embassies.Also Thursday, the U.S. Justice Department said it believes the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco is harboring a Chinese researcher, Tang Juan, who is accused of lying about her background in the Communist Party's military wing on a visa application.The department announced criminal charges of visa fraud against Tang and three other Chinese researchers. It said Tang lied on a visa application last October as she made plans to work at the University of California, Davis, and again during an FBI interview months later.U.S. authorities this week announced criminal charges against two Chinese computer hackers who are accused of targeting companies that are working on vaccines for the coronavirus.U.S. officials including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have stepped up accusations of technology theft. In a speech Thursday, Pompeo said some Chinese students and others “come here to steal our intellectual property and to take this back to their country.”Load-Date: July 24, 2020End of Document

CHINA'S ZOOM BOMBStates News ServiceJune 16, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 556 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Zoom apparently has no qualms about censoring critics in China. In a statement, the company said, "We shut down the meetings instead of blocking the participants by country." The company apologized for not doing a good job censoring international calls that have participants from Chinabecause the way it did so unnecessarily affected users outside of China. Zoom said it was told by Chinese authorities that it had to "comply with local law," yet Chinese law does not prohibit talking about Tiananmen or participating in international discussions.The company's disregard for freedom of expression is troubling but not surprising. Multinationals often cite "complying with local laws" when they give in to political pressure from Beijing. Apple cited this reason when it removed hundreds of virtual private network (VPN) apps from China's App Store. LinkedIn said the same when it blocked content critical of the Chinese government.Companies that think they can keep "complying with local laws," which are often abusive, but not affect the rights and interests of their customers outside of China are being na¯ve. Apple's never-ending capitulations to Beijing have already affected what people around the world can watch through its streaming services: In early 2018, company management warned the creators of some of the shows on Apple TV+ to avoid portraying China in a negative light. (Apple did not respond to a letter Human Rights Watch sent in November inquiring about its China-related operations.) Hollywood is increasingly censoring its films for Beijing's sensibilities, such as the removal of a Taiwan flag from Tom Cruise's bomber jacket in the recent sequel to the 1986 movie Top Gun.Companies understandably want access to China's huge market. Some 700 Zoom engineers are based in China. The majority of Apple's products are assembled in China. But capitulation hasn't and won't get them to safetyit has made them vulnerable to more demands for capitulation.If each company alone faces a choice between submitting to Beijing's censorship demands and being denied access to the Chinese market, many will surely opt for groveling. But if companies band together to stand up to the Chinese government's bullying, the balance of power could shift. The Chinese government can't get rid of all foreign companies.Companies have a responsibility to respect human rights under the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. They should draft and promote codes of conduct for dealing with China that prohibit participation in or facilitation of infringements of the right to free expression, information, privacy, association, or other internationally recognized human rights. Strong common standards would make it more difficult for Beijing to ostracize those who stand up for basic rights and freedoms. Consumers and shareholders would also be better placed to insist that the companies not succumb to censorship as the price of doing business in China, and that they should never benefit from or contribute to abuses.Facing pressure from within and outside of the company last year, Google terminated a plan to launch a censored search engine in China, saving itself from being complicit in human rights violations. Other companies should do the same.Load-Date: July 28, 2020End of Document

Continue reading Zoom cites Chinese law to defend censorship of human rights activistsZoom says it can t  change the laws of governments opposed to free speech. On multiple occasions in recent weeks, Zoom has reportedly suspended accounts or disrupted meetings involving critics of the Chinese government. In an emailed statement, Zoom didn t deny the      censorship. Instead, the company claimed that as a  global company  it was obligated to comply with the law in countries where it operates including China. We regret that a few recent meetings with participants both inside and outside of China were negatively impacted and important conversations were disrupted,  a Zoom spokesperson wrote.  It is      not in Zoom s power to change the laws of governments opposed to free speech.  Zoom says it will  modify its processes  to better protect users.Some of the people affected were in the United States, which has robust legal protections for free speech.In one incident in early June, Zoom deactivated the account of Zhou Fengsuo, a leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests who now lives in California. The move came days after Zhou      participated in a Zoom meeting commemorating the Tiananmen Square protests, which ended in a massacre of protesters by the government on June 4, 1989. Zoom later restored Zhou s account.On Thursday, Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Lee Cheuk-Yan reported that his account was deactivated on May 22, shortly before he was scheduled to broadcast a public Zoom interview with      another Hong Kong democracy activist, Jimmy Sham. Lee said he couldn t get an explanation or a refund from Zoom. The account was suspended before the talk started. I ve asked Zoom many times whether this is political censorship but it has never replied to me,  Lee said to AFP.The Washington Post reports on a third incident that occurred on June 3, when a meeting about the Tiananmen Square protests  was severed after the Zoom account that hosted it was deactivated      midstream.  The video event initially had more than 200 participants, according to organizers.Similar events have been held using YouTube and Facebook s video streaming services without incident.One reason activists promoting Chinese human rights like to use Zoom is that it s one of the few Western services that isn t blocked in China. But the price of that access is apparently that      Zoom has to engage in a certain amount of censorship including censorship that affects people outside of China.See Campaign:https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/technology/zoom-china-tiananmen-square.htmlContact Information:TIMOTHY B.

Pressure grows in U.S. to stop using Chinese social media TikTok and WeChatCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 13, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1108 wordsBodyWhile Wells Fargo Bank and the National Committees of the Republican (RNC) and Democratic (DNC) parties asked its staff to remove TikTok from the phones they use to work, Peter Navarro, a white house trade adviser, said President Donald Trump is going to "act decisively" against the Chinese app and others, such as WeChat, on the grounds that they are not independent companies but contribute user data to the Beijing intelligence system. On Friday Amazon asked its employees to do the same, and then retracted.Officials in the United States expressed concern about the security of TikTok, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo advised Americans not to download the app, unless they wanted to see their private data "in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party." However, a Morning Consult survey found that 52% of people aged 18 to 29 oppose any restrictions on the app, a young people's favorite; 30 the figure drops to 33 per cent."We've identified a small number of Wells Fargo employees with corporate-owned devices that have installed the TikTok app," a bank spokesman told Business Insider. "Due to concerns about TikTok's controls and privacy and security practices, and because company-owned devices should be used only for the company's business, we have ordered those employees to delete the app."Peter Navarro, a White House trade adviser, said President Donald Trump is going to "act decisively" against TikTok and other Chinese apps, such as WeChat. (REUTERS/)At the same time, according to documents to which CNN had access, in the midst of an election campaign by the presidency of the United States, the RNC and the DNC have warned their staff against the use of TikTok. In the case of the DNC, an internal memo for the campaign teams, committees and state affiliates of the party requested that additional security precautions be taken when using the app.The DNC security team wrote: "We continue to advise campaign staff to refrain from using TikTok on personal devices. If you are using TikTok for campaign work, we recommend that you use a separate phone and account." And Mandi Merritt, in charge of the RNC press, said the committee "advised its employees and other stakeholders not to download the TikTok app to their personal devices for security reasons."As early as December, the DNC had referred to the app as a problem because of "its ties to China and the potential sending of data to the Chinese government" in that internal communication he had also warned about FaceApp, the Russian application that went viral. "Campaign staff should refrain from using foreign apps such as FaceApp and TikTok. If team members have already downloaded and used them, they should delete them and suspend their accounts." And in 2018, the DNC also alerted its staff to the use of devices manufactured by Chinese companies such as ZTE and Huawei.The US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo advised citizens not to download the app, unless they want to see their private data "in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party." (EFE/EPA/JIM LO SCALZO) (JIM LO SCALZO/)TikTok sent a statement to CNN to deny any embezzlement of users' personal data. "Under the leadership of our U.S. CEO and our Computer Security Officer, TikTok's growing team in the United States works diligently to develop a world-class security infrastructure," the company said. It ensured that user information was protected on servers in the United States and Singapore.Speaking to Fox Business, Navarro called TikTok's new CEO Kevin Mayer "puppet". All the data that the app collects from its US users, he added, "goes directly to servers in China, directly to the Chinese military, to the Chinese Communist party and to agencies that want to steal our intellectual property."Navarro also said that "TikTok and WeChat are the ultimate forms of censorship in mainland China" and that is why White House actions were expected also on the popular messaging service, owned by Tencent, which is a common tool in the daily lives of Chinese citizens.Bytedance is the Chinese company that owns the TikTok app.  (REUTERS/Thomas Suen) (THOMAS SUEN/)Forbes recalled that the Committee on Foreign Investment (CFIUS), which analyses international purchases to rule out potential threats to national security, "investigated the purchase of Musical.ly made by TikTok" and that "in January, the Pentagon asked military personnel to remove the app from their phones."Navarro spoke of the "information war" against the United States and said the Trump administration is "just getting started" with the steps to be taken. Nothing would change even if TikTok were sold to an American buyer, Bloomberg stressed, "If you split up as a local company, it doesn't help us," he quoted Navarro. "Because it's going to be worse: we're going to have to give China billions of dollars for the privilege of TikTok operating on the U.S. territory."Navarro also said that Amazon's decision to retract after asking its staff to remove the app from their phones is a "show of the Chinese Communist party's power over American corporations."While TikTok is an app used by young people around the world, WeChat is mostly internal in China, and also serves diaspora and international trades.The difference between restricting the use of TikTok and restricting the use of We Chat, Tech Crunch analyzed, is the affected population segment. "Outside China, those who use WeChat are mostly the Chinese diaspora and international trades with presence or connection with that country, while TikTok is used in all international markets,mainly among young people at the local levels." Within China WeChat is employed in a huge amount of everyday tasks, such as paying a bill or requesting an appointment with the dentist, but outside it is limited to messaging.While it is not yet known what form the restriction will take in the United States, some WeChat users "are already speculating on solutions to stay in touch with their family and friends" in China, according to the technology release. If the Apple Store and Google Play delete the app, they might use another regional store to download the app," for example.

Chinese ambassador lashes out at Western rights reportingAssociated Press InternationalJuly 30, 2020 Thursday 5:14 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 733 wordsByline: DANICA KIRKA, Associated PressDateline: LONDON BodyLONDON (AP) — China’s ambassador to the United Kingdom lashed out at what he saw as one-sided reporting on human rights issues Thursday, presenting a series of videos defending Chinese actions against Uighur Muslims in the northwest Xinjang province and warning Britain to stop meddling in his country's affairs.Ambassador Liu Xiaoming’s presentation stressed that China’s actions in Xinjiang were meant to fight terrorism, and the grainy images he played for reporters included bloody scenes showing the aftermath of attacks.The videos were meant to counter a recent BBC interview in which presenter Andrew Marr had challenged the diplomat to explain drone footage that apparently showed Uighur prisoners being guarded and transferred to trains by Chinese authorities.Liu denied Uighurs were being mistreated and posted screen grabs that challenged, among other things, whether the prisoners were kneeling or sitting on the ground. He described “so-called victims” of human rights violations as being either separatists or “actors trained by anti-China forces in the U.S. and other Western countries.”“There are so many fallacies and lies that permeate Western media,'' he said. “It can be called the lies of the century.”The rising tensions come as U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration push Washington and Beijing toward a new era of ever-growing confrontation.The U.S. government last week imposed trade sanctions on 11 companies it says are implicated in human rights abuses. The sanctions upped U.S. pressure on Beijing over Xinjiang, where the ruling Communist Party is accused of mass detentions, forced labor, forced birth control and other abuses against Muslim minorities.Liu added that disputes over human rights, the imposition of a new security law in Hong Kong and Britain's decision to ban Chinese tech giant Huawei from taking part in building a new high speed phone network had “seriously poisoned the atmosphere" of China's relations with Britain.''“China and U.K. should have enough wisdom and capability to manage and deal with these differences, rather than allowing anti-China forces and Cold War warriors to kidnap (the) China-U.K. relationship,’’ he said.The United States has lobbied its allies to shun Huawei, because it says the Chinese government could use the company’s technology to spy on Western nations. Huawei denies the allegations and argues that U.S. protectionism is behind the move.Britain in recent weeks also suspended an extradition treaty with Hong Kong and offered refuge for millions of eligible Hong Kongers who feel threatened by Beijing’s tightening grip on the semi-autonomous city. Liu reiterated his previous comment that Britain should stop meddling in Hong Kong.“China respects U.K. sovereignty and has never interfered in the U.K.'s internal affairs,'' the ambassador said. “It is important the U.K. will do the same - namely, respect China’s sovereignty and stop interfering in Hong Kong’s affairs, which are China’s internal affairs, so as to avoid further damage to the China-UK relationship.”Liu hammered the point that the U.K. and its people needed to think independently of the hawkish signals coming from the Trump administration. He said Britain was at a “critical historical juncture” in how it wanted to treat China.“It’s our hope that the U.K. would resist the pressure and coercion from a certain country and provide an open, fair, transparent and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese investment so as to bring back the confidence of Chinese businesses in the U.K,” he said.Earlier this month, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited London and applauded British Prime Minister Boris Johnson for the decision to bar Huawei from 5G and other responses to the challenges raised by China. Pompeo said the U.S. supports “those sovereign choices, we think, ‘Well done.’”In another sign of fraying relations, U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab condemned the Hong Kong government's decision to disqualify 12 pro-democracy nominees from a September legislative election. Authorities said they failed to uphold the city’s mini-constitution and pledge allegiance to Hong Kong and Beijing.“It is clear they have been disqualified because of their political views, undermining the integrity of ‘one country, two systems’ and the rights and freedoms guaranteed in the joint declaration and Hong Kong’s basic law,” Raab said.Load-Date: July 30, 2020End of Document

CHINESE CITIZEN CONVICTED OF ECONOMIC ESPIONAGE, THEFT OF TRADE SECRETS, AND CONSPIRACYStates News ServiceJune 26, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 950 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Department of Justice:Defendant Stole from U.S. Companies to Benefit Instrumentality of the Chinese GovernmentHao Zhang, 41, of China, was found guilty of economic espionage, theft of trade secrets, and conspiring to commit both offenses today, announced the Department of Justice. The ruling was handed down by the Honorable Edward J. Davila, U.S. District Judge, following a four-day bench trial.Evidence submitted during the course of the trial demonstrated that from 2010 to 2015, Zhang conspired to and did steal trade secrets from two companies: Avago, a designer, developer, and global supplier of a broad range of analog, digital, mixed signal and optoelectronics components and subsystems with a focus in semiconductor design and processing, headquartered in San Jose, California, and Singapore; and Skyworks, an innovator of high performance analog semiconductors headquartered in Woburn, Massachusetts. Judge Davila found that Zhang intended to steal the trade secrets for the benefit of the People's Republic of China"The defendant plotted with Tianjin University to take trade secrets from two U.S. companies, including his own employer, to China for the benefit of the Chinese Government," said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers. "Today's guilty verdict on all counts is an important step in holding accountable an individual who robbed his U.S. employer of trade secrets and sought to replicate the company's technology and replace its market share. The Department of Justice's commitment to prosecuting these cases should serve as a cautionary tale to anyone considering doing the same.""A free nation is naturally innovative. No nation is more innovative than the United States. Countries without freedom cannot match our innovation, and inevitably must resort to theft. Theft is not innovation. By combatting theft, we protect innovation and freedom," said U.S. Attorney David L. Anderson for the Northern District of California."Economic Espionage is a pervasive threat throughout the United States, particularly to the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley which is the center of innovation and technology," said FBI Special Agent in Charge John F. Bennett. "While this case exemplifies how easily a few motivated employees can conspire to misappropriate intellectual property for the benefit of the People's Republic of China, Zhang's conviction should serve as a warning to our adversaries that the FBI and our partners remain committed to aggressively investigating and prosecuting these crimes."According evidence presented during the bench trial, Zhang stole trade secrets relating the performance of wireless devices. Specifically, Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) and Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) filters are used in wireless devices to eliminate interference and improve other aspects of device performance. Film Bulk Acoustic Resonators (FBAR) are one type of BAW filter. The most common and most profitable application of FBAR technology is as a radio frequency (RF) filter for mobile phones and other wireless devices. Technological advances in FBARs have played a substantial role in creating smaller, more efficient wireless devices for both consumer and military applications. Avago, one of the victims of Zhang's theft, was the leading company in the United States manufacturing and selling FBARs. Zhang's other victim, Skyworks, was developing its own BAW technology.Evidence at trial further showed that in October 2006, Zhang and his co-conspirators started a business in China to compete with Avago and Skyworks. One of Zhang's co-conspirators, Wei Pang, started working at Avago at the same time. Zhang and Pang illicitly shared trade secrets with each other and with co-conspirators in China while they worked for the U.S. companies. Zhang and Pang then connected their venture to Tianjin University (TJU) in China, an instrumentality of the Chinese government. By 2009, they left their work in the United States to relocate to China, following a plan laid out by TJU officials to form another company, Novana, in the Cayman Islands. Along the way, Zhang obtained patents in his own name using trade secret information he knew was stolen from Avago. Zhang also worked with stolen trade secrets in a lab he founded at TJU while developing his new FBAR business. The FBAR processes that Zhang and his co-conspirators stole took Avago over twenty years of research and development to build. Additional evidence during the bench trial demonstrated that Zhang engaged in economic espionage to help TJU and Zhang's Chinese company unfairly compete in the multi-billion dollar global market for cell phone RF filters.Zhang was charged in a superseding indictment returned by a federal grand jury on April 1, 2015.Zhang is currently released on a $500,000 secured bond.Zhang's sentencing hearing is scheduled for Aug. 31, 2020, before Judge Davila in San San Jose. The maximum statutory penalty for each count in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1831 is 15 years in custody and a fine of $250,000, plus restitution if appropriate. The maximum statutory penalty for each count in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1832 is 10 years in custody and a fine of $250,000, plus restitution if appropriate. However, any sentence will be imposed by the court after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. 3553.Michelle J. Kane and Susan Knight are the Assistant U.S. Attorneys who are prosecuting the case with the assistance of Rebecca Shelton, Susan Kreider, and Laurie Worthen. The prosecution is the result of an investigation by the FBI.Load-Date: June 27, 2020End of Document

Good to see you.Some of the top stories that we are watching right now this morning. The Trump administration along with Congress set to start negotiations later today on a fourth coronavirus stimulus bill. That package is expected to be talked about today at 10:30 a.m.The President's chief of staff Mark Meadows telling me yesterday on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and others will meet at the White House this morning.Among the consensus, liability protection for schools and businesses and some form of additional help for American workers. There are some people however, who do not want another stimulus bill at all until the prior money already is allocated and spent.President Trump wants a payroll tax cut included. He says he would consider not signing any measure if that payroll tax cut is not in there.The search for a killer is underway after a federal judge's son is shot and killed and her husband is left in critical condition inside of their New Jersey home. Police say that the gunman was dressed as a FedEx driver when he visited the home of U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas. The FBI says it is looking for one suspect. This shooting comes just days after Salas was assigned to work a case linked to Jeffrey Epstein.Chaos breaking out in Seattle, meanwhile. At least 12 police officers are hurt as riots hit the city and protesters throw rocks and bottles at officers. One of those officers is now in the hospital. Two people have been arrested.

Police in Polk County, Florida were called by the father of one of the victims. He rushed to the scene after his son called him begging him for help. He found his son barely alive and the other two men dead. Police believe there was more than one killer and it is likely that the men knew their murderers.Yesterday Florida logged more than 10,000 coronavirus cases in a day. That made it the fifth day in a row for the Sunshine State. More than 80,000 confirmed cases have been reported just in the last week.Meanwhile, the Bahamas will close its borders to U.S. travelers beginning this Wednesday. The country's acting health minister citing the recent spike in coronavirus cases for that decision.Reopening America certainly among the topics this morning being spoken about in Washington. Governors and local leaders grappling with plans to reopen their economies or slow them down again amid a major uptick in COVID-19 cases.Meanwhile the debate over going back to school is also heating up. President Trump is ordering state and local leaders to reopen schools or risk losing federal funding.On "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" White House chief of staff Mark Meadows weighed in on how we can reopen schools safely.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARK MEADOWS, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: So you will see some new initiatives coming out this week as the President is not only leading but will continue to lead and step up in a number of fronts. One of those that you mentioned just earlier, Maria, is about our schools. How are we going to open our schools and make sure that moms and dads don't have to worry about the safety of our children that are going back to schools.And so there will be over $70 billion that this president has already authorized to work with Congress to try to make sure that we not only keep the classrooms safe but the teachers safe and the students safe. And you will see a very broad five to six points in terms of what we will be doing in terms of making sure that our schools are safe.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now former presidential candidate and former Arkansas governor and Fox News contributor Mike Huckabee.Governor, it's always a pleasure to see you.What do you think about that, opening schools in the middle of all of this?MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: You know, Maria I think, the decision has to come down between what will happen and what might happen. If you know what will happen, and you are guaranteed that all these kids are going to get sick then it's an easy decision.But we are talking about what might happen. Well, there might be a bus accident on the way to school. There might be a tornado hit the campus. There might be a school shooting. There might be a lot of things.You can't close school based on all the things that might happen. So then you take every precaution to try to mitigate the problem. That is what I think the President is proposing to do.But let me tell you what is happening as a result of school closures. Kids are getting further and further behind. It is disproportionately affecting poorer families and single parent families who don't have any way to look after their children other than missing work.We know that the distance learning worked for a few kids but it didn't work for most because parents weren't prepared to deal with it and the schools weren't prepared to deliver it.So when we start to talk about what is happening, what will happen, if we keep the schools closed, we are going to lose maybe at a whole generation of young Americans who will be academically deficient and may never catch up. That is what has to be decided upon.And I do think the President is right to say that if you are not going to open the schools, you are not going to get the money. I mean, you know, if you buy the ticket you get to see the movie. If the movie doesn't run, you got to get the refund. That's how that's supposed to work. I think he is 100 percent right about that.BARTIROMO: Well, especially since we understand now better that we have to live with this. We are going to be living with this for sometime, certainly until a vaccine. Will that be this year next year? Will that be next year.And to keep our kids just, you know, stuck at home and learning a different way, is a big risk. I agree with you.This is all going to be part of the race for the White House as well. People are focused on how the President is leading versus what Joe Biden may do. Biden is still ahead but by a smaller margin than last month leading by 8 points as opposed to the double digits, Mike.Additionally President Trump leads among white voters regardless of college degrees as well. The former vice president leads among black Americans by 64 points his and Hispanic by 30 points. What do you think, Governor.HUCKABEE: Well, I think the President has to get his message out there. He has a done far more, far more, for black Americans than any Democrat president in our lifetimes. The unemployment rate, the sense of opportunity, cutting back on some of the very draconian criminal justice issues that disproportionately affected African-Americans.There were many ways in which this president has a great story to tell. Four years ago he said what have you got to lose? And there were really higher level, not a great number, but a higher level of blacks who voted for him.I think if they'd look at their vote and say, you know what, this worked out better than it did when I used to vote for the guys who took me for granted which is what the Democrats have done. They promised them the moon and they don't give them a -- you know, even a picture of the moon when it's all said and done.I think this president has to tell his story. It has to be also done by a lot of surrogates and I think that is what will happen.BARTIROMO: Lee Carter?CARTER: You know, I'm really curious as you talked about the folks that are most impacted by school closures. You talked about it being single moms, lower socioeconomic people with less money, people under the poverty line. And when you also look at some of the stories that talks about the impact that it's going to have on women in the workers if you don't open schools the again, it's going to set them back, some say up, you know, a generation.There's all issues that when you look at polling and Donald Trump doesn't seem like he's the one that people view as humane or empathetic or sympathetic or those that's on the side of these kinds of issues.How do you think he can address this? Because I think it's really important when look at school openings, you look at some of these policies that really is meant to be lifting people up and supporting single families, people underneath poverty line. How would you advise him to try and sort of re-varnish that image?HUCKABEE: Lee, I think that is a very important point to make, and the President has got to show a level of compassion and concern. He's got to speak in the language that really does speak to women. And women's concerns clearly are safety for their children and security and also, for an educational model that works.They don't want to send their kids to school if they're not going to learn. But they don't want to keep them home if they're not going to learn. And for many families, it's also an issue of nutrition.I know it's hard for a lot of affluent Americans to understand, but I led a state that had a lot of poverty. I'm going to tell you, there are a lot of kids for whom the only really decent nutrition they get on a daily basis is school breakfasts and school lunch. That's another factor that should weigh in on whether schools should open.And I think the President can communicate that but he's got to be consistent and there has be clarity. Those are the two things, that I think sometimes has been difficult because the virus has been a little bit ambiguous. And I think the President's message, again -- clarity, consistency, and compassion -- three things.Let me let me add the third one -- compassion, clarity, consistency.BARTIROMO: It's a -- it's a really good point that you make about the school lunches as well.Governor, it's great to see you this morning. Thank you so much, sir. We appreciate your time.HUCKABEE: You bet. Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Governor Mike Huckabee joining us there.We'll take a break.When come walk Kanye West sparks controversy again during his first campaign event. What he said about some of the business relationships that he has right now, that's coming up.And then Instagram stars, one top influencer tells us how she is composing the world to some of the most outrageous behaviors seen on airplanes. The account landing her on "Rolling Stones" list of top 100 Instagram accounts.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Rapper Kanye West speaking out at his first 2020 campaign event. West touching on many controversial issues, his business ventures and diversity at the top of corporate America, watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KANYE WEST, RAPPER: I am now on the board at (INAUDIBLE). I am now on the board at GAP. And that happened today, or I walk away.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Well, these are businesses that made him rich, Dagen McDowell. What do you make of this?MCDOWELL: I don't want to be an armchair psychiatrist. I hate when people do that. But I think something is wrong. And I hope the fact that Kim Kardashian has been really silent about what is happening with her husband, he was -- kind of went after Harriet Tubman. He was talking about abortion, and -- none of it in its totality made any sense. And I think that the takeaway from everybody online and around the country is that they are worried for him.BARTIROMO: Huh.Steve, what do you think?FORBES: Well, he announced with Forbes a couple of weeks ago he's running for president. Then said he wasn't running for president. Now apparently he is running for president. Got on the ballot of Oklahoma. May get on South Carolina.But Dagen makes a very good point in the sense that he was all over the place. Criticizing Harriet Tubman did not sit well with that crowd because Kanye West said well, she made have freed slave but they ended up working for white people. And the crowd was just scratching their heads. They got him out -- she got him out of slavery.And the abortion thing was very emotional and really resonated with me. But it's all over the place, and it is -- it is going to end up harming him if he doesn't focus on what he is trying to do.BARTIROMO: Yes. Lee Carter.CARTER: So he was all over the place, he is all over the map. The question is, is he going to be able to get on any of the ballots and is this going to be a legitimate run.And by legitimate run, I don't think he is obviously going to win. I'm not sure how seriously people are going to take it but if you look how close the race is in some states. I mean look at 2016, we're talking about a difference in thousands of votes.If he can pull a certain number of votes, he could be a spoiler in this election, despite all of this, you know, inconsistencies, seemingly back- and-forth, incoherent, unresponsive on certain issues.And so the question is could he have an impact as I'm not going to say -- as far-fetched as this might seem in this moment.BARTIROMO: So does he take votes, do you think Lee, away from Joe Biden. Is that what you are saying that's why he's the spoiler?CARTER: I do think he could. I don't think he's necessarily going to take votes away from the President. The President's support is really strong, 75 percent of those who are voting for President Trump are doing so enthusiastically. Only one third of voters who are supporting Joe Biden are doing so enthusiastically. Two-thirds say that it's a vote against some of Trump, not a vote for -- not a vote for Joe Biden. So that, hey could be peeled off.BARTIROMO: Wow. That is fascinating actually.All right. Let's take a break.When we come back robots coming to your restaurants. Looking at the potential job impact of the industry testing out the use of artificial intelligence.We will go there. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Well, how about a technology takeover. Restaurants are turning to robots in places they can't use human employees.Lauren Simonetti with more on this, Lauren.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. So you have met Flippy, right? The $30,000 robot used by burger joints like White Castle to fry and flip. Flippy doesn't get sick and he is germ free.Let me show you Bread bot. Bread Bot makes and dispenses fresh baked bread in minutes. No transit time, no sit-in (ph) packaging.And here is Sally. Sally is a $35,000 machine being used by universities, hospitals and grocery stores to make fresh salad and resurrect the salad bar lost to COVID-19.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RICK WILMER, COE, CHOWBOTICS: I think behavior has been changed significantly and probably permanently for many consumers in terms of especially eating from open food bars and buffets. There's just too many touch points, too many possibilities of spreading disease in those kind of, you know, food experiences.(END VIDEO CLIP)SIMONETTI: CEO Rick Wilmer says demand has more than quadrupled because of the pandemic, saving the salad bar for companies and customers but perhaps jeopardizing the livelihoods of some of the employees.The Brookings Institution finds 36 million jobs are at a high risk of automation in the United States with the highest concentration being in the accommodation and food services industries where 73 percent of all jobs could be lost to robots.The institution also finds automation happens in bursts, specifically after an economic shock when humans become both more expensive and also harder to come by.But remember, while some robots will replace human beings, others will complement them and there will always, always, always be a need for human to create a robot, to repair a robot, and to prepare the input for what the robot handles.So in Sally's case, Maria, the 22 fresh ingredients that the customers choose for their salads. So as we talk about the disruption that coronavirus has caused, the new disruption is coming out of it. Is your job safe not because of the disease but because of the robot takeover?BARTIROMO: Yes. And unfortunately we were expecting robots to take over a lot of jobs before COVID and now it is obviously accelerated this in the face of this disease and this sensitivity to touching things.Great story, Lauren. Thank you. Lauren Simonetti with the latest there on robotics.Dagen, what do you think about this.MCDOWELL: Robots break and you're going to need people to step in when they fail. And I just don't see a lot of these jobs going away any time soon.Salad out of a vending machine, who is going to chop up the -- the goods that are in -- all the yummy things that are in the machine? So I'm not sure how well that would work long run. But -- who knows?BARTIROMO: Ok. All right.Quick break and then the White House is debating more stimulus this morning. Another relief package on the table.Council of Economic Advisers, acting chairman Tyler Goodspeed is here, live next as stimulus talks kick off with Congress back in session today.Then outrageous behavior at 35,000 feet?

Meanwhile the Trump administration along with Congress set to start negotiations today on a fourth coronavirus relief bill. President Trump's Chief of Staff Mark Meadows telling me yesterday on Sunday morning Futures.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin and others will meet at the White House this morning. That meeting is expected at 10:30 AM eastern. Among the consensus, liability protection for schools and businesses along with some form of additional help for American workers. There are still some people who do not want another stimulus bill at all until the prior money already allocated is spent. President Trump wants a payroll tax cut and says he may not sign a package, if one is not included.Joining me right now is Acting Chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Tyler Goodspeed. Tyler, it's good to have you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.TYLER GOODSPEED, ACTING CHAIRMAN, COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS: Thanks very much for having me, Maria.BARTIROMO: What do you think is most important as you look at growth and you expect that we will at some point get back to normal. We know that the liability shield is something that people are agreeing on in terms of a consensus. What else is in terms of a consensus on both sides of the aisle that needs to be in this next bill?GOODSPEED: Well first of all Maria, I would like to pay tribute to the late Congressman Lewis whose leadership in the civil rights movement was certainly a true profile in courage. In terms of a Phase 4, what we're definitely looking at closely is the state of the labor market.At the end of the day, the labor share of income is roughly 60 percent and household spending accounts for 70 percent of the U.S. economy so we simply will not see a full recovery in the U.S. economy until we see a full recovery in the U.S. labor market.And certainly some of the preliminary signs are quite encouraging. We saw two successive months in a row of really blockbuster job gains in May and June with a total of 7.5 million jobs added.The - the biggest on record and exceeding expectations by almost 12 million and so we - we certainly want to continue the strength of that recovery and - and in any Phase 4 discussions, we're - we're going to want to prioritize measures that continue to support that labor market recovery rather than impede it.BARTIROMO: So how important is that unemployment benefit of $600 a week from the federal government on top of state unemployment benefits? Does that go away after January - after July 31 or are you expecting that some form of the federal unemployment benefits stays in place?GOODSPEED: So under current law in the CARES Act, it is scheduled to expire on July 31 but we are in active negotiations with folks on the Hill about some sort of new agreement, moving forward that strikes an optimal balance between income replacement on the one hand and not disincentivizing return to work on the other.And also as you mentioned the President has a number one priority of payroll tax cut, I think there are a number of aspects of a payroll tax cut that certainly recommend themselves to a phase 4 agreement that includes, that first of all, it support take home pay.Second it mitigates the shock to firms' cashflow, particularly among small businesses. Third, it incentivizes hiring. Fourth, it disincentivizes the severance of employer-employee matches. Once those matches are severed, it can be - there can be long term scarring as we - as we witnessed in the aftermath of 2008 and 2009.And - and fifth and finally, it helps unemployed workers. The best thing that you can do to help unemployed workers is to help them get a job.BARTIROMO: Yes, for sure. And I think it's important that you focused on the labor market but you just said that there is an opportunity to replace some income, 50 percent of income or maybe 75 percent of income. Does that mean that you would - you would argue for perhaps $300 in unemployment benefits from the federal level versus the $600 or what?GOODSPEED: Well, there are a lot of different options here and I don't want to get too far ahead of the - the process. However I would say that - that certainly even at $300, you are going to have some workers who will - will face then an implicit tax rate in excess of 100 percent on returning to work.So we would definitely recommend, looking, exploring ways in which we could top up the standard state replacement rate to something between 50 and 100 percent just so that we don't have those really high implicit marginal tax rates on the return to work.BARTIROMO: I see. What is the biggest obstacle that you face at this point in terms of getting something out. We of course, see these spikes across the country. How are you dealing with this expectation that sure, the economy is - is taking a step back with these pauses in terms of reopening but at the same time, we're seeing serious spikes across the country and we're worried about a second wave of coronavirus in the fall.GOODSPEED: Right. I mean the - the number one threat to the continued recovery of the U.S. economy is the coronavirus and I think it's important to bear a few things in mind. First of all, we've been conducting testing on a massive scale and therefore we have observed the changing composition of Covid positives with - with relatively less vulnerable people, disproportionately counting for new positives.But I think in terms of sustaining the recovery, it's important we bear in mind that there are relatively low cost things that we can continue to do, to attenuate the transmission of the disease and protect the relatively more vulnerable populations. Masks are a much less costly method for than shut downs in terms of attenuating the transmission of Covid and there are also additional non-pharmaceutical interventions that we can engage in and that we're working on such as protecting nursing homes and other long term care facilities.Just remember, 10 percent, just 10 percent of nursing homes in this country account for more than a fifth of Covid fatalities.BARTIROMO: What about state aid, Tyler? Lot of sources talking to me about $500 billion there in terms of $500 billion to prevent more furloughs. Is that in the cards in terms of money for the states?GOODSPEED: Well, I think that we're definitely analyzing what the projected revenue shortfalls will be at the state and local levels and - and we'll be considering along with counterparts in the Department of Treasury, the National Economic Council, our friends on the Hill about what the appropriate package there is to do both support state and local governments in their fights against Covid-19.And - and also to ensure that there isn't the introduction of moral hazard.BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. Tyler, we'll be watching the developments. Thanks very much for being here this morning.GOODSPEED: Thanks very much.BARTIROMO: Acting chairman of the NEC, Tyler Goodspeed there. Coming up, taking on China, tensions are rising. What global investor Ray Dalio had to say about the China threat and the tough stance from the administration. Wait till you hear this. He joined me yesterday.Then Instagram's biggest names. We're taking a look at one influencer this morning, who's trying to get her followers to be better airline passengers. Her outrageous stories from 35000 feet next. You're watching Morning with Maria live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back from the skies. The social media stardom created by a former flight attendant, 'Passenger Shaming' is the place to go on Instagram to see people's outrageous behavior while traveling. The popular page was named one of the top 100 best Instagram accounts by Rolling Stone magazine.And joining us right now is the creator of 'Passenger Shaming,' Shawn Kathleen. Shawn Kathleen, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks for being here. Tell us what inspired you to start this account.SHAWN KATHLEEN, CREATOR, PASSENGER SHAMING: Hi, thank you. Good morning and so I'm a former flight attendant and I did it for about seven years and I started a vlog about 2007 so we're at like you're 13 now and the crazy behaviors that I would see working as a flight attendant is what totally inspired me to do this.So once I did the vlog for about, I don't know, maybe five-six years or so, I ended up just making it exclusively photographs and then became 'Passenger Shaming.'BARTIROMO: I love it so you're - you're an insider. You've got the best stories. What are some of the worst things you've witnessed in the air?KATHLEEN: So the worse - I would say hands down, the worst thing that I witnessed was now keep in mind this was during the flight and we were getting ready to lay in, you know maybe about 20 minutes you know on the descent and a gentleman went into the front lavatory and caught his hair on fire while he was smoking, let's say an illegal substance.And that was probably the worst.BARTIROMO: Oh my God.KATHLEEN: And unfortunately it's totally true.BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.KATHLEEN: It was traumatic and horrific at the time and you know, talking like you know fire extinguishers, like doing the whole thing, worrying about a fire in aircraft which is just kind of like the worst thing that could basically happen, right?BARTIROMO: And did the cabin fill up with smoke? I mean, did everybody smell it? I mean how did you - you know -KATHLEEN: The alarm went off. The fire alarm of the lavatory went off.BARTIROMO: Yes, of course.KATHLEEN: And the thing was as far as the smell, it was that waft of the heaviest smell of burnt hair before so that - I mean, that's what I smelt when I approached and when I got to the actual lavatory but prior to that, it wasn't like the cabin filled with smoke. It was just - he literally just caught like this big section of hair on fire.BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. So Dagen McDowell travels a lot on planes. Dagen, you probably have a whole list of stories yourself. Jump in here.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Shawn covers my biggest pet peeve and that is the bare male foot. Females take their shoes off too but men like to take their shoes off on the plane and then stick their bare feet on the arm rest between - between the seats so you'll look down and see some hairy unmanicured feet next to you.That's prominent but is there any - anything so gross that you couldn't even post it on Instagram?KATHLEEN: Probably. I mean of course there are some things that aren't appropriate and aren't within the terms of service that you know, and I will say that I've had things reported and taken down before and then I go into panic mode because I'm like, I don't want to lose you know, that entire account.I feel like there was something pretty gross that I did post on there. I mean obviously there's a lot to choose from like over 1000, right? And I'm with you on the bare feet 100 percent. Male-female, I don't care who it is but a bare foot does not need to be anywhere in the aircraft. Socks yes. You're absolutely allowed to wear socks, it's fine.But please make sure they don't smell and they're clean and they're not up like here and you know in my space and you know what I mean.BARTIROMO: Sure.KATHLEEN: It's just not appropriate.MCDOWELL: Shawn, really quickly.BARTIROMO: Shawn Kathleen.MCDOWELL: One of the best stories in my family involves a giant bag of hard boiled eggs that a woman brought on to a plane and ate because there's - you'll never be able to eat an egg again.KATHLEEN: I get it. I've seen it. Those - there's - there's quite a few pictures, not quite a few but a handful of photos of people that come on aircraft with their big ziplock baggie full of hard boiled eggs. I'm like time out. Let's time out guys. Let's take a breather.BARTIROMO: And you can probably smell that. And then you smell that throughout the plane as well. Hey Shawn Kathleen, you made money on this? I mean, you've - you've been - yes, tell me about this. How did you turn this into a business for yourself to actually profit on Instagram?KATHLEEN: Yes, well, first of all, you know what, I put in the time as far as having to deal with the folks here on the aircraft so you know, hey, there's that but no, I'm kidding. I - I as far as Instagram you know the way it works, obviously there's advertising or sponsorship through partnerships.There's all that fun stuff but that's just a small portion of it so you know, it also - there's offshoots so I do commercials. There are you know, television things, there are video series or whatever that there is, you know that people would like somebody who has some form of expertise in the travel industry which as a former flight attendant.And then you know, with the whole passenger shaming movement but it's yes, I'm with you and I'm just still thinking about the bare feet. I'm sorry.BARTIROMO: That is awesome. Shawn Kathleen, congratulations, this is great.KATHLEEN: This is so bad.BARTIROMO: I am going to be posting some of my own pictures on Instagram later today to show you what I found on airplanes as well. Shawn Kathleen, come back soon. Thanks so much.KATHLEEN: Yes.BARTIROMO: We will keep following you on Insta at Shawn Kathleen. And check out mine as well at Maria Bartiromo. Coming up, Taking on China. Tensions are rising. What global investors Ray Dalio has to say about the China threat and the tough stance from the administration. Stay with us.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: The ultimate ambition of China's rulers isn't to trade with the United States. It is to raid the United States. If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short term rewards but in the end, the PRC's goal is to replace you.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Significant speech last week by Attorney General William Barr, warning American businesses about getting too close to China, collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party, something you heard first on this program, weeks ago.Bridgewater Associates Co-Chairman and founder, Ray Dalio joined me Sunday on Sunday Morning Futures discussing China's economy, investing in China and competing with one of the world's largest economic superpowers.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RAY DALIO, CO-CHAIRMAN AND FOUNDER, BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES: I'm just a practical man who has studied histories and what's happening now is happened all through the history. There has always been the taking of ideas. The British took - hired architects who took from the Dutch who had the ship building and that was their main competitive advantage. It's a reality and I think it's important to see that art.You might say somebody stealing their ideas, well, that's right. I mean, that's just the practicality and in the world you don't have the same kind of rules. It's more of a jungle. You don't have laws and so it's just a practicality -BARTIROMO: So should we just say well, China is going to beat us and should we just sit back and say well, look, this is a threat and that's it?DALIO: No, I think you just have to see it for what it is and deal with it well, right? In other words don't deal with it emotionally. Approach it like a chess game.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Chess game continues just after the interview Hayman Capital Management Chief Investment Officer Kyle Bass tweeted this. He says, "Maria, your show was great today minus Ray Dalio session. Next time he agrees to come on, do what no other journalist has done. Ask him how much the Chinese government has invested in his funds. I believe they have been his biggest investor."Steve Forbes, I want you to weigh in on this. This is an important conversation and obviously, this administration is coming on strong, warning companies not to collaborate with the Chinese government. What do you think about this?STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Well, the key thing is the Chinese have not been willing to obey the rules and they've got to learn, there's going to be a price to pay for and I think this administration is moving forward with that.One of the key things though Maria is getting a coherent strategy to dealing with China such as doing more militarily in the South China Sea to make sure that that remains international waters. Shoring up our alliances with India, not getting in trade disputes but the deepening that alliance, same thing with Japan and not withdrawing troops from South Korea and things like that, which will mean Beijing signals weakness.BARTIROMO: But what about the intellectual property theft? Will they never stop stealing, Steve? I mean look, we just saw an indictment of Charles Lieber who was running the biology - the Harvard Chemistry Department. They lobby these industries, whether it's hedge funds like Bridgewater or Hollywood or -FORBES: That's - that - that - yes well, that's why you would take measures like closing down those Confucius centers and punishing individuals and companies, doing it consistently. You make them pay for it.BARTIROMO: All right, Morning with Maria continues live on Fox Business right after this.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Dagen McDowell, Lee Carter and Steve Forbes. Great show today, everybody. Thank you.Load-Date: July 20, 2020End of Document

RESEARCHER PLEADED GUILTY TO CONSPIRING TO STEAL SCIENTIFIC TRADE SECRETS FROM OHIO CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL TO SELL IN CHINAStates News ServiceJuly 30, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 710 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Department of Justice:Crime is Another Example of Economic Malfeasance Related to the Peoples Republic of China Accommodating Theft of Commercial Products They Cannot Field OrganicallyFormer Ohio woman Li Chen, 46, pleaded guilty today via video conference in U.S. District Court today to conspiring to steal scientific trade secrets and conspiring to commit wire fraud concerning the research, identification and treatment of a range of pediatric medical conditions."Once again we see the People's Republic of China (PRC) facilitating the theft of our nation's ingenuity and hard work as part of their quest to rob, replicate and replace any product they don't have the ability to develop themselves," said John C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security. "Far from being an isolated incident, we see the PRC implicated in around 60 percent of all trade secret theft cases. This continued economic belligerence runs contrary to the values and norms that facilitate the success of our industries and countering it remains among our highest priorities.""Nationwide Children's Hospital's Research Institute took reasonable measures to protect its cutting-edge intellectual property and trade secrets regarding exosomes, and I commend the cooperation of Nationwide Children's throughout this investigation," U.S. Attorney David M. DeVillers said. "Chen betrayed her employer of 10 years by stealing trade secrets from this American institution and transferring them to China after receiving payments from the Chinese government.""Li Chen was a trusted researcher at Nationwide Children's Hospital, conducting cutting-edge U.S. government-funded research," stated FBI Cincinnati Special Agent in Charge Chris Hoffman. "With her guilty plea, she admits that she abused this trust to establish a company in China for her own financial gain. The FBI is committed to working closely with partners such as Nationwide Children's Hospital to protect the innovations that make America a world leader in science and technology."Chen admitted to stealing scientific trade secrets related to exosomes and exosome isolation from Nationwide Children's Hospital's Research Institute for her own personal financial gain.Chen and her husband, alleged co-conspirator Yu Zhou, 49, worked in separate medical research labs at the Research Institute for 10 years each (Zhou from 2007 until 2017 and Chen from 2008 until 2018). They are charged with conspiring to steal at least five trade secrets related to exosome research from Nationwide Children's Hospital.Exosomes play a key role in the research, identification and treatment of a range of medical conditions, including necrotizing enterocolitis (a condition found in premature babies), liver fibrosis and liver cancer.According to her plea agreement, Chen conspired to steal and then monetize one of the trade secrets by creating and selling exosome "isolation kits." Chen admitted to starting a company in China to sell the kits. Chen received benefits from the Chinese government, including the State Administration of Foreign Expert Affairs and the National Natural Science Foundation of China. Chen also applied to multiple Chinese government talent plans, a method used by China to transfer foreign research and technology to the Chinese government.As part of her plea, Chen has agreed to forfeit approximately $1.4 million, 500,000 shares of common stock of Avalon GloboCare Corp. and 400 shares of common stock of GenExosome Technologies Inc.Chen and Zhou were arrested in California in July 2019 and their case was unsealed in August 2019 when they appeared in federal court in Columbus.John C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security;David M. DeVillers, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio; and Chris Hoffman, Special Agent in Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cincinnati Division, announced the plea entered into today before U.S. District Judge Sarah D. Morrison. Assistant U.S. Attorneys S. Courter Shimeall, Peter K. Glenn-Applegate, Special Assistant U.S. Attorney J. Michael Marous and National Security Division Trial Attorney Matthew J. McKenzie, are representing the United States in this case.Load-Date: July 31, 2020End of Document

The decision constitutes "a legitimate and necessary response to the irrational measures of the United States," China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.Intel's results contribute to the stock market crash, as the technology sank more than 10% after announcing that its 7-nanometer chip technology is six months behind schedule.On the Portuguese stock exchange, the trend is of widespread falls, with the EDP Group leading the declines in the PSI-20, correcting recent gains. EDP Renováveis shares fell 1.24% to 14.36 euros and EDP depreciated 0.62% to 4.518 euros. On the second day trading on the stock exchange, the subscription rights to the capital increase of the electric dropped 3.6% to 10.7 cents, continuing to trade at a premium against the shares.Among the remaining heavyweights, Galp Energia fell 0.48% to 10.30 euros, Jerónimo Martins gave up 0.51% to 14.50 euros and BCP devalues 0.57% to 0.1051 euros.Pharol, which today presents the results of the first half, is one of the few PSI-20 quotes trading on positive ground (+0.54% to 0.112 euros).Nos, which yesterday shot almost 10% in reaction to the results, is down 0.71% to 3.942 euros.Load-Date: July 25, 2020End of Document

US Charges 2 Chinese Nationals in Global Hacking CampaignASEAN TribuneJuly 21, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 ASEAN Tribune All Rights ReservedLength: 731 wordsBody 21 July 2020 (Voice of America) Two Chinese nationals have been charged with hacking hundreds of entities around the world, including U.S. biotech companies developing COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, while working with China's security services. Li Xiaoyu, 34, and Dong Jiazhi, 33, were charged in an 11-count indictment unsealed in the eastern district of Washington state Tuesday, marking the first time U.S. prosecutors have indicted Chinese hackers for what they termed the "blended threat" of working for the Chinese state while also targeting victims for personal gain. John Demers, head of the Justice Department's national security division, accused China of aiding cybercriminals. "China has now taken its place, alongside Russia, Iran and North Korea, in that shameful club of nations that provide a safe haven for cybercriminals in exchange for those criminals being 'on call' to work for the benefit of the state, here to feed the Chinese Communist party's insatiable hunger for American and other non-Chinese companies' hard-earned intellectual property, including COVID-19 research," Demers said at a news conference. Li and Dong, former classmates at an electrical engineering school in China, performed two complementary roles during the hacking campaign, according to the 27-page indictment. While Dong researched victims and carried out reconnaissance, Li hacked networks and stole information, it said. The two remain at large. The indictment alleges that the pair were aided by intelligence officers at China's Ministry of State Security, an agency previously implicated in economic espionage. The unidentified agents were not charged. According to the indictment, the hacking campaign began in 2009 and continued through early July when the two men were charged. Targeted industries included high-tech manufacturing, gaming software and solar energy. The victim companies were located in the United States, Australia, Belgium, Germany, Japan, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Spain, South Korea, Sweden and Britain, among other places. Hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of trade secrets, intellectual property and other business information was stolen, it said. In recent months, as U.S. biotech firms began developing vaccines, treatments and testing for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, the hackers unsuccessfully sought to target their research, the indictment alleges. In addition to attacking businesses, the hackers infiltrated the online accounts of Chinese dissidents, clergy and rights activists in the United States, China and other countries, providing their personal information to the Chinese government, according to Demers. Stolen email accounts and passwords belonging to a Hong Kong community organizer, the pastor of a Church in China, and a former Tiananmen Square protester were given to the Ministry of State Security, according to the indictment."These intrusions are yet another example of China's brazen willingness to engage in theft through computer intrusions contrary to their international commitments," including a 2015 understanding with the United States, Demers said. The indictment comes as U.S. officials raise the alarm about Chinese efforts to steal U.S. intellectual property as part of a broader effort to supplant the United States as the world's only superpower.FBI Director Christopher Wray, on July 7, called China's economic espionage the "greatest long-term threat to our nation's information and intellectual property, and to our economic vitality." Almost half of the nearly 5,000 active FBI counterintelligence cases are related to China, Wray said, adding that the bureau is adding a new counterintelligence case related to China every 10 hours. Attorney General William Barr said on Thursday that China is engaged in an "economic blitzkrieg" against the United States, accusing U.S. businesses of bowing to Chinese pressure in pursuit of profit. China rejected U.S. allegations of IP theft and economic espionage. "Some U.S. politicians seem to be alleging time and again that China is waging cyberattacks to steal U.S. research on COVID-19 vaccines," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said last week. "Our top researchers don't need to secure an edge by theft. As we speak, Chinese research teams are moving ahead with multiple vaccine tasks through five technical routes." Load-Date: July 22, 2020End of Document

TILLIS, COLLEAGUES URGE TIKTOK SCRUTINY OVER ELECTION SECURITY SPECIFICALLY, THE SENATORS WRITE THAT TIKTOK COULD ENABLE THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY (CCP) TO ENGAGE IN INFLUENCE OPERATIONS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING OPERATIONS DESIGNED TO INTERFERE WITH OUR ELECTIONSStates News ServiceJuly 29, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 945 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis:This week, U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Marco Rubio (R-FL), and Rick Scott (R-FL) sent a letter to Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Christopher Wray, and Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf expressing concern over the Chinese social-media service TikTok.Specifically, the Senators write that TikTok could enable the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to engage in influence operations against the United States, including operations designed to interfere with our elections.The Senators request answers to the following questions regarding TikTok:Do you believe ByteDance's ownership of TikTok gives the CCP an opportunity to conduct influence operations within the United States, including campaigns directed at changing the outcome of elections?Given the CCP's control over ByteDance, is it possible Chinese officials could direct TikTok's employees to amplify or suppress certain political content for U.S. users?Could the CCP direct networks of bots to create or boost its preferred political content on TikTok and other social-media platforms?If evidence emerges of CCP electoral interference via TikTok, would ByteDance be eligible for sanctions under President Trump's September 12, 2018, executive order on foreign electoral influence?What other Chinese social-media applications and technology corporations present vectors for election interference in the United States?The full text of the letter can be found below or here.Dear Director Ratcliffe, Director Wray, and Acting Secretary Wolf,We write to raise concerns about TikTok, the Chinese social-media service, which could enable the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to engage in influence operations against the United States, including operations designed to interfere with our elections.The Trump Administration has rightly taken steps to maintain the security and integrity of our elections. As President Trump stated in Executive Order 13848 in September 2018, "the proliferation of digital devices and internet-based communications has created significant vulnerabilities and magnified the scope and intensity of the threat of foreign interference." The administration has acted decisively on this threat by forcing media outlets controlled by hostile state actors like Russia and China to register as foreign agents, imposing sanctions on foreign officials who attempted to meddle in American elections, and issuing repeated warnings about efforts by hostile foreign powers to interfere in upcoming elections.TikTok has become a popular forum for Americans-particularly younger Americans-to engage in political conversations. I'm greatly concerned that the CCP could use its control over TikTok to distort or manipulate these conversations to sow discord among Americans and to achieve its preferred political outcomes.TikTok is owned by the Chinese firm ByteDance, and the majority of the company's engineering and development resources are based in China. ByteDance regularly modifies TikTok content to satisfy CCP censorship rules. In 2019, the Washington Post reported that ByteDance employees based in China set TikTok's content standards and issued commands to remove TikTok content they deemed "subversive or controversial." In November 2019, TikTok locked the account of an American teenager who posted a video critical of the CCP's horrific crimes against the Uighur people in China. TikTok only reversed this act of censorship and unlocked the young woman's account after a public outcry.The CCP devotes significant resources to conduct information operations overseas. Beijing exploits the openness of Western democracies and social-media platforms to propagate the Party's preferred narratives. The CCP conducts these influence operations by coopting traditional media outlets, spending tens of millions of dollars to purchase space in major U.S. newspapers for propaganda by state-owned outlets like China Daily, and working to ensure Chinese state television channels like CGTN dominate Chinese-language media overseas. The CCP also manipulates overseas political discussions on Chinese-owned social media platforms like WeChat. Chinese government officials increasingly use Western social-media companies, including those banned in China, to flood global social media with propaganda and misinformation.With this history in mind, we respectfully request answers to the following questions about TikTok:Do you believe ByteDance's ownership of TikTok gives the CCP an opportunity to conduct influence operations within the United States, including campaigns directed at changing the outcome of elections?Given the CCP's control over ByteDance, is it possible Chinese officials could direct TikTok's employees to amplify or suppress certain political content for U.S. users?Could the CCP direct networks of bots to create or boost its preferred political content on TikTok and other social-media platforms?If evidence emerges of CCP electoral interference via TikTok, would ByteDance be eligible for sanctions under President Trump's September 12, 2018, executive order on foreign electoral influence?What other Chinese social-media applications and technology corporations present vectors for election interference in the United States?Thank you for working to ensure the integrity of our elections from Chinese interference, which is important in order to maintain the American people's trust in the democratic process. We look forward to hearing from you.Sincerely,###Load-Date: July 29, 2020End of Document

K-pop fans deserve credit for Trump rally activismCNN WireJune 22, 2020 Monday 9:37 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1264 wordsDateline: (CNN) BodyEditor's note: Euny Hong is the author of "The Power of Nunchi: the Korean Secret to Happiness and Success" (Penguin 2019), "The Birth of Korean Cool: How One Nation is Conquering the World through Pop Culture" (Picador 2014) and "Kept: A Comedy of Sex and Manners" (Simon & Schuster 2006). She was previously an editor at France 24 in Paris, a columnist at the Financial Times, and a Fulbright Young Journalists Fellow in Berlin. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.  (CNN) --  Trump's under-attended rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Saturday had an unexpected M. Night Shyamalan-esque twist: K-pop fans and Gen Z-ers had executed a social media putsch to drive down attendance. They made hundreds of TikTok videos encouraging fellow users to sign up for tickets to the rally (the rally organizers had not placed a cap on tickets), and then not turn up. While the true impact of these videos is unknown, K-pop "stans" (stalker fans) claim that their fake registrations might number in the hundreds of thousands, as the New York Times reported. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted her thanks to K-pop fans for their "contributions in the fight for justice." Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale, who probably should study up on the Streisand effect, drew more attention to the matter by rubbishing the role of the TikTokers. Social media is teeming with speculation that some unidentified party was mucking about in a US election, Russian-style, using the TikTok algorithm to viralize the ticket purchase exhortation videos. The app's Chinese origins did nothing to quell conspiracy theories. Vice journalist Tim Pool tweeted dramatically, "One of the tactics used by Russia to meddle was the use of social media to manipulate public perception. This is a Chinese app facilitating the largest most impactful election meddling we have seen yet, assuming its true." TikTok stated in October of 2019 that it does not operate in China, and has denied that US user data is stored on Chinese servers, and, most crucially, "We are not influenced by any government, including the Chinese government." I am the first person to be skeptical of any corporate-ese defense. But even if TikTok is lying, why make the leap that the Chinese Communist Party has any interest in catfishing American teenagers using fake K-pop social media accounts? Has the Party interfered in other viral interests of this demographic, like high school prom-posals or the TV show "Riverdale"?Another Twitter user implied that K-pop accounts were Chinese in origin. A congressional hopeful tweeted, "Hey, @aoc--- How many of these 'teens' were US Citizens?" A right-wing lawyer and self-described satirist asked, "Did @aoc use the Chinese Communist-party owned @tiktok_us to interfere in a Presidential election??" Such theories, while amusing, make no sense. Anything is possible, of course, but it seems more plausible by an overwhelming margin that K-Pop fans deserve the credit for their Trump rally activism. As a former math geek, I was curious about the inner workings of the allegedly manipulated TikTok algorithm, but I did not even see evidence that the conspiracy theorists knew what an algorithm was. Calling this a conspiracy is dismissive, provincial and racist -- for more than one reason. First of all, such pooh-poohing implies that Asian music couldn't possibly be popular enough in the US to mobilize action on this scale. It also severely underestimates the eagerness of Gen Z K-pop fans to support the Black Lives Matter movement. Earlier this month, in the days following the death of George Floyd, K-pop fans flooded the Twitter hashtag #whitelivesmatter with K-pop memes and fancams so they could mute the online reach of hateful posts. The Occam's razor explanation for the TikTok rebellion is the most accurate one: when there are competing explanations for an occurrence, the simpler one is better. Despite the doubters, the simple reality is that yes, there really are this many K-pop fans in the US: last year, for example, BTS became the first band since the Beatles to have three albums hit number one on the Billboard top 200 within a one-year period. Furthermore, K-pop bands are very active on TikTok, which may explain the platform's popularity among global K-pop fans. While it's true that the Korean government were early investors in exporting Korean pop culture, it's not true that BTS is funded by the government. No one is messing with the algorithm.In 2012, after Psy's "Gangnam Style" became a sensation, a white male editor I know was irrationally perturbed. He told me, "There is no way the 'Gangnam Style' video really had a billion people viewing it. The Koreans paid 100,000 people in China to click on the link 100,000 times." The nice word for that theory would be "illogical." Have you seen "Gangnam Style?" If you haven't, trust me -- it's not the video that South Korea wants to be remembered for. These allegations about Trump's rally have an undercurrent of the type of denial that happens at an empire's end -- in this case, the American inability to accept that a US political event could be that easily eclipsed by another country's pop culture. Someone with the handle @CultureWarlord made a claim I've heard many times in anti-fan e-mails addressed to me, "There is no such thing as 'KPop allies.' All these KPop accounts are Chinese phone farms. Big expose coming." Why will a certain type of person refuse to believe that people outside Korea, especially Americans, like K-pop that much? This resistance may be rooted in the same mentality that causes many Americans to resist the metric system, soccer and wearing masks during global pandemics. They see such phenomena as foreign and possibly emasculating invasions. The most knee-slapping bit of this whole incident was that it had some pretty powerful people quaking in their boots over a force even scarier than foreign hackers, and from a demographic that can't even vote yet: the mighty Gen Z, who were the driving force behind the action. Oh how we underestimated them. In the last decade or so, after broadband became cheap and ubiquitous, the Cassandras of the world were terrified what would become of the first generation in history to be raised with easy access to all the information in the world. Many parents worried in the back of their minds that their children might become early porn addicts or have a shaky moral compass dictated either by apathy or aggression fueled by violent multi-user videogames. Imagine the grown-ups' collective surprise that Gen-Zers found an unprecedented, terrifying way (to the President and his supporters, at least) to wield influence? Though some referred to the teens' activism in more derisive terms as a "prank," Twitter was still a-Twitter with chuffed parents boasting that their teen had trolled the leader of the free world. We live in strange times, in which the truism "correlation is not causation" seems less and less accurate. You wouldn't assume that being a Trump supporter would correlate with refusal to wear a mask during a deadly epidemic, but the photos of that under-attended rally are an unmistakable -- if spotty -- sea of bare faces. And you wouldn't think that K-pop fans and Gen-Z social media addicts would become a defining force against white supremacy, yet here we are. And they're just warming up. Next time, it will seem less like a prank and more like the Velvet Revolution... yet entirely online.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

WOMAN WHO WORKED AT LOCAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR 10 YEARS PLEADS GUILTY TO CONSPIRING TO STEAL TRADE SECRETS, SELL THEM IN CHINAStates News ServiceJuly 30, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 597 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: COLUMBUS, OH BodyThe following information was released by the United States Attorney's Office Southern District of Ohio:A former Dublin, Ohio woman pleaded guilty via video conference in U.S. District Court today to conspiring to steal exosome-related trade secrets concerning the research, identification and treatment of a range of pediatric medical conditions.Li Chen, 47, also pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit wire fraud.Chen admitted to stealing scientific trade secrets related to exosomes and exosome isolation from Nationwide Children's Hospital's Research Institute for her own personal financial gain.Chen and her husband, alleged co-conspirator Yu Zhou, 50, worked in separate medical research labs at the Research Institute for 10 years each (Zhou from 2007 until 2017 and Chen from 2008 until 2018). They are charged with conspiring to steal at least five trade secrets related to exosome research from Nationwide Children's Hospital.Exosomes play a key role in the research, identification and treatment of a range of medical conditions, including necrotizing enterocolitis (a condition found in premature babies), liver fibrosis and liver cancer.According to her plea agreement, Chen conspired to steal and then monetize one of the trade secrets by creating and selling exosome "isolation kits." Chen admitted to starting a company in China to sell the kits. Chen received benefits from the Chinese government, including the State Administration of Foreign Expert Affairs and the National Natural Science Foundation of China. Chen also applied to multiple Chinese government talent plans, a method used by China to transfer foreign research and technology to the Chinese government."Nationwide Children's Hospital's Research Institute took reasonable measures to protect its cutting-edge intellectual property and trade secrets regarding exosomes, and I commend the cooperation of Nationwide Children's throughout this investigation," U.S. Attorney David M. DeVillers said. "Chen betrayed her employer of 10 years by stealing trade secrets from this American institution and transferring them to China after receiving payments from the Chinese government.""Li Chen was a trusted researcher at Nationwide Children's Hospital, conducting cutting-edge U.S. government-funded research," stated FBI Cincinnati Special Agent in Charge Chris Hoffman. "With her guilty plea, she admits that she abused this trust to establish a company in China for her own financial gain. The FBI is committed to working closely with partners such as Nationwide Children's Hospital to protect the innovations that make America a world leader in science and technology."As part of her plea, Chen has agreed to forfeit approximately $1.4 million, 500,000 shares of common stock of Avalon GloboCare Corp. and 400 shares of common stock of GenExosome Technologies, Inc.Chen and Zhou were arrested in California in July 2019 and their case was unsealed in August 2019 when they appeared in federal court in Columbus.David M. DeVillers, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio; John C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security; and Chris Hoffman, Special Agent in Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cincinnati Division, announced the plea entered into today before U.S. District Judge Sarah D. Morrison. Assistant United States Attorneys S. Courter Shimeall, Peter K. Glenn-Applegate, Special Assistant United States Attorney J. Michael Marous and National Security Division Trial Attorney Matthew J. McKenzie, are representing the United States in this case.# # #Load-Date: July 30, 2020End of Document

Zoom admits it complied with Chinese request to suspend activist accountsiCrowdNewswire (English)June 12, 2020 Friday 2:05 PM GMTCopyright 2020 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 510 wordsBodyTwo of the activists are based in the US. Zoom has admitted that it interrupted three Tiananmen Square anniversary meetings and suspended their hosts  accounts upon China s request.

Continue reading Zoom admits it complied with Chinese request to suspend activist accountsTwo of the activists are based in the US.Zoom has admitted that it interrupted three Tiananmen Square anniversary meetings and suspended their hosts  accounts upon China s request. The video conferencing service has posted a response      regarding the actions it took against Lee Cheuk-yan, Wang Dan and Zhou Fengsuo who are based in the US and Hong Kong.Zoom says it received notices from China in May and early June about four large Tiananmen Square commemoration meetings, which the Chinese government considers as illegal activities. It      explained that a US-based team reviewed the participants in those meetings and found that two of them had a significant number of participants in mainland China.The other two didn t have participants from the mainland, but China apparently insisted that one of the hosts previously held a video meeting it considers illegal that was attended by mainland      participants. As a result, three hosts were suspended, though their accounts have since been reinstated. Wang Dan and Zhou Fengsuo, two of those hosts, were student leaders during the 1989      Tiananmen Square protests and are now based in the US. Wang told Reuters:  Zoom compiled with China s request  It cannot get away with just a statement. We shall continue to use legal means and      public opinion to ask Zoom to take responsibility for its mistake. While it admitted to complying with China s demands, Zoom said it didn t provide its government with any user information or meeting content. It also denied that it has a backdoor someone (i.e.      authorities) can use to enter meetings without being visible. The company defended its decision to interrupt the meetings and suspend the hosts, as well, explaining that it doesn t have the      ability  to remove specific participants from a meeting or block participants from a certain country from joining a meeting. As a response to Zoom s admission, some US lawmakers are now asking the company to clarify its ties with the Chinese government. Zoom has yet to respond, but in its post, it vowed not to let      requests from Chinese authorities affect anyone outside mainland China going forward. To make sure it can stay true to its word, it s now developing technology that will enable it to block      users based on their location. It s also improving its global policy and outlining it as part of its transparency report due out on June 30th.See Campaign:https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/06/11/improving-our-policies-as-we-continue-to-enable-global-collaboration/Contact Information:Mariella MoonTags:, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: August 18, 2020End of Document

FBI: China's cyberattacks amount to "largest transfer of wealth in human history"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 8, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 434 wordsBodyThe United States has hardened its criticism of China, reiterating accusations of espionage and computer attacks, and theft of information, including related to coronavirus.This time, the charges came from FBI Director Christopher Wray, who, in statements issued on Tuesday, said China's cyberattacks against the United States represent "one of the greatest transfers of wealth in human history.""There could be more at stake, and the potential economic damage to American businesses and the economy as a whole almost defies calculations," Wray said of the Chinese government during a speech at the Hudson Institute."To achieve its goals and surpass the United States, China recognizes that it needs to make a leap in cutting-edge technology, but the sad reality is that instead of getting involved in the hard work of innovation, China steals American intellectual property and then uses it to compete against the American companies themselves that have victimized, actually committing a double fraud" Added.Asked whether the United States had an estimate of the financial damage the Chinese government has caused to the U.S. economy, Wray said he did not have an exact number, stressing, however, that "all the numbers I've seen are breathtaking.""Confronting this threat effectively does not mean that we should not do business with the Chinese, it does not mean that we should not receive Chinese visitors, it does not mean that we should not welcome Chinese students or coexist with China on the world stage," Wray explained. "It just means that when China violates our criminal laws and international norms, we will not tolerate it, let alone allow it."Wray's words come after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo threatened to ban TikTok, among other Chinese applications due to national security concerns. Pompeo explained in an interview monday with Fox News that the Trump administration will look at the infrastructure of Chinese applications, as it did with telecommunications giants Huawei and ZTE.In his statements, the FBI director recalled a joint statement with the Cybersecurity Agency in May, which said attacks on U.S. organizations conducting research related to covid-19 by "cyber actors affiliated with the People's Republic of China" were being investigated.According to the statement, hackers were caught trying to "illegally identify and obtain valuable intellectual property" and public health data related to coronavirus research. "The possible theft of this information compromises the delivery of safe, effective and efficient treatment options," the statement said, quoted by CNBC.Load-Date: July 9, 2020End of Document

MCSALLY: CONGRESS MUST HOLD CHINA ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR MALEVOLENT BEHAVIORStates News ServiceJuly 22, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1053 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: U.S. SENATE BodyThe following information was released by Arizona Senator Martha McSally:U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) spoke on the Senate floor this afternoon to discuss actions she's taken in the Senate to hold the Chinese Communist government accountable for its malevolent actions against the United States.Watch her remarks HERE and see the transcript below:Mr./Madam President,I served 26 years in the military. In my last years in service and since then, we have seen the threat of the rise of China. It's a threat to America's security, our jobs, and our role as the leader of the world. They are on a deliberate path to try to dominate the world and shape it into their vision, and they need to be stopped.When I was a cadet at the Air Force Academy, we had an honor code that said: "I will not lie, cheat, or steal, or tolerate among us anyone who does." Well China has been lying, cheating, and stealing for far too long. Americans are now waking up to this threat and are resolved to change this trajectory and hold China accountable. But this cannot be done by us alone. Our European partners and others, Pacific and elsewhere, need to join with us and also wake up to China's dangerous path and work with us to stop them.We have been calling this geostrategic shift a return to "Great Power Competition" as if to assume that we are all playing by the same rules. We aren't. China is playing by their own rules and cheating the system for their own gain and power. The Chinese Communist Party is a reckless predatory adversary that is dedicated to subverting U.S. interests and supplanting our nation as the world's dominant leader. Over the past 10 years, China has increased their military spending by 85 percent. Their investment in defense has been used to build their Navy, expand their missile stockpile, and emerge as a leader in technologies like hypersonics, cyber warfare, and artificial intelligence.This build up has been far from defensive alone. From their illegal maritime claims among several sovereign states, building artificial islands where they didn't exist before and then militarizing them in the South China Sea with their maneuvers and exercises that are aggressive and belligerent, to their covert attempts to infiltrate the U.S. through our universities and stealing our technology, Chinese forces are expanding their tentacles far beyond their own borders to the detriment of American national security interests.Congress must do our part to respond to this threat. For these reasons, I introduced several pieces of legislation that immediately stop China from taking advantage of government funds and taxpayer dollars to purchase products and services from Chinese companies with ties to the Chinese military.To end our reliance on China's control over manufacturing of PPE, I introduced legislation to authorize the president to incentivize American companies to produce medical devices, equipment, and drugs. We saw in the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, it's very clear that outsourcing the production of PPE to an adversary was wrong and risky. I witnessed firsthand the ingenuity of Arizona companies that stepped up to help fill the gap. That's no excuse for ignoring the fact that we must bring the manufacturing home of vital medical equipment like PPE, so that it will once again be made in America!Finally, the coronavirus outbreak has taken a catastrophic toll on our country and the world. Make no mistake: This virus began in China and spread globally because the Chinese government lied about what they knew about it and they destroyed evidence and they silenced doctors and whistleblowers.Like the rest of the nation, Arizona has suffered devastating consequences due to this pandemic. Already, we have lost over 2,900 Arizonans, plus the economic toll.Communist China unleashed this virus on the world and it should face severe repercussions for their coverup and lies about the origins and spread of the virus. China's actions cost lives and devastated the world economy. It must be held accountable.I moved to do just that this week by introducing the Civil Justice for Victims of COVID Act. Americans who have been victimized by the lies and deceit of the Chinese Communist Partyto include those who lost loved ones, suffered business losses, or were personally harmeddeserve the opportunity to hold China accountable and to demand just compensation and I appreciate many of my colleagues joining me on this legislation.It is due time that we hold China accountable for their malevolent behaviornot just over the past several months, but over the past several decades.The United States must take immediate action and, with strength, demonstrate that the greatest country in the world will not be taken for a fool. Our Republic and the freedoms that it stands for will allow our country to prevail over China's communist and rogue agenda. With American will, American innovation, and the American spirit we will prevail.And with that Mr/Madame Speaker, I yield the floor.Earlier today at a U.S. Senate Committee on Banking Hearing, McSally asked national security and economics experts about the best way for the U.S. to financially disentangle itself from China without harming American national security.Watch McSally's questioning from that hearing HERE .Background:On July 21, 2020, Sen.

Sen. Gardner Calls on FBI and CISA to Bolster National Cybersecurity Infrastructure to Counter Chinese and Russian InterferenceTargeted News ServiceJuly 18, 2020 Saturday 1:47 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1040 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Cory Gardner, R-Colorado, issued the following news release:U.S. Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy, called on Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Chris Wray and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Director Chris Krebs to pursue immediate additional efforts to bolster U.S. national cybersecurity infrastructure against threats from Russia and China, particularly as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic."The successful pursuit of a COVID-19 vaccine will benefit the entire world, not just those living in the United States," wrote Senator Gardner. "Ensuring proper assistance to U.S. universities, laboratories, and our international partners in these efforts is critical to making the world a safer place."* * *Dear Director Krebs:I write to urge that your agency pursue immediate additional efforts to bolster our national cybersecurity infrastructure against threats from Russia and China, particularly as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic.Recently the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) released a report outlining Russian interference in COVID-19 vaccine development, including ongoing efforts Russian-espionage-linked APT29 ("Cozy Bear") has undertaken to steal intellectual property and disrupt critical COVID-19 research.That report included a warning that APT29 "is likely to continue to target organisations [sic] involved in COVID-19 vaccine research and development, as they seek to answer additional intelligence questions relating to the pandemic." There are also indicators of compromise and detection rules as well as mitigation protocol included in the report.On May 13, 2020, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) announced concern about threats from Chinese government-backed hackers working to disrupt COVID-19 research. Today's announcement of similar Russian interference, while unsurprising, is deeply concerning and yet another example of unacceptable subversive activity.Thankfully your agency works closely with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to understand the global threats landscape and protect critical U.S. infrastructure. I am urging you to redouble your efforts with the FBI and our international partners to protect against these and similar threats.In light of these serious threats, I am also urging CISA to work directly with potentially impacted U.S. entities engaged in COVID-19 research that may have suffered breaches related to either Russian or Chinese state-based hacks. Without adequate Federal support, these attacks pose serious risks to our national critical infrastructure in the healthcare sector and beyond.Russia and China have a long history of using state-backed entities to disrupt U.S. initiatives across a range of fields. This is one of many reasons I have advocated listing Russia as a state sponsor of terror and will continue to advocate increased pressure on China, as well. The Asia Reassurance Initiative Act (Public Law 115-409), which I authored, authorized $500 million for cybersecurity cooperation to combat malicious actors in cyberspace.The successful pursuit of a COVID-19 vaccine will benefit the entire world, not just those living in the United States. Ensuring proper assistance to U.S. universities, laboratories, and our international partners in these efforts is critical to making the world a safer place.

Continue reading Chinese engineers found guilty of stealing trade secrets from U.S. tech firmMicron Technology is a U.S. chipmaker that produces storage and memory chips including RAM, flash memory chips and others. Before it was placed on the Entity List and banned from its U.S.    supply chain, Huawei accounted for 13% of Micron s sales. Having American firms lose business was not the goal of placing Huawei on the list but it was an unfortunate side effect.The three engineers involved in the scheme have been fined and will go to prisonThis past Friday, according to Bloomberg, a court in Taiwan ruled that engineers from United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) had stolen trade secrets from Micron. These engineers were accused of      giving the IP to a company operating on the mainland backed by the Chinese government. Theft of intellectual property is one of the problems that the U.S. government and American companies have      with China. The district court of Taichung ended up ordering that UMC pay Micron 100 million New Taiwan Dollars (equivalent to $3.4 million USD) and found three UMC engineers guilty of theft or      assisting in the act. The three were sentenced to prison terms between 4.5 and 6.5 years and were also fined between 4 and 6 million New Taiwan Dollars ($135,000-$202,400 USD).Even though China was caught red-handed, the communist Chinese government has continually denied that its companies steal trade secrets. The verdict comes at a bad time as the country tries    to become a major player in semiconductors. The largest foundry in the country, SMIC, is arguably two years behind global leaders such as TSMC and Samsung; the pair are the two biggest    independent foundries in the world. After the verdict was announced, Micron said,  The misappropriation of trade secrets and their transfer outside of Taiwan is detrimental to the country s    entire semiconductor industry and threatens future competitiveness. This judgment further reinforces the importance of intellectual property protection in Taiwan, demonstrating that criminal    misappropriation will be appropriately addressed.  UMC said that it will appeal the decision and that it did not violate Micron s trade secrets. In a statement of its own, the company said,  In    its appeal against the ruling and the excessively disproportionate penalty, UMC will cite many irregularities in both the investigation and the case itself. According to the indictment, UMC    employee Rong Leh-tian instructed UMC s Kenny Wang to use Micron s design for UMC products in order to reduce the time it takes UMC to develop chips. The third engineer from UMC that was    involved, J.T. Ho, was working for both UMC and Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co. The latter is a Chinese chip manufacturer that benefited from the IP theft. Both Ho and Wang copied Micron s    DRAM data onto their own devices and used it while developing such chips for UMC. In rendering its verdict, the court said,  J.T. Ho earned two salaries respectively from UMC and Jinhua, so it is    very clear he intended to use [Micron data] on mainland China. Kenny Wang and Rong Leh-Tian both leaked Micron s trade secrets to UMC for the use of UMC s relevant business units   and the final    research was to be transferred to Jinhua for mass production, so they had the intention to use [Micron s data] in mainland China. The defendants  conduct has led to Micron s loss of advantage and    competitiveness in the market of products connected to the leaked trade secrets and undermined Micron s interests.  The defendants were paid for their illegal activities. Ho received 5 million    New Taiwan Dollars ($168,700 USD) from both UMC and Jinhua. UMC paid Wang 1.5 million New Taiwan Dollars ($50,600 USD) and Rong 1.6 million New Taiwan Dollars ($54,000 USD). The penalties    announced by the court will force the trio to give back those payments and more.See Campaign:https://www.phonearena.com/news/chinese-engineers-found-guilty-of-stealing-IP-from-us-firm_id125314Contact Information:Alan FriedmanTags:, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: August 19, 2020End of Document

China seeks to expand into the grope as it sees world map of confrontationsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 21, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1945 wordsBodyChina has not yet solved the coronavirus crisis on its territory, but it already feels the winner in the "global ranking" of pandemic management and in the confrontation over who will lead the scientific and technological revolution that will mark the second half of the 21st century. And this "pride" is leading Xi Jingping's government to make mistakes and risk too much to impose his iron hand on what he considers "my world." It confronts India for territory in Kashmir, erases Hong Kong's autonomy, arms artificial islands for misilithic bases and takes other territories in the disputed China Sea, confronts the United States in a tough trade war, threatens to invade Taiwan and launches a cyberattack against Australia. China is expanding to the mittens.While Donald Trump's administration appears to be renouncing global leadership, Xi Jingping's regime is very pleased to occupy the place its rival is leaving. The coronavirus pandemic reinforced the overall impression that the United States is a decadent superpower, which is soon to be supplanted by a strategically skilled and economically dynamic China. The old story of the rise and fall of the great powers would seem to have a new chapter, now written by a virus.infographic: Marcelo Regalado.Although the American economy still surpasses China and remains much stronger and more stable, the Chinese Politburo consolidates its global trade and tries by all means to show a friendly face in the face of trumpist mood. And he does so by playing mainly within the framework of standards designed by the United States as a great architect of the world order after World War II. On the same day that Donald Trump sent a letter to the World Sauld Organization (WHO) harshly criticizing his management of the pandemic and threatening to withdraw its funding, the Chinese president was one of the few heads of state to participate in the opening of the organization's annual assembly. In his speech, Xi Jinping appreciated and praised WHO's management and stressed the importance of multilateralism."The great paradox is that China is succeeding because it is advancing in compliance with the laws imposed by Washington," says Kishore Mahbubani, in his book "China Won Won? The Chinese challenge to American primacy." "A concrete example: the man who saved China was Den Xiaoping in 1979. It adapted to the free market system and this system is a gift from the U.S. to the world. China went a step further and joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) accepting the strict conditions imposed by the United States," adds Mahbubani, a Singapore diplomat who served as the presidency of the UN Security Council.An Indian army convoy moves along a road leading to Ladakh in Kashmir, following clashes with Chinese troops on the disputed border of the Himalayas. REUTERS/Danish Ismail (DANISH ISMAIL/)It was Richard Nixon who brought China into the international system with a job that took him from 1967 to 1972. "We simply cannot afford to leave China forever out of the family of nations, " he said inthat time the then American president. The ideologue of the approach was his secretary of state, Henry Kissinger. And after several secret trips, indirect communications through other countries and a ping pong exhibition, the UN recognized the People's Republic of China in October 1971. In February of the following year, Nixon made his historic visit to Beijing. Although China was a founding member of the United Nations, until then the agency recognized only Chiang Kai-shek's government, folded on the island of Taiwan since the victory of Mao Zedong's Red Army in 1949.From then on, China went from being an international out paria to consolidating and strengthening the system to becoming a superpower. In 2000, China's contribution to the overall UN budget was $12 million, equivalent to 1% of the total. 20 years later, its contribution is 367.9 million (12%), making it the second largest contributor. In the Security Council, China and France are the countries that blocked the least resolutions. Of the 122 measures that were vetoed between 1971 and 2019 it did so 14 times (11.5% of the total) while the United States holds the record with 80 (65.5%). "China really believes in multilateralism. After 100 years of humiliation between 1814 and 1914, now his main desire is to regain his greatness. The Chinese believe they were humiliated because they isolated themselves from the rest of the world. Now they're opened and they're doing very well. It's normal for China to say 'I love these rules,'" Mahbubani says in his book. And Fareed Zakaria, author of 'The Post-American World', reminded us in his Foreign Affairs magazine article that Beijing "has not been going to war since 1979; he has not used lethal military force abroad since 1988; and has not financed or supported armed insurgents since the early 1980s."China expands and supports totalitarian regimes such as Venezuela's. REUTERS/Jorge Silva. (Jorge Silva/)All this until the days of 2020. The pandemic accelerated all processes, including chinese expansionism. This is how the last week Chinese and Indian soldiers clashed in the disputed region of the Galwan Valley in Kashmir. The confusing reports speak of 20 dead Indian troops and another untermined number of Chinese. In early May, tension increased in that area after Indian media reported that Chinese forces had set up tents, dug trenches, and moved heavy equipment several miles into the territory that India considers its own. The action came after the New Delhi government built a road to reach an air base that has between the Himalayan mountains. Below, there is the conflict in Tibet. China rejects the relationship between the Indian government and the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader who fled to India after the failed Tibetan folk uprising of 1959.India and China share a 3,440-kilometer border. Since the 1950s, China has been refusing to recognize the division designed during the British colonial era. In 1962, the dispute led to a brief but brutal war between the two countries, which ended with the humiliating Indian defeat. Now, they are confronted by the power aspirations of both countries. China favors Pakistan – India's traditional rival since the 1947 Partition – with investments of more than $60 billion and seeks to cut Indian trade expansion in South Asia.The Beijing government ended the autonomy that Hong Kong had guaranteed until 2047. EFE/EPA/JEROME FAVRE. (JEROME FAVRE/)The movements of Asian power are not exactly subtle in the South China Sea. The People's Liberation Army (ELP) has already announced that in August it will take possession of Hainan Island, and possibly the Mighty Islands, controlled by Taiwan and claimed as part of its Guangzhou province. On 18 April, China declared the establishment of two new administrative districts: one in the Spratly Islands and one in the Paracel. Located both in the same area of the South China Sea, the Spratlys are contested by China, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Brunei; while the Paracels are claimed by China, Vietnam and Taiwan. Within this presence in conflict areas, China mobilized in recent months an unprecedented number of helicopters and army and coast guard ships to waters of Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia. Although Indonesia has no territorial dispute with China, the vast archipelago protested the illegal incursion of Chinese fishermen around its Natuna Islands in late March. Add to this the artificial islands that Beijing has been building for five years to support its expansion. All these islands have a high geostrategic and economic value. Its waters store a lot of natural resources, especially oil and gas. It also runs one third of the world's maritime traffic, and is one of the areas of the planet with the greatest ictacultural wealth.Just a few days ago, Xi Jiangping's government ended the theory of "one Chinese, two systems" designed by Deng Jiaping when Britain returned the former Hong Kong colony in 1997. The Sino-British Joint Declaration that ruled the handover of the colony says Hong Kong's way of life and capitalist system would remain unchanged until 2047. But last month, the Chinese People's Assembly (the congress that responds to the line marked by the PCCH) passed a national security bill that effectively criminalizes dissent against Beijing in Hong Kong territory and could also extend to the other small autonomous region of Macau and the island of Taiwan. The new law controls "possible secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference" in the city. And, above all, it was approved to stop the anti-government riots and pro-democracy turmoil that have rocked Hong Kong for more than a year.Beijing builds artificial islands to impose its sovereignty in the South China Sea and announces that it will invade several other disputed islands.Concern from the pro-democracy movement and the international community is now centered on Taiwan. The island is located 120 kilometers from the Chinese coast through the Taiwan Strait. It has remained outside Beijing's control for more than 70 years, but the Chinese central government considers it a renegade province and always promised to establish the Communist party regime on the island. Taiwan withstood all the ramming for reunification thanks to the fundamental supportU.S. military, albeit without official recognition of its independence. But now, Xi Jingping seems convinced that it is time to move much further and that the Trump Administration will not intervene if the Red Army takes control of Taiwan. China's Chief of the Chiefs of Staff, General Li Zuocheng, said last week that the military will "take all necessary steps to decisively crush any separatist plots or actions" in Taiwan "if the possibility of peaceful reunification is lost."The obscure handling of information on the new coronavirus, which allowed its rapid expansion around the world, also caused China serious problems with two other major trading partners: nearby Australia, which was from the first countries to demand a thorough investigation of how Covid-19 and the handling of the crisis by Beijing, and the European Union , which not only added to that request for non-investment but, through its highest excuvitive body, accused Xi's regime of mounting a spectacular disinformation campaign.But in recent days there was even more tension on these two fronts: Camberra's government reported that in the last month it was under cyberattack that, according to Prime Minister Scott Morrison, "came from a sophisticated system that can only handle one state." Three government sources confirmed to the Reuters agency that the "cyber attack" came from China and that they were probably looking for information on the development of a Vaccine to Combat Covid-19 that is being developed alongside European university laboratories.While on Friday, the EU's senior representative for foreign policy, Josep Borrell, called for a "fair trial" for Chinese human rights lawyer Yu Wensheng, sentenced to four years in prison for "incitement to subversion against the state." The Chinese authorities arrested Yu in January 2018, a few days after he was discharged from law for publicly calling for reform to live "with freedom, democracy, human rights and a rule of law."China takes advantage of the chaos of the pandemic and expands with its monstrously huge country style. Like an elephant, he walks slowly and safely to support his huge paw with which he leaves the mark his imperial mark.MORE ON THIS TOPIC:China ends Hong Kong autonomy and now goes for TaiwanLoad-Date: June 22, 2020End of Document

U.S. tries to turn China into next Iran: Eli LakeCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 9, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 859 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- Between the pandemic and the protests, it was easy not to notice. But over the past few months, the United States has been quietly adjusting its approach to China, going beyond President Donald Trump's tweets and speeches.Since April, the Trump administration has warned federal pension funds not to invest in indices whose portfolios include large Chinese companies. It has tightened export control regulations, suspended visas for students and regime officials, and pressured by more transparent accounting standards for Chinese companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges. Last month, the State Department required a second Chinese state media group to register as a foreign agent with the Department of Justice. In addition, administration officials tell me that they are currently debating whether to follow India's example and pressure U.S. platforms to withdraw the Chinese social media app, TikTok.Individually, these measures are no big deal. Together, however, they represent a serious effort to decouple the economies of the U.S. and China, the deepest shift in American strategy since Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon visited Beijing in 1972.For nearly half a century, the two countries have leaned towards economic interdependence. And although he enriched the Chinese nation, he failed to tame it.Covid-19 somehow exposed the failure of this approach. China manipulated the World Health Organization and retained data on the pandemic. In the U.S., the health industry faced a shortage in the early weeks of the crisis of essential medical items made in China, such as surgical eye caps. If the U.S. had prepared for alternative supply chains, it would have had greater accessibility to vital equipment.The management's policy shift has been subtle. In early 2018, he launched a campaign against Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant that U.S. intelligence agencies believe is controlled by the People's Liberation Army. With mixed results, management pressured allies to ban Huawei circuits and equipment on their 5G networks, warning that Huawei's involvement in the next generation of wireless communications would give China listening points across the world's digital infrastructure.In April, after the coronavirus unleashed in the United States and the world, the administration began targeting the communist system both rhetorically and bureaucraticly.The latest element of this campaign is a White House letter sent this week to the president of the U.S. Railroad Retirement Board, urging him to divest the hundreds of millions of dollars in pensions he controls of companies that support the Chinese army and participate in the mass detention and "re-education" of the Uighur minority in Xinjiang province.The letter reveals a window into the Trump administration's strategy to make elements of the Chinese economy toxic to financial markets. He warns that the board is investing in China "at a time of growing uncertainty about China's relations with the rest of the world." These concerns, the letter says, "include the possibility of future sanctions or boycotts" that may arise due to a number of Crimes by China, ranging from the "blamed actions of the Chinese government with respect to the covid-19 pandemic" to the "militarization of the South China Sea." Other risks include the abolition of Hong Kong's democracy, the contravention of U.S. sanctions againstIran and human rights abuses against Uighurs.This approach should be familiar to anyone who has followed U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East. Before President Barack Obama imposed secondary sanctions against Iranian oil and its central bank, private groups such as United Against a Nuclear Iran pressured investors to divest from companies and banks doing business with Iran's economy.So far, there is no evidence that this strategy has deterred China. Indeed, Iran and China began negotiations this week for a new strategic pact aimed in part at circumventing U.S. sanctions.Another problem is that the president himself tends to be capricious when it comes to the policies of his own government. As John Bolton, Trump's former national security principal, wrote in his memoir, the president sought China's help for his re-election campaign and privately told China's leader that he did not care if China built Uighur detention camps. In 2018, Trump ordered the Commerce Department to withdraw sanctions against Chinese telecoms company ZTE after she was caught bypassing U.S. sanctions.Some are concerned that this policy may be little more than a ploy in trade negotiations. "It could be transactional," said Anders Corr, editor of the Journal of Political Risk. "It could be retaliation to achieve a better trade agreement."That's always a risk with Trump. But the dangers of investing in China will continue to exist, whether Trump is president or not. Regardless of your motivations or the timing, the administration's campaign will have a useful purpose if you have Western corporations re-evaluate your relationship with an American adversary.Original Note:The U.S. Is Trying to Turn China Into the Next Iran: Eli Lake©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: July 10, 2020End of Document

US parliamentarians call on Zoom to clarify its ties with ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 12, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 447 wordsBodyBy Brenda Goh12 jun (Reuters) - Three US lawmakers have asked Zoom Video Communications Inc to clarify its data collection practices and relationship with the Chinese government after the company said it had suspended some user accounts on demand from Beijing.The California-based company has been under pressure after three activists from the United States and Hong Kong said their accounts had been suspended and meetings were interrupted after attempting to hold events related to the anniversary of China's Tiananmen Square crackdown.Zoom said Friday that it received a notification from the Chinese government about the events in May and early June, and that the authorities asked it to take action. It said it had now reinstated these accounts and will not allow China's new requests to affect users from outside the country."We do not provide any user information or content of the meeting to the Chinese government," Zoom said in a statement. "We don't have a back door that allows someone to enter a meeting without being visible."The internet meeting platform, which has increased its popularity with confinements to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, has experienced a barrage of downloads in China.The service is not blocked in the Asian country, unlike many Western platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, which abandoned efforts to break the Chinese market years ago due to the government's demands to censor and monitor content. On Thursday, Twitter said it had removed accounts linked to a Beijing-backed disinformation campaign.Representatives Greg Walden, chief Republican of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, and Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a member of a consumer subcommittee, on Thursday sent a letter to Zoom's CEO Eric Yuan, asking him to clarify the company's data practices, whether he shared with Beijing and whether he encrypted user communications.Republican Senator Josh Hawley also wrote to Yuan asking him to "choose a side" between the United States or China.The three politicians have previously expressed concern with the Chinese company ByteDance, which owns TikTok, which is being investigated by US regulators about the personal data handled by the video application."We appreciate the communication we have received from several elected authorities and look forward to working with them," said a Zoom spokesman.China's internet control body, China's Cyberspace Administration, did not immediately respond to a request for faxed comments from Reuters.(Information from Ayanti Bera on Bengaluru and Brenda Goh in Shanghai; additional information from Lun Tian Yew and Huizhong Wu in Beijing; Translated by Michael Susin in the writing of Gdansk)Load-Date: June 13, 2020End of Document

I had been reporting frequently that winter on Chinese government human rights violations: They frequently occurred, and my job was to report news.About 20 years ago the Chinese Communist Party started attacking CNN in the state-controlled media and through loyalist internet trolls as part of a hostile foreign media conspiracy. Their goal was to convince the Chinese public that our reporting was biased and couldn't be trusted. These tactics worked pretty well, and have continued ever since. It was inconceivable to me then that the President of the United States, members of his political party, media outlets loyal to him, and his fans would also demonize CNN and other American news organizations as enemies of the people.My job as a reporter in China included trying to ask questions at government press conferences where authorities peddled lies and half-truths constantly. If somebody had told me that two decades later, White House press briefings would be that way too, I would have accused them of peddling dystopian science fiction. But here we are. My China reporting PTSD sometimes gets triggered if I watch those briefings on TV.President Donald Trump has taken a page right out of the CCP's playbook, even as he moves to punish China for having "ripped off the United States." On Friday, he announced that he will remove Hong Kong's special trading status in response to Beijing's crackdown on civil liberties there. Yet even as he takes this position, his own efforts to bend the law, demonize the press, lie to the American public, and keep himself in office by suppressing the vote, threaten to make America more like China.The United States is, for now if we can keep it, a democratic, open society in which people can hold their government accountable, even if imperfectly. Whether Americans can prevent a descent into authoritarianism depends on the survival of robust independent civic space for activism and public discourse. Such spaces can only survive and thrive if they are protected by the rule of law. Instead our civic space is being attacked by the President and his allies in Congress. Authoritarian leaders like China's Xi Jinping bend the law to serve their purposes and reinforce their power. Trump is trying to do the same. China has one of the world's strongest liability regimes for internet companies: social media platforms face severe legal penalties if content appearing on their platforms threatens the Communist Party's version of reality. Last week my feelings of déjà vu grew even stronger when Trump issued an executive order targeting social media companies after Twitter attached fact-check warnings to two of his tweets in which he claimed that the use of mail-in ballots would inevitably lead to election fraud. Under the guise of defending free speech, his executive order threatens to revoke social media platforms' immunity from legal liability under current US law for setting and enforcing rules for users' content and determining how it is displayed, including adding corrections to users' postings. Trump and his supporters, "Alice in Wonderland"-style, claim they are the ones defending free speech against alleged corporate censorship. But it effectively seeks to impose legal and regulatory penalties on any social media platforms that dare to challenge or contradict his statements, including disinformation about the voting process. As states shift to the widespread use of absentee ballots in an effort to protect voters from contracting Covid-19, experts have warned that disinformation about the voting process could suppress voter turnout and weaken the legitimacy of the result. The President is not only the source of such disinformation. He is trying to make it harder for social media platforms to warn the public, in the same way that they have taken steps to warn people about falsehoods related to Covid-19.Legal experts on both the left and right do not believe Trump's order will hold up in court. But it has already dealt a blow against our nation's electoral processes and institutions. It has granted political permission to attack social media companies if they enforce their rules against disinformation known to cause harm -- whether it is dangerous medical misinformation about Covid-19 or disinformation about the voting process that is an attack on the American people's right to accountable self-governance.In 2018 after the Chinese Communist Party effectively anointed Xi president for life, Trump was recorded as saying to supporters: "I think it's great. Maybe we'll have to give that a shot someday."Americans -- and citizens everywhere -- have a right to receive and share correct information about how to vote and other facts related to the voting process. Otherwise, elections are neither fair nor free. We must not allow the nation's dominant political party to use a distorted funhouse argument about free speech to twist the law to the point that the president's word cannot be challenged. Unless we really do want to give him a shot at president for life, just like his counterpart in Beijing.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

US: Prosecutor's office claimed that a FBI wanted investigator is hidden at Chinese consulate in San FranciscoCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 23, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 681 wordsBodyThe prosecution reported Wednesday that a Chinese investigator who lied to the FBI about his membership in his country's military university entered china's consulate in San Francisco on June 20 last june and has remained there ever since.He had been interviewed by FBI investigators regarding an alleged visa fraud, according to documents to which he had access to the Axios site.If the information were confirmed, China would be using one of its diplomatic facilities in the United States to house someone accused of a federal crime, which could cause serious tensions between the two countries, at a time when the relationship is going through a complex time.In particular, the United States has taken a number of strong measures in recent times against Chinese espionage and the theft of investigation information, including the closure of that country's consulate in Houston.A man walks his dog through the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, Texas, United States. July 22, 2020. REUTERS/Adrees Latif (Adrees Latif/)"It is very unusual for a Chinese diplomatic post to be so closely associated with a suspect in a case involving intellectual property theft," said Axios, Minyao Wang, a New York lawyer who has worked on China-related intellectual property theft cases.On Tuesday night, indeed, the United States closed the Chinese consulate in Houston, a move that, according to State Department spokesman Morgan Ortagus, intends to "protect American intellectual property and americans' private information."According to documents filed on July 20 in the San Francisco division of the United States Court for the Northern District of California, Tang Juan came to the United States on a J-1 visa and began working as a researcher at the University of California.In his visa application, Tang stated that he had no affiliation with the People's Liberation Army (PLA), as the Chinese army is also known. However, further research revealed that he worked at the Air Force Military Medical University (FMMU), an EPL-affiliated university in China, and is therefore considered active military personnel.Chinese President Xi Jinping attends the closing session of the National People's Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, on May 28, 2020. REUTERS/Carlos García Rawlins (CARLOS GARCIA RAWLINS/)After obtaining a court order, the FBI found his home and found evidence of his affiliation.On June 26, Tang was finally charged with visa fraud. After that, he would have taken refuge at the Chinese consulate in San Francisco."As the Tang case demonstrates, the Chinese consulate in San Francisco serves as a safe harbor for an EPL officer to avoid prosecution in the United States," prosecutors said.In addition, according to the same source, the U.S. Prosecutor's Office reported the case to China, so the Asian country was informed that it wasof a fugitive from justice.For their part, federal prosecutors believe this is not an isolated case. By contrast, Tang's case could be one of several officers "part of a program undertaken by THE PLA, and specifically, FMMU or partner institutions, to send military scientists to the United States with false alibis or false statements about their true employment."Mike Pomeo and Donald Trump. EFE/YURI GRIPAS (EFEI0658/)One of those other possible cases involved a military scientist who had allegedly been led by military superiors to steal information from an American institution. In other cases, the Chinese government ordered military scientists to destroy evidence, before helping them leave the United States, according to court documents.Last May 29, the White House issued an executive order banning the entry of certain Chinese students and researchers from PLA-linked universities, stating that they are "at high risk of being exploited or co-opted by the CPR authorities" to serve as "non-traditional intellectual property collectors."MORE ON THIS TOPIC:US says China works on creating 'world's most advanced army' by stealing Western technologyU.S. ordered the closure of the Chinese consulate in HoustonLoad-Date: July 24, 2020End of Document

GARDNER CALLS ON FBI AND CISA TO BOLSTER NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE TO COUNTER CHINESE AND RUSSIAN INTERFERENCEStates News ServiceJuly 17, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1108 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Colorado Senator Cory Gardner:Today U.S. Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy, called on Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Chris Wray and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Director Chris Krebs to pursue immediate additional efforts to bolster U.S. national cybersecurity infrastructure against threats from Russia and China, particularly as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic."The successful pursuit of a COVID-19 vaccine will benefit the entire world, not just those living in the United States," wrote Senator Gardner. "Ensuring proper assistance to U.S. universities, laboratories, and our international partners in these efforts is critical to making the world a safer place."The full text of the letter to Director Krebs is available here and below:Dear Director Krebs:I write to urge that your agency pursue immediate additional efforts to bolster our national cybersecurity infrastructure against threats from Russia and China, particularly as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic.Recently the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) released a report outlining Russian interference in COVID-19 vaccine development, including ongoing efforts Russian-espionage-linked APT29 ("Cozy Bear") has undertaken to steal intellectual property and disrupt critical COVID-19 research.That report included a warning that APT29 "is likely to continue to target organisations [sic] involved in COVID-19 vaccine research and development, as they seek to answer additional intelligence questions relating to the pandemic." There are also indicators of compromise and detection rules as well as mitigation protocol included in the report.On May 13, 2020, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) announced concern about threats from Chinese government-backed hackers working to disrupt COVID-19 research. Today's announcement of similar Russian interference, while unsurprising, is deeply concerning and yet another example of unacceptable subversive activity.Thankfully your agency works closely with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to understand the global threats landscape and protect critical U.S. infrastructure. I am urging you to redouble your efforts with the FBI and our international partners to protect against these and similar threats.In light of these serious threats, I am also urging CISA to work directly with potentially impacted U.S. entities engaged in COVID-19 research that may have suffered breaches related to either Russian or Chinese state-based hacks. Without adequate Federal support, these attacks pose serious risks to our national critical infrastructure in the healthcare sector and beyond.Russia and China have a long history of using state-backed entities to disrupt U.S. initiatives across a range of fields. This is one of many reasons I have advocated listing Russia as a state sponsor of terror and will continue to advocate increased pressure on China, as well. The Asia Reassurance Initiative Act (Public Law 115-409), which I authored, authorized $500 million for cybersecurity cooperation to combat malicious actors in cyberspace.The successful pursuit of a COVID-19 vaccine will benefit the entire world, not just those living in the United States. Ensuring proper assistance to U.S. universities, laboratories, and our international partners in these efforts is critical to making the world a safer place. I look forward to staying in contact on these issues.The full text of the letter to Director Wray is available here and below:Dear Director Wray:I write to urge that your agency pursue immediate additional efforts to bolster our national cybersecurity infrastructure against threats from Russia and China, particularly as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic.Recently the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) released a report outlining Russian interference in COVID-19 vaccine development, including ongoing efforts Russian-espionage-linked APT29 ("Cozy Bear") has undertaken to steal intellectual property and disrupt critical COVID-19 research.That report included a warning that APT29 "is likely to continue to target organisations [sic] involved in COVID-19 vaccine research and development, as they seek to answer additional intelligence questions relating to the pandemic."

EXCLUSIVE-China-supported hackers attacked modern biotechnologyCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 30, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 534 wordsBodyBy Christopher Bing and Marisa TaylorWASHINGTON, 30 jul (Reuters) - Chinese government-related hackers attacked the biotechnology company Moderna Inc, a major developer and researcher of a U.S.-based coronavirus vaccine, according to a U.S. security official who follows Chinese cyberattacks.Last week, the U.S. Department of Justice released charges against two Chinese citizens accused of spying on the United States, including three unidentified country-based targets involved in the medical investigation to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.The indictment claims that Chinese hackers "performed reconnaissance" against the computer network of a Massachusetts biotech firm that was working on a coronavirus vaccine in January.Moderna, which is based in Massachusetts and announced its COVID-19 vaccine candidate in January, confirmed to Reuters that she had been in contact with the FBI and had been informed of the alleged "information-awareness activities" of the hacker group mentioned in last week's indictment.Recognition activities can include a wide variety of actions, including polling public internet sites for vulnerabilities to scan important accounts after entering a network, cybersecurity experts say."Modern remains highly vigilant to potential cybersecurity threats, maintaining an in-house team, external support services, and good relationships with outside authorities to continuously assess threats and protect our valuable information," spokesman Ray Jordan said, declining to deliver more details.The U.S. security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, offered no further details. The FBI and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declined to disclose the identities of companies attacked by Chinese hackers.Moderna's vaccine candidate is one of the Trump administration's first and biggest bets to fight the pandemic. The federal government is supporting the development of the company's vaccine with nearly $500 billion and has helped Moderna conduct clinical trials on up to 30,000 people starting this month.China is also developing a vaccine, joining efforts by the state, army and the private sector to combat a disease that has killed more than 660,000 people worldwide.The July 7 indictment released last week holds that Chinese hackers Li Xiaoyu and Dong Jiazhi carried out attacks for a decade that recently included among their targets groups conducting medical research on COVID-19.Prosecutors said Li and Dong acted as contractors for China's Ministry of State Security, a state intelligence agency. Messages left to several accounts registered under Li's alias, oro0lxy, were not answered. Dong's contact details were not available.The Beijing embassy in Washington referred Reuters to a recent statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating that "China has long been a major victim of theft and cyberattack" and that its authorities "strongly oppose and fight" such activities.The Chinese government has consistently denied any role in the incidents of computer attacks around the world. The embassy spokesman did not address specific questions sent by email.(Report by Christopher Bing and Marisa Taylor; Edited in Spanish by Ricardo Figueroa)Load-Date: July 31, 2020End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 28 of 350DOJ says Chinese hackers targeted coronavirus vaccine research  Page 30 of 350Pompeo Calls for U.S.-European Unity to Answer 'China Challenge'  Page 33 of 350UK backtracks on giving Huawei role in high-speed network  Page 36 of 350UK backtracks on giving Huawei role in high-speed network  Page 39 of 350On Senate Floor, Portman Urges Passage of Safeguarding American Innovation Act to Protect COVID-19 Research  Page 42 of 350Justice Department opposes Google, Facebook cable link to Hong Kong  Page 44 of 350Huawei security chief: UK ban is not related to US claims of security risks  Page 47 of 350A new world war over technology  Page 51 of 350China's Telecoms Market Analysis 2020-2025 - Chinese Telecommunications Sector Set to Remain Steady Amid Uncertain Economic Outlook Due to COVID-19 Pandemic  Page 55 of 3502020 Insights into the Diammonium Hydrogen Phosphate (DAP) Markets in China - ResearchAndMarkets.com  Page 57 of 350GOLDEN, COLLEAGUES INTRODUCE BILL TO HOLD CHINA ACCOUNTABLE, PROTECT AMERICANS DURING COVID-19  Page 59 of 350Diplomatic war between London and Beijing on Huawei's behalf  Page 61 of 350Scandal grows: Zoom admitted he closed pro-democracy activists' accounts by order of the Chinese regime and will continue to do so  Page 65 of 350China Enzymes Market Report 2020: Historical Data (2009, 2014 and 2019) and Long-term Forecasts through 2024 and 2029 - ResearchAndMarkets.com  Page 67 of 350RESEARCHER CHARGED WITH ILLEGALLY USING U.S. GRANT FUNDS TO DEVELOP SCIENTIFIC EXPERTISE FOR CHINA ARRESTED WHEN PREPARING TO BOARD CHARTER FLIGHT TO CHINA  Page 69 of 350Zoom gives way to China's pressures and blocks some users  Page 73 of 350CARPER, COONS, COLLEAGUES INTRODUCE BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION TO STOP THEFT OF US RESEARCH AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BY GLOBAL COMPETITORS  Page 76 of 350APP'WHAT BULLIES DO': REP.
