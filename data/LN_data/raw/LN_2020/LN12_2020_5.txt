Coronavirus: which is the safest place to sit on a plane and reduce the risk of contagionCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 30, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1249 wordsBodyA new global health threat puts the health systems of dozens of countries in check. A new virus emerging in China is not sympawhile of reports of contagions and deaths. It is a new strain of coronavirus called 2019-nCoV that has already claimed the lives of 132 people and infected more than 6,000 people.Since then the virus has moved to nearly 15 other countries and as a result major airports have begun examining passengers for detection, and more than half a dozen airlines have begun cutting off their flights to mainland China. But those measures can't provide much comfort to anyone who has to board a flight.While there is still much to learn about the Wuhan outbreak, scientists know a little about similar coronavirusand and other respiratory diseases like flu. So how do these viruses spread, and specifically on airplanes?Respiratory diseases usually spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes, drops of saliva, mucus, or other bodily fluids. If any of those drops fall on a person, or if you touch them and then, for example, touch your face, it can also become infected. These drops are not affected by the air flowing through a space, but fall quite close to where they originate.Viruses would prefer to be wet, and many will disappear from being infectious if they are allowed to dry for too long (Shutterstock)Respiratory diseases can also spread through the surfaces on which droplets land, such as aircraft seats and trays. How long these droplets last depends on both the droplet and the surface: mucus or saliva, porous or non-porous, for example. Viruses can vary drastically as they last on the surface, from hours to months.There is also evidence that respiratory viruses can be transmitted through the air in small dry particles known as aerosols. But according to Arnold Monto, professor of epidemiology and global public health at the University of Michigan, it is not the primary transmission mechanism. To maintain itself, to allow for real aerosols, the virus must be able to survive in that environment for as long as it is exposed to drying. Viruses would prefer to be wet, and many will disappear from being infectious if they are allowed to dry for too long."Coronaviruses are very common viruses known to the medical community. Probably, most people have had a coronavirus infection, as they are one of the main causes of the common cold that carries cough, grip and sneeze," Dr. Gustavo Lopardo, former president of the Society, told Infobae Infectology (SADI)."But sometimes, these viruses have the ability to make changes to their genetic scheme or what we call mutations. So it was that at the beginning of this century, in 2003, a coronavirus became a very dangerous virus and was known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Years later another coronavirus produced a very common disease in the Middle East and was called MERS. And today the world is watching for a new virus coming from China," added the expert infectologist at Vicente López Hospital, Bernardo Houssay and dr. Stamboulian's laboratories.So how does the virus spread specifically on airplanes?sitting within two rows of each other (REUTERS/Mike Blake)" height"1467" src"https://www.infobae.com/new-resizer/7UIgGiNkCPf7maUrM0G05dvws/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-infobae.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IX5BSYCVTFAKFFKENT2H4LDRPM.jpg" width-"2200"/>The World Health Organization defines contact with an infected person as sitting within two rows of each other (REUTERS/Mike Blake) (MIKE/Blake)The World Health Organization defines contact with an infected person as sitting within two rows of each other. But people don't just sit on flights, especially those that last more than a few hours. They go to the bathroom, stretch their legs and grab items from the upper containers. In fact, during the 2003 Coronavirus outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a passenger on board a flight from Hong Kong to Beijing infected people outside the WHO two-rank boundary.Inspired in part by that case, a team of public health researchers from Emory University in the United States set out to study how random movements around the aircraft cabin could change the likelihood of infection in passengers. Experts found that people in aisle seats are much more likely to come into contact with infected passengers.According to findings revealed by the research, passengers who are concerned about contracting coronavirus should remain in their seats. This is because the more a person gets up and moves around the plane, the more likely they are to be next to someone with the disease. The longer a person comes into contact with an infected passenger and the longer they are close to it, the greater the chances of becoming infected.For this reason, cabin crew should not fly if they have any kind of infection, especially one like the coronavirus, as they have the greatest contact with passengers on a flight (Shutterstock)Researchers studied passenger behavior on flights lasting between three and five hours and found that 38% left their seats once and 24% more than once, but passengers by the window barely left their seats. This reduced the number of contacts with other passengers from 64 for those sitting in the aisle to only 12 for window seat holders."Suppose the person is sitting in a seat in the aisle or in a middle seat and I walk to the bathroom. We'll be in close contact, which means we'll be less than a metre away. So, I could pass it on to myself," said Howard Weiss, lead author of the studio in an interview with National Geographic.As it is not yet clear exactly how the coronavirus is transmitted, researchers refuse to give certainties about the impact on a flight. They claim that it appears to be transmitted from human to human and that it has an incubation period of approximately 14 days, which means that people can be sick and transmit long before symptoms appear.In addition to choosing a seat by the window, people should wash their hands with soap regularly, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer after touching surfaces, and avoid touching their faces or having contact with passengers coughing if possible. Despite thethe disease is spreading around the world, with cases reported in more than a dozen countries.Coronavirus map: minute by minute, how the disease expands from China to the worldAn interactive map produced by the prestigious Johns Hopkins University in the United States records in real time the advance of the new strain of coronavirus that has emerged in China that has so far left 132 dead and nearly 6,000 infected.The Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) owned by the Baltimore, Maryland-based institution developed this method for visualizing, geolocating, and monitoring new cases that are detected throughout the World.The new strain is believed to have emerged in a market specializing in the sale of exotic animal meat located in Wuhan City, Hubei Province in central China, and has since been spreading to other Chinese cities and even to other parts of the world or, because of the air transfer of infected people. The Chinese government has so far shown how to control the epidemic. And that inability to react in time increases global concern.KEEP READING:New coronavirus balance in China: 132 dead and more than 6,000 infectedCoronavirus: everything you need to know about the dangerous disease that puts global health in checkCoronavirus map: minute by minute, so the disease expands from China to the worldLoad-Date: January 31, 2020End of Document

Dow Sells Off Sharply as Coronavirus Outbreak Spreads Outside AsiaTheStreet.comFebruary 24, 2020 Monday 2:32 PM EDTCopyright 2020 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 633 wordsByline: Joseph WoelfelHighlight: Stocks sink as investors worry the global spread of the coronavirus will impact economies outside of China.BodyStocks sank as investors grow worried the global spread of the coronavirus, which now has been found in more than two dozen countries, will impact economies outside of China. Coronavirus update: 2,592 deaths in China, 77,150 confirmed cases. Gilead Sciences is Real Money's Stock of the Day. The World Health Organization said the drugmaker's antiviral remdesivir may be effective against the coronavirus. Stocks fell sharply Monday and the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined more than 1,000 points as investors grow worried the global spread of the coronavirus, which now has been found in more than two dozen countries, will impact economies outside of China.Futures prices, meanwhile, were indicating the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates in the coming months if the coronavirus spread accelerates and global economic growth slows. Italy confirmed 150 cases of the virus, with officials verifying at least three deaths in Europe's third-largest economy. Iran has said as many as eight people have died, while the number of coronavirus cases in South Korea has jumped to just under 800, the most outside China.Confirmed cases in China, where the outbreak began last year, numbered 77,150, with 2,592 deaths, according to China's National Health Commission. The World Health Organization said there are 79,407 cases of the virus worldwide and 2,622 deaths.Chinese President Xi Jinping admitted Sunday the virus will "inevitably have a relatively big impact on the economy and society," and the International Monetary Fund warned global economic growth could be reduced by 0.1% from the virus outbreak.The spread of the virus to nations in Europe and central Asia - which have no clear travel or epidemiological links to China - has triggered a notable flight to safety in trading Monday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 910 points, or 3.14%, to 28,082, the S&P 500 tumbled 3.36% and the Nasdaq was down 3.4%. Leading the Dow lower were UnitedHealth , American Express  and Cisco Systems ."(Monday's) volatile market reaction with investors fleeing risk in favor of safe-haven assets such as U.S. Treasuries exemplifies the uncertainty associated to the viral outbreak," said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management.Warren Buffett told CNBC on Monday that investors shouldn't make decisions based on the volatility caused by the coronavirus."You don't buy or sell your business based on today's headlines. If it gives you a chance to buy something you like and you can buy it even cheaper, you're in good luck," he said, adding that "you can't predict the market by reading the daily newspaper."Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway  , meanwhile,  in the fourth quarter vs. a year-earlier loss and posted cash on hand that remains at near-record levels as the conglomerate's collective investments continued to churn out positive returns.The Omaha, Nebraska-based company posted  in the quarter of $29.2 billion, or $17,909 per Class A share, a reversal from a loss of $25.4 billion, or $15,467 a share, the year before. The year-ago results were dragged down largely by an unexpected write-down at Kraft Heinz KHC, of which Berkshire is a significant shareholder. Cash on hand, meantime, totaled $128 billion as of Dec. 31, the company said, slightly down from $128.2 billion at the end of the third quarter but still near a record high.Shares of Gilead Sciences  were rising after the World Health Organization said the  may be effective against the coronavirus.The comments, which were reported by CNBC, came in a press conference at which the organization lauded the Chinese government for the measures it took to stem the spread of the virus. When identifying any drugs that could potentially combat the disease, WHO named the drug from Gilead Sciences.Load-Date: February 24, 2020End of Document

CHAIRMAN RUBIO GIVES FLOOR SPEECH ON JOVITA CARRANZA TO BE SBA ADMINISTRATORStates News ServiceJanuary 7, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1443 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship:Rubio: "And just as the SBA was critical in building the technologies to win the Cold War and the Space Race, it must be at the center of our efforts to compete with this Chinese hostility."U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, delivered a floor speech before the Senate voted to confirm Jovita Carranza to be the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA).Rubio's remarks as prepared are below.Rubio: " As the Senate returns to open the second session of the 116 th Congress, it is fitting that one of our first votes not only of this session, but of this decade, is focused on supporting American small businesses."In America, we tend to speak about small businesses with a sense of reverence absent in other countries."It's with good reason: just under 60 million individuals are employed by the more than 30 million small businesses throughout our nation."These small businesses are the vital center of our economy."They drive our nation's job creation, community development, and overall growth."Small businesses today also fuel American economic power, guaranteeing a world-renowned level of prosperity at home and enabling us to pursue the national interest abroad."The Small Business Administration, or SBA, plays a lead role in our success by providing our entrepreneurs and firms with necessary technical assistance and access to capital."Today, the Senate considers the nomination of Jovita Carranza to serve as Administrator of the SBA."The position of Administrator is crucial to ensuring agency efficacy and success. Additionally, the Administrator will play a pivotal role in the much needed modernization of the SBA and its many programs."As we move into this new decade, it is imperative that the SBA evolve to meet the needs of today's entrepreneurs in an ever-changing, and increasingly global, business climate."Businesses today face a radically different economic environment than in eras past."Aware of these changes, policymakers are tasked with an obligation to identify goals that achieve our national interest -- providing for our national defense and creating good jobs for American workers -- and organize our lawmaking and material resources to achieve them."The last time that the SBA underwent full reauthorization was in 2000, when just 42 percent of households had Internet access, and nearly all of those were using dial-up."It would be six years before the iPhone's debut, and Americans bought fewer than 10,000 hybrid electric cars annually."It was also the year before China became a member of the World Trade Organization."America's small businesses now face an unprecedented threat from the Chinese government and Communist Party's systematic industrial espionage and coercion, large-scale subsidies, and sweeping obstruction of market access."They require the resources that allow them to compete against these conditions, to operate dynamically, and to be innovative and creative."They need access to services and programs that better position them to support American competitiveness on an international scale, particularly given Beijing's continued economic aggression toward our nation."And just as the SBA was critical in building the technologies to win the Cold War and the Space Race, it must be at the center of our efforts to compete with this Chinese hostility."But yesterday's status quo is not enough."The agency must incorporate new and creative programming focused on spurring investment, supporting advanced manufacturing, promoting innovation, and expanding export opportunities."Especially against the backdrop of these growing threats to our national defense, it is important to note that innovation breakthroughs are often contingent on public-private collaboration intended to further our national security."Small businesses and start-ups have been historically essential to developing the technologies and commercializing the products that often come out of these partnerships."Unlike the Silicon Valley start-ups that venture capital firms tend to gravitate toward, these technologies require significant time and resources to finance."The SBA already guarantees some debt and equity investments in these companies through the Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer programs, among many others."To bolster America's small businesses and meet the challenge that Beijing poses, we must increase their scope and accessibility to firms."By insuring financial investment in small business and start-up manufacturing, we can spur the development of a new capital market for innovation in these underserved sectors."America's national development and global competitiveness will be conditional on these broad, ambitious reforms."While the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship continues to work toward a comprehensive reauthorization of the Small Business Act and Small Business Investment Act to these ends, the leadership and guidance of a forward-thinking SBA Administrator will be essential to this modernization process."As Chairman of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I am eager to see the position of Administrator be duly filled."On August 1, 2019, President Trump formally nominated Ms. Jovita Carranza to serve in this critical role."Ms. Carranza has enjoyed a long and successful career, spending many years in both the private sector and in government service."In 1976, she began her career at UPS as a part-time Hub Operations and Human Resources Supervisor."After more than 29 years of hard work and dedication, Ms. Carranza retired from UPS as the Vice-President of Air Operations."In December 2006, she was nominated by President George W. Bush and confirmed by this body to serve as the Small Business Administration's Deputy Administrator."After serving in this role for two years, Ms. Carranza began working as a logistics consultant."Ms. Carranza was again called to government service in June of 2017 when she was named Treasurer of the United States."Last month, the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship held a hearing to consider Ms. Carranza's nomination before voting to favorably report her nomination to the Senate floor for consideration."In that hearing, Ms. Carranza showed her commitment to working with Congress on the pressing issues facing the SBA and its programs by assuring me, Ranking Member Cardin, and members of the Committee that she would:"Address the management challenges in the Office of Investment and Innovation to ensure the programmatic integrity of its programs;"Appear before the Committee within 90 days of her confirmation to provide an update on how she has addressed those challenges;"Reassess a far-reaching rule governing the agency's critical access to capital programs to ensure it will not restrict access to capital for small businesses;"Be communicative and transparent with Congress on the subsidy models and calculations for the agency's federal credit programs;"Fill the backlog of staff needed to properly administer the SBA's innovation programs;"Ensure the proper use of federal grant dollars associated with SBA's entrepreneurial development programs;"Modernize the agency's disaster loan programs and establish internal controls to better manage waste, fraud, and abuse;"Expeditiously establish a Women-Owned Small Business certification program; and"Provide responses to Congress on several past communications to the agency outlining proposals to aide small businesses against cyber threats."There is much work to be done."But restoring and expanding the SBA's great historical legacy to assist American businesses and meet the international challenge at hand is crucial."As a Democratic candidate for president in 1960, Senator John F. Kennedy noted that 'America can afford the initiative, the energy, and the work to bring the country's small businesses back to sound health, to bring the economy as a whole back to healthy growth on a widely diversified, competitive base.'""Alongside parallel reforms like full expensing and removing the tax bias toward stock buybacks, the SBA will be at the heart of America's national development in our own time."I look forward to working closely with Ms. Carranza to modernize existing programs to meet the exacting challenges at hand and work toward solutions that ensure small businesses have access to the resources they need to start, grow, and empower our nation writ large."I ask my colleagues to vote aye."Load-Date: January 7, 2020End of Document

US House speaker Pelosi warns allies against using HuaweiAssociated Press Financial WireFebruary 17, 2020 Monday 5:35 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 334 wordsDateline: BRUSSELS BodyBRUSSELS (AP) - No NATO ally should succumb to the temptation of letting Chinese tech giant Huawei into their next-generation cellular networks, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Monday at Allied headquarters, turning U.S. opposition to Huawei into a bipartisan effort.Pelosi said the invasion of privacy that would result from having Huawei integrated into Europe's 5G communication networks would be "like having the state police, the Chinese state police, right in your pocket."She insisted such technology was far too sensitive to turn to over to Chinese interests, even though they can deliver such technology cheaper, thanks to the fact that the company relied on Western know-how to build its systems."While some people say that its cheaper to do Huawei - well yeah - it's a People's Liberation Army initiative using reversed engineering from Western technology," Pelosi, the senior Democratic lawmaker, told reporters in Brussels. "So, of course it's going to be cheaper to put on the market. And if it's cheaper, then they get the market share and then they (China) bring in their autocracy of lack of privacy."U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has also raised national security concerns about Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer, and is aggressively lobbying Western allies to bar the company from their wireless, high-speed networks.Trump administration officials, including Cabinet secretaries, say Huawei can give the Chinese government backdoor access to data, allegations that the company rejects.The U.S. has been trying to have European nations ban the gear from next-generation cellular networks, but countries are shying away from banning it altogether. Britain, notably, announced last month that it would allow Huawei to participate in certain non-sensitive areas of its networks.Pelosi warned allies not to cave in to Chinese pressure to take Huawei."You cannot sell the privacy of the people of your country down the river," Pelosi said.Load-Date: February 18, 2020End of Document

House Energy & Commerce Committee Issues Report on Secure & Trusted Communications Networks ActTargeted News ServiceJanuary 5, 2020 Sunday 9:20 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3925 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON, Jan. 5 -- The House Energy and Commerce Committee issued a report (H.Rpt. 116-352) on legislation (H.R. 4998) to prohibit certain federal loans, grants and subsidies from being used to purchase communications equipment or services posing national security risks and to provide for the establishment of a reimbursement program for the replacement of communications equipment or services posing such risks. The report was advanced by Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., D-New Jersey, on Dec. 16, 2019.Excerpts of the report follow:I. PURPOSE AND SUMMARYH.R. 4998, the "Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act of 2019", was introduced on November 8, 2019, by Reps. Pallone (D-NJ), Walden (R-OR), Matsui (D-CA), and Guthrie (R- KY), and referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce. H.R. 4998 would take a series of actions aimed at improving the security of communications networks in the United States. Among other things, H.R. 4998 would require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) to develop and maintain a list of communications equipment and services that pose an unacceptable risk to national security and prohibit the use of Federal funds administered by the FCC to purchase, rent, lease, or otherwise obtain such equipment and services. The legislation also establishes the Secure and Trusted Communications Reimbursement Program to assist small communications providers with the costs of removing prohibited equipment and services from their networks and replacing prohibited equipment with more secure communications equipment and services.II. BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATIONUnited States communications service providers rely heavily on equipment and services manufactured and provided by foreign companies. The increasingly globalized market for communications equipment and services has opened the door to cheaper goods for consumers but poses new challenges for the United States, particularly for ensuring the security of the telecommunications supply chain.Given the pivotal role that private communications networks serve in connecting U.S. critical infrastructure functions, American networks are appealing targets for foreign adversaries. The United States, therefore, has a clear interest in mitigating threats posed by vulnerable communications equipment and services.In particular, the United States identified individual Chinese telecommunications firms, including Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd (Huawei) and its affiliates, as posing significant threats to U.S. commercial and security interests./1/ Their susceptibility to state influence over business operations results in China having "the means, opportunity, and motive to use telecommunications companies for malicious purposes," such as espionage and cyberattacks./2/ In April 2018, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission found that the Chinese Government had "invested significant state capital and influence" on state-owned enterprises to strategically place these companies in the U.S. communications supply chain./3/--/1/Department of Commerce, Department of Commerce Announces the Addition of Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. to the Entity List (May 15, 2019) (press release)./2/House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Investigative Report on the US National Security Issues Posed by Chinese Telecommunications Companies Huawei and ZTE, 112th Cong. (Oct. 8, 2012)./3/U.S.-China Economic Security Review Commission, Supply Chain Vulnerabilities from China in US Federal Information and Communications Technology (Apr. 2018).--Large communications companies with sophisticated network security operations and significant capital generally have avoided installing and using Huawei and other suspect foreign equipment in their networks./4/ Moreover, Federal agencies have actively reached out to large carriers to express concerns when carriers have considered purchasing suspect equipment./5/ In contrast, some smaller carriers with more limited resources and less sophisticated security operations have purchased and installed Huawei, and other suspect foreign equipment, in their networks either because the equipment was less expensive or they were unaware of the security risk, or both./6/--/4/See, e.g., Paul Mozur, AT&T Drops Huawei's New Smartphone Amid Security Worries, the New York Times (Jan. 9, 2018) (www.nytimes.com/ 2018/01/09/business/att-huawei-mate-smartphone.html)./5/See, e.g., Todd Shields, Locke Says Sprint's Chief Was Called About Huawei Bid Concerns, Bloomberg (Dec. 7, 2010) (www.bloomberg.com/ news/articles/2010-12-07/commerce-s-locke-says-sprint-s-chief-was- called-about-huawei-bid-concerns)./6/See, e.g., Cecilia Kang, Huawei Ban Threatens Wireless Service in Rural Areas, the New York Times (May 25, 2019) (www.nytimes.com/ 2019/05/25/technology/huawei-rural-wireless-service.html).--III.

APPLICABILITY TO LEGISLATIVE BRANCHThe Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Congressional Accountability Act.XV. SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATIONSection 1. Short titleSection 1 designates that the short title may be cited as the "Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act of 2019".Sec. 2. Determination of communications equipment of services posing national security risks Section 2 requires the FCC to publish and maintain on its website a list of covered communications equipment or services.In making determinations as to what equipment and services are covered communications equipment and services for purposes of the list, the Commission must rely on either a specific determination made by any executive branch interagency body with appropriate national security expertise, a specific determination made by the Department of CommercePursuant to Executive Order 13873, or a designation of communications equipment or services as covered telecommunications equipment or services (as defined in section 889(f)(3) of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019).The Committee expects that the FCC will monitor these sources, both for purposes of adding covered equipment and services to the list and removing equipment and services that are no longer considered covered equipment or services by the source cited in making the original determination.In the event that the original source reverses a designation for certain equipment or services (from covered to not covered), however, but a different source identified by the legislation maintains that such equipment or services are covered equipment or services, the Commission may not remove such equipment or service from its list until each or all sources reverse the designation.The Commission is also required under this section to notify the public on an annual basis if no changes to the list were necessary in the preceding 12-month period.Sec. 3. Prohibition on use of certain Federal subsidies Section 3 prohibits the use of Federal subsidies made available through programs administered by the Commission from being used to purchase, rent, lease, or otherwise obtain any covered communications equipment or service, or to maintain any covered communications equipment or service previously purchased, rented, leased, or otherwise obtained.For equipment or services placed on the list required by section 2 at the time of its initial publication, the prohibition on Federal subsidies is intended to take effect on the date of its publication on the list. For any equipment or services placed on the list after the initial publication of the list, the prohibition on Federal subsidies is effective on the date that is 60 days after the date such equipment or service is added to the list.Sec. 4. Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Reimbursement ProgramSection 4 requires the FCC to promulgate regulations not later than 270 days after the date of enactment to establish the "Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Reimbursement Program" (Program) to reimburse providers of advanced communications service with 2 million or fewer subscribers for the costs associated with removing and replacing covered equipment from networks.Providers receiving reimbursements under the Program may use funds only for purposes of permanently removing, replacing, and disposing of covered communications equipment and services that were purchased, rented, leased, or otherwise obtained by the provider before August 14, 2018, if the covered equipment or service is included on the initial list developed under section 2. At a minimum, the Committee expects the initial publication of the list to include equipment and services produced or provided by Huawei Technologies Co. Limited (Huawei), Zhongxing Telecommunications Equipment Corporation (ZTE), and any subsidiary or affiliate of either entity.For instances in which a provider has purchased, rented, leased, or otherwise obtained equipment and services that are not included on the initial publication of the list, but are deemed to be covered equipment or services at a later date, the provider is eligible to receive reimbursement funds to remove and replace covered equipment and services that were purchased, rented, leased, or otherwise obtained not later than 60 days after the Commission adds such equipment to the list.This section also requires the Commission to develop a list of suggested replacements for both physical and virtual communications equipment, application and management software, and services to mitigate the burden on providers to find suitable alternatives to covered equipment and services. The Committee expects the Commission, when implementing regulations described under this section, to preclude network upgrades that go beyond the replacement of covered communications equipment or services from eligibility; however, the Committee expects there to be a transition from 3G to 4G or even 5G-ready equipment in instances where equipment being replaced was initially deployed several years ago.The Commission is required to develop processes to facilitate intake and review of applications for reimbursement under the Program. In developing the relevant forms and materials, the Commission must require providers to submit an initial estimate for reimbursement costs at the time the application is submitted. The Committee expects this information will assist the Commission in meeting its requirement to ensure that funds are distributed equitably amongst applicants. The Commission may also require applicants to submit updated cost estimates and supporting documentation, including invoices, as the Commission deems necessary.The Commission is required under this section to approve or deny applications no more than 90 days after the date of submission to the FCC. The Commission may choose to extend this deadline for not more than 45 days, if an excessive number of applications are filed at one time. If for any reason the Commission determines an application to be deficient, the Commission is required to allow applicants a 15-day period to cure deficiencies in the application. The Committee expects the Commission to work closely with applicants to identify deficiencies and what further documentation or addendums are needed to cure such deficiencies. Providers whose applications are denied are not precluded from re-submitting applications or submitting new applications for reimbursement.Applicants for reimbursement under the Program are required to certify to the Commission, at the time of application, that the applicant has developed a plan for the permanent removal, replacement, and disposal of covered equipment and services from their networks and certify that the applicant has developed a specific timeline for permanently removing, replacing, and disposing of covered equipment and services. Applicants are required to submit this timeline to the Commission as part of the application. Additionally, applicants whose applications are approved by the Commission must certify that, as of the date of the approval of the application, the applicant will not use reimbursement funds, or any other funds, to purchase, rent, lease, or otherwise obtain covered equipment or services.This section requires the Commission to make reasonable efforts to ensure that reimbursement funds are distributed equitably among all applicants for reimbursement under the Program. If at any time the Commission determines that the funds made available to the Commission will be insufficient to carry out the Program, the Committee expects the Commission to immediately notify the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate.Any applicant receiving reimbursement funds under the Program is required to complete the permanent removal, replacement, and disposal of covered equipment and services from their networks not later than one year after the date on which the Commission distributes funds to the applicant. If the Commission finds that applicants are at risk of not meeting the deadline due to shortages in the supply of replacement equipment and services, the Commission may extend the deadline for all applicants for a period of six months. The Commission may also grant, on a case-by-case basis, individual extensions of an applicant's deadline for not more than six months, if the Commission finds that, due to no fault of the applicant, the applicant is unable to complete the requirements under the deadline. The Committee expects the Commission to not find it the fault of a recipient of the program if such recipient has a shortage of a qualified workers, either employees or contracted third-parties, to complete the removal of covered equipment and replacement of new equipment under the timeframe established in the Act.This section also requires the Commission to include requirements for proper disposal of covered equipment and services in the regulations promulgated under paragraph (1) of this section.Recipients of reimbursement funds are required to submit status updates to the Commission not less frequently than once every 90 days, beginning on the date of the approval of an application, and continuing until the recipient's work to permanently remove, replace, and dispose of covered equipment and services is complete.The Commission is required to submit reports to Congress on the implementation of the Program, and the status of work being done by recipients of reimbursement funds under the Program, not less frequently than once every 180 days.The Committee expects the Commission to take all appropriate steps to combat waste, fraud, and abuse in the Program. These steps shall include, but are not limited to, requiring recipients to submit detailed spending reports and documentation of invoices, and conducting routine audits and random field investigations of recipients to ensure compliance with Program requirements and this Act.The Commission shall require recipients of reimbursement funds to submit a final certification that the recipient has complied with, or is in the process of complying with, all Program requirements as established by this Act and Commission regulations resulting from this Act. If the recipient is still in the process of complying with Program requirements at the time of final certification, the Commission shall require the recipient to submit an updated certification to the Commission upon completing such requirements.The Commission is required to engage in education efforts with communications providers to encourage their participation in the Program and to assist providers' understanding of and complying with Program requirements.This section establishes that the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Reimbursement Program shall be separate from any Federal universal service program.This section authorizes $1,000,000,000 to be appropriated for fiscal year 2020 to carry out the Program. The Commission may not use more than $5,000,000 of the appropriated amount for administrative costs associated with carrying out the program.Sec. 5. Hold harmless Section 5 clarifies that any winner of the Connect America Fund Phase II auction, who is unable to meet build-out obligations due to prohibitions on covered equipment and services in this Act, may withdraw their application for Connect America Fund Phase II support without being found in default or forfeiture.Sec. 6. EnforcementSection 6 requires the Commission to enforce this Act and the regulations promulgated under this Act consistent with all applicable terms and provisions of the Communications Act of 1934.This section also establishes additional penalties for recipients of funding under the Program if the Commission finds the recipient to have violated section 4 of this Act, the regulations promulgated under this Act, or commitments made by the recipient in their application or certifications to the Commission. Recipients of funding under the Program who violate the terms of the Program shall be required to repay all reimbursement funds to the Commission, barred from further participation in the Program, and referred to all appropriate law enforcement agencies or officials as appropriate. The Commission may also choose to bar violators from other Commission programs, including Federal universal service support programs.The Commission is required to provide recipients found in violation of Program requirements an opportunity to cure violations within 180 days of the Commission providing such notice. If the recipient fails to cure such violations, the Commission is required to take action to recover all reimbursement funds awarded to the recipient under the Program that are subject to repayment.Sec. 7. DefinitionsSection 7 provides definitions for the terms "advanced communications service", "Commission", "covered communications equipment or service", "customers", "executive branch interagency body", "person", "Program", "provider of advanced communications service", "recipient", and "reimbursement funds".XVI.

As a result of the reserve on inventory related to Huawei, net losses per share from continuing operations attributable to controlling interest on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis increased by $0.08 and $0.05, respectively."We continue to see growing momentum for silicon carbide as demonstrated by our robust opportunity pipeline and recent customer wins," said Cree CEO Gregg Lowe. "While we continue to navigate a challenging operating environment in the short-term, we continue to invest for the future to support several growth opportunities across multiple sectors."Business Outlook:For its third quarter of fiscal 2020, Cree targets revenue in a range of $221 million to $229 million. GAAP net loss is targeted at $68 million to $62 million, or $0.63 to $0.57 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net loss is targeted to be in a range of $16 million to $10 million, or $0.15 to $0.09 per diluted share. These targets reflect the January 27, 2020 decision by the Chinese government to extend the Lunar New Year holiday due to the coronavirus outbreak. Targeted non-GAAP loss excludes $52 million of estimated expenses, net of tax, related to stock-based compensation expense, amortization or impairment of acquisition-related intangibles, factory optimization restructuring and start-up costs, accretion on convertible notes, and project, transformation and transaction costs. The GAAP and non-GAAP targets do not include any estimated change in the fair value of Cree's Lextar investment.Quarterly Conference Call:Cree will host a conference call at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time today to review the highlights of the second quarter results and the fiscal third quarter 2020 business outlook, including significant factors and assumptions underlying the targets noted above.The conference call will be available to the public through a live audio web broadcast via the Internet.

The Company increased net cash provided by operations and total free cash flow by $11.9 million and decreased net cash provided by financing activities by the same amount. The Company concluded this error was not material individually or in the aggregate to any of the periods impacted.Forward Looking Statements:The schedules attached to this release are an integral part of the release. This press release contains forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties, both known and unknown, that may cause Cree's actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, such as statements about our plans to grow the Wolfspeed business and our ability to achieve our targets for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including the risk that the economic and political uncertainty caused by the tariffs imposed by the United States on Chinese goods, and corresponding Chinese tariffs and currency devaluation in response, may negatively impact demand for our products; risks related to international sales and purchases, including the risk that U.S. government actions with respect to Huawei Technologies Co. and its affiliates or other foreign customers or vendors may have a greater impact on our business and results of operations than our expectations; risks associated with the impact of public health epidemics, such as the coronavirus currently impacting China, on our employees, customers and suppliers; the risk that we may not obtain sufficient orders to achieve our targeted revenues; price competition in key markets; the risk that we may experience production difficulties that preclude us from shipping sufficient quantities to meet customer orders or that result in higher production costs, lower yields and lower margins; our ability to lower costs; the risk that our results will suffer if we are unable to balance fluctuations in customer demand and capacity, including bringing on additional capacity on a timely basis to meet customer demand; the risk that longer manufacturing lead times may cause customers to fulfill their orders with a competitor's products instead; product mix; risks associated with the ramp-up of production of our new products, and our entry into new business channels different from those in which we have historically operated; risks associated with our factory optimization plan and construction of a new fabrication facility, including design and construction delays and cost overruns, issues in installing and qualifying new equipment and ramping production, poor production process yields and quality control, and potential increases to our restructuring costs; the risk that we or our channel partners are not able to develop and expand customer bases and accurately anticipate demand from end customers, which can result in increased inventory and reduced orders as we experience wide fluctuations in supply and demand; ongoing uncertainty in global economic conditions, infrastructure development or customer demand that could negatively affect product demand, collectability of receivables and other related matters as consumers and businesses may defer purchases or payments, or default on payments; risks resulting from the concentration of our business among few customers, including the risk that customers may reduce or cancel orders or fail to honor purchase commitments; the risk that our investments may experience periods of significant stock price volatility causing us to recognize fair value losses on our investment; the risk posed by managing an increasingly complex supply chain that has the ability to supply a sufficient quantity of raw materials, subsystems and finished products with the required specifications and quality; the risk we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our remaining goodwill or amortizable assets become impaired; risks relating to confidential information theft or misuse, including through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion; our ability to complete development and commercialization of products under development, such as our pipeline of Wolfspeed products, improved LED chips and LED components; the rapid development of new technology and competing products that may impair demand or render our products obsolete; the potential lack of customer acceptance for our products; risks associated with ongoing litigation; the risk that customers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brand and products, resulting in lower demand for our products; risks associated with integration or transition of the operations, systems and personnel of the Lighting Products business unit, each, as applicable, within the term of the post-closing transition services agreement between IDEAL Industries, Inc. and Cree; the risk that our products fail to perform or fail to meet customer requirements or expectations, resulting in significant additional costs; and other factors discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including our report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. These forward-looking statements represent Cree's judgment as of the date of this release. Except as required under the U.S. federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, Cree disclaims any intent or obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this release, whether as a result of new information, future events, developments, changes in assumptions or otherwise.Cree® and Wolfspeed® are registered trademarks of Cree, Inc.CREE, INC.

The CODM does not review inter-segment transactions when evaluating segment performance and allocating resources to each segment. As such, total segment revenue is equal to the Company's consolidated revenue.Three months ended(in millions of U.S. Dollars, except percentages)December 29, 2019December 30, 2018ChangeWolfspeed revenue$120.7$135.3($14.6)(11)%Wolfspeed percent of revenue50%48%LED Products revenue119.2145.2(26.0)(18)%LED Products percent of revenue50%52%Total revenue$239.9$280.5($40.6)(14)%Six months ended(in millions of U.S. Dollars, except percentages)December 29, 2019December 30, 2018ChangeWolfspeed revenue$248.4$262.7($14.3)(5)%Wolfspeed percent of revenue51%47%LED Products revenue234.3292.0(57.7)(20)%LED Products percent of revenue49%53%Total revenue$482.7$554.7($72.0)(13)%Three months ended(in millions of U.S. Dollars, except percentages)December 29, 2019December 30, 2018ChangeWolfspeed gross profit$41.8$64.7($22.9)(35)%Wolfspeed gross margin35%48%LED Products gross profit26.543.5(17.0)(39)%LED Products gross margin22%30%Unallocated costs(6.4)(4.7)(1.7)(36)%Consolidated gross profit$61.9$103.5($41.6)(40)%Consolidated gross margin26%37%Six months ended(in millions of U.S. Dollars, except percentages)December 29, 2019December 30, 2018ChangeWolfspeed gross profit$100.8$125.1($24.3)(19)%Wolfspeed gross margin41%48%LED Products gross profit48.684.8(36.2)(43)%LED Products gross margin21%29%Unallocated costs(13.3)(6.9)(6.4)(93)%COGS acquisition related costs-(1.2)1.2100%Consolidated gross profit$136.1$201.8($65.7)(33)%Consolidated gross margin28%36%Reportable Segments DescriptionThe Company's Wolfspeed segment's products consists of silicon carbide and gallium nitride (GaN) materials, and power devices and RF devices based on wide bandgap semiconductor materials and silicon. The Company's LED Products segment's products consist of LED chips and LED components.Financial Results by Reportable SegmentThe Company's CODM reviews gross profit as the lowest and only level of segment profit. As such, all items below gross profit in the consolidated statements of loss must be included to reconcile the consolidated gross profit presented in the preceding table to the Company's consolidated (loss) income before taxes.The Company allocates direct costs and indirect costs to each segment's cost of revenue. The allocation methodology is based on a reasonable measure of utilization considering the specific facts and circumstances of the cost being allocated. Certain costs are not allocated when evaluating segment performance. These unallocated costs consist primarily of manufacturing employees' stock-based compensation, annual incentive plans and matching contributions under the Company's 401(k) Plan.The cost of goods sold (COGS) acquisition related cost adjustment includes inventory fair value amortization of the fair value increase to inventory recognized at the date of acquisition, and acquisition costs resulting from the purchase of certain assets from Infineon's RF Power (RF Power) business in our fiscal 2018 third quarter, impacting cost of revenue for fiscal 2019. These costs were not allocated to the reportable segments' gross profit for fiscal 2019 because they represent an adjustment which does not provide comparability to the corresponding prior period and therefore were not reviewed by our CODM when evaluating segment performance and allocating resources.Cree, Inc.Non-GAAP Measures of Financial PerformanceTo supplement the Company's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, Cree uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating (loss) income, non-GAAP non-operating income (expense), net, non-GAAP net (loss) income, non-GAAP diluted (loss) earnings per share from continuing operations and free cash flow.Reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure of all historical non-GAAP measures included in this press release can be found in the tables included with this press release. Both our GAAP targets and non-GAAP targets do not include any estimated changes in the fair value of our Lextar investment.Non-GAAP measures presented in this press release are not in accordance with or an alternative to measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Cree's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should only be used to evaluate Cree's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.Cree believes that these non-GAAP measures, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, enhance investors' and management's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and the Company's prospects for the future, including cash flows available to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value. In addition, because Cree has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the Company believes the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in the Company's financial reporting.For its internal budgeting process, and as discussed further below, Cree's management uses financial statements that do not include the items listed below and the income tax effects associated with the foregoing. Cree's management also uses non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the Company's financial results.Cree excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures when applicable:Stock-based compensation expense. This expense consists of expenses for stock options, restricted stock, performance stock awards and employee stock purchases through its ESPP. Cree excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures because they are non-cash expenses that Cree does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results.Amortization or impairment of acquisition-related intangibles. Cree incurs amortization or impairment of acquisition-related intangibles in connection with acquisitions. Cree excludes these items because they arise from Cree's prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the ongoing operating results of Cree's business.Factory optimization restructuring. In May 2019, the Company started a significant, multi-year factory optimization plan ("factory optimization plan") to be anchored by a state-of-the-art, automated 200mm silicon carbide fabrication facility. In September 2019, the Company announced the intent to build the new fabrication facility in Marcy, New York to complement the factory expansion underway at its U.S. campus headquarters in Durham, North Carolina. As part of the plan, the Company will incur restructuring costs associated with the movement of equipment as well as disposals on certain long-lived assets. Because these charges relate to assets which had been retired prior to the end of their estimated useful lives, Cree does not believe these costs are reflective of ongoing operating results. Similarly, Cree does not consider the realized losses on sale of assets relating to the restructuring to be reflective of ongoing operating results.Severance and other restructuring. For the six months ended December 29, 2019, these costs relate to the Company realigning its sales resources as part of the Company's transition to a more focused semiconductor company. For the six months ended December 30, 2018, these costs relate to the Company realigning the Company's cost base with a long-range business strategy that was announced in February 2018. Cree does not believe these costs are reflective of ongoing operating results.Project, transformation and transaction costs. The Company has incurred professional services fees and other costs associated with acquisitions and divestitures, as well as for internal transformation programs designed to improve its operating margins and change the manner in which business is conducted. Cree excludes these items because Cree believes they are not reflective of the ongoing operating results of Cree's business.Factory optimization start-up costs. The Company has incurred and will incur start-up costs as part of the factory optimization plan. Cree does not believe these costs are reflective of ongoing operating results.Non-restructuring related executive severance. The Company has incurred costs in conjunction with the termination of key executive personnel. Cree excludes these items because Cree believes they have no direct correlation to the ongoing operating results of Cree's business.Transition service agreement costs. As a result of the sale of the Lighting Products business unit, the Company is providing certain IT services under a transition services agreement which will not be reimbursed. Cree excludes the costs of these services because Cree believes they are not reflective of the ongoing operating results of Cree's business.Asset impairment. The Company incurred impairment charges in conjunction with the factory optimization plan. Cree excludes these items because Cree believes they are not reflective of the ongoing operating results of Cree's business.Net changes in fair value of our Lextar investment. The Company's common stock ownership investment in Lextar Electronics Corporation is accounted for utilizing the fair value option. As such, changes in fair value are recognized in income, including fluctuations due to the exchange rate between the New Taiwan Dollar and the United States Dollar. Cree excludes the impact of these gains or losses from its non-GAAP measures because they are non-cash impacts that Cree does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. Additionally, Cree excludes the impact of dividends received on its Lextar investment as Cree does not believe it is reflective of ongoing operating results.Accretion on convertible notes. In August 2018, the Company issued $575 million in convertible notes resulting in interest accretion on the convertible notes' issue costs and discount. Management considers these items as either limited in term or having no impact on the Company's cash flows, and therefore has excluded such items to facilitate a review of current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.Income tax adjustment. This amount reconciles GAAP tax expense (benefit) to a calculated non-GAAP tax expense (benefit) utilizing a non-GAAP tax rate. The non-GAAP tax rate estimates an appropriate tax rate if the listed non-GAAP items were excluded. This reconciling item adjusts non-GAAP net (loss) income to the amount it would be if the calculated non-GAAP tax rate was applied to non-GAAP (loss) income before taxes.Cree may incur some of these same expenses, including income taxes associated with these expenses, in future periods. In addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, Cree also uses free cash flow as a measure of operating performance and liquidity. Free cash flow represents operating cash flows from continuing operations less net purchases of property and equipment and patent and licensing rights. Cree considers free cash flow to be an operating performance and a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property and equipment, a portion of which can then be used to, among other things, invest in Cree's business, make strategic acquisitions, strengthen the balance sheet and repurchase stock. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of operating performance and liquidity is that it does not represent the residual cash flow available to the company for discretionary expenditures, as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as debt service.CREE, INC.Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures(in millions of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts and percentages)(unaudited)Non-GAAP Gross MarginThree months endedSix months endedDecember 29, 2019December 30, 2018December 29, 2019December 30, 2018GAAP gross profit$61.9$103.5$136.1$201.8GAAP gross margin percentage26%37%28%36%Adjustments:Stock-based compensation expense2.51.84.73.4Project, transformation and transaction costs---1.2Non-GAAP gross profit$64.4$105.3$140.8$206.4Non-GAAP gross margin percentage27%38%29%37%Non-GAAP Operating (Loss) IncomeThree months endedSix months endedDecember 29, 2019December 30, 2018December 29, 2019December 30, 2018GAAP operating (loss) income from continuing operations($56.4)$10.0($95.3)$20.8GAAP operating (loss) income percentage(24)%4%(20)%4%Adjustments:Stock-based compensation expense:Cost of revenue, net2.51.84.73.4Research and development2.42.24.83.7Sales, general and administrative8.17.020.413.9Total stock-based compensation expense13.011.029.921.0Amortization or impairment of acquisition-related intangibles3.63.97.27.8Factory optimization restructuring1.2-2.4-Severance and other restructuring--0.82.6Project, transformation and transaction costs10.80.213.41.8Factory optimization start-up costs1.5-2.9-Non-restructuring related executive severance0.3-1.5-Transition service agreement costs5.2-8.2-Asset impairment--0.2-Non-GAAP operating (loss) income($20.8)$25.1($28.8)$54.0Non-GAAP operating (loss) income percentage(9)%9%(6)%10%Non-GAAP Non-Operating Income (Expense), netThree months endedSix months endedDecember 29, 2019December 30, 2018December 29, 2019December 30, 2018Non-operating income (expense), net$5.1($5.6)$6.7($15.3)Adjustments:Net changes in the fair value of Lextar investment(7.8)1.8(11.2)9.1Accretion on convertible notes5.85.411.47.2Non-GAAP non-operating income, net$3.1$1.6$6.9$1.0Non-GAAP Net (Loss) IncomeThree months endedSix months endedDecember 29, 2019December 30, 2018December 29, 2019December 30, 2018GAAP net loss from continuing operations($52.5)($0.2)($90.3)($1.0)Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest$0.3$-$0.3$-GAAP net loss from continuing operations attributable to controlling interest($52.8)($0.2)($90.6)($1.0)Adjustments:Stock-based compensation expense13.011.029.921.0Amortization or impairment of acquisition-related intangibles3.63.97.27.8Factory optimization restructuring1.2-2.4-Severance and other restructuring--0.82.6Project, transformation and transaction costs10.80.213.41.8Factory optimization start-up costs1.5-2.9-Non-restructuring related executive severance0.3-1.5-Transition service agreement costs5.2-8.2-Asset impairment--0.2-Net changes in the fair value of Lextar investment(7.8)1.8(11.2)9.1Accretion on convertible notes5.85.411.47.2Total adjustments to GAAP net loss from continuing operations attributable to controlling interest before provision for income taxes33.622.366.749.5Income tax adjustment -

Huawei CFO lawyers say her alleged crimes no crime in CanadaAssociated Press Financial WireJanuary 17, 2020 Friday 10:11 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 400 wordsByline: By JIM MORRIS, Associated PressDateline: VANCOUVER, British Columbia BodyVANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) - Defense lawyers argue a senior executive of the Chinese tech giant Huawei should not be extradited to the U.S. because her actions would not be considered crimes under Canadian law.The extradition hearing for Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou is scheduled to begin Monday. Meng, the daughter of the company's founder, faces charges of committing fraud to try and evade U.S. sanctions on Iran. Huawei is China's first global tech brand and Beijing views her case as a political move designed to prevent China's rise."This is a case of U.S. sanctions enforcement masquerading as Canadian fraud," say defense documents released Friday.Meng was arrested at the Vancouver airport in late 2018 at the request of the U.S. government. American prosecutors allege she made misrepresentations to foreign banks, including London-based HSBC, about Huawei's relationship with its Iran-based affiliate Skycom.Last week, the Canadian Department of Justice released documents supporting its case the allegations against Meng meet the extradition test of "double criminality" meaning if they had occurred Canada, they would be criminal under Canadian law.Defense lawyers dispute that claim, arguing it's not illegal in Canada to do business with Iran."Canada not only permits banks to do business with Iran-based entities, it encourages them to do to," the documents say.The documents point out the prosecution has argued Meng's action have caused HSBC to be placed at risk of financial prejudice for offering banking service to Huawei and Skycom because of U.S. sanctions."Simply put, a bank in Canada would not be concerned that Huawei's relationship with Skycom could trigger sanctions risk," the documents say.Meng made a brief court appearance Friday where lawyers discussed additional court dates. The first stage of the extradition hearing dealing is expected to last five days.Meng is free on bail of and is living in one of the two Vancouver mansions she owns.Beijing detained former two Canadians, ex-diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, in late 2018 in an apparent attempt to pressure Canada to release Meng.

10 Mexicans arrive in the country after 14-day isolation by Covid-19CE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 17, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 395 wordsBody       ? The connationals arrived yesterday in Mexico City from Marseille, France, where the health certificate was accredited. Photo Cristina Rodríguez De La Redacción Periódico La JornadaMonday, February 17, 2020, p. 15The federal government reported last night that the 10 Mexicans who requested to be transferred from Wuhan, China, in connection with the Covid-19 coronavirus outbreak, returned to the country, with the support of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They arrived at Mexico City International Airport at 6:58 p.m., on Lufthansa Flight 498, from Frankfurt, Germany.The connationals, he said, were received by officials from the secretariats of Foreign Affairs and Health.The Mexican government appreciated the french government's collaboration for the initial transfer of Mexicans in Wuhan, China, to French territory. It also recognizes and appreciates the facilities provided by the Chinese government to the Mexican consular work. The representations of Mexico continue to provide assistance and protection to Mexicans who visit or remain in the Asian country, highlighted in the statement.Our connationals complied with the standards of preventive containment and isolation standards by France without showing signs or symptoms of disease during this period (14 days), so they do not pose any kind of health risk.In the morning, from France, it was reported through social media that connationals in the Gallic country flew from Marseille to Mexico City. Using his Twitter account, Mexico's ambassador to France, Juan Manuel Gómez Robledo, reported that the 10 Mexicans in Wuhan received the medical certificate proving their optimal health status, he said.Mexican architect Jesús Daniel Stamatis Portugal, who lived in Wuhan and a few days ago made a call on his social networks requesting help from the government of Mexico to leave China, yesterday he again used those platforms to publicize the certificate signed by the Director-General of the Regional Health Agency, Philippe de Mester, in which he settles: Taking into account that the maximum duration of the virus is 14 days and given the absence of virus infection for all people who have been subjected to isolation measures , no additional health measures are required.On February 1, 250 people, including 10 Mexicans, managed to leave Wuhan on a flight chartered by the French government.Load-Date: February 18, 2020End of Document

Co-creator defends suspected UAE spying app called ToTokAssociated Press InternationalJanuary 2, 2020 Thursday 11:28 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWS; Only on APLength: 1130 wordsByline: By JON GAMBRELL, Associated PressDateline: ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates BodyABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - If the popular ToTok video and voice calling app is a spying tool of the United Arab Emirates, that's news to its co-creator.Giacomo Ziani defended his work in an interview with The Associated Press and said he had no knowledge that people and companies linked to the project had ties to the country's intelligence apparatus, despite a recent report in The New York Times.Millions downloaded the ToTok app during the several months it was available in the Apple and Google stores. Its surge in popularity was likely driven by the fact that it allowed users to make internet calls that have long been banned in the UAE, a U.S.-allied nation where the largest city is Dubai.The ban means Apple iPhones and computers sold in the UAE do not carry Apple's FaceTime calling app. Calls on Skype, WhatsApp and other similar programs do not work.Ziani, a 32-year-old native of Venice, Italy, said ToTok won rapid approval from UAE telecommunications regulators, something long sought by established competitors that remain banned. He attributed that decision to the monopoly on the telecom market held by two companies that are majority-owned by the government. ToTok's small market share, he said, would not cut as deeply into their business as major firms if allowed access.In this nation of 9.4 million people where all but a sliver of the population comes from another country, ToTok represented what appeared to be the first government-blessed app that would allow them to connect freely to loved ones back home. That drew everyone from laborers to diplomatic staffers to download it amid a publicity campaign by state-linked and government-supporting media in the Emirates.Ziani denied that the company collected conversation data, saying the software demanded the same access to devices as other common communication apps. Emirati authorities insisted that they "prohibit any kind of data breach and unlawful interception."But this federation of seven sheikhdoms ruled by hereditary leaders already conducts mass surveillance and has been internationally criticized for targeting activists, journalists and others. Ziani repeatedly said he knew nothing about that, nor had any knowledge that a firm invested in ToTok included staff with ties to an Emirati security firm scrutinized abroad for hiring former CIA and National Security Agency staffers.He also said he did not know about alleged ties linking companies involved with ToTok to Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Emirates' national security adviser."I was not aware, and I'm even not aware now of who was who, who was doing what in the past," Ziani said.By installing the app, users agreed to allow access to their mobile device's microphone, pictures, location information and other data."By using this app, you're allowing your life to be opened up to the whims of national security as seen by the UAE government," said Bill Marczak, a computer science researcher at the University of California, Berkley, who has studied ToTok and other suspected Emirati spying operations. "In this case, you're essentially having people install the spyware themselves as opposed to hacking into the phone."An American diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss security matters, said local embassy and consular staff received orders to remove the app from all U.S. government devices. That was only after the Times, citing anonymous U.S. officials, described the app as a "spying tool" of the Emirati government.Ziani alleged, without providing evidence, that criticism of ToTok came more from professional jealousy and U.S.-China trade tensions than security concerns.ToTok described itself on Apple as coming from developer Breej Holding Ltd. and on Google as being from ToTok Pte., a Singapore-based firm.Both ToTok and Breej Holding Ltd. had been registered in a publicly accessible online database of companies operating out of the Abu Dhabi Global Market, an economic free zone set up in the Emirati capital. After suspicions emerged about ToTok, records of the two firms no longer appeared online.Following an inquiry about the firms from an AP journalist, their information reappeared Tuesday night in the database. Market spokeswoman Joan Lew blamed a "data migration" problem for their disappearance.Information from that database shows ToTok's sole registered shareholder as Group 42, a new Abu Dhabi firm that describes itself as an artificial intelligence and cloud-computing company. Ziani said ToTok has another substantial investor he declined to identify.Also known as G42, the company's CEO is Peng Xiao, who for years ran Pegasus, a subsidiary of DarkMatter, an Emirati security firm under scrutiny for hiring former CIA and NSA staffers, as well as others from Israel."G42 has no connection to DarkMatter, whatsoever," the company told AP in a statement. It did not respond to further queries.G42's sole director listed in Abu Dhabi Global Market filings is Hamad Khalfan al-Shamsi, whom Marczak identified as the public relations manager of the office of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Sheikh Tahnoun is a brother to Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the powerful crown prince of Abu Dhabi who has run the country from day-to-day since its president, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, suffered a stroke in January 2014.Sheikh Tahnoun has served as the UAE's national security adviser since 2016. The sheikh's adopted son, Hassan al-Rumaithi, is the sole director of Breej Holding Ltd., Marczak said, citing market filings.Similarly, an executive at Sheikh Tahnoun's company Royal Group, Osama al-Ahdali, is the sole director of ToTok Technology Ltd., Marczak said.Royal Group did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Emirati officials, Apple and Google.For now, Ziani said he is focused on getting ToTok back into the Apple and Google app stores. He mentioned plans to have ToTok become like China's all-encompassing app WeChat, handling payments, social media posts and other high-frequency activities. G42 appears to already have filed paperwork for a possible payment company in Abu Dhabi.That could create an Emirati version of WeChat, a service used by more than 1 billion people in which Chinese government officials routinely censor posts. Dissidents suspect it of allowing surveillance.Ziani insisted a former NSA hacker named Patrick Wardle, who analyzed ToTok, said the app "simply does what it claims to do."However, Ziani ignored the next sentence in Wardle's analysis, which described "the genius of the whole mass surveillance operation" the app could represent by offering "in-depth insight" into '"a large percentage of the country's population."___Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellAP.Load-Date: January 3, 2020End of Document

Soliday said despite being private, these companies are required to comply with China's intelligence laws and allow the Chinese government access to information they have collected. He said this could create a pathway to access American networks and gain information, release malware or spread misinformation.This legislation would prohibit state agencies and political subdivisions from purchasing equipment or services from a company labeled as a security threat. Soliday said this change would align our list of prohibited businesses with that of the federal government."The world of technology has advanced faster than some ever thought possible," Soliday said. "Though it plays an important role in our day-to-day lives, we must be cautious of our information and who might be collecting it. The federal government has already identified these companies as potential security threats. Through this legislation, we could strengthen safeguards to prevent spying and protect Hoosiers from online dangers."State Rep. Jim Pressel (R-Rolling Prairie), co-sponsor of the bill, said this measure would ensure Hoosier tax dollars are not being used to support a prohibited person or business."These companies pose a serious and obvious risk to the security of our state and nation," Pressel said.

TikTok accounts posing as politicians like Trump and Bernie Sanders keep cropping up, and it's another symptom of the app's ongoing struggle to police itselfBusiness Insider USJanuary 8, 2020 Wednesday 01:26 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 810 wordsByline: mmeisenzahl@businessinsider.com,  (Mary Meisenzahl)Highlight: President Trump and presidential candidates like Bernie Sanders don't have official TikTok accounts, but that hasn't stopped some impersonators.BodyReuters• Parody accounts of world leaders are all over popular video app TikTok,           Bloomberg reports.• The app doesn't have a strong verification system to identify genuine accounts.• Despite it's popularity, officials, especially in the US, have mostly avoided TikTok, at least in part due to security concerns over the Chinese-owned company. • Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.World leaders might not be using TikTok, but that doesn't stop copycat accounts from impersonating them on the app, according to a report from Bloomberg's Maria Jose Valero and Yueqi Yang.           Multiple accounts that impersonate the Bernie Sanders campaign or Donald Trump have popped up on the app. These accounts claim to be run by the president or senator, or by members of their team, and sometimes repost official Instagram videos. As a result, other TikTok users can be easily confused about what accounts are genuine.Bloomberg noted that other world leaders have impersonators, too: fake accounts pretending to be UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and India Prime Minister Narendra Modi have cropped up as well. A spokesperson for TikTok directed Business Insider to the app's community guidelines, which say: "We do not allow users to impersonate other individuals or organizations in order to deceive the public. When we confirm reports of impersonation, we remove the violating accounts. We do allow exceptions for parody, commentary, or fan accounts, as long as the account does not mislead others with regard to its identity or purpose on TikTok."TikTok's verification system, like much of the app's inner workings, remains mostly opaque. Some creators, like breakout star Charli D'Amelio, and celebrities, like Will Smith, are verified, represented with a small checkmark on their profile that has become the internet's universal sign for verification. Verification is just one piece of the larger moderation issue that TikTok has struggled with since its US launch in 2018. In September, The Guardian reported that moderators on the app were instructed to censor content that could offend the Chinese government, including mentions of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests or Tibetan Independence. TikTok said that the policies were outdated, and that it now uses "localized approaches" to moderation.The company has since faced other moderation scandals, including admitting it hid videos from disabled creators from the "For You" page, which it claimed was to prevent bullying. It makes sense that US leaders would avoid the app. TikTok is owned by Chinese company ByteDance,            the highest-valued private company in the world, and this ownership raises red flags for some US lawmakers.In October, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida asked the Trump administration to            investigate the app based on what he called "ample and growing evidence" of censorship at the request of China. Sens.            Chuck Schumer and            Tom Cotton            wrote a letter to the US head of national security asking for an investigation into the app as a counterintelligence risk. The US            Navy and            Army have both barred TikTok from government phones. Still, that hasn't stopped accounts that impersonate political leaders from popping up on the app. This account, which Bloomberg confirmed was not connected to the Sanders campaign, simply calls itself "Bernie Sanders Team," clearly implying that the account is officially connected with his run for office. The Trump account described by Bloomberg has been deleted, but a quick search reveals many accounts ready to step into its place. With names like "Donaldtrumpteam" and "the_donaldtrump," and mostly reposts of Trump speeches, they aren't particularly convincing, although they could be confusing to younger or less internet-savvy users.To add to the confusion, not every account claiming to be a political candidate is fake. Joshua Collins, a 26-year-old congressional candidate, uses TikTok to communicate with supporters. His account is not verified. But until TikTok adds a more straightforward verification system, we're likely to see these issues continue to crop up. NOW WATCH: Apple just revealed its AirPods Pro for $249, which feature noise cancellation. Here's everything that was wrong with the $159 pair of the wireless headphones.See Also:• Facebook is the reason Trump got elected, says Facebook exec who ran advertising during the 2016 election, 'but not for the reasons anyone thinks'• Major security flaws found on TikTok left people's sensitive personal data and videos vulnerable to hackers• YouTube star Logan Paul and NFL player Antonio Brown are trading insults online and hinting at a possible boxing matchSEE ALSO: Michelle Obama will host an Instagram video series following college students as they navigate the challenges of higher educationLoad-Date: January 8, 2020End of Document

Passive styles of investment tend to exacerbate market direction.There will still be some dip buyers. The last of the stock pickers will dig their trenches somewhere. That's why equity index futures have largely hung in there overnight. Global equities are lower, but nowhere on the planet is there an old fashioned dumpster fire.After DarkThe closing bell rang out loud. All-time closing highs for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, for the S&P 500, and of course for the Nasdaq Composite. Trading volume was strong. Winners trounced losers both uptown and downtown. The Energy sector led the way, as market prices for the underlying commodities found some relief. Communication Services as well as Information Technology were also hot. Within that group, semiconductors were hotter than was software, and why not? The spread of this dreaded virus, Covid-19 had slowed in China. So it appeared, there would be an unleashing of pent up demand from that corner of the world.Then it happened. S&P futures did their best impression at first, of a pea rolling off of a table, and then of that pea landing on a gentle downward slope as its journey continued. What happened? Suddenly, newly confirmed cases of the Covid-19 virus spiked from Hubei Province in China, where the city of Wuhan is located. 15,000 of them. The number of related deaths increased as well. In fact, roughly 25% of all human beings who have had a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19 since Moses wrote the Book of Genesis have been reported since that closing bell on Wall Street on Wednesday evening.That's why S&P futures are lower on Thursday morning. That's why OPEC and the IEA are cutting estimates for the demand for oil. The IEA projection by the way is for global demand for 2020 to drop to 2011 levels. This is why the Chinese government is replacing local leaders in impacted areas, while school closures are being extended well into March. This is why Bruno Le Maire, France's Minister of the Economy and Finance, is out speaking on the knock on impacts to both Global and French GDP of a damaged Chinese economy.Outside of China... a fourteenth case was confirmed in the United States, at Miramar Marine Corps Air Station (San Diego, CA), among those having been evacuated from the Wuhan area... another 44 cases were confirmed aboard that cruise ship Diamond Princess in the port of Yokohama (Japan), increasing the number of infections on board to 218... and Vietnam has apparently put the community of Vinh Phuc (not far from Hanoi) under lockdown, impacting roughly 10,000 residents.Prepare The Ugly StickJust scanning some industry leaders from the record breaking action on Wednesday. I see within the Consumer Discretionary sector that the Dow Jones U.S. Gambling Index soared 2.65%, while the Dow Jones U.S. Hotels Index was up 1.42%. Both of those indices ended the day trading back near their highs. You do know that at least part of this flow will likely go the other way on Thursday morning, correct? Oh, while you're thinking... while technically an Industrial industry, the Dow Jones U.S. Airlines Index spiked 1.57% on Wednesday. Same story there, closed testing a previous high.Run To The HillsIn Wednesday's Real Money "  " piece we discussed properly timing a withdrawal from, or reduction in exposure to, fossil fuels or "big oil". We did acknowledge that for dividend investors, that maybe do not need to follow all that closely the market performance of those equities, that this dividend revenue could be tough to replace.Well, I run a dividend book myself. I do have some ideas. Two names reported on Wednesday that might warrant some attention. One, CVS Health  , yields 2.71%, and is dirt cheap. The other, Cisco Systems  , yields 2.88%, and while undergoing a painful transition, and indeed exposed to China can not be called expensive in the least. This name will trade at a discount on Thursday morning. I am already long that one with an absurdly low net basis, so I don't know if it trades low enough for me to add today, but if I were flat? Entry would be an idea. Obviously, these are both Sarge names.AbbVie  is another name that I have thrown at you in the past. That one has been knocking the cover off of the ball, will soon enough close on the acquisition of Allergan  which should act as a firewall versus any losses in market share related to the Humira patent which will expire in the U.S. in 2023, but already has expired in Europe. AbbVie yields 4.83%Now for something completely different... Store Capital  , a nation-wide net-lease REIT operating in every state. This firm engages in the acquisition, investment, and management of real estate properties. The clientele could be anyone really. Retail, restaurants, movie houses, health clubs, manufacturing facilities... anything. Why bring this firm up now?Well, STOR reports next week. Wall Street is looking for EPS of $0.48 on revenue of $172.7 million, or growth of more than 17%. Those numbers are not why this one caught my eye. STOR pays shareholders $1.40 annually for a yield of 3.59%. The shares sold off a bit on Wednesday as investors sold the long end of the U.S. Treasury Curve. That said, the 10 year is knocking on the three month's door again this morning. I would think that plays well for the REITs.Bottom LineYour old pal has already started reducing exposure to big oil. By sometime later today, this name will be in his portfolio.I could paint you a picture of a cup with a handle pattern, or we could just save this chart. Yes, Relative Strength is off a bit. Yes, the daily MACD looks like the 12 day EMA is about to cross over the 26 day EMA (that would be bad). But, and this is a big but, should the risk-off behavior across financial markets early this morning hold throughout, those conditions, I would think might improve.I would like to pay something close to the 50 day SMA. However, I am willing to initiate entry somewhere close to the last sale. Our pivot will be the $40.15 level. We see that, and by virtue of catapult, the target would be set at $48. Understand though that the objective here will be revenue over price appreciation. Oh, before I go... Kraft Heinz  , don't laugh... pays 5.33%, and the stock has traded in a very tight range for a year. May add that one as well.Economics (All Times Eastern)08:30 - Initial Jobless Claims (Weekly):Expecting 211K, Last 202K.08:30 - CPI (Jan):Expecting 2.5% y/y, Last 2.3% y/y.08:30 - Core CPI (Jan):Expecting 2.2% y/y, Last 2.3% y/y.10:30 - Natural Gas Inventories (Weekly):Last -137B cf.13:00 - Thirty Year Bond Auction (Weekly):$19B.The Fed (All Times Eastern)No Public events scheduled. Today's Earnings Highlights (Consensus EPS Expectations)Before the Open: (15.72),  (.68),  (1.45),  (1.15)After the Close: (.65),  (1.21),  (.02),  (1.67),  (-.13)(CVS, Cisco, AbbVie, PepsiCo and Nvidia are holdings in Jim Cramer's  .

Dentons' 2020 Autonomous Vehicles Guide Studies Countries and Policy Issues That Will Define the Global Mobility RevolutionTargeted News ServiceFebruary 1, 2020 Saturday 8:31 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 899 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyDentons, a law firm, issued the following news release:As consumers and businesses eagerly anticipate a future in which next-generation autonomous vehicles (AVs) change the definition of mobility as we know it, global automakers and technology companies are investing heavily in AV research and development. Yet the laws and regulations governing the technology and its deployment are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly complex, leaving unanswered questions around safety, liability, privacy and security.Drawing on the knowledge and resources of its global, multidisciplinary Autonomous Vehicles practice, Dentons -- the world's largest law firm -- released a new report, "Global Guide to Autonomous Vehicles 2020," to closely examine front-burner issues, regulatory and policy changes, new legal precedents and the leading global trends shaping the sector.The guide focuses on seven countries -- the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Germany, New Zealand and the United Kingdom -- whose governments or automotive and technology industries have taken unique approaches to supporting the nascent autonomous vehicles industry. For each country, the report examines the regulatory landscape; driverless vehicle testing and deployment; liability; data privacy and security; and telecommunications and 5G.Some key findings across the globe include:* Australia requires significant investment to upgrade infrastructure, including communications and data access. Some municipalities are actively working toward this effort with defined plans of action and budget estimates.* Ontario leads testing and developing AV technology in Canada, while the federal government has taken on a leadership role to ensure consistency across all jurisdictions.* The Chinese government has taken multiple steps to prepare national infrastructure for autonomous vehicles, including defining action plans, publicly soliciting opinions on strategy, promoting relevant research and preparing the streets for autonomous transit.* Germany has established a national strategy for AVs and plans for their ethical use, but its federated structure may threaten consistency at the country level.* New Zealand maintains its position that it will not engage in legislative reform until autonomous vehicles are closer to being commercially available.* Recognizing a communications framework will be essential for AVs, the U.K. has developed a focused strategy to become a global leader in 5G technology, including spectrum allocation."Each of the key areas we analyzed comes with its own specific opportunities and challenges -- for example, as consumers become more savvy about the risks of unsecured personal data, how do we ensure AV-related consumer data remains private while still maximizing its uses for technological improvements?" said Eric Tanenblatt, Global Chair of Public Policy and Regulation, Dentons and leader of the firm's Autonomous Vehicles group. "As the driverless revolution shifts into fifth gear, companies looking to develop, deploy and scale autonomy must consider such uncertainties."The U.S. faces similar challenges to countries around the world. U.S.-specific findings include:1.There is no federal regulatory framework currently in place to address autonomous vehicle testing and deployment. As a result, testing and deployment is regulated by a patchwork of state-centric laws. Forty states and the District of Columbia have either passed autonomous vehicle legislation or are operating under executive orders.2.Expect driving risk and associated liability to shift to manufacturers -- potentially disintermediating insurance companies -- as a vehicle's proprietary "brain" makes more driving decisions.3.As connected AVs become increasingly operational, the focus on AV data privacy and information security standards will also increase, but a federal data privacy and information security law is unlikely in the near future.4.The ongoing embrace of 5G will determine which countries lead the autonomous revolution. The U.S. is not alone in the pursuit of 5G; Chinese carrier Unicom has 5G coverage in 50 cities, and Europe aims to have 5G connectivity in at least one major city in each European Union (EU) member state by 2020.Dentons boasts the world's first and largest multi-disciplinary, multi-jurisdictional autonomous vehicle practice, with the expertise and footprint necessary to provide sound legal, technical and policy advice to automakers and manufacturers, technology startups, fleet operators and auto liability insurers or finance companies.

The Best Privacy Protection is Common SenseConnect2Mason: George Mason UniversityJanuary 27, 2020 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 703 wordsByline: CHRISTOPHER KERNAN-SCHMIDTBodyBY CHRISTOPHER KERNAN-SCHMIDT, STAFF WRITERSocial media platforms have made it easy to share our lives with family and friends, but the prevalence of oversharing on social media has opened Pandora's box. Status updates, location check-ins, online rants and "private" posts, despite some of our best efforts, are often accessible by employers, predators and trolls. There is no privacy setting that will protect you more than common sense.Many of us grew up with social media. I remember sneaking behind my parents' backs to create a Facebook account in sixth grade. A few years later, Snapchat, Twitter and Instagram became the new favorites. Now, TikTok is among the most popular social media apps - even I admit I am slightly addicted to it.Like many social media sites, TikTok has its dangers too. Just a few months ago, reports claimed that TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, are under national security review by the U.S. government. The allegations range from censoring content not aligned with the Chinese Communist Party, to sending user data back to the Chinese government. Phone applications like TikTok store vast amounts of personal data such as phone contacts, biographical data, current location, linked social media accounts and more. Much of this data is sold to the highest bidder and used for tasks such as training facial recognition algorithms, and other analytic technologies, which countries like China and organizations such as Cambridge Analytica use nefariously.It is not just phone applications that sell your data, but all social media sites. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat all rely on their users for success, but we are not their customers. We are their product. Our data is worth billions of dollars.What's the big deal though? Frankly, why should we care that some advertising companies know where I am shopping right now, or who my friends are, or what foods, shows or movies I like?Well, our personal data can be used for more than just advertising preferences. In the last several years, billions of online users' personal data have been hacked. These hackers often have access to phone numbers, email addresses, physical addresses and even Social Security numbers. These data, combined with public social media postings, make millions of Americans easy targets for identity theft and social engineering.It is not just foreign governments, shady advertisers, or neck-bearded, basement-dwelling hackers that pose a threat either.In 2018 California police arrested a naked 21-year-old man who stalked a 13-year-old girl on social media and broke into her home late at night. Police said that the man used publicly available social media information to find her address. There are cases across the country of criminals using social media to find and stalk victims. When we post location updates or post our favorite ice cream place on Snapchat, we are making it easier for would-be bad actors.In addition, it is becoming commonplace for employers to search job candidates' social media postings for adverse information. You may think it's a good idea to post about that minor crime you committed, or rant about your awful boss, or any number of not-so-great things, but employers can and do look up your social media. Wannabe clearance holders should be especially wary, as social media postings may have an adverse effect on clearance determination.So what can be done to protect our data and privacy? First, ensure that your privacy settings on each social media site are at the most secure level. This includes disabling location tracking, customized advertising, access to contacts and more. Second, make all your social media private. It may be awesome to go viral on Twitter, but having your future employer find that risky tweet you forgot about from 2016 is not worth it. Third, allow only those you know to follow you. If Mr. Earl Sporen from Bangkok, Thailand wants to follow you on Instagram, perhaps double-check that you know him. Last but not least, use common sense. Be smart about what you post and who you share it with.At risk of sounding like a "boomer," social media and the internet are amazing technologies, but be wary of the dangers of oversharing.Load-Date: January 27, 2020End of Document

US says e-commerce firms need to do more about fake goodsAssociated Press State & LocalJanuary 25, 2020 Saturday 2:46 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICAL NEWSLength: 785 wordsByline: By BEN FOX, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - E-commerce has unleashed an increasing torrent of fake merchandise upon the world and private companies and the U.S. government must do more to address the problem, Trump administration officials said Friday as they released a plan aimed at cracking down on counterfeit goods.An "action plan" released by the Department of Homeland Security says the government will apply increased scrutiny of e-commerce, including the third-party sellers who sell goods on the major online sites as well as shippers and operators of warehouses where merchandised is stored.It also calls on e-commerce companies to strengthen protections for consumers, more thoroughly screen third-party sellers who use their sites and take other actions to reduce the spread of counterfeit products that has ballooned with growth of online sales in recent years."Some platforms have put in place certain measures to guard against counterfeits," Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of DHS, said in releasing the plan, "but there efforts are oftentimes overwhelmed by the scale of the activity online."Fake merchandise, everything from bogus medicine to knockoff handbags, has always been around but has never been so universally available with the growth of e-commerce through sites such as Amazon, eBay and the Chinese giant Alibaba.The international trade in counterfeit products rose 154 percent, from $200 billion in 2005 to $509 billion in 2016, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. DHS said in the report that it made nearly 34,000 seizures of fake goods in 2018, a 10-fold increase from 2000.To underscore their point, and the potential risk, they displayed a range of bogus goods, including a bike helmet, cigarettes, auto parts and tools and fake medications.DHS considers the issue a threat to national security because of the potential danger to public health from adulterated pharmaceuticals and cosmetics as well as the harm to the U.S. economy. Officials say the proceeds from counterfeit goods may also benefit global criminal networks."This is an absolute righteous threat that's growing exponentially every single year," said Mark Morgan, acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection.The plan was created in response to a presidential memo signed by President Donald Trump in April that called for the creation of a strategy to rein in what the administration called the "Wild West" of online trafficking in counterfeit goods.In addition to increased scrutiny of the industry and enforcement, the plan says authorities will seek to apply fines and penalties to a "broader range" of participants in the counterfeit networks and launch a consumer awareness campaign.Release of the plan follows the recent signing of the Phase 1 trade agreement with China, in which the Chinese government agreed to combat patent theft and counterfeit products.At the time, Alibaba said it would welcome the administration's work to combat counterfeiting. The company said it has developed systems to protect intellectual property and has worked with brand name companies, law enforcement, consumers and trade associations to battle the problem.E-commerce company eBay also says it works to fight the proliferation of fake merchandise. "We welcome and support this multi-stakeholder dialogue and look forward to continuing to work collaboratively with the administration, Congress, law enforcement and our industry partners to combat counterfeits and bad actors," it said in a statement.Amazon says it prohibits the sale of counterfeit products and welcomes more coordinated support from law enforcement to stem the problem.The company said in 2018 that it spent more than $400 million fighting counterfeit products, fraud and other forms of abuse and that its efforts "go well beyond" its obligations under U.S. law.The company said a statement Friday that this year it will begin reporting all confirmed counterfeiters that it has blocked to law enforcement so they can build cases against them."Amazon's anti-counterfeiting efforts are best in class but we recognize they are not perfect and will continue to innovate and work with policymakers and law enforcement to protect brands and customers," the company said.The DHS report essentially would have the e-commerce companies "accept their fair share of the responsibility" for counterfeit goods sold through their sites, Peter Navarro, the director of the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy."Even though they are cooperating, spending more and more money, the problem keeps getting worse," Navarro said. "The problem is for all practical purposes these e-commerce hubs are basically laundries for counterfeiting."Load-Date: January 25, 2020End of Document

US's Pelosi urges countries to steer clear of Huawei for 5GAssociated Press InternationalFebruary 14, 2020 Friday 6:26 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 418 wordsByline: By GEIR MOULSON, Associated PressDateline: MUNICH BodyMUNICH (AP) - U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appealed Friday to an audience in Germany for countries to steer clear of Chinese tech giant Huawei as they build their next-generation cellular networks, adding her voice to pressure from the Trump administration."China is seeking to export its digital autocracy through its telecommunication giant Huawei," Pelosi said during an appearance at the Munich Security Conference, an annual gathering of foreign and security leaders from around the world."Nations cannot cede our telecommunication infrastructure to China for financial expediency," Pelosi said. "Such an ill-conceived concession would only embolden (President) Xi (Jinping) as he undermines democratic values, human rights, economic independence and national security."Chinese domination of 5G "would be to choose autocracy over democracy," the speaker said. "We must instead move to an internationalization."Pelosi's remarks underlined bipartisan suspicion of Huawei in the United States.The Trump administration has raised national security concerns about Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer, and is aggressively lobbying Western allies to bar the company from wireless, high-speed networks.Trump administration officials, including Cabinet secretaries, say Huawei can give the Chinese government backdoor access to data, allegations the company rejects. The U.S. has been trying to have European nations ban the gear from next-generation cellular networks, but countries are shying away from banning it altogether.Britain, notably, announced last month that it would allow Huawei to participate in certain non-sensitive areas of its networks, and European Union 5G guidelines fall far short of addressing U.S. concerns.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper are also at the Munich conference.Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a Republican, emphasized broad agreement in the U.S. that "Huawei technology is a threat to the United States and, we really think, to world order.""Nancy Pelosi and Donald Trump are probably not going to have many dinners together but, if you ask them about British purchase of Huawei, they'll give you the same answer," Graham said."We owe it to the world, all of us do, to give you an alternative - we just can't say no forever to 5G," he added. "But we are very firm in our commitment, Republicans and Democrats, that if you go down the Huawei road, you're going to burn a lot of bridges."Load-Date: February 15, 2020End of Document

FEDS MOVING TO GROUND FOREIGN DRONES FEDS MOVING TO GROUND FOREIGN DRONES; DJI TAKES ISSUE DJI TAKES ISSUEStates News ServiceJanuary 16, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 468 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: FREDERICK, MD BodyThe following information was released by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA):By Jim MooreThe U.S. Department of the Interior operates nearly 1,000 drones for missions including wildland firefighting, rescue, mapping, and monitoring natural resources. Most of those machines were made in China, which is reason enough, in the view of some officials, to ground them.The Financial Times reported January 12, citing unnamed sources and agency documents, that some officials are concerned that the Chinese government could turn DJI drones into spy-copters, a notion that DJI has hotly disputed in recent years. The pending decision is the latest development in a long-simmering issue that previously prompted the same agency to temporarily ground the drones. The company previously responded to similar concerns on the part of federal agencies that operate DJI equipment by enabling a data privacy mode that allows operators to limit the flow of information, including camera and GPS data, to the internet.The new policy has not been officially announced or implemented, and a DJI spokesperson told the Financial Times that the underlying concerns are unfounded: While we have not seen the new policy, we look forward to reviewing the findings of DOIS comprehensive review of its drone programme, given the lack of credible evidence to support a broad country-of-origin restriction on drone technology.The policy push is getting pushback from agency staffers as well, and the newspaper obtained documents showing that some within the agency worry that grounding the majority of the unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) fleet would compromise important missions and significantly increase the cost of aerial surveillance. DJI is credited with producing more than 70 percent of the worlds civilian drones, and the FAA noted, in a recent rulemaking proposal, that an even higher percentage of drones flown for private and government business in the United States are made by DJI.Government agencies have long expressed the concern that foreign-made drones, particularly those made by Chinese firms, could be used to transmit sensitive data to unknown persons without the users knowledge, and not everyone is persuaded that the data privacy safeguards DJI implemented can guarantee the privacy of the data DJI drones collect. While a handful of U.S. manufacturers are making small drones that can fulfill similar missions, there is some concern that it will take years for DJIs competitors to match the technological capabilities that DJI has refined since introducing the most popular line of civilian UAS in history.Jim MooreEditor-WebEditor-Web Jim Moore joined AOPA in 2011 and is an instrument-rated private pilot, as well as a certificated remote pilot, who enjoys competition aerobatics and flying drones.Load-Date: January 21, 2020End of Document

Apple regains throne of smartphone sales by overtaking Samsung and HuaweiCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 30, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 512 wordsBodyAnalysts looked at Apple with concern about its dependence on the iPhone. The matter seems settled: the company led by Tim Cook has found a remedy for the slackness of its sales and is none other than... iPhone itself. Cupertino's technology has released the best results in its history, corresponding to the last quarter of last year, with record revenue and profits, data that have boosted the capitalization on the stock exchange up to 1.29 million euros.Apple competes against its own records, but especially with other manufacturers, such as the Asian brands Samsung and Huawei, which had managed to outperform the American company in units shipped within the large smartphone market. The latest data show a trend change:Apple surpasses 78.4 million terminals sold, by 70.8 million from South Korea's Samsung and 56 from Chinese firm Huawei, according to data from independent consultancy Canalys.In this way, the Apple company would improve its numbers by 9%, while Samsung remains stable (earns 1%) and Huawei is left unsaggling (losing 7%). The latter company suffers a veto in the US, where Donald Trump's administration accuses her of espionage in the service of the Chinese government and has placed her on a blacklist of companies called Entity List. By contrast, two other Chinese companies are uppinning their progress: Xiaomi improves by 23% and Xiaomi by 2%. Each and every other would cover 33 and 30.3 million phones sold in the quarter, respectively.The foiled duel between Samsung and Huawei"The year 2018 showed how Huawei took much of Samsung's market share, and 2019 was set to be the year Huawei rivaled Samsung for the top spot. Samsung knew this and was ready to go with everything in that war: it increased its portfolio and cut its operating margin. But the battle never took place, because Huawei's inclusion on the US Entity List in May has suffocated it internationally," says Mo Jia, one of the analysts at consultancy Canalys.The end of the year is Apple'sThis unofficial data corroborates and accentuates a common phenomenon year after year: a striking boost from Apple during the fourth quarter, which celebrates Single Sendec Day, popular in China; Thanksgiving, especially relevant to the US; and, of course, Christmas.On this date, Apple has had products such as AirPods,a new credit card along with Goldman Sachs and the brand new streaming platform, Apple TV. However, the iPhone has been instrumental in leading the company to a clear improvement in Wall Street's economic performance and expectations.The company no longer discloses the sales of units of your phone, but the value of them: in the fourth quarter of the year, they have risen 8% to reach 50.7 billion euros.Tim Cook himself has celebrated "strong demand" for the iPhone11 and iPhone 11 Pro and "an absolute record for services and wearables."Just a year ago, Tim Cook warned that his data for 2019 would be below forecasts, mainly due to the slow down in Chinese consumption. A year later, the company has doubled its stock market value. The apple has regained luster.Load-Date: January 31, 2020End of Document

Fiat Chrysler in talks with Foxconn to develop electric carsStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeJanuary 19, 2020 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 389 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyThe move for Foxconn comes as it looks to expand beyond electronics and improve profitability - despite being the main assembler of Apple's iPhones, sales have been slowing as consumers are keeping their smartphones for longer and other competitors enter the market.If a deal withFoxconn is reached, a joint venture would focus first on China, the biggest market for electric cars with 1.2 million vehicles sold past year - half the global total.Italian American automaker Fiat Chrysler and Taiwan's Hon Hai plan to set up a joint venture to manufacture electric vehicles and to engage in the business of wirelessly connected vehicles, Hon Hai said on Thursday. Notably, the filing also states that the joint venture aims to develop electric vehicles from scratch. Both Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot have lagged in developing electric powertrains and also have been struggling to increase sales in China, the world's biggest auto market.Documents filed byFoxconn to authorities have revealed that the two companies are looking to establish a 50/50 joint venture to build these EVs.The parties are in the process of signing a preliminary agreement which will govern further discussions aimed at reaching final binding agreements in the next few months.No prep for Federer ahead of Australian OpenI think they are definitely hungry. "So that answer convinces me". "I wouldn't play", he told reporters. What I received on the answer is on the "Olympic rule" is until 300 you can keep competing."There is however no assurance that final binding agreements will be reached or will be reached in that timeframe", FCA said.FCA will produce the electric cars while top iPhone supplierFoxconn will provide the electronics and software, the Nikkei Asian Review reported.Foxconn has been investing heavily in a variety of future transportation ventures for several years, including Didi Chuxing, the Chinese ride services giant, and Chinese electric vehicle startups Byton and Xpeng.People aware of the deal told Reuters earlier on Friday that the two companies had agreed on the sale, with one of the sources adding that Great Wall is likely to pay around $250 million to $300 million to acquire the plant.The Chinese government has a credit-based system that encourages auto manufacturers to sell electric vehicles, leading to an increase in brands.Load-Date: January 19, 2020End of Document

Boris Johnson challenges Trump and doesn't veto Huawei in 5G deploymentCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 28, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 666 wordsBodyBoris Johnson wants to make it clear from the first moment that leaving the European Union does not mean throwing himself into The arms of Donald Trump,as the opposition had criticised him, and one of his first major decisions as prime minister has been to hand over some of the installation of 5G technology in the UK to Huawei, banned by the US.Despite warnings from the White House, and that the Chinese firm has been declared "high risk," the Asian giant will have the opportunity to actively participate in the system, although it will not be granted access to cores.On a day-to-day basis, 5G technology will allow, for example, to download a film in high definition in less than a minute, but it will also be the one that gives the ultimate impetus to the development of the effective connection between smart devices, such as refrigerators or future autonomous vehicles, which will 'communicate' with each other to avoid road accidents.The problem is that in a few years' time 5G could also be relied on to coordinate traffic lights, perform surgical interventions through robotics or even for Army work, something the UK has banned from the Asian company.Security"Our world-leading cybersecurity experts know more about Huawei than any other country in the world. They are satisfied with our tough position and the regulatory regime we are going to impose, so any kind of risk is going to be controlled," they say from Downing Street, where a national security meeting has been held today.The great fear that existed among the British, sponsored by the Americans, lies in the view that Huawei is a chinese government-controlled company,so if they introduce some form of remote shutdown hidden in their facilities, it could cause chaos in the country when it is already fully dependent on this technology.Even so, in this case it has taken a closer weight the fact that the company is a leader in the sector by far from its competitors, so the British Government claims that not having granted them a shareholding would have delayed the arrival of 5G to three years,with the consequent extra expense that would entail for its citizens and the burden on the growth of the economy.In fact, there are some mobile providers in the UK who, tired of waiting for this decision, had moved forward and had granted Huawei the installation of its Mimo technology, which allows the simultaneous connection of hundreds of antennas, increasing the speed of data upload and down, decreasing latency and allowing more devices to be incorporated into the network at the same time.DiversificationHowever, the British Executive says that the legislation will be aimed at diversifying the market, so a maximum share of 35% will be imposed so that no company can take over a monopoly on the facilities. All of this will also be overseen by the industry regulator, Ofcom. From Downing Street, they further insist that, as much as the United States says, there is no real risk that British users will be being sweved from China, as the company will be excluded from the key points of the network and all antennas and installations from there will be reviewed as a precaution.Boris Johnson's decision to give Huawei the green light comes, moreover, at a timecomplicated in trade relations between the two countries. Although it gave the impression that an idyll had been forged during last December's campaign for the British election, the truth is that the trade agreement between Washington and London is not going to be as simple as it might seem at first.From Westminster they have already irritated Americans by launching the plan to raise tax pressure on big internet giants, such as Amazon, Google or Facebook, namely mainly American companies. This also joins Johnson's negotiation of the future relationship with the European Union while Trump is immersed in the race for re-election, which will take him to the polls in November, so there will be no time or capacity to leave anything so important closed.Load-Date: January 29, 2020End of Document

RFA PUBLISHES REBEL PEPPER E-BOOK WITH HONG KONG, UYGHUR FOCUSStates News ServiceJanuary 9, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 491 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM):Radio Free Asia (RFA) has released its second e-book featuring the artwork of Wang Liming, RFA's award-winning resident political cartoonist, known to many by his pen name "Rebel Pepper." The 60 illustrations, caricatures, and cartoons included in the latest volume, titled "Eyes on China: A Cartoonist's Take on Hong Kong, the Uyghurs, and More," display Wang's knack for commenting on complex newsworthy topics through wit and humor. This edition homes in on the ongoing human rights abuses in China's Uyghur Region and the months-long pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong two unfolding sagas covered closely by RFA's journalists and language services. The e-book is available free to download on iTunes, Google Play, and on RFA's e-book shelf."Rebel Pepper uses his trademark brand of political and social satire to focus on the pressing issues of the day for Radio Free Asia's audiences," said RFA President Bay Fang. "This new volume spotlights Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests and China's mass oppression of the Uyghurs, bringing an incisive, artistic perspective to two of the most critical stories that RFA has covered extensively."Wang grew up in China, where he began producing artwork on the many "sensitive" subjects deemed taboo by the ruling Communist Party. The severe restrictions on freedom to discuss certain political topics stifled his creativity, and his cartoons drew the ire of party officials. Wang was forced to leave his native China for Japan in 2014, before moving to Washington, D.C., where he started working for RFA in 2017."As a political cartoonist in the United States, I am able to express myself in ways that are off-limits to people in China," said Wang. "It's my hope that through my work in this e-book more people can learn about the hugely significant issues that the Chinese government, and other repressive governments in Asia, try so hard to keep hidden."RFA previously published another e-book featuring Wang's artwork, "Drawing Fire: The Political Cartoons of Rebel Pepper," in December 2017, for which Wang was awarded the Society of Professional Journalists' Sigma Delta Chi Award. Wang's cartoons have also been featured in the Japanese edition of Newsweek, Index of Censorship and China Digital Times.About RFARadio Free Asia is a private, nonprofit corporation broadcasting and publishing online news, information, and commentary in 9 East Asian languages to listeners who do not have access to full and free news media.

All Rights ReservedLength: 501 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Isobel Asher Hamilton)Highlight: The US appears to be renewing its lobbying efforts to get the UK to ditch Huawei after Britain said it would let Huawei build some of its 5G.Body• White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told members of the Oxford Union that the US is "very much concerned" about the UK's decision to allow Huawei to build parts of it's 5G network.• Mulvaney's comments come one day before he's due to meet with Prime Minister Boris Johnson's top aide Dominic Cummings.• The US appears to be renewing its lobbying efforts to get the UK to ditch Huawei after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo initially backed down on his threats to sever intelligence-sharing ties.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.The Trump administration is keeping the heat up on the UK to freeze out Huawei, weeks after the UK announced it would allow Huawei to participate in building its 5G network.During a speech at the Oxford Union on Wednesday, acting chief of White House staff Mick Mulvaney said the US is "very much concerned" about the decision per the Guardian."Our governments share a tremendous amount of security information," Mulvaney told the audience. "We are very much concerned that integrity of that information is hardwired into your computer systems, and if you folks go forward with the decision to include Huawei, it will have a direct and dramatic impact on our ability to share information with you. Period, end of story," he added.Mulvaney made these comments one day before a scheduled meeting with Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson's top aide.The Trump administration has spent the last year furiously lobbying its allies to exclude Huawei from their 5G infrastructure, as it claims the Chinese tech company acts as a proxy for the Chinese government to spy. Huawei has repeatedly denied this, and claims the US' pursuit of the company is politically motivated.Britain's decision last month to allow Huawei to build "non-core" parts of its 5G was a blow to the US, but initially Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US and the UK would continue to share intelligence, despite earlier threats that the US would have to cut ties with any country that allowed Huawei into its 5G.Mulvaney's visit to the UK also comes a week after the US accused Huawei of spying telecoms backdoors designed for use by law enforcement. Earlier this week            the US ambassador to Germany tweeted he had received a phone call from President Trump, reminding him that: "any nation who chooses to use an untrustworthy 5G vendor will jeopardize our ability to share intelligence and information at the highest level."NOW WATCH: Watch Google reveal the new Nest Mini, which is an updated Home MiniSee Also:• Apple warns that the coronavirus is expected to hurt quarterly revenue due to store closures in China and impacted iPhone production• A cancelled conference and supply chain issues: How the coronavirus outbreak is affecting Facebook's business• Apple is checking customers' temperatures at its stores in Beijing because of the coronavirus outbreakSEE ALSO: The Trump administration failed to convince the UK to ditch Huawei and its other allies aren't listening eitherLoad-Date: February 20, 2020End of Document

The phone of discordCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 17, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 479 wordsBodySince mid-2019, the tech world has focused on Donald Trump and his near-staff lawsuit with Huawei. The accusations of being a spy company of the Chinese government and the veto imposed on him by his government that he could not do business with Usdis firms made more than one think that the Asian company was finished.But the truth is that even though the strongest blow for Huawei was not being able to use Google Play Services, the basis for many apps to work, Huawei already had a plan B that had been cooking for some time now and that has helped it to get out of the air Trump's war.An operating system called Harmony but also its famous EMUI, which in combination with the base Android, already gave a special layer of customization to each Huawei device, in addition to its own app store, are technologies that the company was developing and perfecting for their devices and which, in the face of the crisis with the President of the United States, have been a real life jacket.In the midst of this war, Huawei decided to release in September last year the update of its flagship phone in productivity, the Mate, and so the 30 Pro version was introduced without Google services, and although it was thought that the device could not compete in the merc without them, the truth is that he has not done anything bad in China, but also in Europe and other Asian countries where he has already put for sale.In this context, the Mate 30 Pro arrives in Mexico, a phone with one of the best designs and technologies in cameras that we have seen, but that although it is functional and many apps like those of the Facebook ecosystem, i.e. Instagram, Whatsapp and Messenger , they work without problem, the issue is how to get them to the phone.Downloading them is not easy, that is, if you clone your old phone they are automatically passed to the new one and no problem, but if you start from scratch there is no store where they are and you have to have a little geek experience to achieve it. Obviously apps like Gmail, Docs, Google assistant and others will never be available on this phone, because Huawei assures that even if Trump gave them permission to work with Google and other companies again, this Mate will not be updated to be able to use the services Google.And I think this is not a Chinese tantrum, but a way to test how users adapt to a new system, how developers create their apps to work there, and, in one of those, a real strategy that, if it works, could make Huawei create a new echo a track that works and is profitable without Google's support, so Trump inadvertently accelerated the company's accomplishment of something it surely didn't want: a successful independence from gringa technology.We'll see what happens, while that happens, the Mate 30 is in the country and paints to be a great phone.fernando.santillanes@milenio.comTwitter: @santillanesLoad-Date: February 26, 2020End of Document

Facebook and Cisco aren't going to Barcelona's Mobile World Congress eitherCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 11, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1344 wordsBodyThe board of the GSMA,the association of telecommunications operators and technology companies, plans to address the possible cancellation of the Mobile World Congress at a meeting this Friday.Representatives of telecommunications operators from around the world, including Spain's Julio Linares, former CEO of Telefónica,are present on the board of the GSMA. The board consists of 26 members, with the presidency of turn-up by Stéphane Richard, the CEO of French Orange. In addition, mats Granryd, the CEO of GSMA and 24 other representatives of telecom operators, including European giants such as Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone,such as AT&T;,Verizon and América Móvil,the three Chinese operators, and more than a dozen Asian operators are also present on the board.The MWC, which was initially due to be held in the Fira de Barcelona between 24 and 27 February, is the largest technology congress in the world, and last year received 109,000 visitors, who left a shower of millions in the City of Barcelona, close to 500 million euros, according to the organization.The extraordinary meeting of the GSMA board, convened at the request of the operators, will have to decide whether to finally hold the contest, postpone or cancel this year's edition, fearing many attendees of contagion for the Chinese coronavirus.Government Minister Spokesperson Maria Jesús Montero has merely pointed out in this regard at the end of the Council of Ministers meeting that "international events can be held normally despite the coronavirus",and that "we will cooperate with all administrations".But this fear has already provoked the decision not to go to the MWC of this exercise by a growing group of world-class companies, which began last week with the Korean LG, which has been followed by groups such as Ericsson, one of the heavyweights of the fair in its capacity as the second global network manufacturer, Amazon, Sony, Nvidia, NTT Docomo - one of the members of the GSMA board - and other smaller groups such as Umidigi, Gigaset, Amdocs and CommScope. All of them have been added today by other giants such as Facebook,Cisco,Sprint,Intel and Vivo."As a precautionary measure, Facebook employees will not attend this year's Mobile World Congress due to evolving public health risks related to coronavirus,"said the company founded by Mark Zuckerberg in a statement."The safety and well-being of all our employees and partners is our top priority, and we have withdrawn from this year's Mobile World Congress as a precaution," Intelsaid. The US company has thanked the GSMA, the organizer of the event, and says it hopes to "attend and support future Mobile World Congressevents."Throughout yesterday's greattelecom operators maintained various multilateral contacts to clarify their position on whether or not the MWC was held. In general, operators prefer that it is the GSMA itself that leads the decision so as not to be flagged as those responsible for the suspension. This is especially clear for operators with a presence in Spain, and for which Catalonia is a fundamental market within the Spanish market. None wants to be held responsible for the cancellation, especially after the closed institutional support and the political class that received yesterday the option of maintaining the congress, with calls for calm by the Spanish Government, the Generalitat and the City Council of Barcelona.In the case of Spain's Telefónica,her position is even more delicate than that of any other global operator, being the Spanish historical operator, and therefore almost the host of the MWC, in addition to being responsible for guaranteeing all the connectivity of the contest. The same is true, to a lesser extent, with the Spanish company Cellnex, the European mobile tower infrastructure giant, a group based in Barcelona. In neither case is it in any case that they are meant to be able to relate to a decision that would harm Barcelona's economic interests.But the problem for this year's MWC is much more image and reputational than sanitary. All the companies that have announced their resignation to participate in this year's edition justified the cancellation with the same argument: no one wants to put their workers, customers and suppliers at risk, no matter how much measures have been taken to increase health security. If a single case of infection occurs during the congress, the reputation of the attending companies can be seriously damaged.To date, the coronavirus,which originates in China's Hubei province, has infected more than 40,000 people and claimed more than 1,000 lives. Only two cases have been reported in Spain.Faced with escalating cancellations, GSMA on Sunday announced an increase in health security measures such as a ban on access to the fair for travellers from Hubei and the requirement that all congressmen arriving from China show that they have been gone fourteen days before (the time of incubation of the virus). In parallel, he also explained that the attendees will be temperature-controlled. Despite yesterday's increase in cancellations, the organizer of the congress remained silent.Meanwhile, the assembly of the congress in the Fira de Barcelona venues in Montjuic and L'Hospitalet follows its course with operators - some equipped with masks - already riding the first stands in the pavilions. Sources from the fair institution noted that work began last week and that deadlines are kept within the timetable.Fearing that the snowball will grow larger, the Government, the Generalitat and the Barcelona City Council reaffirmed their commitment to the congress. The three administrations hope that the security measures announced on Sunday by GSMA, the world's employer of mobile operators and organizer of the fair, will be sufficient to stop the indentation of casualties.Oxygen balloonIn the midst of the cancellation cascade, the MWC also received some oxygen balloon yesterday. The Chinese giant Xiaomi explained that it continues with its agenda at the Barcelona fair, although "pending" the evolution of events. The company, which plans to announce new mobiles and hardware at the MWC, indicated that it will follow all GSMA recommendations, such as that employees coming from China should have left the countryat least 14 days before his arrival in Barcelona and in asymptomatic state.Oppo, who will present his new range of mobiles at the fair, keeps his agenda intact at the MWC and will follow the security protocols that the GSMA has marked. The Chinese company said "everything is still standing" and that its Chinese spokesmen have been in Europe for more than 15 days. Fellow Chinese Lenovo indicated that the company has not modified its plans or its presence at the MWC in the face of the coronavirusepidemic.For its part, TCL, like ZTE, announced the cancellation of its news press conference scheduled for February 22, although it will keep the activity in its stand at the fair. The confirmation of these multinationals is added to the list of other tech giants such as Samsung or Huawei,who have renewed their commitment.Hotel and catering cancellationsBarcelona hoteliers acknowledged yesterday that booking cancellations for MWC week continue to increase. "It is still too early to quantify what the total impact will be," they said through the Gremi d'Hotels in Barcelona. As usual for this type of event, reservations for the four days of the congress are paid in advance and the amount is non-refundable. Generally, congressmen extend their stay a couple of days before the event and also two or three days once it is over. In this case, reservations are not paid and hotels will lose their business. For establishments that were practically fully booked by some of the companies that have cancelled their attendance, the losses will be counted in hundreds of thousands of euros. For its part, the Barcelona Restoration Guild noted that the sector is experiencing the first cancellations and recalled that the MWC means "saving a quarter", the first of the year, which is usually bad.ErpLoad-Date: February 12, 2020End of Document

Also, owing to the dropping prices of lithium-ion batteries, various automakers are turning to optimize lithium-ion batteries in their 48V systems. To optimize costs and packaging, Hella developed a 48V power pack that combines a 48V battery, BMS, and DC/DC converter, making it easier to integrate into the existing vehicle architecture.Motor/generator is expected to grow at the fastest CAGR in the BEV powertrain component marketMotor/generator is estimated to be the fastest growing segment in the BEV powertrain market. With the need to decrease CO2 emissions, automakers are switching to pure electric models. Various developments in motor/generators to improve the performance of the BEVs are also driving the BEV Electric Powertrain Market. For example, Tesla Model S uses two motors, and Rimac Concept One uses four motors for improved performance. The rise in sales of BEVs and developments in BEV powertrain motor concepts will drive this market segment in the future.Request FREE Sample Report:https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/requestsampleNew.asp?id=97605711  Asia Pacific is expected to lead the Electric Powertrain Market during the forecast periodAsia pacific is estimated to be the largest market for electric powertrains as China is at the forefront of this technology globally.

Coronavirus could be a black swan: Moody'sCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 4, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 324 wordsBodyThe coronavirus outbreak in China could be a black swan, even bigger than the 2008-2009 financial crisis and recession, evaluated by Moody's analysts.In a report, specialists point out that, unlike the mortgage crisis a decade ago, no one could predict that a potential and devastating pandemic would break out by the beginning of 2020."Moody's Analytics' index of industrial metals has sunk in response to the risks of further virus dispersion," the report states. The market fears that the outbreak will slow down the Chinese economy, and thereby its demand.Moody's index shows a 7.1% decline since the outbreak was released, including a drop of 10.4% for copper, 8.7% for nickel, 7.3% for zinc, 4.6% for lead and 3.5% for aluminum. On January 29, the ratings reached their lowest level since June 2017."This often reliable barometer of global industrial activity fared better during the worst of the U.S.-China trade war," moody's report states.According to the agency, there is a correlation between the index and global economic growth, with data supporting this claim for the period 1987-2019. This relationship is even more pronounced than that of the world economy with the performance of U.S. economic activity, the analysis warns."Expectations of an acceleration in global growth to 3.3% by 2020 are now challenged by the uncertain course the coronavirus is pursuing. Having recovered to 0.8% growth at an annual rate over the past 13 weeks until January 17 this year, the industrial metals price index shows a drop of 3.8%," the study details.The epidemic appeared in December in a market selling seafood and fish in the provincial capital of Hubei, Wuhan, although it was also known for offering exotic meats. So far, cases have already been reported in more than 20 countries.The Chinese government has stated that it needs surgical "emergency" masks, protective suits and safety goggles.

Digital currency gains on fears of cash, coronavirusUSA TODAYFebruary 24, 2020 MondayFIRST EDITIONCopyright 2020 Gannett Company, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: MONEY; Pg. 2BLength: 533 wordsByline: Dalvin Brown, USA TODAYBodySometimes it's hard to avoid surfaces and objects that other people have touched, which is a common way for bacteria to travel. Numerous studies have shown that ATMs, credit cards and those payment tablets popping up in restaurants are rife with all sorts of illness-causing germs. Plus, despite the rise of digital wallets, millions of Americans still use old-fashioned paper money every day.Which raises the question: Can coronavirus live on the cash in your pocket or on the plastic in your purse?"Cash is not a good vehicle to transport respiratory viruses, however, cards have a little bit more potential," said Dr. Susan Whittier, a clinical microbiologist at New York-Presbyterian Hospital at Columbia University Medical Center. "If someone is coughing, and then they hand their credit card to someone across the counter, I wouldn't rule out the potential of transmission."Viruses, in general, tend to survive longer on such hard surfaces as credit cards and coins than they do on porous surfaces such as fabric and dollar bills, Whittier added.Still, Chinese banks have started essentially washing money to destroy potentially infected cash before it's handed back out."Cash received by banks must be sterilized before being released to customers," the Chinese government's website recently announced. The nation is using ultraviolet light and heat to kill any bacteria on  currency.While it's certainly not necessary at this point, making digital payments and transfers could be a viable solution for people shaken by the mere threat of infected cash."Anytime you decrease coming in contact with contaminated surfaces, you're decreasing your risk of coming in contact with viruses," Whittier said.There's been a surge of investment in cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin since news of novel coronavirus hit, which may or may not be pure coincidence.Bitcoin, a market leader, saw a record month in January, breaking $100,000 a day in China alone, the company's CEO Stefan Rust told USA TODAY. The decentralized digital currency saw "a greater surge beyond that" globally in February. Bitcoin currently is trading $10,152 per share.Second to Bitcoin in the mobile payments space is Ethereum, which saw shares gradually rise in mid-January, though shares are priced much lower at $278. The digital currency platform Ripple saw shares jump around the same time.China, which seems to be ground zero for coronavirus cases, is a digitally savvy nation that's light-years ahead of the U.S. when it comes to doing away with paper money.But the potential economic downturn as factories shutter, workers stay home and tourism halts could drive investors to flee risky stocks and park their cash in other places."People are looking for a safe haven and cryptocurrency might be that safe haven," Rust said.Someone also took to Reddit this week to announced a new strain of cryptocurrency dubbed "Coronacoin," which claims to be backed by the spread of the deadly respiratory illness. A portion of the funds generated will be donated to Red Cross, according to coronatoken.org.For now, Coronacoin is virtually worthless, trading at less than half a cent, according to the bitcoin tracking site CoinGecko. Load-Date: February 24, 2020End of Document

New charges were filed against Huawei in New York over theft of "intellectual property" from American companiesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 13, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 388 wordsBodyHuawei took a severe blow on Thursday when she was charged with new criminal charges in New York courts, alleging that the Chinese tech giant worked for "decades" to steal trade secrets from U.S. companies.The prosecution alleges that China's Huawei Technologies Co. and two of its U-subsidiaries conspired "to embezzle the intellectual property" of six U.S. companies as part of a strategy to grow their global business.Brooklyn Federal Prosecutor Richard Donaghue said it was indicted that Huawei has been carrying out these illegal practices since 2000, and that in 2013 it implemented an internal policy that encouraged its employees to "steal confidential information from rivals" with headquarters or offices in the United States."Huawei's efforts to steal trade secrets and other sophisticated American technology were successful," the statement released Thursday, adds that the company "obtained the non-public intellectual property related to the source code of the Internet router, cellular antenna technology and robotics" to gain an "unfair competitive advantage" over their rivals.According to The Wall Street Journal, Thursday's indictment also features new signals about Huawei's business in sanctions-subject countries, such as Iran and North Korea.The new charges add to an indictment opened since January 2019 alleging that Huawei stole trade secrets from US carrier T-Mobile in a case that led to the arrest in Canada of Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou.Huawei, one of the world's largest technology firms and a leading manufacturer of telecommunications equipment, has been blacklisted in Washington amid concerns about its ties to the Chinese government and intelligence services.On Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal spread a revelation from U.S. officials claiming that the Chinese company is able to secretly access mobile phone networks around the world through "back doors" designed for police use, as Washington tries to persuade its allies to exclude the company from its business.According to that article, intelligence agencies in the country showed that Huawei has had this secret capability for more than a decade, although the company rejected the accusations.With information from AFPMORE ON THIS THEME:US reported that Huawei can secretly access mobile phone networks around the worldLoad-Date: February 14, 2020End of Document

CRU: Novel Coronavirus; Key Implications for Battery MetalsPR NewswireFebruary 10, 2020 Monday 4:00 AM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 583 wordsDateline: LONDON, Feb. 10, 2020 BodyPR NewswireThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak an international emergency, and the total number of infections have surpassed that of the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak.In this insight, we will focus on the implications it has for global battery metals markets, namely cobalt, lithium and nickel sulphate. Overall, CRU believes the impact will likely be short-lived, if the outbreak is largely contained within Hubei province where there are only a few major players (such as GEM).We believe that the outbreak could put downward pressure on the price of cobalt and nickel sulphate, mainly by hitting sentiment rather than significantly changing the supply/demand fundamentals. However, the huge price falls already seen in the lithium market mean the 2019-nCoV is less likely to drive prices much lower, as prices already seem to have reached a floor area, putting mines supply under pressure.Our base case assumes that demand will be hit in the short term, as the government takes actions to contain the spread, but it will bounce back in the second half of this year. However, how demand develops in China is the central question for all these markets in 2020.What is the novel coronavirus and its impacts?The first outbreak of the 2019-nCov was in Wuhan, in mid-December. The virus is a member of the family of coronaviruses. Since then, the number of confirmed cases has risen sharply and there have been confirmed cases in other countries also. Currently, the fatality rate has been contained under 2.5% and the daily incremental spreads have declined to below 20%.The Chinese government has taken significant measures to counter the virus, establishing a special team under the Central Politburo Standing Committee and putting the city of Wuhan and the wider Hubei province on lockdown.

Geotechnical Instrumentation and Monitoring MarketPR NewswireJanuary 30, 2020 Thursday 9:20 AM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 536 wordsDateline: NEW YORK, Jan. 30, 2020 BodyPR NewswireGeotechnical Instrumentation and Monitoring Market Research Report: By Component (Hardware, Software, Services), End-User (Energy & Power, Building & Infrastructure, Oil & Gas, Mining), Geographical Outlook (U.S., Canada, Germany, France, U.K., Italy, Spain, Netherlands, China, Japan, India, South Korea, Brazil, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, U.A.E., Turkey, South Africa) - Global Industry Size and Share Analysis and Growth Forecast to 2024Read the full report:https://www.reportlinker.com/p05842924/?utm_source=PRNWitnessing a CAGR of 11.8% during the forecast period (2019-2024), the global geotechnical instrumentation and monitoring market is predicted to generate a revenue of $6.1 billion by 2024. The major contributors of the market growth are the consistent growth in the construction sector and the rising number of government regulations for infrastructural development. Another factor supporting the market growth is the rising demand for geotechnical instrumentation in the oil & gas sector.Taking geography into consideration, the geotechnical instrumentation and monitoring market is expected to exhibit the fastest growth in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region during the forecast period. This can be attributed to the rising number of infrastructure projects in emerging economies, especially India and China. To counter the effects of economic slowdown, China is investing heavily in its infrastructure sector. With a total of $219.4 billion, the Chinese government has approved 27 projects since 2018. Therefore, the huge inflow of investments is indicative of the rising demand for geotechnical and monitoring services in the foreseeable future.In the APAC region, the highest demand for these instruments and services is being generated from South Asia due to rapid industrialization. The major factors behind this are the presence of upskilled workforce and the availability of cheap labor in the region. The governments of many countries, such as Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand are enthusiastically investing in the construction sector, further boosting industrialization.Among various components, the fastest growth in demand in the geotechnical instrumentation and monitoring market during the forecast period is predicted to be witnessed by the services category. This can be mainly ascribed to the surging demand for these services for monitoring of critical structures in the energy & power sector. Additionally, the focus on old structures, such as dams, is rising, which is leading to the deployment of these instruments and services for monitoring purposes to establish the safety of humans and wildlife in the vicinity.Read the full report:https://www.reportlinker.com/p05842924/?utm_source=PRNAboutReportlinkerReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

Wall Street Wants Washington to Do Something and FastTheStreet.comFebruary 28, 2020 Friday 7:15 AM EDTCopyright 2020 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 670 wordsByline: M. Corey GoldmanHighlight: The plunge in stocks and surge in bonds has turned into a not-so-subtle smoke signal from Wall Street to the Federal Reserve to do something - and fast.BodyIt's been an historic week on Wall Street, with investors running for the exits amid expectations that the still-unchecked coronavirus epidemic is already infecting global growth - and possibly set to end the longest economic expansion in history.While large and dramatic in numbers terms - the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Thursday by 1,190 points, the largest daily point drop in history, in percentage terms the stock market declines are on par with past stock market corrections - for now.On the flip side - bonds, the U.S. dollar and gold - all places which investors flee when the going gets rough - have surged, sending bond yields in particular to places they have never been before. At last check, the yield on the 10-year note was at 1.195%."Investors are trying to price in the worst case scenario and the biggest risk is what happens now in the United States and other major countries outside of Asia," SEI Investments Head of Asian Equities John Lau told Reuters. "These are highly uncertain times, no one really knows the answer and the markets are really panicking."There is no doubt that the global economy, and the U.S. economy with it, has already taken a significant hit, as consumers and businesses alike retrench.From still-idle factories in China and other parts of Asia to warnings from the likes of Microsoft , Apple  and other major companies, the consensus is not if, but by how much Covid-19 will impact growth.At the same time, the plunge in stocks and surge in bonds has rapidly turned into a not-so-subtle smoke signal from Wall Street to the Federal Reserve to do something - and fast."Once markets are gripped by fear, the only way to break the back of financial panic is for the government authorities and the central bank to take firm action aimed at helping the economy overcome any foreseeable difficulty," said Chen Zhao, chief strategist with Montreal-based economic research firm Alpine Macro. "Otherwise, fear and panic can become self-feeding, leading to more financial calamity and economic damage."Early on, China was criticized for not doing enough to offset the virus' massive blow to its economy, the second-biggest in the world. In the past month, however, the Chinese government has taken numerous and drastic measures to help the economy, including large interest rate cuts, injections of cash, tax exemptions, public investments in hospitals and health care, and even subsidized loans to struggling companies.Now, Wall Street is turning to Washington and asking the same questions.The answers: A Federal Reserve that has given no indication of if or when it will do anything to adjust monetary policy, and a president who has publicly stated that the government is already doing everything it can and should be doing - and that the panic is the media's fault."I gave a press conference yesterday that was really a very good press conference," Donald Trump said Thursday. "Basically it was a calming press conference, it was a conference to say we're doing well."Wall Street strongly begged to differ. Some analysts including Goldman Sachs Group's equity research team are already beginning to price in no earnings growth in 2020 if the virus becomes widespread."We have to brace ourselves for wave after wave of earnings downgrades," Paul O'Connor, head of multiasset at Janus Henderson Investors, told The Wall Street Journal. "The globalization of the virus extinguishes confidence in the V-shaped recovery that was the view last week."With the U.S. stock market capping off one of its worst runs since the financial crisis, and with no end in sight, investors are saying one thing: Take action."Behind the drop in Treasury yields is investor expectations that the Fed will come to the rescue with a rate cut when in trouble," Kenta Inoue, a senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities in Tokyo, wrote in a client note. "We do expect the Fed to move, but there's a risk that the Fed will wait to see economic data and be behind the curve."Load-Date: February 28, 2020End of Document

China strives to contain a strengthened coronavirusCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 26, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1030 wordsBodyBy Gabriel D. Crossley and Cheng LengPEKON/SHANGHI, 26 Jan (Reuters) - The propagation capacity of the new coronavirus is strengthening and infections could increase, Chinese National Health Commission reported on Sunday, at a time when the number of people affected in China was nearly 2,000 people from a virus that has already claimed 56 deaths.Several cases have also been detected outside China, in Thailand, Australia, the United States and France, so health authorities around the world are reacting to try to prevent a pandemic.The newly identified coronavirus has raised the alarm because there are still many unknowns around it, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads among people. It can cause pneumonia, which in some cases has been fatal.The minister responsible for China's National Health Commission, Ma Xiaowei, said the incubation period for the virus can vary between one and 14 days, being infectious during this time, unlike acute and severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) ,SARS was a coronavirus that originated in China and killed nearly 800 people worldwide between 2002 and 2003."According to the latest clinical data, the virus's ability to spread appears to be strengthening a little," Ma said at a busy press conference on the second day of the Lunar New Year holiday, adding that knowledge about the virus remained Limited.Containment efforts, which have so far included limitations on transportation and travel and cancellation of major events, will be intensified, Ma reported.The virus, believed to have emerged late last year in a seafood market in the Chinese city of Wuhan where wild animals were illegally sold, has spread to other cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. There are six confirmed cases in Hong Kong.China's President Xi Jinping said Saturday during a politburo meeting that the country is facing a "serious situation."On Sunday, China announced a nationwide temporary ban on the sale of wild animals in digital markets, restaurants and trading platforms. Wild animals sold in Chinese markets, often poached, have been designated as potential incubators for viruses to evolve and pass on to humans.Exotic species such as snakes, peacocks, crocodiles and other species can also be found for sale on Taobao, an e-commerce website run by Chinese giant Alibaba.The New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society called on China to make the ban permanent.The U.S. State Department said it will move staff from its consulate in Wuhan to the United States and offer a limited number of seats to U.S. citizens on a flight departing January 28 for San Francisco.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Sunday that his government is working with Chinese authorities to make a charter flight available to any Japanese citizen who wishes to leave Wuhan.The World Health Organization did not qualify the outbreak this week as a global health emergency, but some health experts are questioning whether China can continue to contain the epidemic.On Sunday, China confirmed 1,975 cases of patients infected with the new coronavirus as of January 25, while the number of deaths from the virus has risen to 56, state broadcaster CCTV reported.There have been no deaths outside China.The outbreak has led to the imposition of limits ontravel through china's interior, with Wuhan, a city of 11 million, virtually blocked, cuts off connections to all transports except emergency vehicles.CANCELLATIONS AND DISTRUSTThe health authorities in Beijing urged the public not to shake hands and to greet with a traditional gesture that does not involve contact. The council was circulated via text message sent to the city's mobile phone users on Sunday morning.Beijing also postponed the reopening of the city's schools and universities after the Lunar New Year holiday, as reported by state radio. Hong Kong has also delayed the reopening of schools until 17 February.Health workers in Orange County, California, reported the third case of viruses recorded in the United States, in a traveler from Wuhan who remained isolated and in good condition.On Saturday, Canada confirmed the first "likely" case detected in the country, a resident who had returned from Wuhan. Australia has also confirmed its first four cases.China has called for transparency in managing the crisis, having seen the cover-up of the spread of the deadly SARS virus damage public confidence, although Wuhan's authorities have already been criticized for its handling of the current outbreak."The neighbors of my hometown are wary of the number of infected patients the authorities have given," said Violet Li, who lives in Wuhan district where the seafood market is located."I go out twice a day for a dog walk with a mask, it's my only outdoor activity," he told Reuters by text message.The outbreak has overshadowed the beginning of the Lunar New Year, as hundreds of millions of Chinese move in and out of the country to be with their families, cancelled numerous public events and closed many tourist sites.On Saturday, the first day of lunar New Year, passenger travel decreased by almost 29 percent compared to the previous year, with air passengers down by nearly 42 percent, a representative of the Ministry of Transport reported.Numerous cinemas have been shut down all over China, with major releases being postponed.Cruise operators, including Royal Caribbean Cruises, Costa Cruises, MSC Cruises and Astro Ocean Cruises, reported that they have cancelled a total of 12 cruises scheduled to ship from Chinese ports by February 2.Hong Kong Disneyland and Ocean Park remained closed on Sunday. The Shanghai Disneyland, which expected to receive 100,000 visitors a day during the Lunar New Year holiday, has closed its doors.Airports around the world have intensified control of passengers from China, although some health service employees and experts have questioned the effectiveness of these measures.(1 dollar x 6,9040 Chinese yuan)(Information from Yilei Sun, Samuel Shen, Huizhong Wu, Se Young Lee, Shivani Singh, Cheng Leng, Martin Pollard; Written by Tony Munroe; Edited by Michael Perry and Toby Chopra; Translated by Darius Fernández in the writing of Gdansk)Load-Date: February 24, 2020End of Document

Chinese Premier promises reinforcements to treat virus and deaths rise to 81CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 27, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 786 wordsBodyBy Winni Zhou and Josh HorwitzSHANGHI, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang will personally "inspecte and direct" efforts to control a coronavirus outbreak in wuhan central city and promised reinforcements, following complaints that authorities did not respond to Time.Global actions fell to their lowest level in two weeks due to growing concern about the economic impact of coronavirus, after China, the world's second-largest economy, tightened travel bans and extended the holiday Lunar New Year.Li is the highest-ranking official to have visited Wuhan since the outbreak began, leaving 82 dead. Dressed in a blue protective suit and mask, he spoke to patients and medical staff."Li (...) He thanked frontline medical workers for all their efforts to treat patients and urged them to pay attention to their own protection," said xinhua news agency.The official announced that 2,500 more medical workers would arrive in the area in the next two days. He also visited the site where a hospital will be built in the coming days.The total number of confirmed cases in China increased to 2,835, about half in Hubei Province, whose capital is Wuhan. But some experts believe that the number of infected may be much higher.Later Monday, state TV reported the first death related to the outbreak in Beijing, a 50-year-old who had been in Wuhan.TRUMP OFFERS HELPUS President Donald Trump offered "whatever help is needed" to control the outbreak."We are in a very close communication with China about the virus," Trump said in a tweet for 18 months engaged in a tariff war with Beijing.Fear around the world was growing. Hong Kong banned people who have visited Hubei in the past 14 days, a measure that does not affect its own residents.Nearby Macau, a city known for gambling, imposed a similar ban on citizens from Hubei, unless they can prove they are free of the virus.Haikou city on Hainan Island in southern China said Hubei tourists would be quarantined for 14 days. "The people of Hubei are being discriminated against," complained a Wuhan resident on the Weibo social network.The number of deaths caused by the virus in Hubei rose from 56 to 76, according to health officials, adding to five others who died elsewhere in China.While a small number of cases have been confirmed in more than 10 countries, related to people travelling from Wuhan, there have been no deaths elsewhere.The Government decided to extend Chinese New Year holidays three days to February 2, in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus. Chinese New Year is usually a period of travel for millions of people, but many have had to cancel their plans due to restrictions.QuarantineWuhan is already practically quarantined and in other Chinese cities there are severe restrictions on movement.The city of 11 million people took further action on Monday, suspending visa and passport services for several days.Images of Wuhan were circulating on social media, where hospital corridors were filled with people requesting treatment, as well as complaints about rising prices for necessities such as vegetables.Chinese leaders have urged transparency in the crisis, after public confidence was eroded by the cover-up of the spread of the syndromeSARS, a coronavirus that originated in the Asian giant and left nearly 800 dead worldwide between 2002 and 2003.Not much is known about the new coronavirus, the ease with which it spreads or its danger, but it can cause pneumonia, which has been fatal in some cases.National Health Commission Minister Ma Xiaowei said Sunday that the incubation period could vary from one to 14 days, and that the virus was infectious during incubation, unlike SARS.For its part, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the incubation period is two to 10 days. "Understanding the time infected patients can transmit the virus to others is critical to efforts to control it," the bank said.The virus is believed to have originated late last year in a Wuhan market that illegally sold wild animals. It has spread to other cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, as well as more than 10 countries, including France, Japan and the United States.Airports around the world have intensified control of passengers from China, although some health experts have questioned the effectiveness of these measures.Last week, WHO did not qualify the outbreak as a global health emergency, but some health experts are questioning whether China could contain the epidemic.(Report by Winni Zhou, Wu Huizhong and Josh Horwitz; additional report by Hideyuki Sano in Tokyo, Lidia Kelly in Sydney, Stephanie Ulmer-Nebehay in Geneva.

CHINA SEEKS TO DIVERT ATTENTION FROM VIRUS MISHANDLING WITH DANCING XINJIANG MINORITIES: UYGHUR EXILESStates News ServiceFebruary 14, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1593 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Deploying ethnic minority medical staff from China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) to dance for patients infected with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a tactic by the government to divert public attention from its mishandling of the outbreak, members of the Uyghur exile community said after a viral video caused outrage this week.On Wednesday, a video went viral on social media depicting an ethnic Kazakh named Bargul Tolheng, who the official Global Times network said is from the Second Hospital in the XUAR capital Urumqi, teaching patients with "light symptoms" traditional Uyghur dances from the region at the Fang Cang Hospital in the virus epicenter, in Hubei province's Wuhan city, while wearing a medical hazmat suit."The leader of our group found that the patients are in low morale which would not be good for their recovery," the Global Times quoted Tolheng as saying in a report published after the release of the video on Wednesday."He suggested that I perform Xinjiang dances to cheer them up ... After the dance, many patients chatted with me happily and asked me how I could manage to wiggle my neck while wearing a medical outfit."Tolheng was among a group of 102 medical workers that comprised the second batch sent to assist in Wuhan from the XUAR, which the Times said included 21 ethnic minorities and 31 members of China's ruling Communist Party.The report said that she had volunteered to travel to Wuhan to help combat the spread of the virus, which as of Friday had infected 64,460 people worldwide and 63,866 people within China, causing a total of 1,384 deathsall but two in the country of its origin.While RFA's Uyghur Service was not immediately able to verify who had originally published the video to social media, the clip was heavily promoted by state media, suggesting that it was sanctioned by authorities.Speaking to RFA on Friday, Dilxat Raxit, spokesman for the Munich-based World Uyghur Congress (WUC), suggested that Tolheng's dance was orchestrated by the government to gloss over how its failure to address the virus at an earlier stage led to it becoming an epidemic."China organized performances by Uyghur and Kazakh medical personnel at the hospital in Wuhan for patients infected with coronavirus for the purpose of deflecting the anger of the Chinese people over the government's failure to contain and control the spread of the virus," he said."Completely ignoring the health risks faced by the Uyghur and Kazakh medical personnel, China used them as a political propaganda tool to appease the mounting anger coming from the Chinese people."WUC President Dolkun Isa told RFA that having ethnic minority healthcare workers dance for patients "gives the impression that Chinese authorities sent Uyghur and Kazakh performers, not medical personnel, to the Wuhan hospital."But he also expressed frustration that the authorities in China regularly change their narrative on minorities in the XUARportraying them as religious extremists or docile, contented citizens who happily accept Beijing's ruleto suit their whims.Authorities are believed to have detained as many as 1.8 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities accused of harboring "strong religious views" and "politically incorrect" in a vast network of internment camps in the XUAR since April 2017, and ethnic minorities in the region are deemed "separatists" for speaking their own language, as well as practicing their religion and culture."But here, when Uyghur and Kazakh culture serves CCP (Chinese Communist Party) interests, China uses it for damage control and pacifying public anger," Isa said.Video reactionsIn the three days since the video of the dancing was published, reactions have been mixedeven in a country where dancing, happy ethnic minorities are a staple of state media coverage.The official China Global Television Network applauded the video on Twitter, suggesting that the Kazakh doctor was "bringing optimism and fun to the hospital," while China's Xinhua News Agency called the dancing "heartwarming."The official China Daily labeled her an "#EverydayHero" who "sought to lighten the mood for novel #coronavirus pneumonia patients."A twitter user named PATRIOT said the video shows that "Uyghur Muslims receive professional education just like us" and that "they love their Han brothers and sisters."But others suggested that Tolheng had been forced to dance for the patients and questioned how this kind of interaction was helping to deal with the outbreak.Timothy Grose, an assistant professor of China studies at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, wrote on Twitter that he "thought it was a hoax."Another Twitter user named Frankie Huang said they could not help thinking about the ethnic minority doctors from the XUAR fighting COVID-19 in Wuhan "while there are over a million Uighurs locked up in detention camps in Xinjiang.""What must they be feeling when they dance," Frankie Huang wondered. "I can't imagine that they want to dance."On Facebook, user Zhe Wu called the video "Very surreal! Very odd!" and tagged her post #reallifeismoreunbelievablethanfiction.Another named Jiamin Hu said watching the video made them "[think] of the dance show from those 're-education' camps," referring to clips of a routine detainees performed for foreign media that was given a state-sanctioned tour of one of the camps last year as part of China's bid to challenge reports of rights violations in the facilities.Reporting by RFA and other media outlets indicate that those in the camps are detained against their will and subjected to political indoctrination, routinely face rough treatment at the hands of their overseers, and endure poor diets and unhygienic conditions in the often overcrowded facilities that experts warned recently could lead to an epidemic.A Facebook post from the English-language website Shanghaiist jokingly captioned the video "Dancing away the coronavirus blues," suggesting that authorities were trying to downplay the severity of the outbreak.Social media posts reacting to the video by members of the Uyghur exile community were even more critical, with at least one user referring to the incident as a "dance of death."Regional responseMeanwhile, the official China News Service reported the first death from coronavirus inside the XUAR on Thursdaythat of an 80-year-old man attached to the 8th Division in Shihezi city under the administration of the "Bingtuan"a name used to refer to the quasi-military Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC).At least 65 people were reported infected with COVID-19 in the XUAR as of Friday, including 10 in serious and four in critical condition, while at least 4,622 are currently under medical observation.Authorities have remained tight-lipped about the epidemic in the XUAR, where the region's top court recently issued guidelines that included severe punishments for people committing crimes such as "spreading rumors" and "using violence against medical personnel," and local officials have told RFA that information about COVID-19 and how it has spread is considered a "state secret."Recent reports on social media, including one by a medical staffer in the XUAR, suggest that as many as 13,000 people from Wuhan may have entered the region ahead of an order by authorities to shut down all transportation in and out of the city of 11 million people last month, although these numbers could not be independently verified by RFA's Uyghur Service.On Thursday, RFA obtained a copy of a document issued on Feb. 2 by the authorities in Urumqi's Saybagh district which announced that they planned to "seal off" the area beginning at 10:00 a.m. the following day, "in order to protect our district residents' health and prevent security personnel from getting infected.""During the seal-off period, nobody is allowed to leave this sub-district except under special circumstances," the announcement reads, adding that only people with "entry/exit cards" will be allowed to do so, and that no one who is not from Saybagh will be permitted to visit the area."During the seal-off period, individuals who need to leave to work as civil servants, medical personnel or in public security must provide their work ID, license, and relevant documents from the community affairs bureau so that they can enter and exit the sub-district regularly."Other parts of the region are similarly affected, according to reports.Sources in Atush (in Chinese, Atushi) city, in the XUAR's Kizilsu Kirghiz (Kezileisu Keerkezi) Autonomous Prefecture, recently told RFA that authorities had declared a state of emergency, rolling out two-meter (6.5-foot) fencing to block local intersections and ordering the city's approximately 200,000 inhabitants to stay within their homes for roughly three weeks, while all visitors have been quarantined.State media recently reported that authorities had erected a 4,000 square-meter (43,000 square-foot) hospital dedicated to fighting COVID-19 in the seat of Kumul (Hami) prefecture on the border with Gansu province in seven days, after breaking ground on Jan. 31.The hospital, which was fully equipped and functional by Feb. 9, is believed to be one of the first to be constructed within 10 days as part of an emergency response to the rapid spread of the virus since authorities built a 1,000-bed hospital in Wuhan that began accepting patients on Feb. 3.Reported and translated by Alim Seytoff for RFA's Uyghur Service.

Defense and cybersecurity stocks have gotten a boost from US-Iran tension. Can they hold onto their gains?CNN WireJanuary 13, 2020 Monday 12:30 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 829 wordsDateline: LONDON (CNN Business) BodyLONDON (CNN Business) --  A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.The high-stakes standoff between the United States and Iran in the past week has sent investors scrambling to buy shares of companies that specialize in defense and cybersecurity --- a sign that traders think tensions in the Middle East won't blow over any time soon.Shares of companies whose businesses could benefit from geopolitical conflict have rallied this year, Goldman Sachs' chief US equity strategist David Kostin and colleagues observed in a note Friday. Stock in military shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries is up 8%, while shares of Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin have risen 9% and 6%, respectively. Cybersecurity specialists Zscaler and CyberArk have seen shares jump 18% and 17% year-to-date, respectively. CrowdStrike's stock has increased 15%.Seth Seifman, aerospace and defense analyst at JPMorgan, pointed out that some of the boost to defense stocks can be attributed to the fact that they're viewed as safe havens in times of geopolitical and economic uncertainty.Seifman said in a recent note, however, that "with so many unknowns," he was reluctant to view the US killing of Qasem Soleimani, Iran's top general, as an opportunity to buy defense stocks more aggressively over the long term.The energy sector also stands to benefit from an escalating US-Iran fight. But Goldman Sachs notes that shares have already "given back their gains, suggesting little investor belief in higher long-term oil prices."Remember: Energy was the worst-performing sector of the stock market last year. Sustained higher oil prices could help drive improvement in 2020. But analysts think that without a major disruption to supply, oil will stay in the $60 to $65 per barrel range, in part due to the strength of American shale producers. That won't do much to help suffering stocks.Can anyone get Boeing through this mess? He's going to tryDave Calhoun might have the toughest job in corporate America: Fixing Boeing.As he steps into the CEO job on Monday, Calhoun is tasked with winning approval for the 737 Max to fly again, the first step in ending a 10-month crisis that has cost the company billions of dollars, my CNN Business colleague Chris Isidore reports.He must also work to repair Boeing's reputation for safety and quality that was badly damaged by the plane's grounding in March following two crashes that killed 346 people.To succeed, Calhoun, a veteran of General Electric, private equity firm Blackstone and media measurement firm Nielsen, will have to win back the trust of regulators, investors and the public."What's Boeing need right now? It needs an inspirational leader," Ron Epstein, aerospace analyst with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, told Chris. "You have a work force demoralized by what's happened. You have to make airline customers comfortable, make regulators comfortable. You need to be a good operator because your largest production line is shutting down. Can Dave do all that? I'm not sure."Remember: A trove of internal communications released last week doesn't help matters. One employee described the jet as "designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys."Investor insight: The company's shares rose more than 130% under Calhoun's predecessor Dennis Muilenburg, who took the reins in July 2015. But they've shed 25% since last March. Muilenburg left the company with $80 million in stock and other assets but no severance, the company said last week.Here's what China is doing to avoid mass layoffsThe Chinese government wants to do whatever it can to protect the economy in 2020. It's got an enormous task ahead of it, my CNN Business colleague Laura He reports. Beijing has made clear that the world's second largest economy cannot spiral into a slump and risk mass layoffs as it tangles with rising debt, cooling domestic demand and an ongoing trade war with the United States. In recent weeks, the government has bombarded the economy with a wave of stimulus measures, from tariff reductions that could help soothe the pain from rising prices, to rate cuts that could fuel more lending.Authorities are also amping up the language they're using to describe the situation. China's State Council last month called on local governments to "go to all lengths" to prevent massive job losses this year --- what it characterized as the country's top policy priority.Have a few minutes? It's worth reading Laura's full story here.Up nextBritain's House of Lords meets Monday to begin debate on the Brexit withdrawal agreement, which is expected to easily pass. The United Kingdom is on track to leave the European Union by the end of the month.Coming tomorrow: Earnings season kicks off in earnest.

The market resiliently cut its losses during the afternoon, though, leaving the S&P 500 down 0.3% for the session.The Nasdaq Composite (+0.02%) eked out a closing record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.6%) and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) still finished lower.Apple specifically said it doesn't expect to meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter due to the coronavirus restraining its supply chain and impacting consumer demand in China. The news didn't come as a surprise given similar warnings previously issued by companies, and investors presumably viewed the situation as temporary and China-specific.Investors, however, did assume some defensive positioning, evident by the gains in bonds, gold futures ($1590.00, +$19.00, +1.2%), and the CBOE Volatility Index (14.83, +1.15, +8.4%). The resulting decline in Treasury yields undercut the financials sector (-0.9%), while it benefited the utilities sector (+0.8%).The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.40%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.56%. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.4% to 99.43.

Both stocks extended their yearly gains to 18.7% and 16.6%, respectively, while Apple trimmed its yearly gain to 8.6%.Walmart (WMT 119.63, +1.74, +1.5%) also outperformed despite missing profit estimates.

WHO Designates Coronavirus Outbreak A Public Health Emergency; Sixth US Case ConfirmedThe FrontrunnerJanuary 31, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: WASHINGTON NEWSLength: 1239 wordsBodyThe Washington Post (1/30, Denyer, 14.2M) reports the World Health Organization "announced Thursday that it was declaring the coronavirus outbreak a 'public health emergency,' setting in motion a plan for global coordination to stem the spread of the virus." China "announced more than 1,900 new cases of the coronavirus" Thursday as the US "confirmed a sixth...case" that marked "the first time the virus has spread from person to person in the United States." Earlier, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci said on Fox News' Fox & Friends (1/30, 831K) that beyond the confirmed cases in the US, "there's no secondary spread from any of those travel-related cases." Politico (1/30, Ehley, 4.29M) reports that US officials "said they believe the threat to the general American public remains low, though they said more cases of human-to-human transmission are possible."The AP (1/30, Cheng, Keaten) reports China on Thursday "raised the death toll to 170 and more countries reported infections from a new virus, including some spread locally, as foreign evacuees from China's worst-hit region returned home to medical tests and even isolation." India and the Philippines "reported their first cases, a traveler and a student who had both been in Wuhan," while South Korea "confirmed a case that was locally spread, a man who had contact with a patient diagnosed the new type of coronavirus earlier."USA Today (1/30, Stanglin, 10.31M) reports, "As the death toll from the coronavirus climbed to 170, numerous countries, airlines and travel groups began scrambling to cut service to China, extract citizens or screen individuals who had been there recently in a desperate effort to contain the contagious illness." The New York Times (1/30, 18.61M) reports the cases "of the mysterious new coronavirus in mainland China now outnumber the infections that China saw during the entire SARS outbreak of 2002 and 2003, officials said on Thursday."The New York Times (1/30, 18.61M) reports that "the rapid spread of the coronavirus has unleashed a wave of panic and, in some cases, outright anti-Chinese sentiment across the globe." According to the Times, "In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDon'tComeToJapan has been trending on Twitter." And in Singapore, "tens of thousands of residents have signed a petition calling for the government to ban Chinese nationals from entering the country." The New York Times (1/30, Rich, 18.61M) also reports that "disinformation is also running high. A much-viewed YouTube video in South Korea claims that a biochemical weapons facility in China leaked the coronavirus, a theory that has gained currency in other corners of the globe." The Wall Street Journal (1/30, Lin, Areddy, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports the US is planning to evacuate more Americans from Wuhan by aircraft as soon as next week.In an editorial, the Wall Street Journal (1/30, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) says the emergence of the virus, and the quick response from the pharmaceutical sector, shows why pharma is essential even as politicians of both parties regularly attack it. Reuters (1/30, Nebehay) also reports on the WHO declaration.Trump Says US "In Great Shape" Regarding Virus.In an interview with Fox News @ Night (1/30) before his Iowa rally Thursday night, President Trump said of the coronavirus, "We are dealing very closely with China. We'll be making certain announcements over the next 24 hours and 48 hours. We are in great shape. China is not in great shape right now, unfortunately. But they are working very hard. We will see what happens."Azar: Virus Does Not "Pose At Threat To Everyday Americans At This Time."Appearing on Fox News (1/30, 896K), HHS Secretary Azar said the coronavirus "doesn't pose a threat to everyday Americans at this time," but President Trump is "ensuring that we are proactively preparing, and also taking the necessary steps to prevent or mitigate any potential further spread of that virus here in the United States. One aspect of that is yesterday, he announced that we have formalized a task force that I am leading across the entire government."Azar similarly said on CNBC's Squawk On The Street (1/30, 3.62M), "What the World Health Organization does in terms of declaring whether there is a public health emergency of international consequence won't change in any way what we are doing here in the United States to prepare and respond to the novel coronavirus threat. ... The threat to any individual American is really quite low at this point, but under President Trump's direction, we are proactively preparing in the event of further spread and we are taking steps to prevent and mitigate the potential for future spread."AP Analysis: Trump Saying Little About Virus To Avoid Angering China.The AP (1/30, Superville) writes under the headline "Wary Of Irking China, Trump Offers Rosy Take On Virus Threat" that the President "has had little to say in public about the new virus that so far has killed more than 170 people in China, sickened thousands more there and led to a handful of confirmed cases" in the US, "and he speaks in broad terms when he does talk about it. ...Aides and confidants say Trump's careful approach is part of a political strategy crafted to avoid upsetting the stock market or angering China by calling too much attention to the virus or blaming Beijing for not managing the situation better, according to a White House official and a Republican close to the White House."Ross: Virus Could Encourage US Manufacturers To Return Operations From China.The AP (1/30, Wiseman) reports Commerce Secretary Ross "suggested Thursday that the viral outbreak in China might offer an unexpected benefit for the U.S. economy: It could encourage American manufacturers in China to return to the United States." The Washington Post (1/30, Siegel, 14.2M) reports that in an appearance on Fox Business, Ross "said that he didn't 'want to talk about a victory lap over a very unfortunate, very malignant disease,' and expressed sympathy for the victims. But he said the pneumonia-like virus would be a consideration for American businesses that are scrambling to determine how the outbreak will affect their supply chains." Politico (1/30, Ward, 4.29M) also draws attention to Ross' comments.Kudlow: Virus Has Yet To Have Major Impact On US Economy.Bloomberg (1/30, Reyes, 4.73M) reports NEC Director Kudlow told Fox Business that the US "hasn't seen any major effects on its economy from the coronavirus epidemic, and will refrain from using it as leverage in the second phase of China trade talks." Kudlow said, "This is principally a public-health problem and the pandemic of course is in China, not the US." Asked if the virus "will give the U.S. more leverage in the second phase of trade discussions with the Asian nation, Kudlow said the outbreak is 'completely separate from trade, jobs and all the rest.'"Stocks Rise Following WHO Declaration.Reuters (1/30, Mikolajczak) reports US stocks "rebounded late to close higher on Thursday" after the WHO "declared the China coronavirus a global emergency." The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 124.99 points at 28,859.44, while the S&P 500 was up 10.26 points, to 3,283.66 and the Nasdaq up 23.77 points to 9,298.93. The Wall Street Journal (1/30, Yu, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) also highlights the impact of coronavirus fears in its market summary.Load-Date: January 31, 2020End of Document

Apple reports record sales thanks to iPhone boost; coronavirus influence guideCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 28, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 775 wordsBody28 Jan. (Common Sense) -- Apple, the most influential technology device company globally, was able to retrace during the last three months of 2019 the negative trend in sales of the iPhone, its flagship product, observed most of the year, to the extent of closing the year with the best quarter in sales in its history.The company, based in Cupertino, California, counted between October and December, its first quarter of fiscal 2020, sales of $91 billion, 9% more than during the same period a year earlier, according to a statement."We are thrilled to report Apple's highest quarterly revenue, driven by strong demand from our iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro models, and record-time sales of all-time services and wearables," said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, at a Statement.Between October and December 2019, Apple posted earnings per share of $4.99, 19% more than that achieved a year earlier and 9.9% more than expected by the Zacks Investment Research consensus.While iPhone sales grew 8% during the period and accounted for 60% of Apple's total revenue during the Year-end holiday quarter, the boost that service and accessories businesses -- or wearables--, that had compensated for the poor performance of the smartphone in previous quarters, remained.Services, which considers a wide offering, such as the recently launched AppleTV+ streaming system, cloud storage or fintech services, increased its sales 17%, consolidating itself as the company's second source of revenue; while wearables, with products like the Apple Watch or Airpods hearing aids, increased their revenue by 37%.In contrast to these lines of business, sales of Mac computers and iPad tablets fell 3 and 11% respectively.Apple's qen revenue momentum was also related to growth in most markets where it sells its products, with the exception of Japan, where a new regulation allows telecom operators to sell devices that are more than 24 months old or discontinued with discounts between 50 and 80% of their original price, Cook explained, at a conference with analysts and investors.As with the iPhone, Apple saw its growth in the Chinese market recover during the period, its third in importance, so far, but a strategic territory in terms of future growth.The company increased its sales in the Asian giant by 3%, a good boost that could last a short time in the face of the crisis generated by the coronavirus outbreak in the city of Wuhan, which has disrupted the country's productive and commercial life.In fact, this situation led Apple to offer an income guide for the next quarter with a range is broader than it usually usually usually usually usually, to reflect the uncertainty this situation could generate in its offering and sales."Our thoughts are with those affected in the region, we are donating resources to groups working tocontainment of the epidemic; we are also working with our affected teams and partners and have limited travel in this situation," Cook added, at a conference with investors and analysts. "We have offered a broader income guide for the second quarter due to increased uncertainty."Some of the company's suppliers are located in the Wuhan area, the source of the epidemic that is currently under quarantine, so Apple is exploring mitigation measures to contain the effect of this loss on production.Apple will have to deal with the closure of other plants away from the epicenter of the outbreak, but which by mandate of the Chinese government are closed and will begin to activate around February 10, it all depends on the location of each supplier, explained Tim Cook, director Apple's general conference.Yet what the virus that has ended the lives of more than a hundred people and sick enthuses just under five thousand people, the world's most valuable company estimates to register from January to March, its second fiscal quarter , revenue that could go from $63 billion to $67 billion; compared to the $58 billion counted in the same period last year, which would mean improving its sales by approximately 10%.In terms of the impact on the sale of its products due to this emergency, the Californian company disclosed that to date it was only forced to close one of its stores, however, other distribution partners have also lowered the curtain of its sales centers.In addition, Apple stores that remain open in China have reduced their operating hours, while implementing additional hygiene and health control measures for their employees.Apple acknowledged that although its sales in Wuhan are limited, the situation has led to a drop in traffic in other territories, a fact it said is considered in its quarterly revenue guide.Load-Date: January 29, 2020End of Document

Organic revenue growth for the year was 3% with an operating EBITA margin of 8.1%, up from 7.3% last year.CEO STATEMENTPeter Oosterveer, CEO Arcadis comments: "We are on track to achieve our strategic targets set for 2020. Our revenue and margin growth in the fourth quarter contributed to an improved performance for the full year. We are also pleased with the results in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America, following the actions we took. Our balance sheet is strong despite a lower free cash flow due to residual delays in cash collection in North America, resulting from the Oracle Cloud implementation.I have always been convinced that the foundation for better business results starts with our people. To create an environment for people to grow, perform and succeed it is vital to attract, develop and retain the workforce of the future for Arcadis. I'm therefore proud to see that our People First approach significantly lowered our voluntary employee turnover rate compared to last year.We continue to invest in our Innovation & Growth agenda, through the recent launch of our new digital business, "Arcadis Gen", focused on developing digital products and services and delivering them through new business models. Arcadis Gen already demonstrated the global scalability of our enterprise asset management platform by winning a major project for Amtrak, the passenger railway operator in North America, which follows the win of a project for Transport for London late last year. In addition, we continue to enhance the digitalization of our core business. In the Netherlands we strengthened our business with the acquisition of "Over Morgen", a consultancy focused on urban planning and energy transition.When we announced our strategy "Creating a sustainable future" in 2017, we defined a clear path on long-term value creation, we are pleased to see that our efforts deliver results."REVIEW OF PERFORMANCEKey Figuresin EUR millions FULL YEAR FOURTH QUARTER Period ended December 31 20191) 2019 2018 change 2019 2018 change Gross revenues 3,473 3,473 3,256 7% 930 862 8% Organic growth 4% 4% 5% Net revenues 2,577 2,577 2,440 6% 660 607 9% Organic growth 3% 3% 5% EBITDA 309 235 204 15% 61 51 20% EBITA 192 189 162 17% 49 39 24% EBITA margin 7.5% 7.3% 6.6% 7.4% 6.5% Operating EBITA 2) 213 209 177 18% 60 44 36% Operating EBITA margin 8.2% 8.1% 7.3% 9.0% 7.2% Net income 12 18 -27 Net income from operations (NIFO) 120 125 88 43% NIFO per share (in EUR) 1.36 1.42 1.01 41% Dividend (proposal) per share (in EUR) 0.56 0.56 0.47 19% Avg. number of shares (millions) 88.4 88.4 87.1 Net working capital % 16.6% 16.6% 15.1% Days sales outstanding 88 88 80 Free cash flow 973) 97 149 -35% 85 132 -35% Net debt 6014) 310 342 Backlog net revenues (billions) 2.0 2.0 2.0 2% Backlog organic growth 0% 0% 2% Employee turnover rate 13.5% 15.6% 1) 2019 figures based on IFRS 162) Excluding acquisition, restructuring and integration-related costs3) Cash flow from operating activities minus investments in (in)tangible assets, including lease payments4) For bank covenant purposes the EBITDA and net debt are lease-adjustedIFRS 16: APPROACH AND IMPACTThe 2019 and 2018 figures in this press release are based on IAS 17, for comparison reasons, apart from the Key Figures section, where we presented the 2019 figures based on IFRS 16.

EBITA was EUR189 million, 17% higher than last year (2018: EUR162 million).The effective tax rate, excluding the total impact of ALEN was 26.8% (2018: 27.2%). The tax rate was impacted by, among other things, non-deductible expenses, updates to tax positions from previous years, and unrecognized losses.Net finance expenses were EUR29.7 million (2018: EUR27.1 million). The interest expense on loans and borrowings of EUR25.2 million was in line with last year due to lower average gross debt, offset by higher amortization of transaction fees.The expected credit loss on shareholder loans and corporate guarantees related to the non-core clean energy assets in Brazil was EUR82.4 million (2018: EUR53.9 million).Net income for the year was EUR18 million and was impacted by the provision to cover the full exposure on the Brazilian energy assets, compared to a loss of EUR27 million in 2018.Net income from operations increased 43% to EUR125 million (2018: EUR88 million) or EUR1.42 per share (2018: EUR1.01).REVIEW BY SEGMENTAMERICAS(33% of net revenues)in EUR millions FULL YEAR FOURTH QUARTER Period ended 31 December 2019 2018 change 2019 2018 change Gross revenues 1,394 1,186 18% 390 334 17% Net revenues 860 755 14% 219 199 10% Organic growth 9% 7% EBITA 56.2 51.7 9% Operating EBITA1) 70.5 54.9 28% Operating EBITA margin 8.2% 7.3% 1) Excluding acquisition, restructuring and integration-related costsNORTH AMERICAIn North America, net revenues increased organically by 8% in the year and 6% in the fourth quarter, driven by all business lines. The operating EBITA margin improved to 9.2% (2018: 8.8%), while absorbing additional cost related to the Oracle implementation. The voluntary turnover rate further improved to 9.4% (2018: 9.9%). The market in North America remains attractive with many opportunities, which is reflected in a strong pipeline and backlog growth of 5%.LATIN AMERICAOrganic net revenue growth in the fourth quarter was 27% and 16% for the year driven by an excellent performance in Environment and a turnaround in our infrastructure business. The operating EBITA margin for the quarter was strong, leading to an operating EBITA margin for the year of 5.3% (2018: -1.8%).

The operating EBITA margin was slightly lower at 8.3% (2018: 8.4%). The performance in the Netherlands continued to be strong. The nitrogen and PFAS situation has a negative impact on the buildings and infrastructure market, although initially also creating opportunities for environmental consultancy, which partially offset the negative impact. Furthermore, the Dutch government plans to significantly invest in sustainable economic transformation, an area in which Arcadis strengthened its capabilities by the acquisition of "Over Morgen". The performance of Germany and Belgium remained strong, while in France we continue with improvement measures. Backlog increased by 2%, especially in Germany and France.UNITED KINGDOMThe United Kingdom delivered continued strong organic net revenue growth, with 4% in the quarter and 2% for the year. The operating EBITA margin of our core activities was 8.8% (2018: 8.7%); including the costs associated with the start-up of our new digital business Arcadis Gen, the overall operating EBITA margin was 8.2%. Post elections and with clarity about Brexit, conditions for investment have improved. The government commits to a £120 billion, 5-year investment program including economic and social infrastructure in regions where Arcadis has a strong presence. Backlog increased 4% and was particularly strong in the fourth quarter.MIDDLE EASTOur increased selectivity led to lower organic net revenues in the Middle East of -10% in the year, but for the first-time since the strategic re-orientation in 2018 the business showed organic revenue growth in the quarter.

The operating EBITA margin increased to 8.8% (2018: 4.9%) as a result of the actions taken to improve profitability. The Coronavirus in China and the actions taken by the Chinese government has started to create an impact, which is expected to worsen given the current outlook.AUSTRALIA PACIFICIn Australia, organic growth was 7% in the year and 21% in the quarter. The operating EBITA margin improved further to 13.3% (2018: 11.7%) on the back of a higher billability. The infrastructure market in the major urban areas remains strong. The bush fire disaster impact on government spending is yet to be fully understood. The backlog was in line with last year.CALLISONRTKL(9% of net revenues)in EUR millions FULL YEAR FOURTH QUARTER Period ended 31 December 2019 2018 change 2019 2018 change Gross revenues 301 301 0% 73 81 -10% Net revenues 222 220 1% 56 59 -6% Organic growth -5% -12% EBITA 16.7 17.3 -3% Operating EBITA1) 17.0 19.4 -13% Operating EBITA margin 7.6% 8.8% 1) Excluding acquisition, restructuring and integration-related costsCallisonRTKL is implementing a new operating model to improve profitability, including measures to address underperforming offices. Net revenues declined organically with 5% in the year and 12% in the quarter. The operating EBITA margin was 7.6% (2018: 8.8%). Key priority in the new model is the strengthening of business development, client engagement and to invest in talent. The backlog grew by 3% in the fourth quarter.CASH FLOW, WORKING CAPITAL AND BALANCE SHEETEBITDA improved by 15% to EUR235 million (2018: EUR204 million). Free cash flow generated EUR97 million (2018: EUR149 million). The cash flow was held back by the implementation of the new Oracle Cloud solution in North America. Despite the good progress made in the fourth quarter, the return to normalized working capital and DSO levels takes more time than earlier anticipated. As monthly billings are now higher than gross revenue this situation will be resolved in due course. Due to the temporary arrears in North America, working capital as a percentage of gross revenues was 16.6% (2018: 15.1%), while the days sales outstanding increased to 88 days (2018: 80 days). Net debt at the end of December was EUR310 million (2018: EUR342 million), resulting in an improved leverage ratio at year-end of 1.3 (2018: 1.7). The covenant leverage ratio improved to 1.4 (2018: 2.0).The dividend proposal is to increase the dividend by 19% to EUR0.56 (2018: EUR0.47) with a pay-out ratio of 40% of the net income from operations, in line with Arcadis policy. Arcadis intends to start a share buyback program up to 3 million shares to cover employee incentive plans and stock dividend.BACKLOGBacklog at the end of December 2019 was EUR2.0 billion (2018: EUR2.0 billion), in line with last year, representing nine months of net revenues. The backlog improved most in North America and the UK and was offset by an expected decline in Asia, the Middle East and CallisonRTKL. In the fourth quarter the backlog improved by 2%.STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 2020Our strategy is based on three pillars: People & Culture, Innovation & Growth, and Focus & Performance. We are on track to achieve our strategic targets set for 2020.

Unit labor costs were also up 1.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.2%). The key takeaway from the report is that productivity is still running below the long-term average from 1947 to 2019 (2.1%); however, the 1.7% growth in nonfarm business sector productivity in 2019 was the strongest since 2010 and above the 1.3% average for the period 2007-2019.

The selling lifted the 30-yr yield to its highest level since January 24 while yields on shorter tenors finished at one-week highs. The bulk of today's retreat happened at the open when the cash market adjusted to an overnight slide in Treasury futures, which took place after it was reported that scientists from China and the U.K. may have made a breakthrough in their search for a treatment for the new coronavirus. However, the World Health Organization said a bit later that there is still no known treatment for the virus. The update from the WHO had a limited impact on the market, which remained near lows through the release of a much stronger than expected ADP Employment report (actual 291,000; Briefing.com consensus 160,000) for January and a better than expected ISM Non-Manufacturing Index (actual 55.5; Briefing.com consensus 55.0).

The CDC announced that there are no new coronavirus cases in the U.S. and that 76 individuals remain under observation. Later in the day, Wisconsin health officials confirmed the first case of the coronavirus in the state, bringing the U.S. total to 12. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in China exceeded 24,000 with the death count approaching 500. Impeachment proceedings are expected to end today with an acquittal of President Trump.

Stocks in South Korea fell 1.5% on Friday.China's National Health Commission reported a total of 75,465 confirmed cases of the virus and 2,236 deaths. Globally, the World Health Organization's numbers were: 76,767 confirmed cases and 2,247 deaths.A plunge in car sales in China during the first two weeks of February was evidence that the virus outbreak clearly was having an impact on China's economy. In Japan, the manufacturing sector saw activity decline in February to the lowest level in more than seven years amid the fallout from the coronavirus.Besides the rise in coronavirus cases, a weak U.S. manufacturing reading also hit equities. IHS Markit's Manufacturing PMI dropped to 50.8 in February, well below economists' estimates of 53.4 and below January's reading.The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 274 points, or 0.94%, to 28,946, the S&P 500 fell 1.2% and the Nasdaq was down 2%.Leading the Dow lower were Nike , Microsoft  and JPMorgan Chase .Larry Kudlow, the top White House economist, told CNBC Friday he doesn't expect a "major blow" to the U.S. economy from the virus."There's not a ton of economic reports for the market to sink its teeth into (Friday) so the coronavirus is back center stage, said Mike Loewengart, vice president of investment strategy at E*Trade.

US Stocks Hold Modest Gains Before Three-Day Weekend; Snap Falls on DowngradeMT Newswires Live Briefs PROJanuary 17, 2020 Friday 12:35 PM ESTCopyright 2020 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 338 wordsBody US stocks gained slightly Friday afternoon after hitting record highs following a strong report from the housing market and news of stabilization in China's economy, the world's second-largest. Wall Street's major indexes came off stronger levels as investors prepared for the equity market's three-day weekend. Trading will be closed on Monday for the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday. The Nasdaq Composite and the Standard & Poor's 500 briefly dipped into the red in midday trade.Stocks pushed higher earlier after housing starts in December leapt 17% to a 13-year high. The S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) was up 0.3% in afternoon trade, with D.R. Horton (DHI) rising 0.3%.Equities found upside support ahead of the bell after Chinese government data showed the mainland economy grew in line with expectations. Growth was 6% in Q4 and at 6.1% in 2019, although the annual rate is the slowest in nearly 30 years. Asian stocks managed gains ahead of Wall Street's open and European shares hit record highs.Perhaps "surprisingly given the escalation of trade tensions with the US, net trade provided a positive contribution to full-year growth of 0.7ppt having been a drag of a similar magnitude the previous year," wrote Emily Nicol, an economist at Daiwa Capital Markets, who also noted the slower pace of overall growth.Among movers, Snap (SNAP) gained 4% after UBS raised its rating on the social media site to buy from neutral, and raised its price target on the company to $24 from $16. Lizhi (LIZI) shares climbed 21% during their trading debut with an IPO price of $11. The Chinese interactive audio entertainment platform had aimed for an IPO price of $11 to $13 for their Nasdaq-listed shares.CDW (CDW) dropped nearly 5% following a downgrade of the computer hardware and software maker by Morgan Stanley to underweight from equal-weight. The firm also reduced its price target to $124 from $126.In midday trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1%.

"We will not discuss political issues that are already discussed in other for a": the CELAC Summit in Mexico closed without positions on Venezuela, Bolivia or the Middle EastCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 9, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1025 wordsBodyThe Summit of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) on Wednesday closed its only day of session without a general stance on the situation in Venezuela or the political crisis in Bolivia and the conflict in the Middle East.Mexican Chancellor Marcelo Ebrard, who gave a final report after the plenary session, immediately ruled out touching on topics already addressed in other regional for a:We will not discuss political issues that are discussed in other forums, such as the OAS (Organization of American States) or the Montevideo or Lima Groups. CELAC cannot make another space to discuss the same issuesEbrard, on the other hand, reported on the 14 projects in which the 29 countries that attended the Summit in the Mexican capital (of 33 members in total) agreed to cooperate throughout 2020 and in which "14 results" were promised by the end of the year."There are 14 projects with 14 results in 12 months. It is Mexico's commitment that was established to match CELAC's confidence," the Mexican representative said. "We will deliver the pro tempore presidency in 2021 and today we had a respectful meeting," he said.The Summit was attended by 29 of the 33 countries in the forum (Photo: Twitter@EmbaMexChi)The Summit began at Palacio Nacional, where President Andrés Manuel López Obrador lives and dispatched. According to the Mexican Chancellery, representatives attended at the minister level and deputy minister of 29 of the 33 CELAC countries.The Mexican government emphasized that, during the plenary meeting, held later in an alternate headquarters but always in the center of Mexico City, "meeting was a breakthrough". "Our proposal is based on CELAC strengthening, we have not been met for political polarization in a long time," Ebrard explained.However, Bolivia should have handed over the steth to Mexico, but the situation is not ideal in this part of the world, as the South American country is mired in a political crisis and also, in recent weeks, in a diplomatic conflict with the Mexican authorities.Marcelo Ebrard, the Mexican Chancellor, presented the final results of the Summit (Photo: Steve Allen/ Infobae Mexico)The other large absentee was Brazil, which had also been absent from the last meeting, as well as Dominica and Trinidad and Tobago, due to the climatic conditions that prevented its representatives from traveling on time to the Mexican capital."For Mexico, it is a very high-level commitment that we proposed at the Summit. We will devote all the effort to getting the results. It's a new decade and we also want it to be for CELAC: first from unity and then on course for the future," he said.Mexico emphasized in its final presentation that, although the forum members, independent of Washington, have disagreements, they are "maximized" and the larger and more important agreements are set aside.The final document of the Summitsrc"https://www.infobae.com/new-resizer/eKh6uOGCJAC9-75i1uNsHjL9B8k/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-infobae.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LGUYWJT22VGUTJYDTTRE4R7BMI.jpg" width"1920"/>The Summit ended with 14 proposals and without any specific political statement (Photo: John V. Manrique/ Infobae Mexico)Mexico, in its inauguration of the pro tempore presidency, emphasized that CELAC is sought to consolidate itself as Latin America's largest instrument of cooperation.To do this, 14 projects were proposed "that have to have results this year". The first, being the most "feasible", according to the Mexican Chancellery, is the one that has to do with space and aeronautics. Despite their complexity, nine countries in the forum have space agencies and six of them have their own satellites. Mexico will therefore organize a meeting in the country inviting these institutions to present a Latin American and Caribbean space program.The second project is about certified and specialized teams to prevent, mitigate and withstand natural disasters. The Regional Humanitarian Assistance Logistics Center (CLRAH) will be promoted.The third is scheduled for March, when the STS Forum is held, a technological event of Asian origin to which the summit host invited CELAC countries to participate. The fourth, for its part, is a meeting of rectors from the 500 best universities in the world located in CELAC.The event in Mexico marked the international debut of Felipe Solá as Argentine Chancellor abroad (Photo: Special)The fifth point is intended for a consolidated purchase in common. The joint acquisition will be sought this year between at least the 29 Summit participants, although it has not been determined what it will be.The sixth is related to the health sector, where permanent monitoring of antimicrobial resistance is sought, to prevent possible mass infections, as happened in Mexico City in 2009, when the city was surprised by a mutation of the classic disease.Another of the points that stood out most enthusiastically was that of the fight against corruption. It was proposed to develop a common methodology to prevent, detect, sanction and combat corruption, and also to hold a forum between CELAC and China in the second half of 2020 within the framework of the Shanghai Fair. However, the Chinese government has not been notified.The forum between CELAC and China proposed for the second part of 2020 seeks to emulate that conducted with the European Union (Photo: AFP)The other items are divided between a new meeting within the framework of the UN General Assembly, as well as the need for a plan to determine the governance of CELAC in the coming years, as Mexico will deliver the pro-tempore presidency in January 2021.The creation of the CELAC Awards is also planned for successful projects that reduce economic inequality and poverty in the region, as well as sustainable management of ocean resources, and finally,not least, regional political concertation to present itself in unity in multilateral for a.MORE ON THIS TOPICFelipe Solá proposed at the CELAC summit a regional agenda aimed at preventing further social outburstsAt the height of the crisis in the Middle East, CELAC kicked off in Mexico in search of relaunching the regional forumLoad-Date: February 26, 2020End of Document

Treasury futures dipped beneath yesterday's lows during the first half of the Asian session, but a swift pullback ensued, lifting the complex into positive territory as attention shifted to Europe. Treasury futures backed off their highs during the past hour, pausing just above their unchanged levels. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in China rose past 28,000 with the death count exceeding 550 but the belief that companies will resume full-scale production soon remained in place.

The selling lifted the 30-yr yield to its highest level since January 24 while yields on shorter tenors finished at one-week highs. The bulk of today's retreat happened at the open when the cash market adjusted to an overnight slide in Treasury futures, which took place after it was reported that scientists from China and the U.K. may have made a breakthrough in their search for a treatment for the new coronavirus. However, the World Health Organization said a bit later that there is still no known treatment for the virus. The update from the WHO had a limited impact on the market, which remained near lows through the release of a much stronger than expected ADP Employment report (actual 291,000; Briefing.com consensus 160,000) for January and a better than expected ISM Non-Manufacturing Index (actual 55.5; Briefing.com consensus 55.0). The long bond remained near its low until the close while shorter tenors trimmed a small portion of their losses as the day went on. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.4% to 98.30, reaching a two-month high. Yield Check: 2-yr: +4 bps to 1.45% 3-yr: +5 bps to 1.44% 5-yr: +4 bps to 1.46% 10-yr: +5 bps to 1.65% 30-yr: +5 bps to 2.13%News: The U.S. Treasury confirmed plans to issue a 20-yr bond in the first half of 2020. Details of the issuance will be included in the May quarterly refunding statement. The CDC announced that there are no new coronavirus cases in the U.S. and that 76 individuals remain under observation. Later in the day, Wisconsin health officials confirmed the first case of the coronavirus in the state, bringing the U.S. total to 12. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in China exceeded 24,000 with the death count approaching 500. Impeachment proceedings are expected to end today with an acquittal of President Trump. China's January Caixin Services PMI decreased to 51.8 from 52.5 (expected 52.6). Japan's January Services PMI rose to 51.0 from 49.4 (expected 52.1). Australia's January AIG Construction Index rose to 41.3 from 38.9 while January Services PMI rose to 50.6 from 49.8 (expected 48.9). India's January Nikkei Services PMI rose to 55.5 from 53.3 (expected 52.4). Eurozone's December Retail Sales fell 1.6% m/m (expected -0.9%; last 0.8%) but increased 1.3% yr/yr (expected 2.4%; last 2.3%). January Services PMI dipped to 52.5 from 52.8 (expected 52.2). Germany's January Services PMI rose to 54.2 from 52.9, as expected. U.K.'s January Services PMI rose to 53.9 from 50.0 (expected 52.9). Today's Data: The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for January registered a 55.5% reading (Briefing.com consensus 55.0%) versus a downwardly revised 54.9% (from 55.0%) in December. The January reading eclipsed the December reading as the fastest pace of expansion since August 2019. The key takeaway from the report is that it marked the second straight month of accelerating activity in the services sector, which is an encouraging sign that the U.S. economic expansion is poised to continue. The Trade Balance report for December showed a widening in the deficit to $48.9 billion (Briefing.com consensus -$48.2 billion) from a downwardly revised -$43.7 billion (from -$43.1 billion). Exports were $1.6 billion more than November exports while imports were $6.8 billion more than November imports. The three-month average goods and services deficit decreased by $0.9 billion to $46.6 billion. The key takeaway from the report is that the goods deficit with China decreased by $73.9 billion in 2019 to $345.6 billion, as tariff measures contributed to a $13.5 billion decrease in exports and an $87.4 billion decrease in imports. The ADP Employment Report showed the addition of 291,000 private payrolls in January (Briefing.com consensus 160,000) after a revised 199,000 increase (from 202,000) in December. The weekly MBA Mortgage Index rose 5.0% to follow last week's 7.2% increase. The Purchase Index fell 9.5% while the Refinance Index jumped 15.3%.

Continue reading Driverless car startup Pony.ai raises $462 million at a $3 billion valuationIn a sign that investors  enthusiasm for driverless cars hasn t dampened yet, Pony.ai today secured a whopping $462 million in fresh funding, $400 million of which came from Toyota. The capital infusion brings the Guangzhou- and Fremont, California-based startup s total raised to about $800 million at a valuation north of $3 billion (up from $1 billion as of October 2019), following previous venture rounds just shy of $265 million in total.For comparison s sake, rival Aurora s previous tranche totaled $530 million at a reported $2.5 billion valuation. Cruise Automation, a GM subsidiary and one of the best-funded autonomous vehicle ventures, has an estimated $14.6 billion valuation. Zoox s $465 million series B in 2018 valued the driverless car company at $3.2 billion post-money, and VW Group s recent $2.6 billion investment in Argo AI, which is allied with U.S. automaker Ford, valued it at $7 billion. After this round, Pony.ai is the second-most valuable independent autonomous driving company in the world,  a Pony.ai spokesperson told VentureBeat in an email.  We are position[ing] ourselves as a global autonomous driving company, as we re running a business in both U.S. and China. Pony.ai and Toyota last year announced a partnership to explore driverless mobility services across a range of segments and industries, and this new financing both cements and expands that existing relationship. The companies say they ll  further advance ... joint efforts  as Pony.ai works to integrate its autonomous system with Toyota s Lexus RX platform and technologies ahead of driverless pilots in Shanghai and Beijing. In addition to co-developing autonomous driving technology, Pony.ai and Toyota will look beyond the vehicle itself to explore further possibilities on mobility services,  wrote the companies in a press release.  Going forward, Pony.ai and Toyota will continue to work together to deliver on their shared vision of a safe and sustainable mobility future. The partnership will focus on providing meaningful societal benefit by leveraging the technologies, know-how, and services of each company. Above: A Hyundai Kona electric SUV outfitted with Pony,ai s autonomous navigation tech.Image Credit: Pony.aiFormer Baidu chief architect James Peng cofounded Pony.ai in 2016 with Tiancheng Lou, who worked at Google X s autonomous car project before it was spun off into Waymo. The pair aims to build level 4 autonomous cars   able to operate without human oversight under select conditions, as defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers   for  predictable  environments such as industrial parks, college campuses, and small towns, with a tentative deployment window of several years from now.Pony s full-stack hardware platform, PonyAlpha, leverages lidars, radars, and cameras to keep tabs on obstacles within up to 200 meters of its self-driving cars. It serves as the foundation for the company s fully autonomous trucks and freight delivery solution, which commenced testing in April 2019 and is deployed in test cars within the city limits of Fremont and Beijing (in addition to Guangzhou).Pony.ai is one of the few companies to have secured an autonomous vehicle testing license in Beijing. Stateside, in California, it has obtained a robo-taxi operations permit from the California Public Utilities Commission. Only three other companies have such a license in California: AutoX, Waymo, and Zoox.Last October, Pony.ai partnered with Via and Hyundai to launch BotRide, Pony.ai s second-ever public robo-taxi service after a pilot program (PonyPilot) in Nansha, China. BotRide allowed riders and carpoolers to hail autonomous Hyundai Kona electric SUVs through apps developed in with Via, sourcing from a fleet of 10 cars with human safety drivers behind the wheel.Pony.ai has competition in Daimler, which in summer 2018 obtained a permit from the Chinese government that allows it to test self-driving cars powered by Baidu s Apollo platform on public roads in Beijing. Separately, startup Optimus Ride built out a small driverless shuttle fleet in Brooklyn. Waymo, which has racked up more than 20 million real-world miles in over 25 cities across the U.S. and billions of simulated miles, in November 2018 became the first company to obtain a driverless car testing permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). Other rivals include Tesla, Aptiv, May Mobility, Pronto.ai, and Nuro.Fortunately for Pony.ai, it has a partnership with GAC Group (a Guangzhou-based automobile maker) to develop level 4 robo-taxi vehicles and a joint collaboration with On Semiconductor to prototype image sensing and processing technologies for machine vision. It s also driven over 1.5 million autonomous kilometers (or about 932,056 miles) as of year-end 2019, putting it within striking distance of Yandex (2 million miles) and Baidu (1.8 million miles).Together, these advantages could help position the company to chase after China s gold mine of a driverless car market. According to a McKinsey report, self-driving vehicles and mobility services in the region are expected to be worth more than $500 billion by 2030, when the number of autonomous cars on public roads is expected to reach 8 million.Previous and existing investors in Pony.ai include video game publisher Beijing Kunlun Wanwei, Sequoia Capital China, ClearVue Partners, IDG Capital, Morningside Venture Capital, Legend Capital, and Eight Roads (Fidelity International Limited s investment arm), bringing its total raised to roughly $300 million and taking its valuation to over $1 billion.See Campaign:http://http://pony.ai/Contact Information:KYLE WIGGERSTags:, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: March 26, 2020End of Document

China threat looms over presidential election in TaiwanAssociated Press InternationalJanuary 10, 2020 Friday 2:59 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 576 wordsDateline: TAIPEI, Taiwan BodyTAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) - Further deadlock and heightened pressure from China is the likely outcome if Taiwan's independence-leading President Tsai Ing-wen wins a second term this weekend, as is widely predicted.Tsai had been leading by a comfortable margin in most polls before the standard blackout period on surveys was imposed 10 days before Saturday's elections.Despite her party losing badly in local elections 14 months ago, Tsai has been buoyed by hostile words and actions from China and months of anti-government protests in Hong Kong, which she says proves that Beijing's "one country, two systems" formula by which it proposes to govern Taiwan is untenable.Tsai's position has been bolstered also by stability in the island's high-tech economy, where stock market prices have remained robust and wages shown slight gains, partly as a result of Taiwanese exporters relocating from China to avoid the bruising effects of the U.S.-China trade war.Her chief opponent, Han Kuo-yu of the opposition Nationalist Party, has slumped in the polls following a series of gaffes and allegations of shady financial deals. He has clung to a pro-China policy despite widespread distrust of the mainland and a strong backlash against Beijing's handling of the Hong Kong protests.Voters will also elect a 113-member legislature, where Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party currently has 68 seats. The Nationalists hold 35 seats with the rest taken by minor parties and independents.While Taiwanese elections generally revolve around economic, public welfare and social justice issues, China's threat to annex Taiwan by force always looms large in the background, and even more so this year.China has taken an especially hard-line against Tsai since her 2016 inauguration, infuriated by her refusal to endorse its claim that Taiwan and the mainland are part of a single China.Beijing cut off all formal ties with her government, restricted visits by Chinese tourists, excluded Taiwan's representatives from international gatherings and peeled away more of the island's remaining diplomatic allies, leaving it with just 15.Stepping up its threats, Beijing has in recent months held military exercises across the Taiwan Strait, sailed both of its aircraft carriers through the waterway that divides Taiwan from the mainland and flown air patrols around the island.However, in an apparent effort to avoid antagonizing voters, Chinese leader Xi Jinping didn't renew the threat of using force against Taiwan during his annual New Year's Eve address, though reiterated China's firm opposition to Taiwan's formal independence. Chinese state media have been notably silent on the election campaign.Analysts say the low-key approach masks a more subtle campaign to back Han and Nationalist candidates for the legislature through media manipulation and social media campaigns.Seeking to scupper such attempts, the legislature last month passed an anti-infiltration bill laying out fines and prison sentences for those seeking to manipulate Taiwan's political system on behalf of China or other foreign powers.In comments to the international media on Thursday, Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said Tsai's government doesn't plan to rock the boat with a formal declaration of independence."Maintaining the status quo is in the best interest of everyone concerned. We will not provoke any conflict with China, but we are absolutely determined to defend Taiwan's democracy," Wu said.Load-Date: January 10, 2020End of Document

Coronavirus prompts PATCO to act to prevent fare card shortagePhilly.comFebruary 19, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Distributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWSLength: 463 wordsByline: Patricia Madej, The Philadelphia InquirerBodyFeb. 19--The coronavirus outbreak in China has caused PATCO officials to act fast.To prevent a shortage of the PATCO High-Speed Line Freedom cards produced at a manufacturing plant in China shuttered by the virus, Delaware River Port Authority CEO John Hanson used his emergency authority Wednesday to replenish PATCO’s stock.A shipment of 30,000 cards -- the stored payment option for frequent riders -- had been expected this week. The unfilled order left PATCO with just about a week’s supply of cards on hand and scrambling to find a solution. Europe-based Paragon ID, which makes the smart cards, found 10,000 cards to ship from the United Kingdom.The cards, purchased for $37,700 through the emergency action, should make it to Camden by Friday after a stop in a Vermont facility, where they’ll be imprinted with the Freedom logo, DRPA spokesperson Mike Williams said after DRPA’s board meeting Wednesday.“We hear they closed the factory, had sent all the workers home, nobody’s been back, so the vendor had to scramble, we had to scramble to get those cards," PATCO general manager John Rink said.The cards, introduced in 2007, can be purchased at vending machines at PATCO stations, or at the Freedom Card Service Center at PATCO’s Broadway Station. Paper tickets are available for occasional riders.More than 70% of PATCO riders use the Freedom cards. About 500 are purchased a week, so the supply of 10,000 should ensure that riders don’t feel the impact.“We have not run out of Freedom cards at this point," Hanson said. "We have Freedom cards, although the supply is small and dwindling.”Attempts to reach Paragon ID for comment were unsuccessful.The coronavirus seems to be mild in most children, but scientists are not sure whyThe coronavirus, believed to have originated at an animal market in Wuhan, has more than 75,000 confirmed cases worldwide and more than 2,000 deaths, most of them in China, according to the World Health Organization. While there are confirmed cases in the United States, none have been reported in Pennsylvania or New Jersey, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The growing virus is impacting businesses, however, with Apple, McDonald’s, and Starbucks among major companies taking measures as a result of the outbreak, according to ABC. Philadelphia-area business are also feeling some of the sting.“We really don’t know when the factory’s going to open back up in China. As you might imagine, we don’t have a lot of contact with them," Hanson said. “And we don’t really know what the Chinese government is thinking in terms of when they’re going to ease some of their restrictions.”___ (c)2020 The Philadelphia Inquirer Visit The Philadelphia Inquirer at www.inquirer.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.Load-Date: February 20, 2020End of Document

Stocks in South Korea fell 1.5% on Friday.China's National Health Commission reported a total of 75,465 confirmed cases of the virus and 2,236 deaths. Also in China, car sales plunged 92% during the first two weeks of February as dealerships remained closed and buyers stayed away during the virus outbreak.Contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 72 points, S&P 500 futures were down 9.45 points and Nasdaq futures dropped 30.75 points.  , led by companies in the tech sector, as Wall Street grappled with concerns over the impact from the coronavirus on corporate profits. The  in the U.S. Friday includes the PMI Composite Flash for February at 9:45 a.m. ET and Existing Home Sales for January at 10 a.m.Deere  , the agriculture and turf equipment maker, posted  and reiterated its fiscal 2020 profit guidance amid signs of sunny skies ahead for the U.S. farming sector.2. -- Sprint and T-Mobile Amend Terms of Merger Sprint  and T-Mobile  announced revised terms of their $26 billion merger agreement which they said could be completed as soon as April 1.Under the revised deal, T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom will hold 43% of the newly created company, while SoftBank, the controlling holder of Sprint, will end up with 24%. Ordinary shareholders will see no difference in the exchange ratio for their stock - 9.75 Sprint shares for each T-Mobile share. U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero approved the long-delayed deal last week, and a group of state attorneys general doesn't plan to appeal the ruling. California regulators must still approve the plan. SoftBank decided to give Deutsche Telekom a larger stake in the combined entity because of declines in Sprint's financial situation during the two years the deal has been under review, CNBC reported, citing unnamed sources. The agreement allows SoftBank to recover the originally agreed upon stake if the newly combined company meets financial milestones over the next five years, according to the report.  The merger agreement between Sprint and T-Mobile originally was valued at more than $26 billion when they reached a deal in April 2018.3. -- Wells Fargo Close to Settlements Over Sales Practices Wells Fargo  is nearing a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department over the bank's sales scandal, The New York Times reported. The settlements could be announced as soon as Friday, the Times reported, citing people familiar with the matter.The Times said the size of the penalties couldn't immediately be determined, but noted that Wells Fargo has set aside $3.1 billion to pay legal costs related to the sales practice matters.A Wells Fargo spokeswoman declined to comment on the report. The bank has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in fines and penalties for encouraging employees to open up millions of fake accounts in order to meet unrealistic sales goals.4. -- Tesla Gets OK to Cut Trees at Germany Site A German court ruled that Tesla  can resume cutting down trees so the electric vehicle company can build its first electric car factory in Europe.A Berlin-Brandenburg court had issued an injunction last weekend to give it time to consider the case after an environmental group challenged a lower court's ruling that Tesla could go ahead with clearing the trees, the Associated Press reported. Final planning approval for the factory has yet to be granted. The ruling puts Tesla on track to start construction in Gruenheide before the start of a crucial breeding period for local wildlife in March, Bloomberg noted.Tesla's goal is to have the plant operating by the middle of next year. The company plans to eventually produce as many as 500,000 cars a year at the site and employ 12,000 people, according to Bloomberg.5. -- Dropbox Jumps on Earnings Beat Dropbox , the San Francisco file-sharing service, was rising 14.35% to $21.40 in premarket trading after reporting fourth-quarter adjusted earnings that beat analysts' estimates.The company posted adjusted profit in the period of 16 cents a share, 2 cents ahead of analysts. Revenue rose 19% to $446 million and beat forecasts of $443.3 million. Dropbox reported 14.3 million paying users at the end of the fourth quarter, up 13% from 12.7 million a year earlier. Average revenue per paying user was $125, up 4.5% from $119.CEO Drew Houston, on a conference call, said it was the company's goal to be profitable on a GAAP basis by the end of 2020.Load-Date: February 24, 2020End of Document

EMA, FDA AND WHO PREP FOR NEW CORONAVIRUS TREATMENTS, IVDSStates News ServiceFebruary 4, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 722 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: ROCKVILLE, MD BodyThe following information was released by the Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society:By Zachary BrennanFollowing the World Health Organizations (WHO) determination last week that the spread of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from Wuhan, China is a public health emergency of international concern, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and WHO have taken various precautions and prepared for new medicines, vaccines and in vitro diagnostics (IVDs).FDA on Tuesday issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to authorize the emergency use of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Diagnostic Panel for the "presumptive qualitative detection of nucleic acid from the 2019-nCoV in upper and lower respiratory specimens (such as nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs, sputum, lower respiratory tract aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage, and nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate or nasal aspirate) collected from individuals who meet CDC criteria for 2019-nCoV testing."To date, this test has been limited to use at CDC laboratories, but FDA said todays authorization allows the use of the test at any CDC-qualified lab nationwide.EMA also said Tuesday that it is ready to support drug developers with all available regulatory tools (i.e., scientific advice, the PRIME scheme, the accelerated assessment and conditional marketing authorization) to advance and expedite the development of ways to fight and prevent the spread of this virus.Developers working on medicinal products or vaccines that could be used for treatment or prevention of novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV infections are encouraged to contact the Agency and discuss their strategy for evidence generation as soon as possible. They can contact EMA by sending an email to 2019-nCoV@ema.europa.eu for initial discussions with EU regulators, EMA said.WHO on Tuesday said that there are now more than 20,000 cases of 2019-nCoV and 425 deaths. The death toll rose to 490 by Tuesday evening, according to the Chinese government.Almost a dozen clinical trials are beginning to take shape in China, including one for a recombinase aided amplification (RAA) assay at a Beijing hospital, as well as one to test the efficacy and safety of the antiviral treatment arbidol in patients with 2019-nCoV.The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), after declaring a public health emergency last Friday, said Tuesday that its working with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals to develop multiple monoclonal antibodies that could be used to treat 2019-nCoV. Other large biopharma companies are also working on treatments and vaccines, including Gilead Sciences, GlaxoSmithKline and Johnson and Johnson.And the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is providing a portal for companies and interested stakeholders to submit market research packages. FDA last week also outlined the product development process for combating this virus.Federal agencies are particularly interested in identifying products and technologies that have progressed into or beyond non-clinical studies, have established large-scale commercial Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) manufacturing capability, or utilize a platform already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), HHS said.Meanwhile, FDA, which has cancelled all staff travel to China, on Tuesday said it is aware that some blood establishments are considering donor education and/or donor deferral measures in response to 2019-nCoV. However, FDA said that respiratory viruses, in general, are not known to be transmitted by blood transfusion and there have not been any reported cases of transfusion-transmitted coronavirus.Routine blood donor screening measures that are already in place should prevent individuals with clinical respiratory infections from donating blood, FDA says.WHO also published its Emergency Use Listing (EUL) procedure to streamline the process by which new or unlicensed products can be used during public health emergencies. The EUL replaces the Emergency Use Assessment and Listing (EUAL) procedure, which was used during the West Africa Ebola outbreak of 2014-2016.Editor's note: Article update on 2/4/20 with more information about the EUA and the death toll in China.Load-Date: February 5, 2020End of Document

France will let Huawei compete for 5G despite the U.S.CE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 14, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 619 wordsBodyThe French economy minister announced that the Chinese company will be free to participate in the development of its networks.The United States warns of the danger it poses to computer security.France announced yesterday that it will allow Chinese company Huawei to participate in the development of its 5G mobile networks, joining the UK and ignoring US warnings that the company is linked to Chinese intelligence and government."Huawei will not be removed from 5G in France, although we will put a number of restrictions to protect our interests," said French Minister of Economy and Finance Bruno Le Maire.Le Maire stated that "it is normal for a state to take its precautions to ensure its sovereignty" and argued that all countries do.CompetitionThe United States and China, the two largest economies on the planet, are confronted by the leadership of this technology, which will determine what will be the dominant power for the next 50 years.This fifth generation of mobile data transmission will allow the operation of sensors, robots, autonomous vehicles and other devices that need large amounts of data.Visiting Brussels, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper warned European Union allies yesterday that opening the door to Huawei in the 5G market puts the transatlantic security association in "danger"."Relying on China's 5G suppliers could make our partners' critical systems vulnerable to disruption, manipulation or espionage," Esper alerted reporters following a two-day meeting of Otan's defense ministers."This could jeopardize our communications, capabilities and, by extension, our partnerships," he added. To address this situation, the Pentagon chief urged "allied and American technology companies to develop alternative 5G solutions."Offer issueIn France, Le Maire said 5G concessions will be made "on a case-by-case basis," two weeks after the UK also angered Washington by giving Huawei the green light in the development of its 5G networks.The minister said he is in favour of the European idea of privileging companies such as Finland's Nokia or Sweden's Ericsson, which also have the technology to participate in that market."But if Huawei has a better deal from a technical or price point of view, they will be able to access 5G in France, (although) with restrictions if there are critical, military or nuclear facilities in its vicinity," he insisted.The 5G will also allow a greater use of virtual reality and artificial intelligence tools, as the transmission speed could become 100 times faster than what we have now with 4G.In the White House there is a conviction that there must be only one winner in this technological race, and the loser must be banished. "The 5G race is underway and America must win," President Donald Trump said recently.The EU also said it is concerned that Huawei is required by law to cooperate with China's authorities. Esper explained that he approached with EU allies during a working dinner at the meeting on Wednesday the cooperation between the Nato and the Union, the hybrid threats and "the challenge posed by China"."We must continue efforts to complement The activities of the Otan and promote transatlantic cooperation (...) especially in the face of a more assertive and growing China",said Esper."Nato allies should carefully consider the long-term risks of the economic and trade elections they make, particularly on the integration of Chinese telecommunications into the Infrastructure of the European Union," he continued.Esper stated that, at the end of the day, "Chinese telecommunications companies have a legal obligation to provide support and technical assistance to the Communist Party," which "is of profound concern."Advertising       Load-Date: February 15, 2020End of Document

February Proves Busy for SPAC IPOsThe Deal PipelineFebruary 21, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 The Deal, L.L.C. All Rights ReservedLength: 671 wordsByline: by Bill MeagherBodyFebruary has proven to be a busy month for the special purpose acquisition sector as seven SPACs have gone public, raising more than $2 billion in proceeds.Two of those SPACs, Newborn Acquisition Corp. (NBACU) and Churchill Capital Corp III (CCXXU) went public February 19, raising $57.5 million and $1.1 billion respectively. The Churchill offering is likely the largest by a U.S. registered SPAC ever, and Churchill didn t waste any time waiting to go public. It only registered its SPAC January 29. The investment vehicle is backed by M. Klein & Company and is the third special purpose acquisition company the firm has brought to market.East Stone Acquisition Corp. (ESSCU) joined Newborn and Churchill going public Feb. 19, raising $120 million to search out fintech deal. East Stone moved swiftly, going from a S-1 to an IPO in a little more than a month.On the other hand, Yunhong International (ZYGHU) followed a deliberate path before going public in its $60 million debut Feb. 18. Yunhong registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 28, 2019 and waited eight months for its IPO. But it might not have been up to the sponsors of the SPAC, LF International Pte Ltd. And Yunhong Group Holdings Co. Ltd. SPACs located in Asia or China have been the subject of lengthy review processes by the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq over the last year, which has slowed their getting to market.Yunhong has plenty of company when it comes to SPACs deal hunting. UTXO Acquisition Inc., a special purpose acquisition company that hasn t yet gone public will be looking in Asia for a transaction. So will Greenvision Acquisition Corp. (GRNV), Proficient Alpha Acquisition Corp. (PAAC), AGBA Acquisition Corp. (AGBA), Longevity Acquisition Corp. (LOAC) and Tottenham Acquisition I Limited (TOTA).Greenrose Acquisition Corp. (GNRSU), a SPAC with designs on doing a deal with a cannabis company, raised $150 million in its Feb. 13 IPO. The SPAC says it s open to acquiring a company that is "touching the plant," that is, a company involved directly in growing, distribution or selling cannabis in a retail setting. Should the marijuana-focused SPAC do that kind of transaction, it will need to acquire a company located in Canada, because Nasdaq will not allow a U.S.-based cannabis concern to list. While this could limit Greenrose s options, it could also help it bag an undervalued Canadian company as valuations north of the border have declined from more frothy levels.The cannabis SPAC took less than two months to go from S-1 to IPO.SPACs have become popular vehicles to bring cannabis companies public. According to PrivateRaise, The Deal s proprietary data service that tracks U.S. registered SPACs, there are five other SPACs prospecting for cannabis deals, including Stable Road Acquisition Corp. (SRAC), Merida Merger Corp. I (MCMJ), Silver Spike Acquisition Corp. (SSPK), Tuscan Holdings Corp (THCB) and Tuscan Holdings Corp. II (THCA). Citic Capital Acquisition Corp. (CCACU) went public the same day that Greenrose did, raising $276 million which included $26 million in overallotments that underwriter Credit Suisse handled. Citic is focused on a deal in sectors like clean technology, energy or sustainability in Asia or China, and the SPAC moved swiftly through the review process with the NYSE, with Citic registering its S-1 Jan. 22 and pricing its IPO just 22 days later. Its sponsor, Citic Capital Holdings Limited, is a global investment company with private equity, commercial real estate, asset management and structured finance and investment divisions and part of the Citic Group, substantial China-based company that is backed in part by the Chinese government. InterPrivate Acquisition Corp. (IPVU) was the first SPAC to go public in February as the the special purpose vehicle raised $241.5 million in its Feb. 6 IPO. Unlike most SPACs, which have some stated sector or geographic focus, InterPrivate is agnostic when it comes to preferences for an acquisition.DEAL SIZE$ 1-10 BillionLoad-Date: February 25, 2020End of Document

Furthermore, they also regulate and control several conditions, such as fluid level, temperature, and pressure, as per the signal received from the control system. The partial or entire opening or closing of control valves is carried out by the actuators. The major components of the valve include its body, bonnet, disk, seat, trim, stem, and plug. Control valves are used mostly in the operations of oil and gas, water and wastewater, chemicals, food and beverage, marine, energy and power, and other industries.The factors driving the growth of control valve market are increasing investments in water and wastewater industry and construction and upscale of nuclear power plants. The water and wastewater treatment industry consists of several chemical or physical treatment processes and biological wastewater treatment processes for the removal of pollutants and harmful contaminants, such as sulfur, nitrates, and bacteria, from water.

Furthermore, as per Infrastructure Report Card published by the American Society of Civil Engineers, in 2017, there were 14,748 wastewater treatment plants in the US. Moreover, the demand of wastewater treatment plants is expected to increase by 23% with an estimated investment of USD 271 billion by 2032. Such developments lead to the increase in use of control valves as they help obtain greater control and monitor the flow of water, sludges, and chemicals in the water and wastewater industry.Inquire or Share Your Questions If Any before the Purchasing This Report  https://www.absolutereports.com/enquiry/pre-order-enquiry/15066501Market segmentationFor the purpose of study, the global control valve market is segmented based on valve type, valve size, component, end use, and region.

The heat generated by the nuclear reactor converts water into steam, which rotates turbine and generators, generating electricity. In 2018, the share of electricity generated by the nuclear power was 10.15% in the world s total electricity generation. Moreover, as per World Nuclear Industry Status Report, 2019, as of the 3rd week of September 2019, there were 415 nuclear reactors operating, globally. Moreover, as of July 2019, there are 46 nuclear power plants under construction phase, globally. Authorities in many countries, such as the US, China, and Russia, are focusing on the construction of new nuclear power plants and the upgrade of the existing plants. For instance, the Chinese Government is working on construction of nuclear power plants, which will lead to the development of two nuclear reactors, namely Fuqing units 5 and 6 in Fujian province of China. Such developments help in the electricity generation to meet the electricity demand of China.No.of Pages: 165Purchase This Report (Price 4450 USD for single user license):https://www.absolutereports.com/purchase/15066501Some major points from Table of Content:Market Dynamics• Market Drivers• Processor Manufacturers Incorporating Control Valve• Emergence of Gestures as a New Way of Communicating with Machines• Development of Motion-Control Gaming• Growing Consumer Electronics MarketMarket Inhibitors• Supply Chain Analysis• Porter s Five Forces AnalysisGlobal Control Valve Market, By Technology• Technology 1• Technology 2Global Control Valve Market, By Application• Application 1• Application 2Global Control Valve Market, By ProductRegional Market AnalysisCompany Profiles• Key Players Ranking• Business Overview• Product/Services Offering• Strategy• SWOT Analysis• Business Overview• Product/Services OfferingContinued...Contact Us:Name: Ajay MorePhone: US +1424 253 0807/ UK +44 203 239 8187Email id- sales@absolutereports.comPress Release Distributed by  The Express WireTo view the original version on The Express Wire visit Control Valve Market 2020 Supply-Demand, End User Analysis to 2025 | Research Report by Absolute ReportsTags:, Wire, Research Newswire, EnglishLoad-Date: January 14, 2020End of Document

The death toll from the virus has risen to 17 in China, with more than 570 cases confirmed.  Investors also digested weak corporate earnings outlooks and remained cautious ahead of the release of Australia's unemployment data for December later today. The benchmark S&P;/ASX 200 Index is losing 56.10 points or 0.79 percent to 7,076.60, just off a low of 7,076.10 earlier. The broader All Ordinaries Index is lower by 60.40 points or 0.83 percent to 7,188.60. Australian stocks rallied to reach fresh highs on Wednesday. Shares of Downer EDI are falling more than 21 percent after the engineering contractor lowered its earnings outlook for fiscal 2020 due to the underperformance of its Engineering, Construction and Maintenance or EC&M; business.  CIMIC Group said it plans to exit the Middle East with the sale of its 45 percent stake in BIC Contracting and expects to incur a one-time charge of A$1.8 billion. The engineering contractor's shares are tumbling almost 20 percent. Tech stocks are lower. Appen is losing 2 percent, Xero is lower by more than 1 percent and Wisetech Global is declining almost 1 percent. Oil stocks are weak after crude oil prices fell overnight.

Global Temporary Power Market Analysis, Trends, and Forecasts 2020-2025 - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireJanuary 28, 2020 Tuesday 2:23 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 834 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Temporary Power - Market Analysis, Trends, and Forecasts" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The global market for Temporary Power is projected to reach US$8 billion by 2025, driven by the growth in construction projects and the need for site preparation with the necessary infrastructure that includes electrical power supply.Temporary power is critical for construction projects to power onsite construction machinery and tools such as powered tools, and lighting, etc. required to support the construction activities, site workforce and equipment. Residential construction, commercial construction and public works require electricity to be delivered onsite. Temporary power can be provided in two basic configurations, i.e. overhead and underground. Long-term projects with higher electrical loads and safety issues often require underground provision of temporary power via underground placement of electrical cables, trenching, and wiring. The market is therefore benefiting from the recovering construction activity in most countries across the global and the huge opportunities in the retrofit market driven by global 'green' building standards will also influence growth in the market.Recovery in construction which began in 2011 in the aftermath of the great recession is continuing even today, albeit with slight bumps and turns. This is largely because of the success with which the industry has and continues to evolve and adapt to changes in labor availability, technology and economic turmoil. Digital technologies for concept, design, engineering and building; rise of AR/VR in digital construction; connected construction; smart on-site equipment; increase in modular and prefabricated construction; use of Building Information Monitoring (BIM), automation, robotics, AI, Drones and 3D Printing, etc. have helped the industry fight the changing economic realities and remain afloat. Healthy outlook for global investments in construction technologies (Contech) also bodes well for the overall outlook for the construction industry in 2020.The rise of smart cities will emerge as the single most important factor driving demand for temporary power in the construction industry. Growth of megacities will fuel residential and infrastructure construction projects worldwide. The over 9,280 ongoing megacity construction projects worldwide create robust demand temporary job site power. Dubai flaunts the highest megacity pipeline project value and will remain an attractive market for temporary power solutions. In addition to construction, demand for temporary power solutions and services is also benefiting from the increase in trade shows/fairs, exhibitions, conventions and special events being organized. Growing competition and increased focus on innovation and new product development are stepping up the importance of showcasing products and services to leverage new business opportunities.Number of exhibition venues globally stands at an approximate 1,300 covering over 36.8 million sqm of space. The scenario benefits demand for temporary electrical power supply and distribution to support digital display areas, special lighting, sales demos and presentations, live entertainment production and operation of equipment such as lifts, scissor lifts and forklifts, among others. The United States, Europe, Latin America. Middle East and Africa represent large markets worldwide with a combined share of 76% of the market. China ranks as one of fastest growing markets with a CAGR of 12.8% over the analysis period supported by the Chinese government's plans to step up infrastructure investment as a way of boosting its slowing economy.Companies Mentioned• Aggreko Ltd.• APR Energy• Ashtead Group Plc.• Atlas Copco AB• Caterpillar Inc.• Cummins Inc.• Diamond Environmental Services LLC• Herc Rentals Inc.• Kohler Co.• Rental Solutions & Services LLC• Smart Energy Solutions• Speedy Hire Plc• Temp-Power Inc.• Trinity Power Rentals Inc.• United Rentals Inc.Key Topics Covered:I.

The virus to start 2020The Snapper: Millersville UniversityFebruary 6, 2020 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 542 wordsBodyShaun LucasAssociate Opinion EditorDespite only being through a month, 2020 has already been established as an uncanny year: Australia dealt with massive forest fires, World War 3 seemed possible, and already an assortment of deaths from icons of our time occurred within the first month of the decade. Moving to February, however, many are still fearful of the outbreak of the coronavirus.The coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan, China, confirmed to begin spreading in the United States on January 30, 2020. According to "The New York Times," the Chinese Government recently reported 20,438 cases of virus infection, along with over 400 casualties. Since there's currently no cure for the virus, many leaders have limited both human and product transport in and out of Asian territory. This includes air travel to and from many regions in China.It's certainly understandable why the coronavirus continues to be feared among the worldly public. The virus is moving fast, along with seemingly no solid way to avoid infection. In addition, the outbreak is even spreading on American soil, with cases as close as Philadelphia, PA. Unfortunately, in times of fear, actions may become sporadic, causing citizens to act against reason.Every time a major outbreak occurs, select individuals attempt to capitalize on fears to gain online traffic. Mainly, this occurs through the spread of false "cures" or methods of avoiding infection. Social media accounts, often impersonating reputable health sources such as the "World Health Organization ," post passages of untested self-treatments. These include tweets stating rubbing garlic on the body will prevent infection. While WHO and organizations have debunked claims such as these, false information only serves to waste time for all attempting proper disease research.While the creators of rumors are certainly unruly, responsibility also falls on other consumers of media. One must always remain mindful of the content's legitimacy. This is especially crucial in modern times, as accessibility to image altering software makes deceit even more possible. Even basic research can avoid confusion, such as checking in with multiple legitimate sources. Some social media sites even attempt to make the search simple, as Twitter marks valid accounts with a blue checkmark.Another factor of the coronavirus is racist remarks against individuals of Asian heritage. While memes coinciding with major news is now commonplace, many are posting jokes about Asian individuals potentially holding the virus. This feeling of resentment has also spread worldwide, with Japanese Twitter users spreading the phrase "ChineseDon'tComeToJapan." Viruses don't discriminate, so focusing on the alienation of one group is foolish.So, what can be done to avoid infection? As aforementioned, no cure exists, with the probability it may only become treatable similar to the Ebola virus. Despite this, researchers innovate medical technology, with disease treatment advancing at a rapid rate. In the meantime,utilize basic health precautions, such as bathing, washing your hands, and getting proper sleep. Society has experienced numerous outbreaks in human history, so I hold faith in innovators to conquer yet another epidemic.Load-Date: February 6, 2020End of Document

US Stocks Head for Second Session of Gains as Apple Shares Leap But Coronavirus Concerns PersistMT Newswires Live Briefs PROJanuary 29, 2020 Wednesday 12:49 PM ESTCopyright 2020 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 439 wordsBody US stocks rose Wednesday afternoon, heading toward a second session of gains as Apple (AAPL) helped push blue-chip shares higher but investors still kept tabs on the continuing spread of the coronavirus.The industrial and material groups performed the best on the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, leading eight of the index's 11 sectors higher. Blue chips as gauged by the Dow Jones Industrial Average were topped by a nearly 10% jump in Apple shares. Strong demand for the company's iPhones and wearable devices helped the tech company outstrip Wall Street's quarterly expectations. Thirteen of the Dow's 30 components rose.But the Dow, the S&P, and the Nasdaq Composite did back slightly away from session highs before the Federal Reserve releases its first monetary policy decision of 2020 at 2 pm ET. The Fed is widely expected to leave policy unchanged after cutting interest rates three times in 2019. At Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 pm, investors will watch for any insight into central bank's expanding balance sheet.The specter of the coronavirus outbreak that started in China was still on Wall Street's radar. Apple said late Tuesday that its second-quarter revenue range was wider than usual because of the greater degree of uncertainty stemming from the virus. "The situation is emerging, and we're still gathering lots of data points and monitoring it very closely," said Apple CEO Tim Cook on the company's earnings call.American Airlines (AAL) reportedly said Wednesday it is reducing service on its Los Angeles to Shanghai route, responding to the coronavirus outbreak. China on Wednesday raised the death toll from the illness to 132 and reported more than 5,900 new cases. Meanwhile, an economist with the Chinese government, Zhang Ming, reportedly told Caijing magazine that the country's economic growth may slow to 5% or even lower.Oil futures fell 0.2% as EIA data showed a weekly jump of 3.55 million barrels in US oil stockpiles, higher than the estimated rise of about 1.3 million barrels.In individual movers, McDonald's (MCD) rose 2.4% as the fast-food chain operator's fourth-quarter revenue and same-store sales surpassed Wall Street's targets.Hess (HES) shares fell more than 5%. The oil exploration company's fourth-quarter adjusted loss widened to $0.60 per share, a bigger loss than Wall Street anticipated. Xilinx (XLNX) stock tumbled 10%, with the programable chip maker late Tuesday posting disappointing fourth-quarter guidance and plans to cut 7% of its workforce.The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index were up 0.4% as was the Nasdaq Composite.Load-Date: January 30, 2020End of Document

Why one Wall Street firm thinks coronavirus is a 'true black swan' for oil and energy marketsBusiness Insider USFebruary 11, 2020 Tuesday 02:00 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 521 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Carmen Reinicke)Highlight: Depending on how the coronavirus situation is resolved, "outright demand contraction is now on the table," Pies wrote.BodyREUTERS/Donna Carson• Oil prices have fallen for five weeks straight amid the coronavirus outbreak, which has weighed on demand in China. • The blow could be the "first black swan of the decade" for oil and energy markets, according to a note to clients sent Monday from Ned Davis Research. • Investors should heed objective indicators, remain flexible, and manage risk, as there might be some opportunities to buy midstream companies at a later date, Warren Pies of Ned Davis Research wrote. • Watch oil trade live on Markets Insider.• Read more on Business Insider.The oil market has been dealt a shock amid the coronavirus outbreak that's upended demand and shaken energy outlooks on Wall Street. The blow of coronavirus to oil and energy markets may be the "first black swan of the decade," according to a note to clients sent Monday from Ned Davis Research. A "black swan" is a rare and unpredictable event that can have extreme consequences. China's oil demand has fallen an estimated 2 million to 3 million barrels per day during the crisis, according to the note by analyst Warren Pies. Both West Texas Intermediate crude and            Brent crude, the international benchmark, are trading in a bear market after five straight weeks of losses. Depending on how the situation is resolved, "the oil market is looking down the barrel at no demand growth for the calendar year, and outright demand contraction is now on the table," Pies wrote. Ned Davis Research downgraded its oil outlook in January and  thinks that it's likely that crude oil and energy equities "will see more weakness before this is over." On Tuesday, oil markets went into full contango, which is when each later dated future contract is less expensive than the previous one, the opposite of how futures usually sit. What this signal indicates is that markets are worried about oversupply amid the impact of coronavirus and            doubt OPEC+'s willingness to support prices. Pies warned investors to "resist the urge to become 'epidemiological tourists'" by forecasting the spread of coronavirus, comparing it to the 2003 SARS outbreak, or trying to determine if the Chinese government is hiding the severity of the epidemic. Instead, he said to heed objective indicators, remain flexible, and manage risk. Because this decline is demand-driven rather than supply-driven, some old trades such as "buy refiners" is unlikely to work, and make "broad investment in E&P stocks untenable," Pies wrote. He suggested that investors look to deploy capital in midstream energy companies, as "this perfect storm could create an excellent opportunity to gain exposure to this group later in the year."NOW WATCH: A big-money investor in juggernauts like Facebook and Netflix breaks down the '3rd wave' firms that are leading the next round of tech disruptionSee Also:• What Americans spend on an engagement ring in each state, ranked from lowest to highest• The rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes, who started Theranos when she was 19 and will now stand trial over 'massive fraud' in July 2020• Exercise makes you happier than money, Yale and Oxford research suggestsLoad-Date: February 11, 2020End of Document

The largest U.S. asset bank exceeded analysts' estimates by announcing a 21% rise in profit for the fourth quarter of 2019, in what was the best year ever for the bank. JP Morgan shares are up 1.93%.On the back, Wells Fargo announced a 55% annual drop in profits for the same period and sees its shares fall 3.54%.Analysts expect the companies that make up the S&P; 500 to have an average drop of 0.7% in net results, which, to be, would represent the second quarterly average decline in the charts, with strong pressure from the industrial and energy sectors that have suffered from the impact of the trade war between the United States and China in this period.Giving some encouragement to the markets is also approaching the signing of the first phase of the trade agreement between China and the United States, scheduled for next Wednesday, January 15.Reuters said the Chinese government will have made the promise that it will spend a total of nearly $80 billion on U.S. products such as cars and airplanes. The news agency, which cites sources linked to the process, writes that this amount focuses on "significant purchases" of cars, automotive components, airplanes, agricultural machinery, medical devices and semiconductors.Among the companies, air carrier Delta Air Lines values 3.60%, after reporting higher-than-expected results.In the technology industry, companies like Apple, Amazon.com, Microsoft and Facebook correct the strong gains achieved in recent sessions.       Load-Date: February 26, 2020End of Document

Wall Street, at highest after dealCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 15, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 363 wordsBodyThe Dow Jones, the road to close for the first time in its history in the 29,000 points.Wall Street hits historic highsthis Wednesday. Both the Dow Jones and the S&P; 500 are trading at levels unprecedented following the signing of the 'phase one' of the U.S.-China trade agreement,which is driving markets.At mid-session on the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow Jones stood above the psychological barrier of 29,000 points with an advance of 0.6%, to 29,113.The S&P; 500 was up 0.44 percent to 3,298 points, while the Nasdaq earned 0.4 percent to 9,083 points.Positive data in New York parquet come on a day when the main news has been the welcome of US President Donald Trump to the Chinese government delegation led by Deputy Prime Minister Liu He to rubthet phase one of the agreement commercial in the White House.At the ceremony, Trump has called the deal a "momentous step" for a "fair and reciprocal trade future" between the US and China.The signing of the document eases some of the fears associated with the long-running trade dispute between the two powers that has dragged on for nearly two years, although some of the tariffs will remain, US trade representative Robert Lighthizer warned on Tuesday.On Wednesday, a white-house adviser Larry Kudlow, who advanced the Trump Administration, was also in the mood for investors to prepare another tax drop by the middle of the year.It is an intense day on the New York Stock Exchange, which also coincides with the publication of annual and quarterly results of two financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs or Bank of America,which have announced a drop in their profits.Among the 30 listed firms of the Dow Jones were maintained with half-session profits companies such as UnitedHealth (2.93%), Coca Cola (1.7%), Merck &Co; (1.43%), Visa (1.39%) or Pfizer (1.28%).The steepest losses were for JPMorgan (-1.32%), Walmart (-0.9%), 3M (-0.54%) Caterpillar (-0.36%).When it comes to crude oil, the US-reference West Texasbarrel is 0.4% and jeopardizes $58.

Wall Street hikes: Dow Jones tops 29,000 points for first time in historyCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 10, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 671 wordsBodyWall Street wants to finish the week on a high. The New York stock exchange hits the all-time highs it hit yesterday, firmly demonstrating its bullish situation. The Dow Jones surpasses 29,000 points for the first time in its history, while the S&P; 500 moves around 3,280 points. Tensions in the Middle East have not frightened US equities this week, and investors are already thinking about signing the "phase one" of the china trade agreement, which will occur next week (if nothing changes).This Friday, it has been known that the U.S. economy, the largest of the day, was dismissed from 2019 while keeping the unemployment rate at 3.5%. In December, it created 145,000 jobs, less than analysts expected, but the figure does not seem to have a particular impact on markets. 2.1 million jobs were created throughout the year.With this background reference, Wall Street looks for more. Yesterday he breast-feeding with all his main indices, without exception, setting new highs of all time.Yesterday's day was "anything but somewhat bearish," stresses Joan Cabrero, Director of Strategy at Ecotrader, who thinks the New York stock exchange "strengthens its bullish situation if it fits further."And when will it be the upward path? It does not appear that soon, according to this expert: "The US market will not show any signs of exhaustion as long as the S&P; 500 does not lose the bullish guideline (...) currently running through the 3,200-3,212 points zone," he says.New Apple and Microsoft HighsAt the corporate level, technology is once again the protagonist of this day. Apple again has all-time highs, hovering above $310. So does Microsoft approaching $163 per share.The iPhone manufacturer doubles its price in the last year. As Aitor Méndez, an analyst at IG in Spain, recalls, on January 10, 2020, ending the session at $152 per title.However, American Express, Intel and Dow lead shopping this Friday at the selective Dow Jones as Travelers positions itself as the 'red lantern' with drops of more than 1%.With less force, Boeing aeronautics falls, shrouded in controversy over the crash of a 737 in Tehran on Wednesday, in which the more than 170 people on board died. From the US, Canada and the UK it is believed that the accident was not due to a technical failure of the aircraft, but to a missile from Iran.  Trade war is once again the focusThis week has been marked in the markets by tension in the Middle East in the face of the latest mutual attacks by the United States and Iran. It's just been a week since the U.S. military killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad.On Tuesday night to Wednesday Tehran responded by launching several missiles at U.S. military bases in Iraq's capital. Faced with the counterattack, US President Donald Trump announced no further military action and merely imposed new economic sanctions on Iran.In the face of geopolitical confrontation and its cooling, the raw materials have experienced a real roller coaster this week. Oil loses 5% from last Friday. Brent crude, a reference in Europe, falls at $65 a barrel and West Texas, a U.S. benchmark, drops to $59. Gold, on the other hand, is just 0.2 percent in the week, at $1,550 an ounce.Yet next week, the United States will change the direction of its look from Tehran to Beijing. The Chinese government confirmed yesterday that Deputy Prime Minister Liu He will travel Monday with the negotiating delegation to Washintong to sign the "phase one" of histrade agreement.After more than a year of tariff tensions, the world's largest powers will seal the 'first part' of the pact seeking trade peace. The rubric will be on Wednesday, January 15, as Trump advanced.  What else to expect from next week?A day earlier, the trade balance of China will be known and on Friday, the 17th, its gross domestic product (GDP).Other references to be known next week will be the GDP of Germany, the eurozone's largest economy, at the end of 2019; inflation in the UK and France; and industrial production across the euro area.Load-Date: February 26, 2020End of Document

Rep. Spanberger Bipartisan Bill to Protect Telecom Networks Against Foreign Threats Passed by HouseTargeted News ServiceJanuary 9, 2020 Thursday 8:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1018 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Virginia, issued the following news release on Jan. 8:* * *- According to a 2018 NATO Report, Huawei 5G Could Be Exploited by China to Commit Espionage, Monitor Foreign Corporations and Governments, & Aid Chinese Military Operations* * *The U.S. House of Representatives voted 413 to 3 to pass a bipartisan bill led by U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger that would build a national strategy to protect 5G telecommunications systems in the United States and among U.S. allies.According to a 2018 North Atlantic Treaty Organization report, Huawei's growing influence as a leading supplier of 5G technology could be exploited by China to engage in espionage, monitor foreign corporations and governments, and support Chinese military operations. In November 2019, the Federal Communications Commission placed greater restrictions on Huawei and fellow Chinese tech firm ZTE due to widespread security concerns. However, the United States still lacks a comprehensive strategy.The Spanberger-led Secure 5G and Beyond Act would require the administration to develop an unclassified, national strategy to protect U.S. consumers and assist allies in maximizing the security of their 5G telecommunications systems. This strategy would also identify additional ways to spur research and development by U.S. companies in a way that maintains reliable internet access. Spanberger introduced this bipartisan legislation in May 2019 alongside U.S. Representatives Susan W. Brooks (R-IN-05), Tom O'Halleran (D-AZ-01), Francis Rooney (R-FL-19), Elissa Slotkin (D-MI-08), and Elise Stefanik (R-NY-21)."To protect the privacy, data, and security of American consumers and companies, we need a national game plan to defend U.S. wireless systems from the next wave of cyber threats. Especially as more of our communities transition to high-speed 5G networks, we must build a smart strategy to defend against intrusions and prevent our networks from being compromised," said Spanberger. "Today, I was proud to see my Secure 5G and Beyond Act pass in the U.S. House, and I'm encouraged that my bill passed with 11 Republican and 16 Democratic cosponsors--showing that the long-term security of our telecommunications systems is not a partisan issue. As we witness the growing influence of foreign-based 5G companies like Huawei and ZTE, this bill would level the playing field for American tech companies and defend the online security of American families and businesses. I encourage my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to take up this legislation for a vote as soon as possible.""In our 21st century economy, access to reliable, high-speed internet is crucial for access to education, tele-health, and countless other resources, especially in rural communities like my district," said O'Halleran. "However, we must ensure that, as this necessary telecommunications infrastructure evolves, we continue to prioritize the security and privacy of all Americans. I was proud to join a bipartisan group to pass this important bill that will allow these crucial systems to grow while protecting American interests from potential foreign threats and monopolies.""The United States needs to be proactive in preventing any vulnerabilities that could be exploited by our adversaries. In our increasingly interconnected world, that means protecting our telecommunications and infrastructure, and those of our allies, from malign foreign interference," said Rooney. "Today's passage of this critical bill, which I was honored to cosponsor, will assist in ensuring the safety, security, and freedom of the United States and in safeguarding our technology infrastructure.""Our economic competitiveness and our national security depend on a clear-eyed approach to China's influence in the 5G space," said Slotkin. "This bipartisan bill will requires an inter-agency strategy to mitigate this threat, protect U.S. companies and consumers, and prevent foreign influence in future telecommunications systems, and I'm proud it has passed the House today.""I'm proud to help pass this important bill to provide clarity and inter-agency strategy to secure 5th generation and future-generation telecommunications systems and infrastructure across the United States," said Stefanik. "Ensuring the United States remains a leading global competitor in both the economy and technology is critical to the future of our nation. This bipartisan legislation requires the President to implement a strategy to secure these systems and maximize their security. I look forward to the bills implementation, and to protecting the competitiveness of American companies and the privacy of American consumers."The legislation passed in the U.S. House today is the companion legislation to a bill introduced in the U.S. Senate by U.S. Senators John Cornyn (R-TX), Mark Warner (D-VA), and Richard Burr (R-NC).Specifically, the bipartisan Secure 5G and Beyond Act would require the administration to build an interagency strategy to:* Secure 5th generation and future-generation telecommunications systems and infrastructure across the United States;* Assist U.S. allies and defense partners in maximizing the security of 5G systems and infrastructure in their countries; and* Protect the competitiveness of U.S. companies, the privacy of U.S. consumers, and the integrity of international standards-setting bodies against foreign political influence.Click here to read the full bill text.

US accuses Huawei of stealing secrets and collaborating with Iran and North KoreaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 13, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 504 wordsBodyThe U.S. government today accused Chinese telecoms giant Huawei of theft of trade secrets and assured that the company maintains illegal business with North Korea and assists Iran in internal surveillance.The 16-charge conspiracy to steal trade secrets and violate the law of corrupt and organized crime-influenced organizations (RICO) against Huawei Technologies, the world's largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer, and two of its U.S. subsidiaries, filed wednesday in a federal court in Brooklyn, New York, the Department of Justice today reported in a statement.One of the accusations refers to the alleged practice that the China-based company has long used to misappropriate advanced technology and intellectual property from U.S. companies through fraud and deception, Department of Justice.In its indictment, the result of a lengthy "independent investigation" conducted by the US Government and replaced the previous ones, the Department of Justice asserts that intellectual property obtained by Huawei included "secrets copyrighted material, such as source codes and user manuals for internet routers, antenna technology and robot testing technology."The U.S. government also accused Huawei of working on trade and technology projects in countries subject to its sanctions or those of the UN, such as Iran and North Korea, as well as of making efforts to conceal the scope of these businesses by mentioning their internal communications to those nations with code names, such as the code "A2" for the first of those countries or "A9" for the second.Specifically, on Iran, he accuses Huawei of helping the Government of that country carry out national surveillance, including during demonstrations in Tehran in 2009, through the company Skycom, one of its unofficial subsidiaries, a relationship that Huawei employees allegedly tried to deny.According to the U.S. Government, to achieve its ends, Huawei reached "confidentiality agreements with intellectual property owners" and then appropriated it and recruited employees from other companies to be the ones who appropriated the intellectual property of their former employers.As part of this plot, he added, "Huawei allegedly launched a policy that institutes a bonus program to reward employees who obtained confidential information from their competitors.""Huawei, Huawei USA and Futurewei agreed to reinvest revenue from this alleged organized crime activity in Huawei's global business, including in the United States," added the Department of Justice, which said this new indictment contains charges of the previous indictment announced in January 2019.Other subsidiaries mentioned in the indictment are Huawei Device Co. (Huawei Device) and Skycom Tech Co. Ltd. (Skycom), as well as the chief financial officer of Huawei, Wanzhou Meng. Contacted by Efe, Huawei has not yet given its version of these new accusations.The U.S. government has long considered Huawei's products to be a security risk, due to their very close ties to the Chinese executive.Load-Date: February 14, 2020End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 28 of 277Coronavirus: which is the safest place to sit on a plane and reduce the risk of contagion  Page 30 of 277Dow Sells Off Sharply as Coronavirus Outbreak Spreads Outside Asia  Page 34 of 277CHAIRMAN RUBIO GIVES FLOOR SPEECH ON JOVITA CARRANZA TO BE SBA ADMINISTRATOR  Page 36 of 277US House speaker Pelosi warns allies against using Huawei  Page 38 of 277US House speaker Pelosi warns allies against using Huawei  Page 45 of 277House Energy & Commerce Committee Issues Report on Secure & Trusted Communications Networks Act  Page 61 of 277Cree Reports Financial Results for the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2020  Page 63 of 277Huawei CFO lawyers say her alleged crimes no crime in Canada  Page 65 of 277Huawei CFO lawyers say her alleged crimes no crime in Canada  Page 67 of 27710 Mexicans arrive in the country after 14-day isolation by Covid-19  Page 70 of 277Co-creator defends suspected UAE spying app called ToTok  Page 72 of 277Indiana State Rep.
