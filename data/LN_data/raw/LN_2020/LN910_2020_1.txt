CHINA'S INFLUENCE ON THE GLOBAL HUMAN RIGHTS SYSTEMStates News ServiceSeptember 14, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 7165 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Is the Chinese government's greater engagement with international institutions a gain for the global human rights system? A close examination of its interactions with United Nations human rights mechanisms, pursuit of rights-free development, and threats to the freedom of expression worldwide suggests it is not. At the United Nations, Chinese authorities are trying to rewrite norms and manipulate existing procedures not only to minimize scrutiny of the Chinese government's conduct, but also to achieve the same for all governments. Emerging norms on respecting human rights in development could have informed the Chinese government's approach to the Belt and Road Initiative, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and national development banks, but they have not. Chinese authorities now extend domestic censorship to communities around the work, ranging from academia to diaspora communities to global businesses.This paper details the ways Chinese authorities seek to shape norms and practices globally, and sets out steps governments and institutions can take to reverse these trends, including forming multilateral, multi-year coalitions to serve as a counterweight to Chinese government influence. Academic institutions should not just pursue better disclosure policies about interactions with Chinese government actors, they should also urgently prioritize the academic freedom of students and scholars from and of China. Companies have human rights obligations and should reject censorship.Equally important, strategies to reject the Chinese government's threats to human rights should not penalize people from across China or of Chinese descent around the world, and securing human rights gains inside China should be a priority. The paper argues that many actors' failure to take these and other steps allows Chinese authorities to further erode the existing universal human rights system and to enjoy a growing sense of impunity.In recent years, the Chinese government has become considerably more active in a wide range of United Nations and other multilateral institutions, including in the global human rights system. It has ratified several core U.N. human rights treaties,[1] served as a member of the U.N. Human Rights Council (HRC), and seconded Chinese diplomats to positions within the U.N. human rights system. China has launched a number of initiatives that can affect human rights: It has created the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) under the mantra of promoting economic development, and it has become a significant global actor in social media platforms and academia.This new activism on issues from economics to information by one of the most consequential actors in the international system, if underpinned by a serious (albeit unlikely) commitment among senior Chinese leaders to uphold human rights, could have been transformative. But the opposite has happened.[2] Particularly under President Xi Jinping's leadership, the Chinese government does not merely seek to neutralize U.N. human rights mechanisms' scrutiny of China, it also aspires to neutralize the ability of that system to hold any government accountable for serious human rights violations.[3] Increasingly Beijing pursues rights-free development worldwide, and tries to exploit the openness of institutions in democracies to impose its world view and silence its critics.It is crucial particularly for people who live in democracies and enjoy the rights to political participation, an independent judiciary, a free media, and other functioning institutions to recall why the international human rights system exists. Quite simply, it is because often states fail to protect and violate human rights, particularly in countries that lack systems for redress and accountability. People need to appeal to institutions beyond their government's immediate control.Beijing is no longer content simply denying people accountability inside China: It now seeks to bolster other countries' ability to do so even in the international bodies designed to deliver some semblance of justice internationally when it is blocked domestically.[4] Within academia and journalism, the Chinese Communist Party seeks not only to deny the ability to conduct research or report from inside China, it increasingly seeks to do so at universities and publications around the world, punishing those who study or write on sensitive topics. The rights-free development the state has sanctioned inside China is now a foreign policy tool being deployed around the world.Beijing's resistance to complying with global public health needs and institutions in the COVID-19 crisis,[5] and its blatant violation of international law with respect to Hong Kong,[6] should not be seen as anomalies. They are clear and concerning examples of the consequences for people worldwide not only of a Chinese government disdainful of international human rights obligations but, increasingly, also seeking to rewrite those rules in ways that may affect the exercise of human rights around much of the world. Chinese authorities fear that the exercise of these rights abroad can directly threaten the party's hold on power, whether through criticism of the party itself or as a result of holding Beijing accountable under established human rights commitments.In June, Human Rights Council member states adopted China's proposed resolution on "mutually beneficial cooperation" by avoteof 23-16, with eight abstentions.[7] This vote capped a two-year effort that is indicative of Beijing's goals and tactics of slowly undermining norms through established procedures and rhetoric, which have had significant consequences on accountability for human rights violations. The effort became visible in 2018 when the Chinese government proposed what is now known as its "win-win" resolution,[8] which set out to replace the idea of holding states accountable with a commitment to "dialogue," and which omitted a role for independent civil society in HRC proceedings. When it was introduced, some member states expressed concern at its contents. Beijing made minor improvements and, along with the perception at the time that the resolution had no real consequences, it was adopted 28-1. The United States was the only government to vote against it.China's June resolution seeks to reposition international human rights law as a matter of state-to-state relations, ignores the responsibility of states to protect the rights of the individual, treats fundamental human rights as subject to negotiation and compromise, and foresees no meaningful role for civil society. China's March 2018 resolution involved using the council's Advisory Committee, which China expected would produce a study supporting the resolution. Many delegations expressed concern, but gave the resolution the benefit of the doubt, abstaining so they could wait to see what the Advisory Committee produced.China's intentions soon became clear: Its submission [9] to the Advisory Committee hailed its own resolution as heralding "the construction of a new type of international relations."[10] The submission claims that human rights are used to "interfere" in other countries' internal affairs, "poisoning the global atmosphere of human rights governance."This is hardly a coincidence: China has routinely opposed efforts at the council to hold states responsible for even the gravest rights violations, and the submission alarmingly speaks of "so-called universal human rights." It is nonetheless encouraging that 16 states voted against this harmful resolution in June 2020, compared with only one vote against in 2018, signaling increasing global concern with China's heavy-handed and aggressive approach to "cooperation."That the resolution nonetheless passed reflects the threat China poses to the U.N. human rights system. In 2017, Human Rights Watch documented China's manipulation of U.N. review processes, harassment, and intimidation of not only human rights defenders from China but also U.N. human rights experts and staff, and its successful efforts to block the participation of independent civil society groups, including organizations that do not work on China.[11]In 2018, China underwent its third Universal Periodic Review (UPR), the process for reviewing all U.N. member states' human rights records. Despite or perhaps because Chinese authorities had since China's previous review opened an extraordinary assault on human rights, Chinese diplomats did not just resort to some of its past practices. These had included providing blatantly false information at the review, flooding the speakers' list with friendly states and government-organized civil society groups, and urging other governments to speak positively about China.This time around China also pressured U.N. officials to remove a U.N. country team submission from the UPR materials (ironically that report was reasonably positive about the government's track record),[12] pressured Organisation of Islamic Cooperation member states to speak positively about China's treatment of Uyghur Muslims, and warned other governments not to attend a panel event about Xinjiang.China has so far fended off calls by the high commissioner for human rights and several HRC member states for an independent investigation into gross human rights abuses in Xinjiang, the region in China where an estimated one million Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims remain arbitrarily detained.[13] Typically, violations of this magnitude would have already yielded actual accountability proceedings, but China's power is such that three years into the Xinjiang crisis there is little forward movement.In July 2019, two dozen governments sent a letter to the Human Rights Council president though they were unwilling to make the call orally on the floor of the HRC urging an investigation.[14] China responded with a letter signed by 37 countries, mostly developing states with poor human rights records. In November, a similar group of governments delivered a similar statement at the Third Committee of the U.N.;[15] China responded with a letter signed by 54 countries.[16]Beijing also seeks to ensure that discussions about human rights more broadly take place only through the human rights bodies in Geneva, and not otherU.N. bodies, particularly the Security Council. China contends that only the HRC has a mandate to examine them a convenient way of trying to limit discussions even on the gravest atrocities. In March 2018, it opposed a briefing by then-High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein to the Security Council on Syria,[17] and in February 2020 it blocked a resolution at the Security Council on the plight of Myanmar's ethnic Rohingya.[18]U.N. human rights experts, typically referred to as "special rapporteurs," are key to reviews and accountability of U.N. member states on human rights issues. One of their common tools is to visit states, but China has declined to schedule visits by numerous special rapporteurs, including those with mandates on arbitrary detention, executions, or freedom of expression.[19]It has allowed visits by experts on issues where it thought it would fare well: the right to food in 2012, a working group on discrimination against women in 2014, and an independent expert on the effects of foreign debt in 2016.[20] In 2016, China allowed a visit by Philip Alston, then the special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, who ended his visit early when authorities followed him and intimidated people he had spoken to.[21 ] Since that time, China has only allowed a visit by the independent expert on the rights of older people in late 2019.China also continues to block the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights from having a presence in China. While there are two dozen other U.N. agencies in China, they have rarely invoked their mandate to promote human rights.In late June, 50 U.N. current and former special procedures the most prominent group of independent experts in the U.N. human rights system issued a searing indictment of China's human rights record and call for urgent action.[22] The experts denounced the Chinese government's "collective repression" of religious and ethnic minorities in Xinjiang and Tibet, the repression of protest and impunity for excessive use of force by police in Hong Kong, censorship and retaliation against journalists, medical workers, and others who sought to speak out following the COVID-19 outbreak, and the targeting of human rights defenders across the country. The experts called for convening a special session on China, creating a dedicated expert on China, and asking U.N. agencies and governments to press China to meet its human rights obligations. It remains to be seen whether and how the U.N. secretary-general, the high commissioner for human rights, and the Human Rights Council will respond.Despite its poor human rights record at home, and a serious threat to the U.N. human rights system, China is expected to be reelected to the Human Rights Council in October. Absent a critical mass of concerned states committed to serving as a counterweight to both problems, people across China and people who depend on this system for redress and accountability are at serious risk.For the last several decades, activists, development experts, and economists have made gains in creating legal and normative obligations to ensure respect and accountability for human rights in economic development. By the time China became the world's second-largest economy in 2010, major multilateral institutions including the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund had already adopted standards and safeguards policies on community consultation, transparency, and other key human rights issues. In 2011, the United Nations adopted the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Taken together, these emerging global norms should have afforded Beijing a template to pursue development with clear respect for human rights, but neither China's development banks nor BRI shows signs of doing so.[23]Beijing's trillion-dollar BRI infrastructure and investment program facilitates Chinese access to markets and natural resources across 70 countries. Aided by the frequent absence of alternative investors, the BRI has secured the Chinese government considerable good- will among developing countries, even though Beijing has been able to foist many of the costs onto the countries that it is purporting to help.China's methods of operation appear to have the effect of bolstering authoritarianism in "beneficiary" countries, even if both democracies and autocracies alike avail themselves of China's BRI investments or surveillance exports.[24] BRI projects known for their "no strings" loans largely ignore human rights and environmental standards.[25] They allow little if any input from people who might be harmed, allowing for no popular consultation methods. There have been numerous violations associated with the Souapiti Dam in Guinea and the Lower Sesan II Dam in Cambodia, both financed and constructed mainly by Chinese state-owned banks and companies.[26]To build the dams, thousands of villagers were forced out of their ancestral homes and farmlands, losing access to food and their livelihoods. Many resettled families are not adequately compensated and do not receive legal title to their new land. Residents have written numerous letters about their situation to local and national authorities, largely to no avail. Some projects are negotiated in backroom deals that are prone to corruption. At times they benefit and entrench ruling elites while burying the people of the country under mountains of debt.Some BRI projects are notorious: Sri Lanka's Hambantota port, which China repossessed for 99 years when debt repayment became impossible, or the loan to build Kenya's Mombasa-Nairobi railroad, which the government is trying to repay by forcing cargo transporters to use it despite cheaper alternatives. Some governments including those of Bangladesh, Malaysia, Myanmar, Pakistan, and Sierra Leone have begun backing away from BRI projects because they do not look economically sensible.[27] In most cases, the struggling debtor is eager to stay in Beijing's good graces. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, China has made some pronouncements on debt relief, yet it remains unclear on how that will actually work in practice.[28]BRI loans also provide Beijing another financial lever to ensure support for China's anti-rights agenda in key international forums, with recipient states sometimes voting alongside Beijing in key forums. The result is at best silence, at worst applause, in the face of China's domestic repression, as well as assistance to Beijing as it undermines international human rights institutions. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, for example, whose government is a major BRI recipient, said nothing about his fellow Muslims in Xinjiang as he visited Beijing, while his diplomats offered over-the- top praise for "China's efforts in providing care to its Muslim citizens."[29]Similarly, Cameroon delivered fawning statements of praise for China shortly after Beijing forgave it millions in debt: Referencing Xinjiang, it lauded Beijing for "fully protect[ing] the exercise of lawful rights of ethnic minority populations" including "normal religious activities and beliefs."[30] China's national development banks, such as the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China, have a growing global reach but lack critical human rights safeguards. The China-founded multilateral AIIB is not much better. Its policies call for transparency and accountability in the projects it finances and include social and environmental standards, but do not require the bank to identify and address human rights risks.[31] Among the bank's 74 members are many governments that claim to respect rights: much of the European Union including France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden, along with and the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.Beijing's censorship inside China is well documented, and its efforts to disseminate propaganda through state media worldwide are well known. But Chinese authorities no longer appear content with these efforts and are expanding their ambitions. Under Xi Jinping's leadership, Chinese authorities increasingly seek to limit or silence discussions about China that are perceived to be critical, and to ensure that their views and analyses are accepted by various constituencies around the world, even when that entails censoring through global platforms.Chinese authorities have long monitored and conducted surveillance on students and academics from China and those studying China on campuses around the world. Chinese diplomats have also complained to university officials about hosting speakers such as the Dalai Lama whom the Chinese government considers "sensitive." Over the past decade, as a result of decreasing state funding to higher education in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, universities are increasingly financially dependent on the large number of fee-paying students from China, and on Chinese government and corporate entities. This has made universities susceptible to Chinese government influence.The net result? In 2019, a series of rigorous reports documented censorship of and self-censorship by some administrators and academics who did not want to irk Chinese authorities.[32] Students from China have reported threats to their families in China in response to what those students had said in the classroom.Scholars from China detailed being directly threatened outside the country by Chinese officials to refrain from criticizing the Chinese government in classroom lectures or other talks.Others described students from China remaining silent in their classrooms, fearful that their speech was being monitored and reported to Chinese authorities by other students from China. One student from China at a university in the United States summed up his concerns about classroom surveillance, noting: "This isn't a free space." Drew Pavlou, a student at the University of Queensland who has been critical of the school's ties to the Chinese government, is facing suspension on the grounds that his activism breached the university's code of conduct.[33]Some universities in the United States are now under pressure from federal authorities to disclose any ties between the schools or individual scholars and Chinese government agencies, with the stated objective of countering People's Republic of China influence efforts and harassment as well as the theft of technology. Universities and scholars in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States have been embarrassed by revelations over their ties to Chinese technology firms or government agencies implicated in human rights abuses. In April 2020 the Massachusetts Institute of Technology broke off a relationship with Chinese voice recognition firm iFlytek whose complicity in human rights violations Human Rights Watch documented after adopting tighter guidelines on partnerships.[34]Other schools have grappled with tensions between students who are critical of the Chinese government and those who defend it. Students from the mainland tried to shout down speakers at a March 2019 event at the University of California at Berkeley who were addressing the human rights crisis in Xinjiang, or in September when unidentified individuals threatened the Hong Kong democracy activist Nathan Law as he arrived for graduate studies at Yale.[35]But few if any universities have taken steps to guarantee students and scholars from China the same access to academic freedom as others.[36] The failure to address these problems means that for some debates and research about China are arbitrarily curtailed.Surveillance and harassment of diaspora communities by Chinese authorities is also not a new problem, but it is clear that securing a foreign passport does not guarantee the right to freedom of expression. Even leaving China has become more difficult: Beijing has worked hard in recent years to prevent certain communities from leaving the country through tactics such as denying or confiscating their passports, tightening border security to prevent Tibetans and Turkic Muslims from fleeing, and pressuring other governments from Cambodia to Turkey to forcibly return asylum seekers in violation of their obligations under international law.[37]Since early 2017, some Uyghurs who have traveled outside China and returned, or simply remained in contact with family and friends outside the country, have found that Chinese authorities deem that conduct criminal.[38]As a result, even individuals who have managed to leave China and obtain citizenship in rights- respecting democracies report that they are cut off from family members still inside China, are monitored and harassed by Chinese government officials, and are reluctant to criticize Chinese policies or authorities for fear of reprisals. Some feel they cannot attend public gatherings, such as talks on Chinese politics or Congressional hearings, for fear of being photographed or otherwise having their presence at those events noted. Others describe being called or receiving WhatsApp or text messages from authorities inside China telling them that if they publicly criticize the Chinese government their family members inside China will suffer.One Uyghur who had obtained citizenship in Europe said: "It doesn't matter where I am, or what passport I hold. [Chinese authorities] will terrorize me anywhere, and I have no way to fight that." Even Han Chinese immigrants to countries like Canada described deep fear of the Chinese government, saying that while they are outraged by the human rights abuses in China, they worry that if they criticize the government openly, their job prospects, business opportunities, and chances of going back to China would be affected or that their family members who remain in China would be in danger.[39]Governments have relatively weak means to push back against this kind of harassment, given that it originates largely in China. In 2018, the Federal Bureau of Investigation stepped up its outreach to Uyghurs in the United States who had been targets of Chinese government harassment, and the Uyghur Human Rights Act, adopted in June 2020, expands that work across various diaspora communities from China.[40]Chinese authorities also seek to limit freedom of expression beyond China's borders by censoring conversations on global platforms. In June, Zoom, a California-based company, admitted that it had at the request of Chinese authorities suspended the accounts of U.S.-based activists who had organized online discussions about the 1989 Tiananmen massacre.[41] While the company reinstated the accounts of people based in the United States, it said it could not refuse Chinese authorities' demands that it obey "local law."Other global platforms have also enabled censorship. WeChat, a Chinese social media platform with about one billion users worldwide, 100 million of them outside China, is owned by the Chinese company Tencent.[42] The Chinese government and Tencent regularly censor content on the platform, skewing what viewers can see. Posts with the words "Liu Xiaobo" or "Tiananmen massacre" cannot be uploaded, and criticisms of the Chinese government are swiftly removed even if those trying to post such messages are outside the country. WeChat is wildly popular for its easy functionality, but it is also a highly effective way for Chinese authorities to control what its users worldwide can see.It also affects what politicians outside China can say to their own constituents. Politicians around the world increasingly use WeChat to communicate with Chinese speakers in their electorates. In September 2017, Jenny Kwan, a member of the Canadian parliament, made a statement regarding the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong in which she praised the young protesters who "stood up and fought for what they believe in, and for the betterment of their society"; that statement was subsequently posted on her WeChat account only to be deleted.[43]It is unclear whether or how politicians in democracies are tracking Beijing's efforts to censor their speech. As China plays an ever-more prominent role in global affairs, governments need to move swiftly to ensure that elected representatives' ability to communicate with their constituents is not subject to Beijing's whims.One can no longer pretend that China's suppression of independent voices stops at its borders.Finally, Beijing also leverages access to its market to censor companies ranging from Marriott to Mercedes Benz.[44] Chinese state television, CCTV, and Tencent, a media partner of the National Basketball Association with a five-year streaming deal worth $1.5 billion, said they would not broadcast Houston Rockets games after the team's general manager tweeted in support of Hong Kong's pro-democracy protesters.[45] Under pressure from Beijing, major international companies have censored themselves or staff members. Others have fired employees who have expressed views the companies perceive as critical of Beijing. It is bad enough for companies to abide by censorship restrictions when operating inside China. It is much worse to impose that censorship on their employees and customers around the world. One can no longer pretend that China's suppression of independent voices stops at its borders.AND WHAT TO DOThe consequences for failing to stop China's assault on the international human rights system, and on law and practice around rights-respecting development and on the freedom of expression are simple and stark. If these trends continue unabated, the U.N. Security Council will become even less likely to take action on grave human rights crises; the fundamental underpinnings of a universal human rights system with room for independent actors will further erode; and Chinese authorities' (and their allies') impunity will only grow.Serious rights-violating governments will know they can rely on Beijing for investment and loans with no conditions. People around the world will increasingly have to be careful whether they criticize Chinese authorities, even if they are citizens of rights-respecting democracies or in environments like academia, where debate is meant to be encouraged.Chinese government conduct over the first half of 2020 its stalling into an independent investigations into the COVID-19 pandemic, its blatant rejection of international law in deciding to impose national security legislation on Hong Kong, even its manipulation of Tiananmen commemorations for people in the United States appears to have galvanized momentum to push back. Members of parliaments from numerous countries are calling for the appointment of a U.N. special envoy on Hong Kong, governments are pressuring Beijing over a COVID-19 cover up, and companies' capitulation to Chinese pressure to censor are regular news items.But this is far from creating the kind of counterweight necessary to curb Beijing's agenda, whose threat can now be seen clearly. To protect the U.N. human rights system from Chinese government erosions, rights-respecting governments should urgently form a multi-year coalition not only to ensure that they are tracking these threats, but also to prepare themselves to respond to them at every opportunity to push back. This means nominating candidates for U.N. expert positions and calling out obstructions in the accreditation system.This means canvassing and organizing objections to norm-eroding resolutions, and mobilizing allies to put themselves forward as candidates for the HRC or other selections made by regional blocs. China has the advantages of deep pockets and no periodic changes in government to encumber its ability to plan; democracies will struggle with both. But here the stakes could not be higher not just for the 1.4 billion people in China, but for people around the world.Governments, especially those that have joined the AIIB, should use their joint leverage to push the institution to adopt well-established human rights and environmental principles and practices to ensure abuse-free development. And governments entering into BRI partnerships should carefully consider the consequences and ensure that they do what China will not: provide adequate public consultation, and full transparency about the financial implications for the country, and the ability of affected populations to reject these development projects.Governments should urgently consider Beijing's threats to the freedom of expression in their own countries. They should track threats to citizens, and pursue accountability to the fullest extent through tools like targeted sanctions. Academic institutions should not content themselves merely with better disclosure policies about interactions with Chinese government actors, they need urgently to ensure that everyone on their campuses has equal access to freedom of expression any less is a gross rejection of their responsibilities.Companies have a role to play in rejecting censorship. They should recognize that they cannot win playing Beijing's game, especially given their responsibility to respect human rights under the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. They should draft and promote codes of conduct for dealing with China that prohibit participation in or facilitation of infringements of the right to free expression, information, privacy, association, or other internationally recognized human rights. Strong common standards would make it more difficult for Beijing to ostracize those who stand up for basic rights and freedoms. Consumers and shareholders would also be better placed to insist that the companies not succumb to censorship as the price of doing business in China, and that they should never benefit from or contribute to abuses.Finally, it is critical that none of these efforts to limit the Chinese government's threats to human rights rebound on people across China or of Chinese descent around the world. The rapid spread of COVID-19 triggered a wave of racist anti-Asian harassment and assaults, and an alarming number of governments, politicians, and policies are falling into Beijing's trap of conflating the Chinese government, the Chinese Communist Party, and people from China.[46] They are not the same, and the human rights of people in China should remain at the core of future policies."UN Treaty Body Database: China," United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner, https:// tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/15/TreatyBodyExternal/Treaty.aspx?CountryID=36andLang=EN.Kenneth Roth, "China's global threat to human rights," (Washington, DC: Human Rights Watch, 2020), https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2020/country-chapters/global."The Costs of International Advocacy: China's Interference in United Nations Human Rights Mechanisms," (New York: Human Rights Watch, September 5, 2017), https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/09/05/costs- international-advocacy/chinas-interference-united-nations-human-rights;

Congressional Research Service Report: 'Intellectual Property Violations & China - Legal Remedies'Targeted News ServiceSeptember 18, 2020 Friday 8:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 7056 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Congressional Research Service issued the following report (No. R46532) entitled "Intellectual Property Violations and China: Legal Remedies". Here are excerpts of the report issued on Sept. 17 and co-authored by Kevin J. Hickey, coordinator and legislative attorney, Nina M. Hart, Brandon J. Murrill and Kevin T. Richards, legislative attorneys:Concerns that the government of the People's Republic of China (China) fails to protect and enforce intellectual property (IP) rights, and thus harms U.S. IP rights holders, have been one of the key issues in U.S.-China relations for decades. These concerns extend both to actions of China's government itself and state-affiliated entities, as well as to actions of Chinese persons and entities not affiliated with the Chinese government. The primary issues raised by the U.S. government and U.S. businesses have evolved over time, from an earlier focus on the adequacy of Chinese domestic IP protection and enforcement (e.g., to counter piracy and counterfeiting), to more recent concerns about cyber intrusions and strategic acquisitions.During the Trump Administration, the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) investigated China's actions with respect to IP and concluded that a number of Chinese policies and practices violated Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. In response, the United States initiated a World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute against China and imposed tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese imports. China responded by imposing tariffs on U.S. goods and challenging the U.S. tariffs at the WTO. In January 2020, the United States and China reached a deal known as the "Phase One Agreement" that addressed some of the trade and IP issues between the parties. However, major issues--such as coerced technology transfer--were not resolved by the Phase One Agreement. Although the parties anticipated further negotiations, the onset of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has increased tensions between the nations and stalled progress toward a Phase Two Agreement.Violations of IP rights by Chinese persons and entities are not a monolithic phenomenon, and general terms like "IP theft" often obscure important distinctions that affect the legal options available to address IP violations. One such distinction is the type of IP at issue. Different varieties of IP--such as patents, copyrights, trademarks, or trade secrets--protect different types of intellectual creation, involve different procedures for obtaining rights, and grant the IP owner distinct rights that vary in scope and duration. A second important distinction is the type of IP violation at issue--that is, the particular policy, practice, or action that is alleged to undermine U.S. IP rights. Possible violations include a failure to provide adequate legal protection for IP, a failure to enforce existing IP laws, trade secret misappropriation (including via cyber intrusion), discriminatory IP licensing laws, coerced technology transfer as a condition of regulatory approval or market access, or bad-faith assertion of IP rights. The legal remedies available will depend on the type of violation, the type of IP, and where the violation occurred.Existing U.S. legal remedies for IP violations can be grouped into two broad categories. First, there are remedies for systemic violations, which are usually initiated by the executive branch to address widespread trade or IP violations by foreign actors.The executive branch possesses a number of constitutional and statutory authorities to protect IP rights. These include enforcement provisions in international agreements and authority to negotiate such agreements. U.S. law also contains several statutory provisions that allow the executive branch to investigate IP violations that affect international trade and then impose different types of remedies, including import and export controls, suspension of trade benefits, imposition of tariffs, and regulation or prohibition of certain transactions.Second, there are legal remedies for individual violations--that is, discrete IP violations by a particular person or entity.Several legal doctrines limit domestic legal remedies for violations involving foreign actors or activity, however. First, under the presumption against extraterritoriality, U.S. law generally does not reach activity that occurred outside of the United States unless a statute clearly indicates otherwise. Second, under the requirement of personal jurisdiction, U.S. courts may only adjudicate disputes involving a defendant who has a sufficient connection with the forum or who has submitted to the court's power in some way. Presuming that U.S. law applies and any jurisdictional barriers can be overcome, possible remedies for individual violations include civil actions for infringement; import controls by the International Trade Commission and U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency; and criminal prosecutions for economic espionage, computer hacking, and, in some circumstances, IP infringement.Moving forward, Congress may consider whether these existing legal options are sufficient to deter or remedy continued practices or future IP violations by Chinese entities.* * *Contents:Intellectual Property Violations and China ... 5* Types of Intellectual Property ... 6- Basis and Rationales for IP Rights ... 6- Patents ... 7- Copyrights ... 8- Trademarks ... 9- Trade Secrets ... 11- Overlap and Interactions Among Different Forms of IP ... 12* Forms of "IP Theft ... 15- Under-Protection ... 15- Infringement and Under-Enforcement ... 17- Trade Secret Misappropriation and Cyber Intrusions ... 19- Coercive Technology Transfer ... 20- Discriminatory Restrictions on Contractual IP Licensing ... 21- Bad-Faith Assertion/Registration ... 22* State Sponsorship and IP Violations ... 23Existing Legal Remedies ... 24* Systemic Violations: Foreign Affairs and Trade Remedies ... 24- TRIPS and WTO Disputes ... 25- Diplomacy and International Agreements ... 27- Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 ... 28- Export Controls ... 31- Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 ... 32- Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 ... 34- The International Emergency Economic Powers Act ... 35* Individual Violations: Civil, Criminal, and Administrative Remedies ... 37- Remedial Issues: Jurisdiction and Territoriality ... 37- Civil Actions ... 41- Import Controls ... 47- Criminal Prosecutions ... 50Conclusion ... 54Tables:Table 1.

In the 1990s, before China's 2001 accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), China's failure to provide basic levels of legal protection for some forms of IP was a central concern./5During China's WTO accession process, its use of regulatory structures to coerce technology transfers from U.S. businesses to Chinese entities as a condition of doing business in China was another concern./6In the early 2000s, China's failure to adequately enforce its IP laws received significant attention, leading to a 2007 WTO dispute between the United States and China./7Unauthorized cyber intrusions and trade secret misappropriation were--and remain--an area of concern./8In recent years, the United States has increasingly focused on coercive technology transfers, strategic acquisitions, and cyber intrusions. On August 18, 2017, the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) initiated an investigation under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 (Section 301) into "whether acts, policies, and practices of the Government of China related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation" were unreasonable or discriminatory, and burdened or restricted U.S. commerce./9On March 22, 2018, the USTR concluded its investigation, finding that four Chinese policies and practices violated Section 301: (1) use of foreign ownership restrictions and administrative licensing requirements to pressure technology transfer from U.S. companies to Chinese entities; (2) IP licensing restrictions that discriminate against foreign entities; (3) systematic investment in or acquisition of U.S. companies to acquire targeted technologies; and (4) unauthorized cyber intrusions into U.S. networks to obtain IP and other confidential business information./10In light of the USTR's conclusions, the President issued a memorandum directing the USTR to consider three responses: (1) increased tariffs on goods imported into the United States from China; (2) initiation of a WTO dispute settlement process with respect to China's discriminatory licensing practices; and (3) executive branch actions to address concerns about Chinese inbound investment and acquisition./11On March 26, 2018, the United States initiated a WTO dispute alleging that China's discriminatory licensing practices violate its WTO commitments./12Beginning in July 2018 and continuing through 2019, the United States imposed tariff increases on Chinese products worth over $200 billion in several stages./13China responded by issuing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods worth over $100 billion and filing a WTO dispute challenging the United States' actions./14On January 15, 2020, the United States and China signed a trade deal known as the "Phase One Agreement" intended to address issues relating to the Section 301 investigation and other trade concerns./15The Phase One Agreement touches on several areas in China-U.S. trade relations, including agriculture, financial services, macroeconomic policy, currency exchange rates, and trade purchases./16With respect to IP, China makes several commitments in the Phase One Agreement, agreeing to* increase enforcement against trade secret misappropriation by expanding the scope of persons who may be sued for trade secret theft, providing broader preliminary and criminal penalties, and addressing unauthorized disclosures of trade secrets by Chinese regulatory authorities;/17* strengthen patent protections for pharmaceuticals by creating a mechanism for the early resolution of pharmaceutical patent disputes, and providing for patent term extensions and adjustments based on regulatory delays in the grant of patents or marketing approval for pharmaceutical products;/ 18* improve procedures to counter copyright infringement online and counterfeiting on major e-commerce platforms;/19* take effective enforcement actions against counterfeit medicines and other counterfeit goods with health and safety risks;/20 and* provide for procedures to improve border enforcement actions against counterfeit goods, such as requirements that customs and judicial authorities generally destroy such goods./21The Phase One Agreement did not resolve technology transfer issues--one of the central focuses of the Section 301 investigation--leaving the matter for future negotiations./22The Phase One Agreement does contain general commitments by the parties not to "require or pressure" technology transfer, but it avoids details on implementing that commitment./23Observers have noted that many of the Phase One Agreement's IP provisions reflect changes or commitments that China had made before,/24 or are phrased at high levels of generality without specific timelines for implementation./25After the Phase One Agreement was reached, however, the United States and China agreed to attempt to deescalate their trade conflict. In February 2020, both sides agreed to delay imposition of the next round of proposed tariff increases: the United States agreed to reduce some tariffs it imposed in 2019, and China agreed to suspend some of its retaliatory tariffs./26Since the onset of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a number of events and issues have increased tensions between the nations. This has led to a delay of the planned six-month review of the Phase One Agreement/27 as well as an apparent halt to further negotiations of a Phase Two Agreement./28Observers are uncertain whether the Phase One Agreement will prove lasting and whether a further agreement will emerge./29In the meantime, the United States continues to raise concerns about IP theft by Chinese entities, including recent criminal allegations of Chinese state-sponsored hacking of COVID-19 vaccine research./30This report seeks to place these developments into a broader legal context by reviewing the various legal options available to address IP violations by Chinese entities. First, it describes various forms that "IP theft" by Chinese entities may take, depending on the form of IP at issue (e.g., patents, copyrights, trademarks, or trade secrets) and the nature of the violation. These distinctions are significant because the remedies available to the U.S. government and individual rights holders will depend on the nature and circumstances of the IP violations. Second, the report reviews the scope and requirements of the legal remedies available under U.S. and international laws. These remedies fall into two broad categories: (1) remedies for systemic IP violations, which are initiated by the U.S. executive branch to target widespread IP violations by foreign actors by relying on trade or international law; and (2) remedies for individual IP violations, which seek to redress discrete IP violations by particular entities by relying on domestic civil, administrative, and criminal processes.* * *Intellectual Property Violations and ChinaAlthough news reports and U.S. entities often accuse China of "stealing IP,"/31 this general usage conflates both different types of IP and different types of IP violations. For example, in several reports,/32 the USTR has found that Chinese corporations, individuals, and its government (collectively, Chinese entities), have, among other things,* used legal and regulatory requirements, such as foreign ownership restrictions and administrative approval processes, to require or pressure technology transfer from U.S. companies seeking to do business in China;/33* imposed discriminatory technology licensing restrictions that impair U.S. companies' ability to negotiate fair, market-based terms when they seek to license IP or transfer technology to Chinese companies;/34* conducted and supported unauthorized intrusions into U.S. computer networks to acquire valuable confidential business and technical information,/35 as well as misappropriating such confidential information through other means;/36* manufactured, marketed, and exported counterfeit trademarked goods;/37 and* permitted and facilitated online piracy of copyrighted music, television, movies, and other creative works./38IP violations by Chinese entities are thus not a monolithic phenomenon, and general terms like "IP theft" often obscure important legal distinctions. Different actions by Chinese entities implicate distinct IP or trade laws, which affects the various legal remedies that may be available.To better understand these distinctions, this section presents a taxonomy of IP violations along two dimensions: (1) the particular type of IP at issue, and (2) the type of violation--that is, what is meant by "theft." It also briefly notes a third distinction--the degree to which the IP violation is committed by the Chinese government or state-affiliated entities (or with their support), or instead by Chinese individuals or entities not affiliated with the Chinese government.Types of Intellectual PropertyIP law comprises a set of legal rights to exclude others from making, copying, misappropriating, selling, disclosing, or using certain intangible creations of the human mind./39There is no universally accepted definition of what qualifies as "intellectual property." Sometimes, IP is used as an umbrella term to refer, at least primarily, to three distinct forms of legal protection: patents, copyrights, and trademarks./40Other times, IP is used more broadly to include related areas of law, including trade secrets, rights of publicity, misappropriation, and moral rights, as well as narrower legal regimes protecting plant varieties, industrial design, circuit design, geographical indications, and the like./41Based on their primarily federal nature and commercial importance, this report focuses on four types of IP: patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. Each of these forms of IP protects a different type of intellectual creation, involves different procedures for obtaining rights, and grants the IP owner distinct rights that vary in scope and duration. After a brief discussion of the purposes and rationales for IP, this section overviews these four major forms of IP protection.Content omitted: https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46532* * *Existing Legal RemediesThe legal remedies available for IP violations by Chinese entities depend on many factors, including the nature of the violation, the type of IP at issue, where the violation occurred, the availability of personal jurisdiction over the accused, and whether the violation is part of a larger pattern of IP violations./220This section reviews some of the principal legal remedies available under current law. First, it reviews remedies to address systemic violations, which are usually initiated by the executive branch to address widespread IP violations by foreign actors. These remedies generally rely on the President's authority over foreign affairs or Congress's statutory delegation of its authority over trade to the executive branch. Second, this section reviews the civil, criminal, and administrative remedies available for individual IP violations--that is, discrete IP violations affecting a particular rights holder--such as infringement suits or import controls. This section does not address the policy considerations relevant to pursuing these various remedies./221Systemic Violations: Foreign Affairs and Trade RemediesThis section examines actions that the executive branch could initiate against China's alleged violations of U.S. IP rights under international trade agreements, through the use of its constitutional authority over foreign affairs, and under domestic international trade statutes. Although this section also examines remedies under some national security-related authorities,/222 it does not address potential remedies under U.S. sanctions laws./223TRIPS and WTO DisputesThe United States could consider challenging China's IP practices by bringing cases against China before a WTO dispute settlement panel. To initiate a WTO dispute, a complaining member requests consultations with the respondent member in an effort to settle the dispute./224If these consultations fail, the member initiating a dispute may request the establishment of a dispute settlement panel composed of trade experts to determine whether a country has violated WTO rules./225Prior to December 2019, if a WTO panel rendered an adverse decision against China, it would be expected to bring its practices in line with its WTO obligations, generally within a reasonable period of time, or face the possibility of paying compensation to the complaining member or being subject to countermeasures allowed under the rules./226Such countermeasures could include the United States imposing higher duties on imports of selected products from China./227As of December 11, 2019, the WTO's Appellate Body--the entity that considers appeals from dispute settlement panel decisions--lost its quorum of three members necessary to decide such appeals./228Accordingly, if a WTO member appeals a panel report, the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) (i.e., the committee composed of all WTO members that oversees the dispute settlement mechanism) can no longer adopt panel reports in line with the WTO's Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU)./229Unless WTO members agree to consider panel reports as final, the DSB can no longer oversee the losing member's implementation of a panel report or authorize the prevailing member to engage in trade retaliation if the losing member ignores the dispute panel's recommendations./230Thus, even if the United States obtained a favorable ruling against China from a dispute panel, there are doubts as to whether the ruling would be enforceable under WTO procedures.As an example, in March 2018, the United States initiated the WTO dispute process against China based on its laws and implementing measures for importing and exporting technology and for foreign JVs./231Specifically, the United States alleged that these Chinese laws and regulations were inconsistent with TRIPS's national treatment principle,/232 because they treated foreign IP rights holders less favorably than Chinese IP rights holders./233The United States also alleged that Chinese regulations permitting a Chinese JV partner to continue using licensed technology even after a contract's expiration violate TRIPS article 28.1 because they deny the foreign patentee the "exclusive" right to her invention./234In other words, these Chinese laws and regulations allegedly favor Chinese IP holders, while preventing U.S. IP rights holders from enforcing their valid IP rights. On June 14, 2019, at the request of the United States, the WTO panel handling the dispute suspended the proceedings./235The suspension remains in effect at the request of the United States and with China's consent, although the panel resumed work for several brief periods between June 14, 2019, and June 8, 2020. The most recent request for a suspension was filed in June 2020./236Under the DSU, a panel retains its authority so long as it has not been suspended for more than twelve months./237The United States and China appear to interpret this rule as permitting suspensions to extend beyond a year overall if the panel has resumed work, even briefly, during that period.WTO rules under the TRIPS Agreement are arguably inadequate for addressing China's IP violations because WTO members retain some flexibility with regard to implementation and enforcement. In addition, there can be difficulties in collecting sufficient evidence to support a WTO dispute. The executive branch's decision to impose tariffs under domestic law to address some of China's IP practices identified in the USTR's Section 301 Report may reflect this concern./238Content omitted: https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46532* * *ConclusionThere are numerous ways in which the Chinese government and other Chinese entities have allegedly misappropriated, infringed, undermined, failed to enforce, or otherwise violated IP rights. Both IP rights holders and U.S. authorities, depending on the nature of the violations, may pursue a variety of existing legal remedies. Moving forward, Congress may choose to consider whether these existing legal options are sufficient to deter or remedy continued practices or future IP violations.* * *Footnotes:1 See generally DANIEL C.K.

The coercive diplomacy of the Chinese Communist Party and its impact on the worldCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 21, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1869 wordsBodyA report released this month, prepared by the Australian Institute for Political Strategy (ASPI), details how the Chinese Communist Party (PCCh) is increasingly deploying coercive diplomacy against foreign governments and companies in order to punish conduct that displeases the Asian giant.So-called "coercive diplomacy" includes arbitrary arrests, restrictions on investment and trade, popular boycotts, and state-issued threats. He points out that countries and businesses are beginning to understand its harmful effects and to fight to jointly develop effective tools to counterattack and resist the asian giant's onslations.Beijing has intensified harassment around the world over the past decade further deepening it since 2018 when the United States declared trade war on it. By blocking websites, imposing sanctions and inciting public anger, the PCCh has managed to force the parties to apologize. The report finds that up to 82.7 percent of the harassed have apologized and that few of their respective governments have defended them.The report highlights the PCCh's use of coercive diplomacy over the past 10 years, recording 152 cases affecting 27 countries. The most affected regions and countries include Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand and East Asia.The CHC's coercive tactics may include economic measures such as trade sanctions, investment restrictions, bans on tourism and popular boycotts, and non-economic measures such as arbitrary detentions, restrictions on official travel, and state-issued threats. These efforts seek to punish unwanted behavior and focus on issues including securing territorial claims, deploying Huawei's 5G technology, suppressing minorities in Xinjiang, blocking reception of the Dalai Lama, and hiding the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.It highlights China's economic importance as the largest trading partner of nearly two-thirds of the world's countries, giving it significant global influence. There is a growing reliance on foreign governments and companies on the Chinese market that is likely to continue to rise.Chinese government seeks to deploy Huawei 5G technology (REUTERS/Tingshu Wang) (TINGSHU WANG/)The report mentions eight methods used by the Chinese government in its coercive diplomacy: arbitrary detention or execution, restrictions on official travel, investment restrictions, trade restrictions, restrictions on tourism, popular boycotts, pressure on specific companies, and state-issued threats.This research documents that of the 152 instances of coercive diplomacy over the past decade, 100 targeted foreign governments, while the other 52 cases targeted foreign companies. More than half of the cases have taken place in this pandemic year.Of the 27 affected countries, Australia was the most attacked, followed by Canada and the United States. Europe, New Zealand, and East Asia (South Korea, Japan, Taiwan) were also the subject of coercive diplomacy, while countries in Africa, South America, the Pacific Islands and the rest of Asia recorded fewer attacks. The likely reason for this is that China has spread its influence over the past decade in the developing world so it has had no reason to subdue theseCountries.The Philippines has been the exception while holding disputes with Beijing over the South China Sea. However, since President Rodrigo Duterte publicly announced a foreign policy change four years ago, combining ties with the communist country, no more cases of coercive diplomacy against this country have been re-recorded.In April of this year, the Netherlands infuriated the PCCh by changing the name of the country's diplomatic mission in Taiwan to "Netherlands Office in Taipei". In response, the state-run Global Times published an article citing 'Chinese cybernauts' calling for an export of medical supplies to the Netherlands to cease and cited an analyst who raised this measure as a means for the PCCh to send a warning to the Netherlands. This also served as a warning to other states about the PCCh's willingness to use coercive measures, even in critical areas such as health care and during a global pandemic.Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo in a 1995 interview (REUTERS/Will Burgess/file) (REUTERS/)The PCCh also enacted multiple coercive measures against Norway in 2010 in retaliation for the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo. After these measures were enacted, UN voting patterns showed a closer alignment between China and Norway, and the Norwegian government supported China's admission as an observer to the Arctic Council in 2013 and refused to meet with the Dalai Lama for the first time in 2014.Arbitrary arrestsAs for the method of arbitrary detention it was applied for both Canada and Australia. Just days after the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Canada under the U.S.-Canada extradition treaty, the PCCh arbitrarily arrested Canadian citizens Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.In Australia, the recent arrest of Australian journalist of Chinese origin, Cheng Lei, has highlighted the risk to foreigners of the so-called "hostage diplomacy" and Beijing's attitude towards citizens of dual Chinese descent. Cheng, who worked as a television presenter for Chinese state media, has been detained for more than a month and is accused of "criminal activity that jeopardizes China's national security," according to the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. His case joins that of dissident Chinese-Australian writer Yang Hengjun, who was charged with espionage in March after more than a year of being in custody, an accusation that sparked an official Australian protest. Yang's wife, a permanent resident of Australia, has been banned from leaving China.Chinese-Australian journalist Cheng Lei (Reuters TV/Screenshot)China does not allow dual citizenship so the Australian government warned its Chinese citizens that the Beijing authorities may refuse to recognize their new nationality and deny access to consular services by launching a prevention campaign for the many Chinese-Australians based in China.Several journalists from various countries have left China in the latter time so as not to risk being arrested and treatedarbitrarily so there are virtually no foreign correspondents today.Trade RestrictionsWith regard to trade restrictions, this report recorded 19 cases between 2010 and 2020, more than half of which occurred since 2018. In all registered cases, the PCCh never officially implemented official sanctions against the target state; instead, an unrelated official reason was provided, such as non-compliance with sanitation or labelling requirements, or no reason was provided. By providing an unrelated official reason for disguising coercive diplomatic measures, the PCCh may maintain plausible denial, offering some protection against countries that pose the problem through international channels, such as the World Trade Organization.The PCCh imposed restrictions on imports of Canadian meat in June 2019 in retaliation against the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou. However, the PCCh retracted these restrictions only 5 months later, even though tensions persisted on this issue, after the effects of a swine fever outbreak continued to raise domestic pork prices unsustainably.Huawei Executive Meng Wanzhou (REUTERS/Jennifer Gauthier/file) (JENNIFER GAUTHIER/)The PCCh's recent trade restrictions against Australian barley, which are widely interpreted as retaliation for Australia's drive research into the origins and management of the Covid-19 outbreak, further illustrate how these measures are often market-aligned or constrained by trends and conditions. While Australian barley accounts for up to 80% of China's barley imports in recent years, the communist government has established a plan of self-sufficiency and diversification of imports, so the restriction was useful to its new purposes in addition to having coincided with a significant decline in China's domestic barley demand. As Scott Waldron of the University of Queensland argued, it is significant that the PCCh has not imposed restrictions on wool, as China buys approximately 75% of Australia's wool exports. It would now aim to impose import restrictions on Australian wines that would greatly affect the Aussie country.Imports of Canadian canola were blocked in China, Canadian wheat exporters experienced an increase in wheat imports in the Asian country. Similarly, in August 2020, trade between China and Australia was 4% higher than the previous year, despite the limitations of covid-19.Tourist restrictionsRestrictions on tourism are the third most common form of coercive diplomacy used to attack foreign governments identified through this investigation. This report recorded 17 cases between 2010 and 2020, half of which occurred after 2018. China is the world's largest issuing tourism market. It accounts for more than 20% of world tourism, and 150 million Chinese tourists traveled abroad and spent a combined total of $277 billion in 2018. Subject to the long-term impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on large-scale tourism, these numbers are likely to continue to rise and the importance of the Chinese tourism market in the world continues to grow as it now accounts for only 10% of its population.Restrictions onCompaniesThe success of coercive measures against businesses is largely due to reliance on their sales relative to the world's second-largest economy, which is one of the largest sources of income. China's consumer spending surpassed that of the United States for the first time in 2019, so companies are unlikely to risk losing access to that market. In many cases, coercive diplomacy has caused the company to end up apologizing publicly for some action that has annoyed the communist government as Versace and others have done.Many foreign governments, including those in Australia, Canada, Japan, India, the United Kingdom and the United States, are beginning to criticize Chinese coercive diplomacy and begin developing a joint effective counter-action strategy.In August 2020, the Five Eyes intelligence alliance issued a joint statement demonstrating its grave concern about the disqualification of pro-democracy candidates in hong Kong Legislative Council elections and condemning the abolition of the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong citizens following the imposition of a new PCCh national security law. The joint statement came after the PCCh threatened countermeasures against the five member states for suspending extradition treaties and assisting Hong Kong citizens.The report concludes by offering some recommendations on how countries can jointly cope with China's pressure. These include raising global awareness of coercive diplomacy, generating a coordinated response, building a Five eyes economic security pact, developing protocols to help the business community cope, and underlining the risks of doing business with China.MORE ON THIS TOPIC:Like Kim Jong-un and with stolen Hollywood scenes: this is Xi Jinping's new military propagandaChina sent more military jets in defiance to TaiwanMike Pompeo: "The Vatican jeopardizes its moral authority if it renews the agreement with China"Load-Date: September 22, 2020End of Document

Senate Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Committee Issues Testimony From FBI Director WrayTargeted News ServiceSeptember 25, 2020 Friday 8:41 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4189 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee issued the following testimony by FBI Director Christopher A. Wray as part of a hybrid hearing entitled "Threats to the Homeland" on Sept. 24:Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the current threats to the United States Homeland. I am pleased to be here representing the nearly 37,000 dedicated men and women of the FBI.While the COVID-19 pandemic has presented unique and unprecedented challenges to the FBI workforce, I am proud of their dedication to our mission of protecting the American people and upholding the Constitution. Hostile foreign actors, violent extremists, and opportunistic criminal elements have seized upon this environment. As a result, we are facing aggressive and sophisticated threats on many fronts. Whether it is terrorism now moving at the speed of social media, or the increasingly blended threat of cyber intrusions and state-sponsored economic espionage, or malign foreign influence and interference or active shooters and other violent criminals threatening our communities, or the scourge of opioid trafficking and abuse, or hate crimes, human trafficking, crimes against children--the list of threats we are worried about is not getting any shorter, and none of the threats on that list are getting any easier.CounterterrorismPreventing terrorist attacks remains the FBI's top priority. However, the threat posed by terrorism--both international terrorism ("IT") and domestic violent extremism--has evolved significantly since 9/11.The greatest threat we face in the Homeland is that posed by lone actors radicalized online who look to attack soft targets with easily accessible weapons. We see this lone actor threat manifested both within Domestic Violent Extremists ("DVEs") and Homegrown Violent Extremists ("HVEs"), two distinct sets of individuals that generally self-radicalize and mobilize to violence on their own. DVEs are individuals who commit violent criminal acts in furtherance of ideological goals stemming from domestic influences, such as racial bias and anti-government sentiment. HVEs are individuals who have been radicalized primarily in the United States, and who are inspired by, but not receiving individualized direction from, Foreign TerroristOrganizations ("FTOs").Many of these violent extremists, both domestic and international, are motivated and inspired by a mix of ideological, socio-political, and personal grievances against their targets, which recently have more and more included large public gatherings, houses of worship, and retail locations. Lone actors, who by definition are not likely to conspire with others regarding their plans, are increasingly choosing these soft, familiar targets for their attacks, limiting law enforcement opportunities for detection and disruption ahead of their action.DVEs pose a steady and evolving threat of violence and economic harm to the United States. Trends may shift, but the underlying drivers for domestic violent extremism--such as perceptions of government or law enforcement overreach, socio-political conditions, racism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, misogyny, and reactions to legislative actions--remain constant. As stated above, the FBI is most concerned about lone offender attacks, primarily shootings, as they have served as the dominant lethal mode for domestic violent extremist attacks. More deaths were caused by DVEs than international terrorists in recent years. In fact, 2019 was the deadliest year for domestic extremist violence since the Oklahoma City Bombing in 1995.The top threat we face from domestic violent extremists stems from those we identify as Racially/EthnicallyMotivated Violent Extremists ("RMVE"). RMVEs were the primary source of ideologically-motivated lethal incidents and violence in 2018 and 2019 and have been considered the most lethal of all domestic extremists since 2001. Of note, the last three DVE attacks, however, were perpetrated by Anti-Government Violent Extremists.The spate of attacks we saw in 2019 underscore the continued threat posed by DVEs and perpetrators of hate crimes. The FBI works proactively to prevent acts of domestic terrorism and hate crimes. For example, in November 2019, the Denver Joint Terrorism Task Force arrested Richard Holzer on federal charges of attempting to obstruct religious exercise by force using explosives. This disruption is just one example of the strength of our Domestic Terrorism-Hate Crimes ("DT-HC") Fusion Cell. Our Counterterrorism ("CTD") and Criminal Divisions ("CID") working together were able to prevent a potential terrorist attack before it occurred and, for the first time in recent history, make a proactive arrest on a Hate Crimes charge. Through the DT- HC Fusion Cell, subject-matter experts from both CTD and CID work in tandem to innovatively use investigative tools and bring multiple perspectives to bear in combatting the intersecting threats of domestic terrorism and hate crimes, preventing attacks and providing justice to victims.We recognize that the FBI must be aware not just of the domestic violent extremism threat, but also of threats emanating from those responding violently to First Amendment- protected activities. In the past, we have seen some violent extremists respond to peaceful movements through violence rather than non-violent actions and ideas. The FBI is involved only when responses cross from ideas and Constitutionally-protected protests to violence.Regardless of the specific ideology involved, the FBI requires that all domestic terrorism Investigations be predicated based on activity intended to further a political or social goal, wholly or in part involving force, coercion, or violence, in violation of federal law.HVEs and FTOs have posed a persistent threat to the Nation and to U.S. interests abroad, while their tradecraft, tactics, and target sets have evolved. The international terrorism threat to the U.S. has expanded from sophisticated, externally-directed FTO plots to include individual attacks carried out by HVEs who are inspired by designated terrorist organizations. As stated above, the FBI assesses HVEs are the greatest, most immediate international terrorism threat to the Homeland. These individuals are FTO-inspired individuals who are in the U.S., have been radicalized primarily in the U.S., and are not receiving individualized direction from FTOs. We, along with our law enforcement partners, face significant challenges in identifying and disrupting HVEs. This is due, in part, to their lack of a direct connection with an FTO, an ability to rapidly mobilize without law enforcement detection, and their frequent use of encrypted communications.Many FTOs use various digital communication platforms to reach individuals they believe may be susceptible and sympathetic to violent terrorist messages. However, no group has been as successful at drawing people into its perverse ideology as ISIS, which has proven dangerously competent at employing such tools. ISIS uses traditional media platforms as well as widespread social media campaigns to propagate its ideology. Terrorists in ungoverned spaces--both physical and virtual--readily disseminate propaganda and training materials to attract easily influenced individuals around the world to their cause. With the broad distribution of social media, terrorists can spot, assess, recruit, and radicalize vulnerable persons of all ages in the U.S. either to travel to foreign lands or to conduct an attack on the Homeland. Through the Internet, terrorists anywhere overseas now have direct access to our local communities to target and recruit our citizens and spread their message faster than was imagined just a few years ago.We remain concerned that groups such as the Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham ("ISIS") and al-Qaeda intend to carry out large-scale attacks in the U.S. Despite their territorial defeat in Iraq and Syria, ISIS remains relentless and ruthless in its campaign of violence against theWest and has aggressively promoted its hateful message, attracting like- minded violent extremists. The message is not tailored solely to those who overtly express signs of radicalization. It is seen by many who use messaging apps and participate in social networks. Ultimately, many of the individuals drawn to ISIS seek a sense of belonging.Echoing other terrorist groups, ISIS has advocated lone offender attacks inWestern countries. Recent ISIS videos and propaganda have specifically advocated attacks against soldiers, law enforcement, and intelligence community personnel.As noted above, ISIS is not the only terrorist group of concern. Al-Qaeda maintains its desire for large-scale, spectacular attacks. While continued counterterrorism pressure has degraded the group's Afghanistan-Pakistan senior leadership, in the near term, al-Qaeda is more likely to focus on building its international affiliates and supporting small-scale, readily achievable attacks in key regions such as East and West Africa. Simultaneously, over the last year, propaganda from al-Qaeda leaders seeks to inspire individuals to conduct their own attacks in the U.S. and theWest. For example, the December 2019 attack at Naval Air Station Pensacola demonstrates that groups such as al-Qaeda continue to be interested in encouraging attacks on U.S. soil.The FBI regularly reviews intelligence to ensure that we are appropriately mitigating threats from any place by any actor, and the possible violent responses and actions. We are sensitive to First Amendment-protected activities during investigative and intelligence efforts so as to ensure that our investigative actions remain aligned with our authorities and are conducted with the appropriate protections in place for privacy and civil liberties.As the threat to the United States and U.S. interests evolves, we must adapt and confront these challenges, relying heavily on the strength of our federal, State, local, Tribal, and international partnerships. The FBI uses all lawful investigative techniques and methods to combat these terrorist threats to the United States. Along with our domestic and foreign partners, we are collecting and analyzing intelligence concerning the ongoing threat posed by violent extremists motivated by any ideology and desire to harm Americans and U.S. interests. We continue to encourage information sharing, which is evidenced through our partnerships with many federal, State, local, and Tribal agencies assigned to Joint Terrorism Task Forces around the country. Be assured, the FBI continues to strive to work and share information more efficiently, and to pursue a variety of lawful methods to help stay ahead of these threats.Election SecurityIn less than two months, Americans will exercise one of their most important and cherished freedoms; the right to vote in a democratic election. Our nation is confronting multi- faceted foreign threats seeking to both influence our national policies and public opinion, and cause harm to our national dialogue. The FBI and our interagency partners remain concerned about, and focused on, the covert and overt influence measures used by certain adversaries in their attempts to sway U.S. voters' preferences and perspectives, shift U.S. policies, increase discord in the United States, and undermine the American people's confidence in our democratic processes.Foreign influence operations--which include covert, coercive, or corrupt actions by foreign governments to influence U.S. political sentiment or public discourse or interfere in our processes themselves--are not a new problem. But the interconnectedness of the modern world, combined with the anonymity of the Internet, have changed the nature of the threat and how the FBI and its partners must address it. This year's election cycle, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, provides ample opportunity for hostile foreign actors to conduct disinformation campaigns and foreign influence operations in an effort to mislead, sow discord, and, ultimately, undermine confidence in our democratic institutions and values and in our government's response to our current health crisis.Foreign influence operations have taken many forms and used many tactics over the years. Most widely reported these days are attempts by adversaries--hoping to reach a wide swath of Americans covertly from outside the United States--to use false personas and fabricated stories on social media platforms to discredit U.S. individuals and institutions.The FBI is the lead federal agency responsible for investigating foreign influence operations. In the fall of 2017, the Foreign Influence Task Force ("FITF") was established to identify and counteract malign foreign influence operations targeting the United States. The FITF is led by the Counterintelligence Division and is composed of agents, analysts, and professional staff from the Counterintelligence, Cyber, Counterterrorism, and Criminal Investigative Divisions. It is specifically charged with identifying and combating foreign influence operations targeting democratic institutions and values inside the United States. In all instances, the FITF strives to protect democratic institutions and public confidence; develop a common operating picture; raise adversaries' costs; and, reduce their overall asymmetric advantage.The task force brings the FBI's national security and traditional criminal investigative expertise under one umbrella to prevent foreign influence in our elections. This better enables us to frame the threat, to identify connections across programs, to aggressively investigate as appropriate, and--importantly--to be more agile. Coordinating closely with our partners and leveraging relationships we have developed in the technology sector, we had a number of instances where we were able to quickly relay threat indicators that those companies used to take swift action, blocking budding abuse of their platforms.Following the 2018 midterm elections, we reviewed the threat and the effectiveness of our coordination and outreach. As a result of this review, we further expanded the scope of the FITF. Previously, our efforts to combat malign foreign influence focused solely on the threat posed by Russia. Utilizing lessons learned over the last year and half, the FITF is widening its aperture to confront malign foreign operations of China, Iran, and other global adversaries. To address this expanding focus and wider set of adversaries and influence efforts, we have also added resources to maintain permanent "surge" capability on election and foreign influence threats.We have also further refined our approach. All efforts are based on a three-pronged approach, which includes investigations and operations; information and intelligence sharing; and a strong partnership with the private sector. Through the efforts of the FITF, and lessons learned from both the 2016 and 2018 elections, the FBI is actively engaged in identifying, detecting, and disrupting threats to our elections and ensuring both the integrity of our democracy is preserved and the will of the American people is fulfilled.Protecting policymakers is an important part of our efforts to combat malign foreign influence and protect our elections. As you are aware, the FBI and our interagency partners have been providing ongoing election security threat briefings to Congress. We will continue to do so throughout the fall and into the future, where there is actionable intelligence.Lawful AccessI want to turn now to an issue continuing to limit law enforcement's ability to disrupt these increasingly insular actors. We are all familiar with the inability of law enforcement agencies to access data, even with a lawful warrant or court order, due to "end-to-end" encryption. Increasingly, device manufacturers and communications service providers have employed encryption in such a manner that only the users or parties to the communications can access the content of the communications or devices. This is known as "end-to-end" encryption.This development has meant that, in recent years, the FBI has observed a decline in its ability to gain access to the content of both domestic and international terrorist communications, due to the widespread adoption of encryption for Internet traffic and the prevalence of mobile messaging apps using end-to-end encryption as default.The FBI certainly recognizes how encryption increases the overall safety and security of the Internet for users. But, in fulfilling the FBI's duty to the American people to prevent acts of terrorism, this kind of end-to-end encryption creates serious challenges. Accessing content of communications by, or data held by, known or suspected terrorists pursuant to judicially authorized, warranted legal process is getting more and more difficult.The online, encrypted nature of radicalization, along with the insular nature of most of today's attack plotters, leaves investigators with fewer dots to connect. As was evident in the December 9, 2019, shooting at Naval Air Station Pensacola that killed three U.S. sailors and severely wounded eight other Americans, deceased terrorist Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani was able to communicate using warrant-proof, end-to-end encrypted apps deliberately to evade detection by law enforcement. It took the FBI several months to access information in his phones, during which time we did not know whether he was a lone wolf actor, or whether his associates may have been plotting additional terrorist attacks.If law enforcement loses the ability to detect criminal activity because communication between subjects--data in motion--or data held by subjects--data at rest--is encrypted in such a way making content inaccessible, even with a lawful order, our ability to protect the American people will be degraded. Providers and law enforcement must continue to collaborate to explore possible technical solutions that would provide security and privacy to those using the Internet while also contributing to the FBI's ability to complete its mission.Despite the successes that result from the hard work of the men and women of the FBI, our Joint Terrorism Task Forces, and our partners across the government, terrorism continues to pose a persistent threat to the Homeland and our interests overseas.China ThreatThe greatest long-term threat to our nation's information and intellectual property, and to our economic vitality, is the counterintelligence and economic espionage threat from China. It is a threat to our economic security and by extension, to our national security.As you have seen from the recent closure of the Chinese Consulate in Houston, this issue is not just an intelligence issue, or a government problem, or a nuisance largely just for big corporations who can take care of themselves. Our adversaries' targets are our nation's core economic assets--our information and ideas, our innovation, our research and development, our technology. No country poses a broader, more severe threat to those assets than China. It is the people of the United States who are the victims of what amounts to Chinese theft on a scale so massive that it represents one of the largest transfers of wealth in human history. If you are an American adult, it is more likely than not that China has stolen your personal data.In 2017, the Chinese military conspired to hack Equifax and made off with the sensitive personal information of 150 million Americans--we are talking nearly half of the American population and most American adults. Our data is not the only thing at stake here--so is our health, livelihood, and security.The FBI is opening a new China-related counterintelligence case approximately every ten hours. Of the nearly 5,000 active FBI counterintelligence cases currently underway across the country, almost half are related to China. And at this very moment, China is working to compromise American health care organizations, pharmaceutical companies, and academic institutions conducting essential COVID-19 research. They are going after cost and pricing information, internal strategy documents, personally identifiable information--anything that can give them a competitive advantage.It is important to be clear: this is not about the Chinese people as a whole, and certainly not about Chinese-Americans as a group, but it is about the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party. Every year, the United States welcomes more than 100,000 Chinese students and researchers into this country. For generations, people have journeyed from China to the United States to secure the blessings of liberty for themselves and their families--and our society is better for their contributions. So, when the FBI's refers to the threat from China, we mean the Government of China and the Chinese Communist Party.Confronting this threat effectively does not mean that we should not do business with the Chinese. It does not mean that we should not host Chinese visitors. It does not mean that we should not welcome Chinese students or coexist with China on the world stage. But it does mean that when China violates our criminal laws and international norms, we are not going to tolerate it, much less enable it. The FBI and our partners throughout the U.S. government will hold China accountable and protect our nation's innovation, ideas, and way of life--with the help and vigilance of the American people.CyberWith the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, the nature of the cyber threat has become increasingly concerning. As more individuals telework and increasingly use the cloud, we encounter less secure networks. As a result, the scope of our cyber threats has changed, the impact has deepened, and many of the players have become more dangerous as we have become increasingly vulnerable. We are still seeing hack after hack and breach after breach. We hear about it daily in the news. The more we shift to the Internet as the conduit and the repository for everything we use and share and manage, the more danger we are in.Today we are worried about a wider-than-ever range of threat actors, from multi-national cyber syndicates to nation-state adversaries. And we are concerned about a wider-than-ever gamut of methods continually employed in new ways, like the targeting of managed service providers--MSPs--as a way to access scores of victims by hacking just one provider.China's Ministry of State Security ("MSS") pioneered that technique and, as you saw in July, we indicted two Chinese hackers who worked with the Guangdong State Security Department of theMSS. These individuals conducted a hacking campaign lasting more than ten years, targeting countries with high technology industries, to include the United States. The industries targeted included, among others, solar energy; pharmaceuticals; and defense.Cybercrimes like these, directed by the Chinese government's intelligence services, threaten not only the United States but also every other country that supports fair play, international norms, and the rule of law, and they also seriously undermine China's desire to become a respected leader in world affairs.Theft of intellectual property is not the only cyber threat presented by the People's Republic of China ("PRC") government. They are also working to obtain controlled defense technology and developing the ability to use cyber means to complement any future real-world conflict. All of them, and others, are working to simultaneously strengthen themselves, and weaken the United States. And we are taking all these nation-state threats very seriously.But as dangerous as nation-states are, we do not have the luxury of focusing on them alone. We also are battling the increasing sophistication of criminal groups that place many hackers on a level we used to see only among hackers working for governments. The proliferation of malware as a service, where darkweb vendors sell sophistication in exchange for cryptocurrency, increases the difficulty of stopping what would once have been less-dangerous offenders. It can give a ring of unsophisticated criminals the tools to paralyze entire hospitals, police departments, and businesses with ransomware. Often the hackers themselves have not become much more sophisticated--but they are renting sophisticated capabilities, requiring us to up our game as we work to defeat them, too.Hackers have not relented under the COVID-19 pandemic. On the contrary, they have attempted to compromise the computer systems of hospitals and medical centers to obtain patient financial data, medical records, and other information. In addition, such attacks on medical centers may lead to the interruption of computer networks and systems putting patients' lives at an increased risk when America faces its most dire health crisis in generations.ConclusionChairman Johnson, RankingMember Peters and Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I am now happy to answer any questions you might have.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7246551 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: September 25, 2020End of Document

U.S.-China Business Council Issues Public Comment on Office of Trade Representative NoticeTargeted News ServiceSeptember 22, 2020 Tuesday 2:46 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 5313 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON, Sept. 22 -- The U.S.-China Business Council has issued a public comment on the Office of U.S. Trade Representative notice entitled "China's Compliance With World Trade Organization Commitments". The comment was written on Sept. 15, 2020, and posted on Sept. 21, 2020:* * *The global economy has changed significantly in the 19 years since China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO). As part of its accession agreement, China lowered its overall tariff rate, dropping its applied import tariffs from a weighted average of 14.7 percent in 2000 to 4.8 percent in 2017. However, due to bilateral trade tensions, China has selectively raised the weighted average tariff rate on US goods to 20.3 percent, up from 8 percent in 2018. China agreed to open some, though not all, of its economy to foreign participation--these commitments have largely been implemented. The accession agreement also changed the way most American companies were able to do business in China, such as by allowing companies to distribute and service their own products in the market.As the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) has noted in previous annual reports, while China has fulfilled most of the specific obligations of its accession agreement, several commitments fall short of full implementation. The "positive list" approach used in the accession agreement only opened listed sectors. It also meant that new areas of the economy not envisioned at the time of the accession negotiations were not covered by the agreement, including cloud computing, electronic commerce, and other technology services. And while some additional sectors have been opened to foreign participation in the decade since the "roadmap" of obligations expired, the sectors that remain closed are ones that would benefit from liberalization, from both the perspective of foreign companies seeking market access and from those hoping to strengthen the competitiveness of the Chinese economy as a whole.There is a logical question that should be considered in the assessment of China's WTO implementation: is the world economy, and in particular, the US economy, better off since China's entry into the WTO 18 years ago? There are several developments to consider.In 2000, the year before China's accession, China's gross domestic product (GDP) was approximately $1.2 trillion, ranking as the fifth-largest economy in the world. China's GDP was roughly $14.14 trillion in 2019, making it second only to the United States' economy which grew to $21.43 trillion. The United States remained the largest economy in the world throughout this time, even when taking into account the global recession in 2009.China also lifted more than 800 million people out of poverty as a result of its market reforms. Its middle class is now larger than the entire population of the United States and still growing, making it a major driver of global demand for goods and services. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, in 2000, US exports of goods and services to China were only $21.9 billion and US company sales in China were roughly $18.5 billion. The United States now exports approximately $164.5 billion of goods and services to China, placing it just behind Canada and Mexico as the United States' third-largest market. Likewise, as of 2018, the last year of available data, US company sales in China have grown to $392.7 billion, over 20 times the value in 2000.The bilateral goods trade deficit has also grown from $83 billion prior to WTO accession to a peak of $418 billion in 2018. However, focusing solely on the bilateral trade balance misses an important change in the pattern of trade. After China entered the WTO, suppliers from Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and other economies moved their export manufacturing to China, shifting the United States' long-standing bilateral trade deficits with those economies to China.China's proportion of the US global trade deficit has increased, while the rest of East Asia's proportion has decreased. Now China simply accounts for a larger piece of the region's overall share. Last year, the goods trade deficit with China fell to $344 billion, though it was accompanied by the loss of an estimated 300,000 American jobs, an 18 percent reduction in US goods exports to China, and a dampening of US investment as US-China tariff escalation intensified.China's accession also made it subject to the WTO's dispute settlement process, intended to act as a de-politicized mechanism for resolving trade disputes. The United States has a positive track record in cases involving China--as of September 2020, of the 20 completed cases the United States has filed against China, 11 cases were won by the United States and nine were settled before a ruling was made. None were lost. The US blockage of appellate judge appointees currently threatens the effectiveness of this dispute resolution mechanism that has historically served the United States well with respect to China.On balance, China's WTO entry has been positive for the United States and the world. Notably, China has taken some steps to further open its markets in the last couple of years, particularly in financial services and agriculture, and has strengthened protections for intellectual property rights, improved the approval process for foreign investments, and worked in other areas to address concerns raised by the US government and industry. The US-China Phase One trade agreement played a helpful role in pushing many of these changes forward.At the same time, however, numerous Chinese policies implemented since its WTO accession appear to have been put in place purely to protect or promote domestic industry at the expense of foreign companies.Implementation of the "Letter" of Existing WTO CommitmentsUSCBC noted in its 2002 submission for the first Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC) hearing on China's compliance with its WTO commitments that:"WTO-relevant issues involving entrenched PRC bureaucratic and domestic commercial interests will likely require particular vigilance by the US government and the American private sector, in the interest of effective encouragement of China to reach the fullest possible realization of [its] WTO commitments."That vigilance is still needed. While China has implemented most of its sector-specific accession commitments, it has fallen short in implementing or adhering to some of the broader WTO principles. In particular, national treatment remains challenging, as does consistent protection of intellectual property rights (IPR). These challenges are reflected in US companies' experiences with China's procurement policies and pressures to transfer technology.National TreatmentThe WTO's requirement that member countries treat domestic and foreign companies on an equal basis, also known as national treatment, is an essential principle for all companies doing business globally. However, USCBC's annual member survey showed again in 2020 that American companies continue to experience problems with discriminatory treatment, primarily in the form of regulatory challenges and preferential treatment for domestic companies.Regulatory and competition challenges are not new for US companies, but they still have a real effect on companies' ability to do business and are among the issues that companies perennially cite as primary restraints on their profitability in China.China's policymakers should move toward eliminating terminology in laws and regulations that distinguishes between domestic and foreign-owned companies, such as the term "foreign-invested enterprises." Continued use of this term invites discriminatory treatment of various types of domestic legal entities based solely on ownership. A better approach would be to treat all companies legally established under China's Company Law equally, regardless of ownership or nationality. China's nationwide negative list makes progress toward this end by increasing transparency on all market access requirements--it applies to both domestic and foreign investors.Many Chinese companies thrive because they produce competitive, high-quality goods and services. However, several Chinese policies and practices continue to provide advantages to both state-owned and private domestic companies over foreign ones, an issue that 46 percent of the respondents to USCBC's 2020 member survey say affects their companies. This includes direct benefits and support from various levels of the government, as well as favorable licensing decisions, restrictions on foreign investment, and preferential treatment in enforcement actions-- all issues identified among companies' top 10 concerns in 2020 as well as in previous years. Policies to level the playing field for foreign companies should ensure equal treatment of foreign companies regardless of their ownership form.National Security and Innovation PoliciesCompanies remain concerned about China's use of measures imposed under the banner of national security, but seemingly aimed more at promoting domestic industry. Recent examples include China's Cybersecurity Law (as well as draft implementing measures that could mandate data localization), measures targeting foreign technology procurement, and provisions in the Foreign Investment Law that can require national security reviews of foreign investments. These policies do little to strengthen China's national security and contradict the spirit of China's WTO commitments.Discrimination is also a feature of China's innovation policies. Although most of China's innovation measures are taken to promote high-tech industries, their negative impact extends beyond technology companies. Policies favoring the use of domestic technology appear in rules that affect technology users in industries ranging from financial services to healthcare and ecommerce.Regulations in the areas of technology and innovation should be based solely on commercial and technical factors. Innovation thrives under such conditions but is stifled when a government seeks to limit how and where it occurs, or seeks to dictate technology choices. To create a fairer legal environment for all companies invested in the market, China--and all governments-- should refrain from using national security as a means to discriminate against foreign companies. Measures to protect national security should be narrowly tailored and necessary for the protection of genuine security goals.Licensing and ApprovalsOver the past decade, licensing has consistently ranked among USCBC member companies' top 10 concerns. Certain regulations require expert panels to be convened for inspection, testing, and quarantine of equipment, facilities, products, and articles that directly concern public security, health, and safety of life and property. There are three major concerns about expert panel reviews among US companies.First, the government has the authority and tendency to nominate panelists who work for the applicant's Chinese competitors. Second, applicants are often required to report detailed information about confidential and proprietary operations, which many companies consider to be trade secrets, to review panels. Providing such information to anyone outside the company-- including government officials, and especially competitors--exposes companies to the risk of losing their competitive advantages, profits, and sensitive technologies. Third, experts have unlimited authority to request information from companies, even when the information requested has little or no relation to the panel's decision-making.In a positive step, China committed in the Phase One trade deal to prohibit third-party reviewers with financial or competitive interests from participating in the administrative review process.They also committed to establishing a mechanism for objecting to the participation of specific third-party reviewers. Recent draft documents would help to meet these commitments, but have yet to be implemented.Because licensing approvals are made more on an ad-hoc basis rather than systemic and transparent rules, they can pose a significant market access barrier. US companies often face more challenges in obtaining licenses than their domestic competitors. Depending on the industry sector, companies may need dozens of licenses to do business, and many of these licenses require frequent renewal. The inconsistency of licensing procedures across provinces and government agencies also complicates company operations.Intellectual Property RightsChina is slowly making progress in IP protection, but it remains an issue that US companies have consistently raised over the years--85 percent of USCBC survey respondents are concerned about IPR protection.For the last decade, the majority of our members reported no change in China's IP protection environment. This trend reversed in 2019, and members continued to express greater optimism in our most recent survey: 61 percent saw improvement, 37 percent saw no change, and only 2 percent reported a deterioration in IP protection. Companies attribute these improvements to the Chinese government's increased emphasis on IP protection, a variety of new laws and regulations that aim to enhance protections, and US government efforts to elevate the protection of IP in the Phase One trade agreement.One positive development in recent years that merits attention is the improvement in companies' ability to use China's various IP enforcement channels. Those channels include administrative agencies, civil courts, criminal courts, special IP courts, and China's recently-created Supreme People's Court IP appeals mechanism. Other positive developments in 2020 include the release of a two-year IP Action Plan, as specified in the Phase One agreement, and draft revisions to the Copyright Law, the Patent Law, and the Criminal Law, all of which include provisions that strengthen IP enforcement. Since March 2020, China's Supreme People's Court has also released a series of draft judicial interpretations and guiding opinions that address Phase One commitments on trade secrets, ecommerce, geographical indications, notarization services, the expeditious enforcement of court judgments, and evidence rules in civil IP litigation. These improvements build on those in 2019, including amendments to the Trademark Law, the AntiUnfair Competition Law, and the Administrative Law.These actions reflect progress that China has made on the full spectrum of IP issue areas. While China is on track to carry out its IP Action Plan, legal reform is a slow process, and there is still room for improvement in enforcement. According to USCBC's most recent member survey, 29 percent of companies curtail or choose not to embark on investments in China because of China's level of IP enforcement. Significant trade secret cases can languish in court for years, even when there are clear cut cases of Chinese violations of the IP rights of foreign companies.Chinese courts often stall recognition and enforcement proceedings for international arbitration awards obtained by foreign companies against Chinese companies. The delay or denial of prompt and credible enforcement of IPR violations erodes US, international, and, ultimately, Chinese interests in protecting IP and establishing the precedent to prevent further trade secret misappropriation. Continued reform, with follow-through in enforcement, would also help to reduce tensions between China and its major trading partners--something that industry would welcome.Additionally, China's evidence-collection requirements are cumbersome, impacting companies' ability to cost-effectively challenge infringers. Tools that many companies use in the United States and other markets to protect their IP, such as non-compete or other contractual agreements, are largely untested in China, leading to uncertainty about how such provisions would be interpreted by China's courts. Further, China has some policies that could place foreign-owned companies at a competitive disadvantage, such as subsidies offered to Chinese companies for patent prosecution.One step that China is taking to improve IP protection is adopting a tougher deterrent against piracy. Under China's current system, violators are subject to a traditionally low fine rather than criminal sanctions, which would serve as a stronger deterrent. The Phase One deal attempts to address this problem by increasing punitive and statutory damages for IP cases. In what appears to be a larger trend, recent legal amendments have quintupled the previous maximum damages for IP cases, in line with Phase One obligations.In addition, the Foreign Investment Law, which went into effect in January, stipulates that government officials must not reveal sensitive information or trade secrets that they have gained access to in the course of their work. It also requires that public officials of administrative organizations can be criminally prosecuted for illegally providing others with trade secrets they learned while performing their duties. While this is a step in the right direction, the effectiveness of these changes on IP enforcement will be tested as the law is implemented.Broadening the use of higher penalties, holding both government and commercial infringers criminally liable for IP infringement, and creating stronger deterrents in both civil and criminal cases against all types of IP infringement would benefit everyone doing business in China. This would include adopting WTO-consistent deterrents of criminal penalties in cases of commercial-scale infringement.Technology TransferWhen China joined the WTO, it agreed that it would not require foreign companies to transfer technology in order to invest or sell products in China. Tech transfer would be allowable only in situations where a foreign and Chinese company agreed to such a transfer as part of a normal business negotiation. The accession's Working Party Report stipulated that "the terms and conditions of technology transfer, production processes or other proprietary knowledge, particularly in the context of an investment, would only require agreement between the parties to the investment." China's accession protocol also specifies that the right to import or invest in China will not be conditioned on "performance requirements of any kind, such as local content [or] the transfer of technology." Despite these commitments, as part of China's drive to become more innovative, foreign companies have been "encouraged" and, in some cases, pressured to transfer technology to their China subsidiaries or Chinese companies.Only 13 percent of respondents to USCBC's member survey report that they have been explicitly asked to transfer technology to China as a requirement for gaining an investment, project, product, or market entry approval, down from 20 percent in our 2017 survey. While over the last three years, fewer of our member companies have reported technology transfer as an issue affecting their business in China, it is still an acute issue for affected companies.China has taken some steps to address these concerns, such as committing not to require or pressure foreign companies to transfer technology in the Phase One agreement and through language prohibiting forced technology transfer in the Foreign Investment Law. These regulatory changes address some of the top concerns raised in USTR's Section 301 report on restrictions that reduce the ability of foreign companies to negotiate fair, market-based terms for the transfer of their technology into China. However, without specifics, it is unclear how this will reasonably be enforced. Additional reforms to joint venture requirements and administrative licensing requirements would be beneficial in protecting companies' trade secrets.Structural Issues Encourage Tech TransferWhile the above regulatory changes are a step in the right direction, they do not address the structural issues--like JV requirements and foreign equity restrictions in certain industries--at the root of technology transfer issues in China.In sectors where 100 percent foreign ownership is allowed in China, foreign companies are generally not compelled to transfer their technologies to their competitors, since any technology used in their China operations remains in their own hands. In various industries, China imposes equity caps or other restrictions that require foreign companies to not only partner with a domestic company to access the market but also to allow the domestic company to control the technologies and processes, things that many foreign companies consider to be trade secrets.While many requests for technology transfer might technically be part of a "normal" business negotiation, in reality, China's joint venture requirements and foreign equity restrictions create unbalanced negotiations--Chinese companies have an inherently stronger position over their foreign counterparts because of joint venture requirements or equity restrictions as stipulations for market entry. As a consequence, a request for technology transfer made by a Chinese party in a business negotiation can reasonably be interpreted by the foreign party as a requirement for the deal to be successfully concluded.In order for China to uphold its WTO accession responsibilities, China should eliminate all joint venture requirements and foreign equity limitations and regulate all companies in the market under China's Company Law. This would provide meaningful improvements in affected sectors and bring China in line with its commitments.ProcurementChina has a variety of procurement-related policies that act as de facto IP or technology transfer requirements. For instance, China's Cybersecurity Law and measures related to the law's implementation include requirements for the use of "secure and controllable" technology in certain industries, which in effect mandates the purchase of such technologies by government or state-owned entities. Qualification for participation in such procurement processes requires sharing source code or other proprietary information. Some provincial and local procurement policies continue to include preferences for products using "indigenous" innovation, frequently interpreted as meaning products made by Chinese companies. This problem is exacerbated by a lack of clear domestic content regulations, leading some tendering agencies to interpret a country of origin without considering products manufactured in China by foreign-invested firms.Foreign companies often cannot participate in various procurement processes if they do not comply with technology transfer, encryption, or other requirements that leave their trade secrets and intellectual property vulnerable. The system also lacks a functioning appeals framework which limits bidders from reviewing detailed records of how a tendering decision is made.To address these concerns, it is critical that China's regulations comply with its WTO commitments on nondiscrimination and national treatment. The Chinese government should also actively ensure that its commitments to treat IP owned and developed in other countries on par with intellectual property owned or developed in China are being honored at both the central and local level. This includes ensuring the procurement process appropriately values investment in innovation, and that government procurement policies and decisions are transparent, predictable, and consistent across the central and local levels.Lastly, China should join the WTO's Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) and ensure that goods and services provided by all legal entities in China are treated equally during procurement processes, regardless of ownership. China's latest offer to join the GPA in October 2019 makes progress towards this goal. In advance of joining the GPA, China should immediately designate a formula of "substantial transformation" similar to those used by the United States to determine a product's national origin.TransparencyChina has made incremental progress in its commitment to increase transparency. The Chinese government's move to generally require draft regulatory documents to be open for a 30-day public review and comment period, as per China's bilateral commitments, is a welcome step. USCBC continues to recommend that China go further by permitting a longer comment period of 60 or 90 days to ensure high-quality comment contributions. It should also expand the scope of regulatory documents subject to the public comment process.Beyond the rule-making process, however, transparency challenges remain pervasive and a top source of concern among US companies in China. As noted above, companies face challenges obtaining accurate information on the status of their licensing and patent applications, as well as in participating in the standard-setting process and providing input on government regulatory developments. Obscure allocation of government resources and regulatory scrutiny is often equated with unfair competition and preferential treatment for Chinese firms.Another emerging area of concern is the development of China's corporate social credit system (SCS). Lack of clarity about how the vast amounts of company data collected are shared between different government entities, as well as how the utilization of a blacklist system as a compliance and enforcement tool, are raising concern that the SCS could provide Chinese government officials significant discretion to apply pressure on companies in an opaque and non-fact-based manner. The growing web of frameworks supporting a social credit system leaves too much room for interpretation and should be applied narrowly and transparently and introduce safeguards that guarantee due process for all entities subject to the system.Electronic Payment ServicesWhen China joined the WTO in 2001, it committed to allowing non-Chinese electronic payment services (EPS) companies to compete and do business in its domestic market on equal terms with Chinese companies, including by processing renminbi-denominated transactions in China. While US EPS suppliers have continued to process "cross-border" transactions in China for decades, which primarily involve purchases by international travelers in a currency other than renminbi (RMB), through the end of 2019 no US EPS supplier was processing, or even authorized to process, RMB-denominated transactions in China.Under the Phase One agreement, China committed to accept and make a determination on any application for a Bank Card Clearing Institution (BCCI) license from a US EPS supplier within prescribed time limits and without regard for the applicant's ownership structure. Following the signing of the agreement in January 2020, one US EPS supplier has completed its licensing process while others have applications still under consideration. US companies look forward to the processing of RMB-denominated transactions by all US EPS suppliers that have applied for a BCCI license, as contemplated under the Phase One and WTO agreements.Antidumping and Countervailing Duties (AD/CVD)China's politicization of the anti-dumping/countervailing duty regime is a significant violation of WTO commitments and core values such as procedural fairness. China has deliberately targeted key imports of countries when disputes arise in order to pressure and damage foreign industry as well as to support China's domestic industrial development goals. The process is non-transparent, unnecessarily burdensome, and designed to ensure negative outcomes that establish maximum political and commercial leverage rather than following the rationale and nature of the AD/CVD process.Ensuring a transparent and WTO-compliant AD/CVD process is critical for a well-functioning trade regime. The Chinese government should make determinations based on the law and articulated facts and establish transparent standard procedures.Leading By ExampleThe United States is losing credibility as a leader of the global trading system, and by extension, risks validating controversial Chinese approaches that have used similar justifications. Since 2018, the United States has been the subject of 22 requests for consultation and dispute settlement--some of them initiated by China--but complaints have also been filed by Canada, Mexico, South Korea, the European Union, Vietnam, India, Norway, Russia, Switzerland, Venezuela, and Turkey. In at least two separate instances in 2019, 40 WTO members jointly voiced objections to US tariff plans at the WTO Council on Trade in Goods. These complaints, in addition to others, represent a substantial increase in our global trading partners' perceptions that we, ourselves, are not acting in accordance with our commitments or following WTO rules.Neither China nor the United States should implement policies that violate the spirit of WTO commitments despite conforming to the letter of the rules. We must push ourselves and encourage our trading partners to implement policies that uphold WTO principles. If existing rules fall short, we should not abandon them, but instead should take the lead to improve them.The WTO's appellate body, which has ceased to function as a result of US actions, is one example. While the dispute settlement body is not without fault, it remains a central component of the global, rules-based trading system from which the United States benefits. Restoring the body to its full capacity and working with partners to enact reforms will serve the long-term interests of the United States and its companies. It is the only means of ensuring that the WTO continues to provide an active and meaningful mechanism for resolving disputes over China's trade practices. Until the appellate body is restored, dispute settlement decisions at the WTO will not be enforceable.Multilateral CooperationConstructively working with like-minded partners has proven to be an effective method to alter adverse Chinese policies. The United States' dispute settlement case filed in March 2018 identifying Chinese laws and regulations that raise tech transfer and IP protection concerns is a good example of how the United States should seek those types of outcomes. USTR's request for consultation to address China's discriminatory technology licensing requirements, based on evidence detailed in the Section 301 investigation report, was joined by five WTO members, and China ultimately revised the regulations in question.In recent years, the trilateral with the EU and Japan aimed at addressing "non-market-oriented policies and practices" provides another example of constructively working with like-minded partners to address inappropriate Chinese practices.The three countries have held a series of meetings to develop stricter rules governing subsidies and state-owned enterprises, with a longer-term goal of similarly upgrading the WTO's existing rules. This offers a clear indication that like-minded global trading partners are eager to work with the United States in ways consistent with international agreements to address common concerns regarding China's trade and investment policies. USCBC encourages the United States to undertake more actions that include this kind of cooperation.View attachments at: https://downloads.regulations.gov/USTR-2020-0033-0004/attachment_1.pdf* * *The notice can be viewed at: https://beta.regulations.gov/document/USTR-2020-0033-0001TARGETED NEWS SERVICE (founded 2004) features non-partisan 'edited journalism' news briefs and information for news organizations, public policy groups and individuals; as well as 'gathered' public policy information, including news releases, reports, speeches.

DR. JOYCE: THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT'S LIES COST AMERICAN LIVES AND LIVELIHOODSStates News ServiceSeptember 22, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 712 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of Pennsylvania Rep. John Joyce:Congressman John Joyce, M.D. (PA-13) today emphasized the Chinese Communist Party's coverup of the coronavirus outbreak and outlined his work on the China Task Force to hold this hostile regime accountable. Watch his full remarks on the House Floor.Mr. Speaker, after too long, Americans are waking up to the danger of the Chinese Communist Party. As we combat the economic and health ramifications of coronavirus, it's never been more important that we take on this hostile regime.It has been my honor to serve on the China Task Force and help expose the threats that the Chinese Communist Party poses to our national security and to the American people.Just yesterday, Congressman Michael McCaul released the House Foreign Affairs Committee's report into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. Their evidence clearly confirms that the Chinese government covered up the coronavirus, enabling a local outbreak to escalate into a deadly pandemic.The Chinese Communist Party knew that the coronavirus could be spread by human to human transmission. And yet, this regime hid key findings from global leaders, public health experts, and even the World Health Organization.Leaders in the Chinese government knew that this virus could be catastrophic; and yet, they deliberately chose to cover up their missteps rather than sound an alarm and warn the world about the virus that they had unleased.Their lies cost American livelihoods. Their lies cost American lives. This pandemic's destruction could have been prevented - this didn't have to happen.Now, Americans are facing a choice. If we do not act now, who will stop the Chinese Communist Party from simply repeating this coverup? Inaction is not an option. America must prevent another pandemic from reaching our shores.And, our work can't stop there. Sadly, the Chinese government's malicious acts extend far beyond the coronavirus pandemic.From cyberattacks on American citizens and blatant overreach into our virtual networks to espionage in our academic institutions and illicit fentanyl that kills on American streets, we cannot ignore the Chinese government's pervasive threats to our nation.Mr. Speaker, this is no "distraction." It is reality. For the safety of the American people and the future of our nation, the Chinese Communist Party must be held accountable.For months, the China Task Force has been focused on researching these issues and exploring legislative solutions. We are working on a final report that will detail our findings and recommend a pragmatic path forward.While our work on this report is coming to a close, our commitment to this cause will continue.During these busy days, I recognize that many issues are competing for America's time. But, to be fair, these threats require action.The Chinese government's coverup of the coronavirus pandemic requires action. The Chinese government's persecution of Uyghurs requires action. The Chinese government's monopoly of the medical supply chain requires action. The Chinese government's attempts to control the world's network require action.Despite the challenges that we are facing, the American people must stand together against the Chinese Communist Party.Our national security should never be a partisan issue. The health of the American people should never be a partisan issue. By working together, we can strengthen our defenses, defend human rights, spur innovation, and equip Americans to lead the way in global innovation.Moving forward, it is imperative that America continues to strengthen our supply chain, to pursue fairer trade deals with China, and ultimately to hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable for its actions.Once again, it has been my privilege to serve the American people as a member of the China Task Force. I thank Leader Kevin McCarthy for the opportunity to serve, and I am grateful to Chairman Michael McCaul for his leadership.This is a long road, but it is worth the fight. And, as always, I believe America will win. Thank you, and I yield.Watch Dr. Joyce's full remarks and read more about the China Task Force. The House Foreign Affairs Committee report on the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic is available here.###Load-Date: September 22, 2020End of Document

Chinese virologist: China's government party 'intentionally' released COVID-19Stillman Advance: Stillman CollegeSeptember 18, 2020 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 515 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBodyDr. Yan told Carlson: "They don't want the people to know this truth".Specifically, Yan believes the Chinese government ignored research that could have saved lives. She did not stop at that and went on to claim that Beijing also released the deadly virus "intentionally" to inflict "damage" on the world. She blames "the big suppression [coming] from the Chinese Communist Party government, and also their friends in the scientific world". Twitter suspends accounts which violate the Twitter Rules'.Yan in July publicly alleged that China attempted to quash the spread of information on its handling of the virus in the early stages of the pandemic.She provides: "SARS-CoV-2 exhibits organic traits which are inconsistent with a naturally occurring, zoonotic virus".Last week, Li Meng-Yan had appeared on ITV and said that she had proof to support her claim that the virus was man-made.Twitter has not commented on the suspension of Dr Yan's account."The scientific world also keeps silent [and] works together with the Chinese Communist Party".Justin Bieber Recruits Chance The Rapper For "Holy" SingleThe track is a collaboration with Grammy-winning musician Chance the Rapper , who is known for collaborating with Kanye West. "This new album is some of the best music, i've ever made", Bieber said in the livestream ahead of the song's release.Yan, who is a former researcher at the Hong Kong School of Public Health, said COVID-19 was "man-made" and "not from nature". "Specifically, Dr Yan never conducted any research on human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus at [the University of Hong Kong] during December 2019 and January 2020, her central assertion of the said interview", the statement added. The Society was founded by Stephen K. Bannon, the former Trump advisor recently charged by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for fraud, and Chinese businessman Guo Wengui, who fled China in 2014 on bribery and other charges.The U.S. administration, citing intelligence, has said that the virus is naturally-occurring but that "there is significant evidence" suggesting the virus first leaked out of a Wuhan lab. Officials have called out Beijing for denying worldwide researchers access to crucial data about the virus's origins."We will get in trouble and we'll be disappeared", is what was allegedly told to her.The Twitter ban, however, has drawn criticism from prominent China critics and the overseas Chinese dissident community, who said Twitter could be helping the Chinese regime censor topics not to its liking."This is the critical thing for us to know the origin of the virus", Dr. Yan related.Dr Li-Meng in a youtube video had stressed that the coronavirus did not originate from a meat market in Wuhan and the claim that coronavirus has originated from a wet market in Wuhan is simply "a smokescreen".As the National Institutes of Health explains on its website, reputable medical and scientific journalists insist articles are reviewed by expert colleagues to ensure valid methods were used and that scientists are making significant and original conclusions.Load-Date: September 19, 2020End of Document

Dartmouth encourages faculty to safeguard students as Chinese law targets free speech globallyThe Dartmouth: Dartmouth CollegeSeptember 24, 2020 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1643 wordsByline: Kyle MullinsBodybyMichael Lin/ The Dartmouth Senior StaffProtests in Hong Kong may seem far away for most Dartmouth students, but the Chinese government's response - a new national security law with worldwide implications - has brought concerns about censorship and surveillance to Dartmouth itself. In the law's wake, the College has issued a set of guidelines encouraging professors to take precautions when teaching about topics considered unpalatable by Beijing.The Hong Kong National Security Law was passed in China this summer in reaction to pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. The law criminalizes separatist or subversive activity, including speech about topics "objectionable to the Chinese government," according to a Sept. 11 memo sent by faculty of arts and sciences dean Elizabeth Smith to "fall 2020 instructors whose course curriculum deals with China."Topics covered by the law include those deemed contrary to the Chinese government's interests, experts said. These include the protests in Hong Kong, the persecution of Uighurs in Xinjiang, the status of Tibet and Taiwan, China's practices of online surveillance and censorship and the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.The broad scope of the law constitutes a "threat to online security" for some students, the memo says. The memo and experts alike warn that the law is not limited to speech or actions that take place in Hong Kong, making it potentially applicable to any "objectionable" speech by anyone, anywhere in the world. Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that while enforcement of the law outside of China's borders is difficult, the law could be used against foreigners who travel to or through the country.Amnesty International researcher Kai Ong agreed that the Chinese or Hong Kong governments could try to arrest anyone they think has violated the law, "regardless of where you are and regardless of your nationality.""If someone says something that was truly inflammatory - supporting, for example, the June 4 protests [in Hong Kong] and encouraging the Chinese people to repeat that episode - surely, they could be 'disappeared.'"Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International StudiesThe Dartmouth memo focuses on the threat posed to international students from mainland China or Hong Kong, especially if they are taking online classes while in China. That group of students, the memo says, "could be at risk" if they address controversial topics in assigned coursework."It is reasonable to be concerned that classes might be monitored, and that if students voice opinions that are seen as engaging in criminal behavior, that they could be harassed and intimidated - they could be threatened," Glaser said. "If someone says something that was truly inflammatory - supporting, for example, the June 4 protests [in Hong Kong] and encouraging the Chinese people to repeat that episode - surely, they could be 'disappeared.'"In the memo, the College recommends that professors "alert and inform" students about the potential legal liabilities that the law creates. For students who may be at risk, it suggests a number of technical measures, including removing identifying information and metadata from submitted assignments, disabling video on Zoom and turning off recording and transcription. Finally, it suggests that students be excused from participation grades in assignments where anonymity is "not possible.""These measures," the memo concludes, "may help but they cannot not guarantee full digital security for students."Students, professors, take precautionsThe national security law was written intentionally vaguely, Ong said, in order to generate uncertainty around what speech is illegal."The law is so vague that no one really knows how they would transgress the law," she said. "The problem is that it creates this chilling effect."Brian Kot '21, a student from Hong Kong who has been active in pro-democracy activism, explained that since there is "no clear way of knowing" whether you've violated the law, it "induces citizens to self-censor.""[The law] induces them to avoid saying things that they think might trigger or might cross the red line - and the fact is, every person has a different idea of what the red line is," Kot said.Kot, who is living on campus this term, said that while activities and speech on campus may not appear "dangerous" at the moment, the law leaves open the possibility of future prosecution.Were he to return to Hong Kong, though, he said classwork with "any slight condemnation or any slight criticism of the government in China" could potentially put him in danger - though he could not say for sure.Jenny Ge '23, a student from Beijing, said that she already was "very careful" about what she said or wrote before the law, an impulse she credits partly to a "repressive" education system in China that does not encourage disagreement with authority.The law also presents challenges for professors teaching about topics considered taboo by the Chinese government or who rely on access to China for research.Government professor Jennifer Lind, who this fall is teaching GOVT 50.16, "Rise and Fall of Great Powers," added a note to her syllabus suggesting that any Chinese nationals concerned about course content should contact her to arrange anonymization of their coursework."It was extremely depressing to do so," Lind wrote in an email statement, "but important to start a conversation with our Chinese national students who may be worried about their situation. We want them to both get a great Dartmouth education and feel secure as they do so."An August article in The Wall Street Journal details similar measures being taken at schools including Amherst College, Harvard University and Princeton University.History professor Pamela Crossley, who specializes in modern Chinese history, said any changes to classes would be up to individual professors."Some will decide, 'well, sorry, no matter what the risk, I'm not altering what I do in the classroom,'" she said. "I think [the law] has the distinct potential to extend the self-censorship issue to the classroom."Crossley also expressed concern that students may self-select out of classes that deal with sensitive material, and added that it was likely some Chinese students were doing this prior to the law's passage.Professors who work in China have also had to tread lightly amid uncertainty. Asian Societies, Cultures and Languages program chair Allen Hockley noted that professors in his department may need to exercise caution when speaking about the law."China scholars need to be careful what they say if they want a career," Hockley wrote. "[They] need access to China for their research."Several professors in the government and religion departments, as well as the ASCL program, did not respond to or declined requests for comment.Although the recent law raises new issues, censorship related to China is not a new problem. Anthropology professor Sienna Craig, who studies cultures in Nepal and Tibet, wrote in an email that she has "had to deal with various issues over the years working in Tibet," and that she is "very careful" to monitor her words and actions when in China for that reason. She also referred further comment to other professors.The Office of General Counsel referred requests for comment to College spokesperson Diana Lawrence, who declined to comment on whether the College has an official stance on the law. The Office of Visa and Immigration Services did not reply to multiple requests for comment.Security uncertain in the age of ZoomStudents and professors have both expressed concern that Zoom is not a safe platform under the new law, citing concerns about Chinese influence.Association for Asian Studies guidelines cited in the Dartmouth memo state that U.S. data has been routed through Chinese servers and that "Zoom and other online meeting providers will have limited ability to prevent state intrusion by the governments in the countries where they do business."Information, Technology and Consulting chief information officer Mitchel Davis said that in his conversations with Zoom leadership, they have assured him that the company has handled the privacy issues that arose in the spring as millions of people moved onto the platform due to COVID-19."We can create a secure solution for Zoom," Davis said, adding that security is "not a problem anymore," and Zoom is "as focused as any other company on making sure that it is secure."However, one of the technical changes suggested in the memo - allowing students to join Zoom calls from "throwaway" email accounts - may also be illegal in China upon further consideration, Davis said. He said ITC is working on "finding a better way as quickly as possible," but did not specify further.Crossley said that due to uneasiness about security, she uses Webex for her classes and pays for it herself. Kot said that Zoom is "notorious" in Hong Kong for being influenced by the mainland."There are widespread concerns that Zoom may betray users' privacy and information," Kot said. "I would be more cautious on Zoom."Going forward, it remains to be seen how stringently the law will be enforced on international students, but the fact that universities have seen a need to act is telling, Kot said."The fact that college faculties are worried that they might put students in trouble, it's akin to the Chinese government holding overseas students hostage," he said. "They're using those overseas students for putting pressure on U.S. campuses to silence them or to tone them down."Ge said that the academic freedom in the U.S. is something she appreciates about being able to study here."Those kinds of freedoms, or liberties, should not be taken as granted," Ge said.Load-Date: September 25, 2020End of Document

Lookman pleaded guilty to the charge in January, according to the statement. Former Employee At Los Alamos National Laboratory Sentenced To Probation For Making False Statements About Being Employed By China https://t.co/XBw2NdaO97 - Justice Department (@TheJusticeDept) September 15, 2020Lookman falsely denied his involvement with the Chinese government in June 2018, when he was a scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, which receives taxpayer funding. At a hearing in 2019, federal prosecutors characterized Lookman as a serious national security threat because of his high-level security clearance at the lab, which gave him access to some of the U.S.'s most guarded nuclear secrets, according to the Santa Fe New Mexican.The top-secret information Lookman was privy to is “the kind of gun he could point at a whole city, a whole country,” federal prosecutor George C. Kraehe said at that hearing according to the Santa Fe New Mexican. “And the United States tries to keep that kind of gun very safe and secure, and that's why it entrusts possession of that gun to only the very most reliable people there are: people who always tell the truth.”The Thousand Talents Program is a Chinese-government talent recruitment program that in some cases has resulted in violations of U.S law, including espionage, theft of trade secrets and grant fraud. Lookman also had a number of bank accounts and possible citizenship in several other countries, which prosecutors said was additional proof that he had no loyalty to the U.S., the Santa Fe New Mexican reported.Numerous students, researchers and academics at labs and universities across the country have faced charges related to lying about their ties with the Chinese government, often while accepting US-taxpayer-funded grants.

In some cases, participation in the program has resulted in violations of U.S. law, such as espionage, theft of trade secrets and grant fraud at the benefit of the Chinese government.Mark Mukasey, Lieber's attorney, has promised to restore his client's name.“Employees who find themselves accused of wrongdoing rely on their employers' promises to pay their defense costs,” the complaint said.“Instead of following suit, and supporting their long-standing, well-respected employee, Harvard has placed Professor Lieber on administrative leave, publicly denounced him, improperly characterized the charges against him, and permanently and falsely associated him with academic espionage, forever harming his reputation,” it said.The school's rejection of Lieber's legal fees will leave Lieber, who has blood cancer, and his family “impoverished” according to the lawsuit, which says Harvard's actions are also illegal.“It is disturbing that Harvard acted solely its in own self-interest by turning its back on a dedicated faculty member who suffers from a terminal illness and who is presumed innocent. More importantly, it is illegal,” the lawsuit said.Lieber is accused of working for Wuhan University of Technology (WUT) in China beginning in 2011, and accepting $50,000 per month, living expenses of up to roughly $158,0000, and $1.5 million in awards to establish a research lab at the Chinese university, according to the Justice Department. The payments were part of the terms of Lieber's three-year Thousand Talents Program contract. Lieber allegedly did not inform Harvard of his involvement with the foreign entities, and caused Harvard to falsely tell the National Institutes of Health that he had no connection with WUT. Lieber has been convicted by a grand jury on two counts of making false statements to authorities, which carries a sentence of up to five years in prison if convicted. Lieber is one of more than a dozen researchers, professors and students at American universities who have been arrested in the last year on charges related to lying about their ties with the Chinese government, often while accepting US-taxpayer-funded grants.

Environmental Investigation Agency: Revealed - The Chinese Government's Pangolin Trade DeceptionTargeted News ServiceOctober 13, 2020 Tuesday 8:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 671 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: LONDON, England Body(TNSRep) -- The Environmental Investigation Agency issued the following news release:A new report by the London-based Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), Smoke and Mirrors, reveals the extent to which the Chinese Government is supporting the continued use of pangolins, the world's most trafficked mammal.Four months ago, Chinese State media reported that pangolin scales had been removed from traditional medicines - but a new investigation has found it is still business as usual.EIA's Pangolin Product Survey 2020, detailed in the report, identified:* 221 companies licenced to sell pangolin scale products;* 56 of these companies actively advertising medicinal products claiming to contain pangolin online;* A total of 64 products listing pangolin as an ingredient advertised on manufacturer websites;* Six of these products available via e-commerce websites.Some of the products were found on e-commerce sites, including eBay and Taobao, with international shipping to the US, UK and other countries.One of the companies identified is China's largest traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) pharmaceutical company, China Beijing Tong Ren Tang Group Co Ltd, which has subsidiaries across the world and whose shareholders include major European and US investment funds.Chris Hamley, EIA Senior Pangolin Campaigner, said: "Amid mounting concerns about the role of wildlife trade in causing the coronavirus pandemic, it is critical that the Chinese Government ends all legal use of pangolin scales, instead of allowing the multi-billion dollar TCM industry to carry on as usual."The Government claims the pangolin scales used in medicines come from a national stockpile - but it is a stockpile shrouded in secrecy and never seems to run out. Demand is being met by trafficking from across Africa and Asia; the vast majority of pangolin scale shipments seized from illegal trade are ultimately bound for China."By keeping the door open for the TCM industry to exploit pangolins, the Chinese Government is undermining international efforts to end the global pangolin trafficking crisis and fueling transnational organised crime."Earlier this year, EIA warned that while pangolin scales had been removed as a raw ingredient from the country's 2020 Pharmacopoeia - an official reference book on traditional Chinese and Western medicines - they remain listed in some of the book's patent medicine formulations.The EIA investigation further found that while pangolin scale 'yinpian' (semi-processed scales) was removed from the list of products covered by State medical insurance in 2019, the insurance scheme has actually added an additional patent pangolin scale treatment to its list - 'weiling guci gao' - and continues to cover four patent medicines containing pangolin scales that were on the 2017 list."China urgently needs to amend its Wildlife Protection Law so that it fully prohibits the acquisition, sale or possession, including for medicinal purposes, of all parts and products of pangolins and other globally threatened species," said Hamley, "including those from captive-bred sources."Scientists earlier this year suggested that pangolins may have been an intermediary host in the transmission of coronavirus between animals and humans.The EIA report highlights how many stakeholders in China are already calling for the existing wildlife consumption ban to extend beyond food and include the medicinal use of wildlife."Most TCM medications do not use the body parts of globally threatened wildlife and experts in the field have proposed specific herbal substitutes that can replace pangolin scales," added Hamley.The report further urges shareholders to review their investments in the companies named in Smoke and Mirrors and to divest from these if they do not cease the use and sale of pangolins and other wildlife threatened by trade.* * *REPORT: https://eia-international.org/wp-content/uploads/EIA-Smoke-and-Mirrors-2020-FINAL.pdf[Category: Environment]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7263711 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: October 13, 2020End of Document

VIEWPOINT: Denounce Islamophobia in ChinaThe Hoya: Georgetown UniversityOctober 29, 2020 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 773 wordsBodyIn 2019, shootings at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand resulted in 51 people killed and 40 people wounded. The attacker, Brenton Tarrant, had previous ties to alt-right ideology. Immediately following the attack, Australian Senator Fraser Anning blamed the violent act on Muslim immigration into New Zealand, faulting the nation's immigration program for allowing Muslim "fanatics" to enter the country. He added that communities in Australia and New Zealand are growing fearful of Muslim presence in their regions. Ironically, Anning's Islamophobic stance perpetuates fear and hostility toward Islam or Muslims.Anning's stance pins the death of the Muslim worshippers at the hands of New Zealand's government, The senator's misguided rhetoric legitimizes the rampant Islamophobia present in the world, which has resulted in devastating human rights atrocities such as the genocide and ethnic cleansing of the Uighur Muslims taking place in Xinjiang, China.The Chinese government has employed a program called the Golden Shield Project to carry out these violations of human rights. The Golden Shield Project is an oppressive government surveillance system that uses facial recognition technology to monitor citizens' physical movements and online activity. A computer system then uses these individual records to give each person a social credit score based on their perceived trustworthiness. The Chinese government then uses this score to easily identify and punish perceived dissenters. The government's use of facial recognition technology and extreme censorship of news and social media outlets are part of systems put in place by the Chinese government to restrict citizens' rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.This system of mass surveillance allows the Chinese government to target Uighur Muslims for imprisonment. According to a United Nations human rights panel, over the last year, "up to one million Uighur Muslims were forced into grounds that resemble massive internment camps in Xinjiang." Additionally, the Chinese government has uprooted a large portion of the Uighur people from Xinjiang, an autonomous region in northwest China, and forced them to move across the country to work in factories.Even more appalling is the mass genocide carried out by the Chinese government. Authorities have launched a massive campaign to drastically reduce the birth rate of the Uighurs and other minorities in an effort to reduce the country's Muslim population. An investigation by the Associated Press found, "the state regularly subjects minority women to pregnancy checks, and forces intrauterine devices, sterilization and even abortion on hundreds of thousands of [Uighur women]." These atrocities are part of China's long campaign to oppress the Uighur people.As someone who has lost family members and friends to religious persecution in Cameroon, this issue hits close to home. As a Christian man, I cherish the opportunity I have in the United States to freely practice my faith, and I feel all people in the world - regardless of their religion - should be afforded that same right.What can be done to combat this injustice? While an intervention from the global community and world powers is the most powerful weapon against these violations of human rights, students can also play a role in demanding justice for Uighur Muslims. A host of companies, including Calvin Klein, Fila, The North Face, Tommy Hilfiger, Victoria's Secret and Puma, have financially benefited from prison labor of Uighur Muslims. I implore Georgetown University students to boycott these companies to compel them to stop doing business in China and halt operations in Xinjiang.Students should also urge the university to end any partnerships with these companies. The student body has shown its ability to enact similar changes; Georgetown committed to divest from the fossil fuel industry after student demands. Although these proposed efforts will not completely solve the human rights violations taking place, they will target a specific area in which the Uighur people are being abused.Islamophobia should have no place in this world, as all human life is precious and deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. The same bigoted ideology held by Anning has empowered the Chinese government to commit these atrocities against Uighur Muslims. We can not accept such bigotry. I am pleading with the student body to take action and spread awareness about Islamophobia. We as a student body can give this issue the attention it deserves.Tetu Mbah is a freshman in the School of Nursing and Health Studies.Load-Date: October 30, 2020End of Document

Congressional Research Service Report: 'TikTok: Technology Overview & Issues'Targeted News ServiceOctober 2, 2020 Friday 7:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 7013 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Congressional Research Service issued the following report (No. R46543) entitled "TikTok: Technology Overview and Issues" by Patricia Moloney Figliola, specialist in internet and telecommunications policy, on Oct. 1:TikTok is a globally popular video-sharing smartphone application (app) owned by ByteDance Ltd., a privately held company headquartered in Beijing, China. It is under increasing scrutiny by the U.S. government as a potential privacy and security risk to U.S. citizens. This is because ByteDance, like all technology companies doing business in China, is subject to Chinese laws that require companies operating in the country to turn over user data when asked to by the government. Researchers differ over how TikTok's collection of user data compares with other social media apps and whether TikTok poses a unique threat to the privacy and security of its U.S. users.TikTok launched in the United States in August 2018. The app is available in over 155 countries in 39 languages and has approximately 800 million monthly active users. In the United States, the app has approximately 49 million monthly active users. TikTok's appeal lies heavily on what has been called its "addictive" video feed, For You. The app builds this feed through a "recommendation engine" algorithm built on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and data mining practices.According to the company, the recommendation engine relies on a complex set of weighted factors to recommend content, including hashtags and videos watched previously, as well as the kind of device a person is using. TikTok critics cite problems with how much data TikTok collects from and about its users and with how that data is stored--and could be shared.On August 6, 2020, President Trump signed an Executive Order aimed at stopping TikTok from doing business in the United States. Once in effect on September 27, 2020 (an extension from the original date of September 20), the order will prohibit any U.S. company or person from "transacting" with ByteDance. On August 14, 2020, the President issued a second Executive Order stating that ByteDance, its subsidiaries, and partners must divest from all assets that support TikTok's operations in the United States and destroy all previously collected U.S. user data. Divestiture may be accomplished by finding a U.S. buyer for TikTok. The requirements are designed to limit the Chinese government's access to current and future data from U.S. TikTok users. ByteDance does not want to divest from TikTok and has sued the Trump Administration.On September 14, 2020, Oracle announced that it had reached an agreement with ByteDance to "serve as [the company's] trusted technology provider" in the United States. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced that he had received the proposal. From the terminology used, it appears that the deal may involve a partnership between the two companies rather than a sale. This arrangement would keep the source code of the For You recommendation engine in the hands of ByteDance.It is unclear if this deal satisfies the conditions in President Trump's Executive Orders. Secretary Mnuchin said that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States will review the proposal and present President Trump with its opinion.On September 19, 2020, Oracle announced that Walmart would be joining the TikTok acquisition. On September 27, 2020, Judge Carl J. Nichols of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration order. He stated that while President Trump has broad authority to prohibit business transactions with foreign entities that are deemed to pose a national security risk, TikTok appears to be exempt from such a prohibition because it is a personal communication service, which is protected by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The ruling does not affect the November 12, 2020, deadline that ByteDance divest from TikTok in the United States.Some believe TikTok and other Chinese-owned apps pose a serious security risk to the United States because Chinese companies are subject to China's laws that require compliance with government requests for data. Others believe that TikTok has fallen into "the crosshairs of a global technology battle" based on technology trade protectionism (this concept, also called "techno-nationalism," refers to a country's refusal or reluctance to import other countries' advanced technology, as well as to export, or to allow other nations to benefit from, its own advanced technology).Similar situations may arise in the future with other apps created by foreign companies. Options that Congress may consider include (1) developing an overarching legal and regulatory framework to protect the security and privacy of U.S. citizens' data and communications, and (2) developing a uniform, transparent process to assess and mediate risks posed by foreign apps.* * *Contents:Background ... 1What Is TikTok? ... 1* TikTok's Recommendation Engine ... 2* Data Collection, Storage, and Sharing by TikTok ... 3- Data Collection ... 3- Data Storage ... 4- Data Sharing ... 4White House TikTok Executive Orders ... 4* Prohibiting Transactions with ByteDance ... 5* Requiring Divestiture of ByteDance from TikTok ... 5- ByteDance Lawsuit Against Order to Divest ... 5China's Cybersecurity Law and Export Rules ... 6Status of Potential Oracle and Walmart Partnership with TikTok ... 6Discussion ... 8* Threat to Security ... 8* Technology Trade Protectionism ... 9Related Congressional Activity ... 10* Hearings ... 10* Legislation ... 10Conclusion ... 11Tables:Table 1.

The app is under intense scrutiny by the U.S. government as a potential privacy and security risk to U.S. users. A major concern is that ByteDance is subject to Chinese laws that require companies operating in China to turn over user data when asked to by the national government. On August 6 and August 14, 2020, President Trump signed Executive Orders aimed at stopping U.S. persons and entities from doing business with ByteDance/1 and requiring ByteDance to divest from any holding used to support the operation of TikTok in the United States./2Researchers differ over how TikTok's collection of user data compares with other social media apps and whether TikTok poses a unique threat to the privacy and security of its U.S. users, including many minors.WeChat, another Chinese-owned app, is often mentioned in conjunction with TikTok, but the two apps are quite different. TikTok has a single function--short video--while WeChat has multiple--voice and data messaging, social media, and digital payment. WeChat is used in the United States primarily by the Chinese language community, whereas TikTok is used more widely. On the same day as the TikTok order, President Trump also signed an Executive Order prohibiting any U.S. individual or entity from engaging in any transaction related to WeChat and its owner, Tencent Holdings Ltd./3While issues with the two apps are often conflated, their functions, technical capabilities, and the data collected from their users are different. Only TikTok is discussed in this report. Background information about WeChat is in Appendix.What Is TikTok?On August 2, 2018, U.S. users of the Musical.ly app, a short video service headquartered in Shanghai, China, with a U.S. office in Santa Monica, CA, found that it had been merged into TikTok. Musical.ly had been acquired by ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, in November 2017 for $1 billion as a means to enter the U.S. market. The TikTok app is available in over 155 countries in 39 languages, and has approximately 800 million monthly active users./4In the United States, TikTok has approximately 49 million monthly active users/5 and the company maintains offices in Los Angeles and New York. When ByteDance first released the TikTok app in September 2016, videos could be no longer than 15 seconds, but now users are allowed to link together four 15second segments./6Longer videos recorded outside the app can also be uploaded to the platform. ByteDance is currently estimated to be worth over $100 billion./7The company's core product in China is Toutiao, which means "Headlines." Toutiao began as a mobile news recommendation engine, but has evolved into a platform to deliver content and targeted advertising in other formats as well (e.g., text messages, images, question-and-answer posts, microblogs, videos).TikTok's Recommendation EngineTikTok's appeal relies on what has been called its "addictive" video feed, For You./8The app builds this feed through a "recommendation engine" using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and data mining practices. How each user's feed is constructed had been a tightly held secret until recently. On June 18, 2020, TikTok published a blog post, "How TikTok Recommends Videos #ForYou."/9The company says its algorithm relies on a complex set of weighted factors to recommend content based on user preferences, including hashtags and videos watched; videos "liked," shared, and commented on; as well as the kind of device a person is using. Each user's feed is unique.Table 1 lists the specific factors the company says it uses.Table 1. "For You" Feed Factors and ElementsTable omitted.According to TikTok, [a]ll these factors are processed by our recommendation system and weighted based on their value to a user. A strong indicator of interest, such as whether a user finishes watching a longer video from beginning to end, would receive greater weight than a weak indicator, such as whether the video's viewer and creator are both in the same country. Videos are then ranked to determine the likelihood of a user's interest in a piece of content, and delivered to each unique For You feed.The blog post was seen by most as an effort to provide more transparency to the public as the U.S. government was increasing its scrutiny of the company's practices./10Data Collection, Storage, and Sharing by TikTok Critics, as well as some members of Congress, cite as problematic the amount of data that TikTok collects from and about its users, how that data is stored, and how it could potentially be shared with the Chinese government and used in influence campaigns/11 or against U.S. citizens./12Based on these concerns, both the Democratic and Republican national committees, the Department of Defense, and some private firms, such as Wells Fargo Inc., have banned or discouraged the use of the TikTok app./13Data CollectionAccording to its privacy policy,/14 TikTok collects a range of user information, including location data and internet address, keystroke patterns, and the type of device being used to access the app.The app also collects and stores a user's browsing and search history within the app, as well as the content of any messages exchanged using the app. Additional information can be collected based on user permission: phone number, phone book, and social-network contacts; GPS data; user age; user-generated content (e.g., photos and videos); store payment information; and the videos "liked," shared, watched all the way through, and re-watched. TikTok states that the app collects less personal data than many other apps, such as Facebook and Google, both of which track user activity across devices (TikTok claims that it does not)./15The data that TikTok collects from users appears in many regards to be comparable to what other social media companies gather and use./16Some critics have described TikTok's approach to data mining as aggressive/17 and that its ability to track user behavior while using the app, as well as access to a user's photos, videos, and phone book and geolocation tracking (based on user permissions), means that it can build extremely detailed behavioral profiles of its users that could potentially be shared with the Chinese government./18On August 11, 2020, the Wall Street Journal reported that TikTok avoided privacy safeguards in Google's Android operating system to collect users' mobile device MAC addresses, unique identifiers that allow "the app to track users online," and concealed this activity with an additional layer of encryption before ending the practice after 15 months in November 2019./19Data StorageTikTok claims to store all content created by U.S. users--as well as data about those users--only on servers located within the United States and backed up in Singapore. Those servers are owned or controlled by TikTok, but the company denies that it shares or would share this data with the Chinese government,/20 stating that:The key personnel responsible for TikTok ... are all Americans based in the United States--and therefore are not subject to Chinese law. U.S. content moderation is likewise led by a U.S.-based team and operates independently from China, and, as noted above, the TikTok application stores U.S. user data on servers located in the United States and Singapore./21Data SharingDespite these assertions, TikTok's website says that information can be shared with its parent company in China or other affiliates (usually advertisers), which operate under Chinese law./22Further, a lawsuit filed in federal court in December 2019 asserted that user data was harvested and sent to servers in China./23* * *White House TikTok Executive OrdersPresident Trump has issued two Executive Orders affecting the future of TikTok in the United States, one on August 6, 2020, and another on August 14, 2020.Prohibiting Transactions with ByteDanceThe August 6, 2020, TikTok Executive Order was set to take effect on September 20, 2020, but that date has been extended to September 27, 2020. Once in effect, it will prohibit any U.S. company or person from transacting with ByteDance. The order does not state which specific transactions are to be prohibited, but it likely means, at least, the TikTok app will no longer appear on Apple's App Store or Google's Play Store in the United States. It might also make it illegal for U.S. companies to purchase advertising on TikTok. Some U.S. TikTok employees have speculated that they would no longer be able to be paid.Requiring Divestiture of ByteDance from TikTokOn August 14, 2020, President Trump issued an additional Executive Order, "Regarding the Acquisition of Musical.ly by ByteDance Ltd.,"/24 that imposed additional conditions on the ability of ByteDance to operate TikTok in the United States. The order requires ByteDance and its "subsidiaries, affiliates, and Chinese shareholders" to divest from "any tangible or intangible assets or property, wherever located, used to enable or support ByteDance's operation of the TikTok application in the United States" as determined by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS)./25The order also requires ByteDance to destroy all data obtained or derived from either the TikTok or Music.ly apps from U.S. users upon divestiture and certify in writing to CFIUS that it has done so. The order requires these actions within 90 days, rather than the 45 days included in the first order, giving ByteDance additional time to find a buyer./26A transfer of ownership and operation of TikTok to a U.S. entity not subject to Chinese laws, including management of collected user data, appears designed to limit the ability of the Chinese government to acquire access to future U.S. user data.ByteDance Lawsuit Against Order to DivestByteDance opposed divestiture from TikTok and, on August 24, 2020, sued the Trump Administration./27In a blog post, TikTok stated that it was "shocked by the recent Executive Order, which was issued without any due process."/28On September 27, 2020, Judge Carl J. Nichols of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration order. He stated that while President Trump has broad authority to prohibit business transactions with foreign entities that are deemed to pose a national security risk, TikTok appears to be exempt from such a prohibition because it is a personal communication service, which is protected by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The ruling does not affect the November 12, 2020, deadline that ByteDance divest from TikTok in the United States./29* * *China's Cybersecurity Law and Export RulesThe Cybersecurity Law of the People's Republic of China was passed in November 2016 and went into effect in June 2017. It was updated in November 2018 by the Regulations on Internet Security Supervision and Inspection by Public Security Organs. These laws--* strictly control online activities;* mandate the local storage of user data and the registration of certain network assets; and* allow the government to conduct onsite and remote inspection of computer networks./30The law requires Chinese companies to cooperate with government intelligence operations if so requested/31 and may allow the Chinese government access to user data collected by any company doing business in China. One analyst notes that "by demanding access to any data collected and stored in China, the updated regulations force [domestic and] foreign companies based in China to comply with its investigative measures, leaving intellectual property and private information vulnerable to government abuse."/32On August 31, 2020, China took specific action that could prohibit the sale of TikTok's underlying technology and processes. The new export regulations cover such technologies as "text analysis, content recommendation, speech modeling, and voice recognition."/33Since the For You feed and algorithmic recommendation engine is considered the key element of TikTok's success, a ban on transferring the technology and processes used to create it could make it more difficult to sell the app or prevent a sale altogether./34Status of Potential Oracle and Walmart Partnership with TikTokIn response to the TikTok Executive Order, two leading bidders emerged as potential buyers of the app: Oracle and a partnership between Microsoft and Walmart. Bids were reported to be in the range of $20 billion to $30 billion./35Twitter and Google were also rumored to be interested in acquiring the app./36On September 13, 2020, Microsoft announced that its bid had been rejected by ByteDance. In its announcement, the company stated, "We would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combating disinformation." One expert, Alex Stamos, Director of the Stanford Internet Observatory, commented that this statement is "an attempt to poison the well against an Oracle deal where they only take over hosting. And [Microsoft] is right to do so."/37On September 14, 2020, Oracle announced that it had reached an agreement with ByteDance to "serve as [the company's] trusted technology provider" in the United States. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced that he had received the proposal./38From the terminology used, it appears that the deal may involve a partnership rather than a sale, with TikTok using Oracle's cloud hosting services./39 This arrangement would keep the source code of the For You feed and algorithmic recommendation engine in the hands of ByteDance. Secretary Mnuchin said that CFIUS will review the proposal and present President Trump with its opinion.On September 19, 2020, Oracle announced that Walmart would join its bid for TikTok, with the two companies acquiring 20% of a newly formed company, TikTok Global,/40 with the remaining 80% owned by ByteDance. According to announcements made by the companies, 40% of ByteDance is owned by U.S. investors, which is meant to indicate that the new company would be under majority U.S. ownership./41However, this arrangement, along with TikTok keeping the For You recommendation engine algorithm,/42 would not appear to satisfy conditions in President Trump's Executive Orders. In addition to U.S. approval of the proposal being uncertain given its provisions, Chinese approval of the proposal is also uncertain. China's new export regulations appear to forbid transfer of the For You algorithm, but the United States appears to require such a transfer. So, the legal requirements of each country are at odds with each other.On September 23, 2020, TikTok filed for an injunction in federal court to stop a ban on the app that is set to take effect on September 27, 2020.DiscussionSome believe TikTok and other apps developed and owned by Chinese companies pose a serious security risk to the United States because Chinese companies are governed by China's Cybersecurity Law. Others believe that TikTok is caught up in increasing trade tensions between China and the United States./43Threat to SecurityAlthough TikTok forcefully states that it does not share U.S. user data with the Chinese government, many security and privacy advocates are skeptical. For example, in addition to the lawsuit cited above (see "Data Sharing"), the American Civil Liberties Union argues that "Chinese apps in particular have a reputation for grabbing more data than required to provide their services, often sending information to advertising networks ... [they] are frequently far more abusive than others...."/44The Chinese government obtains data about and created by its own citizens, for purposes that range from censorship to mass surveillance./45Other countries have also taken action against TikTok on the grounds of security. India banned TikTok and 50 other Chinese apps in June 2020, calling them a "threat to sovereignty and integrity."/46Also in June 2020, the European Union opened an investigation into TikTok to examine possible violations of its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)./47Australia had threatened to ban the app, but on August 4, 2020, the country's Prime Minister indicated that TikTok would not be banned; however, he warned Australians against the app, saying it "connects right back to China."/48Japan, Turkey, and Pakistan have also taken various measures to protect their countries' users from possibly security risks./49Technology Trade ProtectionismOther observers argue that TikTok is caught in "the crosshairs of a global technology battle,"/50 and that a unilateral U.S. ban on any app may be comparable to China's "Great Firewall."/51One way to potentially understand U.S. and Chinese government actions in this dispute may be through the concept of techno-nationalism,/52 which refers to a country's refusal or reluctance to import other countries' advanced technology, as well as to export, or to allow other nations to benefit from, its own advanced technology. Within this framework, technology is considered a central pillar of a country's wellbeing:Techno-nationalism ... links technological innovation and capabilities directly to a nation's national security, economic prosperity, and social stability.... [It] seeks to attain competitive advantage for its stakeholders, both locally and globally, and leverage these advantages for geopolitical gain./53One policy mechanism that nations use to protect what they view as important or sensitive technologies are export controls, rules which limit to which foreign entities and under what circumstances or conditions specific technologies may be sold or licensed./54For example, in August 2020, the Bureau of Industry and Security at the Department of Commerce announced sanctions that restrict foreign semiconductor companies from selling chips developed or produced using U.S. software or technology to Huawei, another Chinese company, without first obtaining a license to do so./55This restriction has been called a "lethal blow"/56 to the company.Another mechanism is the use of protectionist practices that privilege domestic entities' access to domestic markets. For example, China requires U.S. telecommunications companies to enter into a partnership with a Chinese company to provide services in that country. In June 2020, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations issued a report, "Threats to US Networks: Oversight of Chinese Government Owned Carriers." The report notes that while China has access to the U.S. telecommunications market, U.S. companies do not have that same level of access in China.China does not provide US telecommunications companies reciprocal access to the Chinese market and requires foreign carriers seeking to operate in China to enter into joint ventures with Chinese companies. These joint ventures often require U.S. companies to give their technology, proprietary know-how, and intellectual property to their Chinese partners.Since China was allowed to join the World Trade Organization in 2001, the report notes that "not a single foreign firm has succeeded in establishing a new joint venture" to provide basic telecommunications services in China."Related Congressional ActivityCongress began taking an interest in TikTok as early as October 2019, when Senator Marco Rubio reportedly called for a formal investigation into whether TikTok posed a national security risk./57Later that month, Senators Charles Schumer and Tom Cotton sent a letter/58 to the Acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, expressing their concerns about TikTok and the national security risks they believe it poses. More formally, Congress has scrutinized TikTok in two hearings, and Members have introduced three related bills.HearingsThe Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism has held two hearings on, among other topics, the impact of Chinese smartphone apps on U.S. citizens' privacy:* "How Corporations and Big Tech Leave Our Data Exposed to Criminals, China, and Other Bad Actors" was held on November 5, 2019./59* "Dangerous Partners: Big Tech and Beijing" was held on March 4, 2020./60 TikTok was invited to testify at these hearings, but declined to appear./61LegislationThree bills have been introduced that would prohibit the use of TikTok and WeChat on U.S. government devices:* S. 4452/62 is a bill to prohibit federal employees from downloading or using WeChat on government devices. It was introduced on August 5, 2020, by Senator John Kennedy and referred to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs the same day* S. 3455,/63 the No TikTok on Government Devices Act, was introduced on March 12, 2020, by Senator Josh Hawley. This bill was passed by the Senate on August 6, 2020, and received in the House the following day. (See S.Rept. 116-250./64)* H.R. 6896,/65 also called the No TikTok on Government Devices Act, is the House companion bill to S. 3455. It was introduced on May 15, 2020, by Representative Ken Buck and referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Reform and the House Committee on Administration the same day.* * *ConclusionThe variety of apps available to U.S. users is enormous. Situations similar to the case of TikTok may arise in the future with other apps created by foreign companies. Congress may consider taking one or both of two parallel approaches to address such situations: (1) developing an overarching legal and regulatory framework to protect the security and privacy of U.S. citizens' data and communications, and (2) establishing a uniform, transparent process to assess the risks posed by foreign apps and establish mechanisms to mediate those risks.* * *Footnotes:1 President Donald J.

Congressional Research Service Report: 'Semiconductors: U.S. Industry, Global Competition & Federal Policy'Targeted News ServiceOctober 28, 2020 Wednesday 8:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 5644 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Congressional Research Service issued the following report (No. R46581) entitled "Semiconductors: U.S. Industry, Global Competition, and Federal Policy". Here are excerpts of the report issued on Oct. 26 and co-authored by Michaela D. Platzer, specialist in industrial organization and business, John F. Sargent Jr., specialist in science and technology policy and Karen M. Sutter, specialist in Asian Trade and Finance:Semiconductors, tiny electronic devices based primarily on silicon or germanium, enable nearly all industrial activities, including systems that under gird U.S. technological competitiveness and national security. Many policymakers see U.S. strength in semiconductor technology and fabrication as vital to U.S. economic and national security interests. The U.S. semiconductor industry dominates many parts of the semiconductor supply chain, such as chip design.Semiconductors are also a top U.S. export. Semiconductor design and manufacturing is a global enterprise with materials, design, fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging operating across national borders. Six U.S.-headquartered or foreign-owned semiconductor companies currently operate 20 fabrication facilities, or fabs, in the United States. In 2019, U.S.-based semiconductor manufacturing directly employed 184,600 workers at an average wage of $166,400.Some U.S.-headquartered semiconductor firms that design and manufacture in the United States also have built fabrication facilities overseas. Similarly, U.S.-headquartered design firms that do not own or operate their own fabrication facilities contract with foreign firms located overseas to manufacture their designs. Much of this overseas capacity is in Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan, and increasingly in China. Some Members of Congress and other policymakers are concerned that only a small share of the world's most advanced semiconductor fabrication production capacity is in the United States. Other have become increasingly concerned about the concentration of production in East Asia and related vulnerability of semiconductor supply chains in the event of a trade dispute or military conflict and other risks such as product tampering and intellectual property theft.Some Members of Congress and other U.S. policymakers have expressed concerns about the economic and military implications of a loss of U.S. leadership in semiconductors. China's state-led efforts to develop an indigenous vertically integrated semiconductor industry are unprecedented in scope and scale. Many policymakers are concerned that these efforts, if successful, could significantly shift global semiconductor production and related design and research capabilities to China, undermining U.S. and other foreign firms' leading positions. Although China's current share of the global industry is still relatively small and its companies produce mostly low-end chips, China's industrial policies aim to establish global dominance in semiconductor design and production by 2030. Moreover, Chinese semiconductor competencies could support a range of technology advancements, including military applications. Another issue for policymakers is how to address competing interests: China is an important market for U.S. semiconductor firms but U.S. and foreign industry are helping to advance China's capabilities. China's government outlays (an estimated $150 billion to date) and its role as a central production point for global consumer electronics are generating strong incentives and pressures on U.S. and foreign firms to focus on China. The Chinese government views access to foreign capabilities in the near term as a key pathway to accelerate China's indigenous development. Also of concern to many are China's state-led efforts to acquire companies and access semiconductor technology through both licit and illicit means; targeted intellectual property (IP) theft; and technology transfer pressures.Issues before Congress include the appropriate role of government in assisting U.S. industry; how best to focus federal financial assistance; the amount of funding each proposed activity would need to accomplish its goals for sustaining U.S. semiconductor competitiveness; how to coordinate and integrate federal activities internally and with initiatives of the U.S. semiconductor and related industries; and how to address China's ambitious industrial plans, trade practices of concern, and the role of U.S. firms in China's emerging semiconductor market. Legislation has been introduced in the 116th Congress to increase federal funding for semiconductor research and development efforts; collaboration between government, industry, and academic partners; and tax credits, grants, and other incentives to spur U.S. production. Two bills under consideration are the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) for America Act (S. 3933/H.R. 7178) and the American Foundries Act (AFA) of 2020 (S. 4130). Some of the provisions of these acts have been included in other bills.* * *Contents:Introduction ... 1Semiconductor Industry Basics ... 2* Semiconductor History and Technological Challenges ... 4- Wafer Size ... 5- Feature Size ... 6The Global Semiconductor Industry ... 6Semiconductor Market Segments ... 8Global Semiconductor Production ... 9* Materials Used for Wafer Manufacturing ... 10* Design; Fabrication; and Assembly, Testing, and Packaging ... 11- Design ... 12- Fabrication: Facilities (Foundries) ... 14- Fabrication: Equipment and Other Suppliers ... 15- Assembly, Testing, and Packaging ... 17* Key Parts of the Global Semiconductor Supply Chain ... 17* Global Semiconductor Fabrication Capacity ... 18The U.S. Semiconductor Manufacturing Industry ... 18* Industry R&D Spending ... 19* Semiconductor Manufacturing Jobs ... 19* Semiconductor Production in the United States ... 20The Global Semiconductor Landscape ... 23* East Asia ... 24* China ... 26- U.S. Controls on Semiconductors ... 31* ... 34The Federal Role in Semiconductors ... 35* Current Federal R&D Efforts to Develop Potential Technology Alternatives and Supplements to Semiconductors ... 36National Security Concerns ... 39* DOD Trusted Foundry Program ... 40Current Semiconductor-Related Legislation ... 43Concluding Observations ... 44Figures:Figure 1.

They are fundamental to nearly all modern industrial and national security activities, and they are essential building blocks of other emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, 5G communications, and quantum computing. For more than six decades, consistent growth in semiconductor capabilities and performance and concurrent cost reductions have boosted U.S. economic output and productivity and enabled new products, services, and industries.Since the immediate post-World War II era, the United States has been a global leader in the research, development, design, and manufacture of semiconductors. The United States remains a leader in semiconductor research and development (R&D), chip design, and some aspects of semiconductor manufacturing, but a complex mix of both U.S. and foreign companies makes up the semiconductor supply chain, including fabrication facilities, or fabs. Nevertheless, in 2019, the United States accounted for 11% of global semiconductor fabrication capacity, down from 13% in 2015, continuing a long-term decline from around 40% in 1990./1Many policymakers see the competitiveness of the U.S. semiconductor industry, including domestic production of semiconductors and the retention of manufacturing knowledge, human expertise, and hands-on experience, as vital to U.S. economic and national security interests./2Several factors contribute to congressional concerns about the competitiveness of the U.S. semiconductor industry:* Sustaining the ability of the industry to continually improve semiconductor performance while decreasing cost through technological innovation. Because semiconductors are integral components in almost all industrial activity and fundamental to several emerging technologies, their performance and price affect multiple sectors and the broader U.S. economy.* Retaining and growing high-skilled and high-paying semiconductor industry jobs in the United States. Semiconductor manufacturing jobs in the United States pay twice that of the average U.S. manufacturing job.* The movement of many U.S. firms toward a "fabless" business model. In this model, fabless semiconductor and related firms focus on R&D and design capabilities, while contracting with outside, mostly foreign, fabrication companies./3 This fabless trend has contributed to a concentration of global chip production among a handful of firms operating fabs in East Asia.* U.S. reliance on global supply chains and production concentrated in East Asia and vulnerability to disruption or denial due to trade disputes or military conflict. Manufacturing disruptions during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have exacerbated this concern. Successive presidential administrations and many in Congress have asserted the need to retain and expand advanced domestic semiconductor fabrication plants.* China's emerging strength in semiconductors supported through a state-led effort to establish itself as a global leader across the supply chain by 2030. Although China's wafer fabrication is at least a generation behind the global industry in technology, it appears to be catching up through foreign technology acquisition, collaboration, and transfer. This includes the use of joint ventures, licensing agreements, U.S.-led open source technology platforms for chip design, as well as the hiring of foreign talent and the purchase of U.S. equipment and software tools.* Assuring access to secure semiconductors for military systems. Through its Trusted Foundry program, the Department of Defense (DOD) has, for over a decade, relied on a single U.S.-based foundry to supply secure, leading-edge semiconductors. Concerns about the sustainability and adequacy of this approach has generated interest in alternatives, including access to a broader range of commercial, state-of-the-art design and fabrication capabilities.Although some countries, including the United States, support their domestic semiconductor industry, the scope and scale of China's state-led efforts are unprecedented. China's approach has the potential to shift global semiconductor production and related design and research capabilities to China, a development that could affect the competitiveness of U.S. firms. China's efforts are also of concern to many policymakers because they undermine global rules (e.g., state financing of industry and acquisitions, forced technology transfer, and intellectual property theft). While some aspects of the China semiconductor challenge are unique, the U.S. response to the challenge posed by the Japanese government and its semiconductor industry in the 1980s offers context. For a discussion of the federal policies and investments at that time, including a multiyear, $1.7 billion federal investment in SEMATECH, an industry consortium of U.S. semiconductor firms, see Appendix A.This report discusses the technical challenges the semiconductor industry faces, domestic and global supply chains, secure and trusted production of semiconductors for national security, and federal policies. This report also discusses current legislation to address these concerns, including federal assistance for the domestic semiconductor industry and funding for research and development (R&D) activities.* * *Semiconductor Industry BasicsA semiconductor (also known simply as an integrated circuit, a microelectronic chip, or a computer chip) is a tiny electronic device (generally smaller than a postage stamp) composed of billions of components that store, move, and process data./4All of these functions are made possible by the unique properties of semiconducting materials, such as silicon and germanium, which allow for the precise control of the flow of electrical current. Semiconductors are used for many purposes in many types of products--for example, to run software applications and to temporarily store documents. Semiconductors provide data storage and communication capabilities of countless other products, including mobile phones, gaming systems, aircraft avionics, industrial machinery, and military equipment and weapons. Many products with roots in mechanical systems--such as manufacturing equipment--heavily depend on chip-based electronics. Modern automobiles illustrate the ubiquitous role of semiconductors in devices that were once only mechanical and chemical in function. According to one analysis, some hybrid electric automobiles may now contain as many as 3,500 semiconductors./5Semiconductor chips are fundamental to emerging technological applications such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, 5G, the Internet-of-Things (IoT), and large-scale data processing and analytics and supercomputing./6(See Figure 1.)Figure 1. Semiconductors: An Enabling TechnologyFigure omitted.Semiconductor History and Technological ChallengesThe federal government played a central role in the development of semiconductors and has engaged in efforts to bolster the competitiveness of the U.S. semiconductor industry and to address unfair trade practices. Early computers (in the 1940s and 1950s) relied on thousands of vacuum tubes, crystal diodes, relays, resistors, and capacitors to perform simple calculations.* * *Key Semiconductor Dimensions: Feature Size and Wafer SizeThis report refers frequently to two key dimensions related to semiconductors. One, feature size, relates to the performance of a semiconductor (generally the smaller the feature, the greater the chip performance) and the other, wafer size, which relates to the efficiency of semiconductor fabrication (in general, the larger the wafer, the lower the production cost per wafer). Feature size describes the size of the transistor gate length as measured in billionths of a meter, or nanometers (nm). Feature size is often referred to as the semiconductor technology node, which is used to identify the technology generation of a chip. The extraordinary advances in chip processing power have resulted primarily from continued reductions in the size of the features that can be printed on a chip. Generally, the smaller the feature size, the more powerful the chip, as more transistors can be placed on an area of the same size. This also results in increased processing power per dollar. Many semiconductors manufactured in 2019 were produced at the 14nm and 10nm nodes. Some manufacturers are producing at 7nm and 5nm nodes, with efforts to manufacture at 2nm and 1nm. Wafer size refers to the diameter of a wafer measured in millimeters (mm). Wafers used in semiconductor fabrication are usually made from thin slices of pure silicon, which serve as the substrate on which semiconductors are manufactured through microfabrication processing steps, such as doping, etching, thin-film deposition, and photolithography. The diameter of a wafer determines its surface area, which in turn determines how many chips can be made on it. A larger wafer diameter allows more amortization of fixed costs, resulting in a lower cost per chip. The performance of a semiconductor is independent of wafer size. Since 2002, the largest wafers in full production have been 300 millimeters in diameter.* * *The federal government, academia, and U.S. industry undertook efforts to reduce and simplify the number of these devices. Military applications played a significant role in the research that led to the development of semiconductor technology. The invention of the transistor, a simple semiconductor device capable of regulating the flow of electricity, was followed by the development of the integrated circuit (IC) in 1958. ICs allowed thousands of resistors, capacitors, inductors, and transistors to be "printed" and connected on a single piece of semiconductor material, so that they functioned as a single integrated device. In addition to funding academic and industrial research, the federal government played a central role in the commercialization of the technology through purchases of semiconductors for a variety of military, space, and civilian applications. The semiconductor industry has a rapid internal product development cycle, first described by the former CEO and cofounder of Intel Corporation, Gordon Moore, in 1965./7Moore's Law, which is actually an observation about the pace of development and reduction in chip cost, has held true for decades. It states that the number of transistors that can be cost effectively included on a dense integrated circuit will double about every 18 months to two years, making semiconductors smaller, faster, and cheaper./8This observation has held true for decades. The effects of Moore's Law are evident in short product life-cycles, requiring semiconductor manufacturers to maintain high levels of research and investment spending. The increased power and decreased cost of semiconductors predicted by Moore's Law has created and revolutionized entire industries; a 2015 study estimated that advanced semiconductors played a critical role in enabling innovations that generated at least $3 trillion in incremental gross domestic product over the previous two decades./9Semiconductor factories, also referred to as fabs or foundries, are often characterized by the size of the wafer that chips are printed on and the size of the transistor gate length printed on each chip (see box). Only a small number of firms have the capital to produce the most advanced semiconductors with reduced feature size, as the fabrication of each new generation of semiconductors requires more costly equipment and capital-intensive processes./10Leading-edge semiconductor manufacturers have to make concurrent R&D investments in development and support of multiple generations of chip technology.Wafer SizeSemiconductor production lines primarily use 300-millimeter (mm) diameter wafers, also referred to as a 12-inch line (see Figure 2). In contrast, production lines built in the 1980s and 1990s used 6- and 8-inch (also referred to as 200mm diameter) wafers, and some older production lines still use 4-inch diameter wafers. As wafer diameter increases, more chips can be made from a single wafer, allowing the fixed costs of processing a wafer to be spread over a larger number of chips, thereby improving production efficiency and lowering the unit cost of the chips./11A 300mm wafer can yield more than 2,400 ICs, compared to the 1,000 ICs that can be made from a 200mm wafer./12Figure 2. Evolution of Silicon Wafer SizeFigure omitted.Each reduction in feature size is considered a move to a new generation of manufacturing technology. Some features of chips are now under 10nm,/13 a few chip producers have reached 5nm./14Some companies have announced plans to move to even smaller nodes.Most semiconductors are made using 300mm wafers. Efforts to develop 450mm wafers have proven unsuccessful so far. The impetus for moving to larger wafers is the potential for decreased costs resulting from the production of more chips from a single wafer over the same time period.Delays in an industry shift to 450mm appear to be attributable to several factors: the challenge of getting equipment manufacturers, chip fabricators, and other elements of the supply chain to move forward together in such a shift; the potentially higher cost of new fabrication facilities and manufacturing equipment; and the industries' current investments (i.e., sunk costs) in existing facilities. Another factor in the decision to move to 450mm is the complexity of timing to align best with broader market conditions. One high-profile industry consortium formed in 2011 to develop 450mm wafer production--the Global 450 Consortium, whose founders included Intel, Samsung, GlobalFoundries, TSMC, IBM, and the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering at the State University of New York Polytechnic Institute--disbanded in 2017./15Feature SizeThe most advanced chips today may have more than a trillion transistors. This miniaturization has led to feature sizes so small that performance can be impeded by electrons jumping out of their barriers (known as "leakage current") due to a phenomenon known as quantum tunneling.Reducing leakage current to allow even tighter packing of transistors is a focus of semiconductor research./16* * *Content omitted.* * *Current Semiconductor-Related LegislationThe Trump Administration and Congress have sought to address concerns about U.S. semiconductor manufacturing competitiveness and the challenges posed by China through trade and investment measures.In the past, congressional efforts related to semiconductors have largely focused on R&D. Two bills that Congress is currently considering would offer various incentives, including grants and tax credits, to induce investment in U.S.-based semiconductor manufacturing equipment and fabrication facilities, as well as authorizing funds for R&D activities.The Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) for America Act (S. 3933/H.R. 7178) would, among other things: establish an investment tax credit for U.S.-based semiconductor manufacturing equipment and manufacturing facilities; authorize more than $15 billion for semiconductor R&D, workforce training, and related activities; authorize matching funds for state and local semiconductor programs; authorize funding to bolster DOD assured access efforts; and direct the Department of Commerce to assess the capabilities of the U.S. industrial base to support semiconductor design and manufacturing, and U.S. interdependencies with such capabilities in other countries.The American Foundries Act of 2020 (S. 4130) would, among other things: authorize at least $25 billion for semiconductor-related R&D, construction of facilities, and acquisition of equipment and intellectual property; authorize incentives for the creation, expansion, or modernization of microelectronics manufacturing or advanced R&D facilities to meet the needs of the DOD and intelligence agencies for assured and secure microelectronics; and require the development of a plan to coordinate with foreign government partners on establishing common microelectronics export control and foreign direct investment screening measures to align with national and multilateral security priorities.Additional details on the provisions in these acts are provided in Appendix C. The semiconductor industry's trade group, SIA, has endorsed both bills./220Others have raised questions about the high level of federal support for a single industry, arguing against establishing an industrial policy for semiconductors or any other industry./221A number of provisions in the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America Act and the American Foundries Act of 2020 have been incorporated into the House and Senate versions of the FY2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).The House version of the NDAA (H.R. 6395) would, among other things: authorize a semiconductor grant program to support construction, expansion, and modernization of semiconductor fabrication, assembly, testing, packaging, and advanced R&D facilities in the United States, providing up to $3 billion per grant; direct DOD to lead a multi-agency effort to incentivize the formation of a consortium of U.S. companies to ensure DOD and intelligence agencies have access to secure microelectronics; require an assessment of the capabilities of the U.S. industrial base to support semiconductor design and manufacturing, and U.S. interdependencies with such capabilities in other countries; establish and authorize funding for a Multilateral Semiconductor Security Fund to build safe and secure semiconductor supply chains; require the establishment of a Manufacturing USA institute focused on semiconductor manufacturing R&D; establish and authorize $914 million in FY2021 for a semiconductor technology center to conduct research and prototyping of advanced semiconductor technology; and authorize an additional $350 million for semiconductor-related R&D in FY2021. H.R. 6395 was passed by the House on July 21, 2020.The Senate version of the FY2021 NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (S. 4049), includes provisions similar to those of H.R. 6395 described above, though it does not include the provision that would direct DOD to incentivize the creation of a consortium to ensure DOD and intelligence agencies have access to secure microelectronics. S. 4049 would also require DOD to certify that covered printed circuit boards are manufactured and assembled in the United States or certain nations for all future DOD contracts.In addition, the Health, Economic Assistance, Liability Protection and Schools (HEALS) Act incorporates many of the provisions in S. 3933 and H.R. 7178.* * *Concluding ObservationsSome policymakers assert that continued U.S. leadership in semiconductor technology, design, and fabrication is important to the U.S. economy and national security. In addition, others believe that these functions must not be interrupted by trade disputes or military conflict. In this regard, Congress may opt to consider how best to maintain continued U.S. semiconductor competitiveness, address ongoing discriminatory trade barriers and practices of concern, and ensure access to protected and secure sources of certain chips. The CHIPS for America Act and the American Foundries Act (AFA) of 2020 present approaches to addressing these concerns.One key policy question is: What is the appropriate role for the federal government in seeking to ensure the U.S. position in semiconductors (or other industries)? For many years, Congress has debated the utility and fairness of policies that single out a technology, company, or industry for targeted government assistance. Advocates of such policies generally justify federal action based on the presumed benefits of attaining or retaining U.S. technology leadership, job creation, and economic growth, and furthering other policy objectives (e.g., fostering domestic manufacturing, furthering energy independence, or reducing carbon emission reductions). Opponents often characterize such policies as "industrial policy," "picking winners and losers," or "corporate welfare," arguing that the federal government should not attempt to supplant market forces and decisions, and that such attempts are in any case unlikely to be effective; that government policies should be agnostic with respect to technology, company, and industry, not favoring one over another; that federal funding should not subsidize profitable companies; and that funding associated with such policies may be used to provide political rewards for favored constituents.These criticisms have been of less concern in the context of the federal government's role in fostering technologies, products, and industries deemed central to U.S. national security. These defense-focused efforts have been less controversial, in part, because national defense is a constitutionally mandated function of the federal government and because, in the absence of government action, the technologies, products, and industries needed for national security would not exist.The fact that semiconductor technologies and chip production are central to both economic and national security complicates the debate about the federal role in ensuring U.S. leadership and government access and assurance of chip fabrication and domestic availability. The Chinese government's announced plans to build independent capabilities in all parts of the semiconductor supply chain raise additional considerations for U.S. policymakers.The programs and policies included in the CHIPS for America Act and the American Foundries Act of 2020 illustrate a variety of mechanisms through which the federal government could actively promote innovation by U.S.-based semiconductor companies and encourage domestic production. These mechanisms include:* investments in R&D, including through the use of public-private partnerships;* inducements, such as grants and tax benefits for establishing domestic production capacity for the fabrication of semiconductors, including semiconductor equipment and advanced assembly, testing, and packaging;* support for investments in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and skills training related to semiconductor design and fabrication;* investments in the development of manufacturing machinery;* investments in infrastructure (e.g., measurement technologies, standards, materials characterization) to support the semiconductor industry;* efforts to coordinate and integrate federal activities; and* efforts to assess the global semiconductor competitive environment and related federal policies.The level of funding needed for each of these activities to accomplish its goals raises a set of relevant questions. For example: How large would the tax benefits need to be to induce semiconductor manufacturers to build future plants in the United States? How much would the federal government need to invest in R&D and related activities to ensure U.S. semiconductor technology leadership? How long would these incentives and investments need to be sustained?How much would the federal government need to invest in education and training to ensure an adequate workforce for expanded domestic semiconductor design, fabrication, and assembly, testing, and packaging? How much would it cost to ensure a domestic production source for some or all national security applications? Would Congress provide additional funding to cover the increased costs or would it require DOD to make trade-offs within its current budget?Another set of questions relates to how other nations would respond to such efforts by the United States: Should federal policies to ensure continued U.S. access to semiconductors include a strategy that allows for reliance on allied nations as part of the semiconductor supply chain?Should U.S. investments in semiconductor research or manufacturing be structured as part of a larger effort with allies and like-minded countries to incentivize R&D and supply chains and to counter China's state-led policies? What are the prospects to counter China's state-led policies through changes to global trade rules?Congress may seek to assess the effectiveness of current U.S. authorities and global rules and approaches in addressing Chinese government direction, control, and subsidization of Chinese semiconductor activities and forcing foreign technology transfer. Such an assessment could evaluate whether new authorities and efforts are needed, including with regard to trade concerns such as state control of companies, subsidies, technology transfer, and other potential discriminatory practices.Congress may want to evaluate U.S.-China technology ties that contribute to the development of China's indigenous semiconductor industry. These areas include China's investment in U.S. technology firms with niche and emerging capabilities; use of greenfield operations in the United States; imports of U.S. semiconductor equipment, tools, and software; licensing of U.S. technology; partnerships and joint ventures with U.S. firms; access to overseas foundries; hiring of foreign talent; and participation in open source technology platforms. Congress may also seek to address the full life-cycle of semiconductor capabilities developed with the support of U.S. government R&D investments in an effort to mitigate potential China-related risks. In particular, Congress might look for ways to further protect the integrity and use rights of commercial capabilities developed with the support of U.S. government investments. These issues may loom larger if, as some Members have proposed, there is a substantial increase in federal support for development of semiconductor technologies intended for exploitation by the private sector.Congress may hold hearings and seek studies and analysis on these topics as it moves forward in its consideration of the legislation before it.* * *REPORT, TABLES, FIGURES and FOOTNOTES: https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46581Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7279789 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: October 28, 2020End of Document

Cheney: China Task Force Report Recognizes Choice Between Freedom & CCP TotalitarianismTargeted News ServiceOctober 1, 2020 Thursday 8:01 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1668 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyoming, issued the following news release:This morning, Wyoming Congresswoman and House GOP Conference Chair Liz Cheney (R-WY) delivered remarks at a press conference to unveil the final China Task Force report.The House Republican China Task Force Report addresses key issues the nation must confront in order to defend against the threat posed to our freedom and security by the Chinese Government. The final report, which includes more than 400 recommendations, highlights the importance of ongoing increased funding for the U.S. Department of Defense, including for a modernized nuclear triad, sea and air power, cutting edge capabilities in space, cyberspace, and other emerging technologies, and acquisitions and military construction projects necessary to deter the CCP's malign behavior on the world stage. The full report can be found here https://gop-foreignaffairs.house.gov/blog/china-task-force-report/ and an executive summary can be found here https://mcusercontent.com/301a28247b80ab82279e92afb/files/af9a95d7-bff6-41a8-bd8b-4a30c330d247/China_Task_Force_Executive_Summary.01.pdf.Watch the video of Rep. Cheney's remarks here https://youtu.be/AzWOoJza9Tw, and see the transcript below:REP. LIZ CHENEY: Thank you very much, Whip Scalise. I want to join in thanking our leader, Kevin McCarthy, for putting this task force together and the leader of the task force Chairman McCaul in leading us, the staff who helped us make sure that in such a timely fashion we were able to put together a report that touches on every aspect of the threat this nation faces with respect to China. At a moment where we are facing, I think, what is a generational threat, it is too bad that the Democrats refused to join us on this report. As the Leader said, two-thirds of the recommendations in here are bipartisan, and in order for us to defeat the threat from China, we've got to work in a bipartisan fashion. So, we call on Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats once again to stop putting their personal political interests ahead of the interests of the security of this country and join us in helping to put in place some of these recommendations.I want to say just a few words specifically about the defense portion of this report. China is rapidly developing a military force that is capable of winning regional conflicts and they're expanding their military footprint globally. The government of China and the Chinese Communist Party have gone to school on the United States - they've looked at our capabilities, they've looked at the particular assets that we have that enable us to project our power, that enable us to make sure that we maintain our military supremacy and they have developed capabilities to counter those. In particular, this report points out the importance of sufficient continued funding for our Defense Department. We have heard repeatedly from the military leadership and the civilian leadership of the Department over the course of many years that we must have three to five percent annual real growth increases in the defense budget in order to maintain our supremacy, and that was pre-COVID. It's crucially important that we continue that resource of funding.We must modernize our nuclear triad. It's crucial to deterring the Chinese Communist Party and we must also develop and field conventional capabilities that are critical to countering the Chinese Communist Party in the Indo-Pacific in particular. This includes ground launched cruise and ballistic missiles. The People's Republic of China is now the leading theater range missile power with both dual and conventional nuclear delivery capabilities - we must counter that. We must modernize our sea and air power, we must procure long range precision fires and strategic fires, we have to build contested logistics capabilities, and we've got to develop new operational concepts - joint operational concepts that allow us to counter the threat, that allow us to truly do what's necessary to defend this country. Congress must fund military construction, prepositioning, strategic airlift, tanker support, and surge capacity. And we must counter the Chinese Communist Party globally as it seeks to establish more robust logistics and basing infrastructure around the world as it seeks to project its own military power.In conclusion, it is very important for everyone to note that we are in the midst of a battle between freedom and totalitarianism. The question we all face is whether the United States and our allies will set the rules of the road into the future or whether the Chinese Communist Party and that authoritarian, totalitarian regime will set the rules of the road. The proposals that we have offered in this report recognize the gravity and the significance of this moment that we face and if followed these proposals will help ensure that freedom and the U.S.-led global order prevail.BACKGROUND:In May, Rep. Cheney was named a member of the House GOP Leader's China Task Force which was originally a bipartisan effort; however Democratic leaders backed out the day before it was supposed to launch, with Speaker Pelosi later saying Republicans calling attention to China was a "diversion."The CTF Report is broken down into six chapters: Ideological Competition; Supply Chain; National Security; Technology; Energy and Economics; and Competitiveness. In total, the CTF engaged with more than 130 leaders to provide insights and solutions for its comprehensive action plan.Additionally, this past June, Rep. Cheney led a letter to President Trump, signed by 40 of her House colleagues, highlighting the need for the United States to contain the CCP's malign nuclear ambitions.In February, Rep. Cheney joined Congressman Michael McCaul (R-TX), the lead Republican of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, to introduce a resolution denouncing the United Kingdom's decision to allow Huawei to build part of their 5G networks. The United Kingdom later reversed their decision and announced in July that it would ban Huawei from its 5G network, requiring all operators to dispose of Huawei equipment by 2027.Additionally, this past January, Rep. Cheney joined Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN) in introducing a bill that would bar the U.S. from sharing intelligence with any country that allows Huawei into its 5G networks.* * *June 15, 2020To: The Honorable Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20500Dear President Trump,We are writing to express our strong support for your commitment to ensuring China is included in meaningful U.S. arms control efforts. The Chinese Communist Party is an irresponsible predatory actor that has spent many years working against America's interests.Even amid the global coronavirus crisis--which the CCP created with its lies and deception--the Chinese regime has put its aggressive nuclear ambitions on full displayJust recently, a CCP state media editorial said that China should expand its nuclear arsenal to 1,000 warheads, which according to some estimates would mean tripling the regime's stockpile. The CCP was careful to note China's specific need for "at least 100" DF-41 intercontinental ballistic missiles that can reach the United States. This rhetoric underscores the need to cap China's arsenal at existing levels--at a maximum--through effective arms control.The CCP's aggressiveness is nothing new. In April, the State Department raised concerns that China may not be conforming with the "zero-yield" standard under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Last May, Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Robert Ashley warned that China will likely at least double the size of its nuclear stockpile over the next decade. China, he said, is "implementing the most rapid expansion and diversification of its nuclear arsenal" in its history.Powered by the state-mandated fusion of its defense and civilian sectors, China, after many years of proclaiming its minimum nuclear deterrent, has developed its own nuclear triad to directly rival America. It continues to modernize its nuclear arsenal. It is also developing capabilities to evade U.S. missile defenses, including maneuverable reentry vehicles and hypersonic glide vehicles, and is topping some of its missiles with multiple independently targetable warheads. These advances, among others, do not signal a policy of restraint or lean force structure.The United States must contain China's malign nuclear and conventional military ambitions. That includes fully funding efforts to increase U.S. readiness and lethality in the IndoPacific, continuing to develop advanced missile and missile defense capabilities, and modernizing all three legs of our nuclear triad. But, as you have rightfully said, Mr. President, it also means reining in China through effective arms control.Your directive to bring China to the table has only grown in urgency since the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, a crisis for which the U.S. and its allies must hold China accountable.We must compel the CCP to be transparent about both this devastating virus and its nuclear capabilities and ambitions. As the Chinese regime continues to engage in pernicious behavior in the Indo-Pacific and around the world, we reiterate our support for your efforts to protect freedom and stability through meaningful arms control.See signatories here https://mcusercontent.com/301a28247b80ab82279e92afb/files/aea1deb9-f64d-4abd-ba95-873c36712a12/Cheney_China_Letter_6.15.pdf?utm_source=House+GOP+Media+List&utm_campaign=5b9e128b26-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_01_03_06_14_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_38d91d4596-5b9e128b26-&utm_source=Wyoming+Press+List&utm_campaign=c7f9c9703b-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_01_03_06_14_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_3c0499666b-c7f9c9703b-&utm_source=House+GOP+Media+List&utm_campaign=aeab3ffbe5-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_01_03_06_14_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_38d91d4596-aeab3ffbe5-Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7252311 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: October 1, 2020End of Document

Proposed ban on Chinese-based TikTok and WeChat upends international student life, all student entertainmentCalvin College Chimes: Calvin CollegeOctober 4, 2020 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 928 wordsByline: Sarah GibesBodyWeChat, the most popular social media platform in China and among Chinese citizens abroad, and TikTok, a popular social media platform globally, have become points of contention in the past few months.According to an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on August 6th, these Chinese-owned applications "[threaten] to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information." The order would have banned downloads and updates of both apps as of Sept. 20.However, a judge blocked the ban of WeChat on Sept. 19 with an injunction. The Trump administration has since appealed this preliminary injunction and will consider it at an Oct. 15 hearing. Likewise, another judge blocked the ban of TikTok on Sept. 27, and the Trump administration has granted preliminary approval for Oracle and Walmart, both American companies, to buy all American operationsZach Priebe, a junior biology major who uses TikTok, noted that the app is useful but not necessary to his life. "It's a good way to kill time," Priebe said. "If they think we need to take it away, it's not like I won't live without it. It's not like I'm going to be sad or something when it's gone." Priebe noted that removing the platform has a greater effect on people who make a living by using the platform. He noted, however, that "there are other ways of making a living," such as by moving content to a different platform. In contrast to TikTok, which is one of many video-based social media platforms, WeChat is the primary social media platform by which Chinese citizens communicate and do business with each other."Chinese people use WeChat for almost everything," biology professor Anding Shen said. "We never use cash or credit cards [in China] anymore. When you go to the grocery store, you just scan your phone."Shen noted that cultural differences between the United States and China affect how individuals think about social media, particularly cultural perceptions of privacy. "In the United States and Europe, people highly value privacy," Shen said. "In Chinese culture, privacy is perceived differently. In China, if you want to keep something private, people ask, 'What are you hiding?'" In addition, people are much more willing to talk about topics Americans perceive as private, such as income and health problems. Shen emphasized that Chinese users use WeChat wisely. "Of course people think twice before posting anything. And there are ways around the censors, which primarily utilize text readers. The text readers are not very good at detecting information in pictures or in recorded messages. So you can send information in an image or a recorded message and it's much more difficult for the censor to recognize it." Shen noted that blocking apps like WeChat and TikTok in retaliation to the Chinese government's ban of US social media companies, such as Facebook, Google, and WhatsApp, shows that the US is willing to sink to the same levels of China. "The Chinese government often works with a very heavy-handed, top-down structure. No one expected the United States to work in the same way," Shen said. In addition, banning an application isn't the most effective way to guard content. "There are always still ways to access particular platforms or content, such as by downloading the software from a server in a different country," Shen explained. Similarly, individuals can still access WeChat through software that provides underground access to the app. Although the ban currently only prevents users from downloading WeChat and Tiktok, as well as updating the current version, the political tension between the United States and China have significant ramifications for the everyday life of international students. For example, the number of flights between the United States and China has been drastically reduced since the Covid-19 pandemic. The price of existing flights has also increased dramatically, often exceeding $10,000.In addition to increasing flight costs, the administration has also proposed new student visa regulations. Current visa rules determine students' visa status on whether they are enrolled full-time at an American university. Under the proposed regulations, students' visa status would be approved for either a two or four year period, regardless of whether they complete their degrees in the allotted amount of time. "If you don't finish in time, you can file for an extension," Shen said. "But there is currently a six-month waiting period for extending student visas, and there's no guarantee that the extension will be granted." "[The administration] has just made life so difficult for the Chinese students," Shen said. "Students want to come here to study. They provide important revenue for US universities and technical skills for the workforce. It's really not fair to these students to make everything so challenging when it's not their fault."International student Moses Yang, a junior mechanical engineering major, uses both WeChat and Tiktok. He finds that the proposed WeChat ban is particularly difficult. "Students use WeChat to talk to their family and friends back in China. It's just so convenient," he emphasized. "Why are they trying to ban it now, with Covid and the election coming?"Although he disagrees with the ban, he partially understands the reasons for it. "WeChat is just used by all the Chinese," Yang said. "Tiktok, though, is used by people all over the world. It's a place you can go to relax. It's pretty positive. Without Tiktok, America would just be a sadder place."Load-Date: October 6, 2020End of Document

Trump's first TikTok move: A China quagmire of his own makingPolitico.comSeptember 12, 2020 Saturday 6:09 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1809 wordsHighlight: When the president has faced off with China, he often ends up in a jam. And the solution to the TikTok stalemate isn't clear.BodyPresident Donald Trump has browbeaten his way into yet another expensive and politically loaded standoff with China - this time over an app populated with dancing ferret videos and at-home lip syncs. Trump's order that TikTok's parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, sell off its U.S. operations - initially seen as a potential opportunity for an American company - has turned into a quagmire. China has issued new export restrictions that raise uncomfortable questions about what the American company might have to do to satisfy Beijing. TikTok is suing the Trump administration over the president's order, which claimed the app could potentially funnel Americans' personal data back to the Chinese government. And the U.S. government is apparently exploring alternate ways for TikTok to operate in America without selling off its entire business, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday. Essentially, Trump has backed himself into a corner. His moves against TikTok are part of a broader tough-on-China push he has made a centerpiece of his reelection campaign, an outlet to deflect blame for mishandling the coronavirus. But each time he has chosen to face off with China - over trade, 5G technology or Hong Kong - he has ended up at a critical moment when he has to find his way out of a jam. This time around, Trump's way out isn't clear. If China delays a TikTok sale - or scuttles the deal altogether - Trump will be forced either to relent with Beijing or to ban the viral video app outright from U.S. soil. If Trump blinks, he risks looking like he caved to Beijing weeks before the election. If Trump follows through with his threats, he risks Chinese retaliation against the U.S. business community, not to mention angering millions of TikTok-loving Americans. And a deadline looms - Trump asked for a deal to be completed by the week of Sept. 20, and he said on Thursday that he wouldn't extend the deadline."This is an escalatory move," said Jude Blanchette, a China expert at the foreign policy think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies, referring to China's recent moves. "If China blocks the deal, then that puts the Trump administration in the position of having to actually follow through with the ban it put on place on TikTok."Trump's August announcement of restrictions on the popular video app, downloaded by over a billion people, marked a new phase in the president's anti-China crusade, which has become central to his reelection message. Previously, Trump has focused on placing tariffs on China and sanctioning Chinese tech manufacturers. But the campaign against TikTok shows the Trump administration is also willing to target Chinese social media platforms. Officials have also made pledges to go after WeChat, the uber-popular Chinese messaging and payment app. The pledges have raised concerns in the U.S. business community, with industry leaders saying a crackdown could restrict their business interests in China, the world's second-largest economy. Barring American companies from working with WeChat, for instance, could deprive major firms of access to a critical commercial platform.But administration officials insist the national security threats posed by these platforms are too grave to let them operate in the U.S. economic ecosystem without heavy restrictions. The Trump administration claims companies like TikTok and WeChat are simply a vehicle for Chinese government espionage of Americans - though it has offered no proof of these accusations. On TikTok, specifically, the Trump administration has pointed to the application's ability to "build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage," according to the administration's executive order on TikTok. The company has denied those claims, and the administration has not specifically shown evidence that TikTok improperly used or shared data.A recent report from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, an Australian government-funded think tank, found a history of TikTok and WeChat censoring topics considered sensitive in China - a typical feature for content platforms operating in the country. It also noted the Chinese government has leverage over both companies, given the country's national security laws."TikTok has a documented history of censoring free speech to conform to [Chinese Community Party] propaganda," said a senior administration official. "This administration will not allow the CCP to exploit the private information of U.S. citizens."The Commerce Department has not yet clarified the scope of the administration's orders on TikTok and WeChat, or when potential bans could go into place. And ByteDance is currently negotiating to sell its U.S. TikTok operations with Oracle, and with Microsoft, which is partnering with Walmart on its bid. Microsoft is seen as the top bidder, according to one person familiar with the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The person, however, raised concerns about what China's new export restrictions might mean for a deal. The rule requires companies to get a special license from the Chinese government for the transfer of artificial intelligence technologies, such as algorithms, text analysis and content recommendation - all aspects central to TikTok. So while TikTok could be a moneymaking prize for any winning bidder, there is unease about the potential political headaches that would come with navigating the deal with the Chinese government. ByteDance is currently trying to get a license from the Chinese government for the sale to either Oracle or Microsoft, complicating the timeline for the deal, the person said.If the new requirement scuttles a deal, it could force Trump to follow through with an outright ban on TikTok. A person close to discussions, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the U.S. government will be ready with other options for the president if a deal is not reached by his deadline, without offering specifics. The Wall Street Journal's report said even if there is not a full sale, the U.S. is exploring a potential restructuring of TikTok. If Trump chooses to ban TikTok outright, the process could be delayed by the lawsuit the company has filed."The Trump administration may have overshot the landing here because it thinks leverage over the U.S. markets is so strong it can set the terms for decoupling actions, but China is trying to show they have significant leverage as well," Blanchette said. "Now," he added, "the U.S. and China are facing an unpalatable situation. For China, the humiliation of having a company extorted from their control by the Trump administration. And now with China's involvement, the Trump administration may have to follow through on their course of actions." The Trump administration has invested considerable energy in its tough-on-China campaign as election season ramps up. Since the beginning of the year, the administration has sanctioned some Chinese officials over Beijing's treatment of the Uighur minority group, its militarized building in the South China Sea and its crackdown on pro-democracy efforts in Hong Kong. More recently, Trump has been chiding Beijing over its handling of the coronavirus, which he derides as the "China virus," shuttered a Chinese consulate in Houston and restricted Chinese diplomats in America. The crackdown has caused consternation in the business community. Industry leaders have expressed fears over losing access to China's rapidly growing market and large population, and are still smarting over Trump's trade war with China, during which involved he slapped steep tariffs on numerous products. A U.S.-China Business Council survey found 86 percent of its member companies said bilateral trade tensions have negatively affected business with China.And while TikTok's high-profile American users are young liberals - including the group that requested thousands of tickets to a Trump rally, hoping to troll the campaign and drive down attendance - there are still many conservative users on the platform whom Trump may alienate with a full ban."The gains are all difficult to grasp right now and the loss is really obvious," said Derek Scissors, a China policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "As a result, China might think the president might change his mind, but I don't know how the president would get away with backing down here." Essentially, he said, China has "raised the odds of TikTok in the U.S. just dying." Still, Trump's advisers insist hitting China over trade and national security is a winning issue. "President Trump is the first one to hold China accountable for their cheating on trade, and has also pinpointed them as the source of the coronavirus outbreak which lied about it and put the entire world behind the curve on responding," Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said in a statement. "To this day, Joe Biden doesn't view China as an economic threat. Joe Biden has a China problem and it is a major issue in the campaign."Biden, for his part, has knocked Trump for consistently downplaying China's human rights abuses, referred to Chinese President Xi Jinping as a "thug" and vowed to strengthen alliances so the U.S. can present a united front and counter Beijing.The Trump administration has shown few signs it plans to back down on its efforts to ban TikTok if no American buyer is found. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and trade adviser Peter Navarro both even said the administration plans to crack down on more Chinese companies, though they did not state which might be targeted."It is critical that this country not use apps that are made in China, or that can take our data and go to servers in China. That data will be used to surveil, monitor and track you," Navarro said last week on Fox Business. "That's the policy position underlying why we have gone after TikTok and WeChat, and there will be others because China is basically going out around the world trying to acquire technology and influence."A second senior administration official said the White House is committed to policing any tech platform that can be manipulated to suppress speech and abuse its users."Where we find efforts to harvest and surveil intimate data, and use that to intimidate and coerce people in our country or their relatives back in China, we are going to take step - in some cases aggressive steps like you saw against TikTok and WeChat - to protect freedom of thought as well as freedom of speech in the United States," the official said in a call with reporters Friday. "At the end of the day," the official added, "the data we produce in this day and age is roughly equivalent to our thoughts. So what you have is a modern day crystallization of the thought police that George Orwell wrote about in his novel, '1984.'"Load-Date: September 14, 2020End of Document

CHINA IS LEARNING FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD: FROM WINEMAKING, TO TRADE AGREEMENTS, TO ANTIDUMPINGStates News ServiceSeptember 10, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 2026 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Cato Institute:By Simon Lester and Huan ZhuThere are probably many hotter trade news stories out there right now, but this one intrigued us because it has a number of different elements. It's about how China learned the techniques of a new industry, using a combination of market forces and government intervention; negotiated a liberalizing trade agreement, roughly following the model of the United States and others for such agreements; and then creatively used anti" dumping measures, with techniques it had also learned from others, to limit the competition that resulted. There is not necessarily a grand moral to this story, but a theme underlying it is that China is learning from the rest of the world, in both good and bad ways. There may be a lesson in here about how to nudge China in particular directions, but that's something for another blog post.China Learns to Appreciate WineNeither one of us is a wine aficionado, but we think it's safe to say that China has not traditionally been known for its winemaking prowess or for its love of wine. Even though ancient Chinese started grape cultivation more than 2,000 years ago, grape production in China had been negligible for a long time. It was not until 1892 that the first modern Chinese winery was established, and its operation mainly relied on imported vines from the United States and Europe. The policy of "reform and opening" up," which began in the late 1970s, boosted the Chinese wine industry in several ways: The resulting economic growth led to a rapid increase in grape and wine production; strong western influence introduced wine to more Chinese; and economic development generated more wealth and income that allowed the Chinese people to afford more imports. Furthermore, China's accession to the WTO substantially lowered tariffs on wine, from 65% to 14% for bottled wine. These factors resulted in a significant increase in China's wine imports. Between 2000 and 2011, China's wine imports rose from $4.9 million to $1.3 billion per year.Clearly, China is moving up the learning curve for wine, developing both a taste for drinking it and a knack for producing some unique products. The story of award" winning Chinese wine production starts with a bit of government intervention as well as some private sector consulting. As a 2018 New Yorker article tells us, the center of Chinese winemaking is Ningxia, a province in the northwest that is described as "a poverty" stricken coal region whose dusty scrubland was in danger of desertification." In the 1990s, the Chinese governmentbegan to invest seriously in its infrastructure, irrigating immense tracts of desert between the Yellow River and the Helan Mountains, much as the phoenix had done. A few years ago, local officials received a directive to build a 'wine route' through the region, similar to Bordeaux's Route des Vins. European winegrowers, hired by the government as consultants, had identified Ningxia's continental climate, high altitude, dry air, and sandy, rocky soil as ideal for vineyards.Not exactly a free market approach, but nonetheless, it makes sense for developing countries to think about replicating the commercial successes of more developed countries. If the conditions were suitable for wine production in Ningxia, someone was going to come up with the idea of producing wine there at some point. Entrepreneurs keep their eye out for these sorts of market opportunities.People often accuse China of stealing intellectual property. While cyberhacking into foreign companies' networks to steal their ideas is certainly a problem, the process of winemaking is out there in the public domain. It doesn't seem reasonable to object to China figuring out how others are producing good wine and then doing it themselves. Wine made in China will always have a unique character in the same way that Cabernet Sauvignon from California, Chile, and France have distinguishable characteristics. Trying to learn how to make good varieties of wine through consultation with experts shouldn't be a problem, even for the hawkiest of China hawks.The New Yorker then offers some additional details about the growth of wine consumption and production in China:Growing demand for wine in Chinaimports increased twenty" six thousand per cent in the first eleven years of this centuryhas prompted a surge in domestic production. China is now the seventh" largest producer of wine globally, and has more acreage devoted to vineyards than any other country besides Spain. There are a dozen or so Chinese wine" growing regions, of which Ningxia is the most significant. Ningxia now has around a hundred wineries, spread across a hundred miles, which, in 2016, produced a hundred and twenty million bottles' worth of wine. Most of this comes from large, state" backed enterprises, but the region's reputation is anchored by privately owned boutique operations, which have been accumulating international prizes.So far, the wines produced are mostly Cabernet Sauvignons, Cabernet blends, and Chardonnays. The noted wine critic Jancis Robinson told me that she'd found the best ones to be "fully ripe, satisfying, well" balanced wines that seem to have some potential to age," closer in style to French than Californian wine, something that may reflect the involvement of several French companies in Ningxia. She added, "I've never come across such a determinedly wine" focussed local government," and recalled how, when she visited in 2012, all the most senior officials involved in the wine region's development insisted on meeting her.At this point, Chinese wine production and consumption are certainly scaling up, and may one day rival the large wine producing countries. This expansion is not at the rate of manufactured goods, which China is famous for, but it has been significant nonetheless.Trade Liberalization with AustraliaWhile you may not have heard much about Chinese wine, you almost certainly have heard of Australian wine. The Australians have been making wine for generations and have gotten quite good at exporting it in recent years. In the midst of the Chinese expansion of wine production and consumption, and the Australian export growth, Australia and China signed a free trade agreement, which went into effect in December 2015. Given what you hear about China's trade practices, it may sound odd that China is signing trade liberalizing agreements, but in fact it has an active bilateral trade agreement program, just like the United States and many other countries do.A key feature of these agreements is to lower tariffs on a bilateral basis. As part of the China" Australia FTA, Chinese tariffs on bottled wine went down from 14% in 2015 to zero in 2019.Not surprisingly, then, Australian exports of wine to China began to increase after the FTA was signed. Lower tariffs should lead to lower prices, and this made China a more enticing market for the Australian wine industry, who had noticed the increase in Chinese wine consumption. The price advantage helped Australian wine producers compete against wine producers from other countries. According to the China Alcoholic Drinks Association (CADA), for small bottles of wine (2 liters and less), imports from Australia accounted for 14.31% of China's wine imports in 2015, and this figure almost doubled, to 26.49%, in 2019. With regard to the share of the Chinese market, according to CADA, in 2019 13.36% of small bottles of wine (2 liters and less) consumed in China came from Australia, compared to only 3.66% in 2015.Enter the Dragon's Anti" Dumping/ Countervailing Duty LawsWas there anything "unfair" about the Australian approach to pricing its wine? On the face of things, it seems that the Australian industry was simply benefitting from the lower tariffs, rather than engaging in any anti" competitive or unfair behavior. But if you have read anything about anti" dumping/ countervailing duties from our Cato colleagues over the years, you will realize that these so" called "trade remedy" laws are not really about anti" competitive behavior. They can be used to harass foreign competitors and to get tariffs imposed on these competitors even in the absence of any actual anti" competitive behavior.A couple weeks ago, we blogged about how the Chinese government was using a creative methodology, learned from practices in the United States and other developed countries, to accuse U.S. chemical producers of massive "dumping" of products in the Chinese market. Now, that same methodology is being invoked by Chinese wine producers in a case against their Australian counterparts.In July of this year, the CADA filed a petition for an anti" dumping investigation on Australian wine. It claimed that there is a "particular market condition" in the Australian wine industry, on the basis that both federal and local governments in Australia intervene in and control the wine industry. Such intervention and control includes legislation, industrial plans, and other supportive measures. Laws and industry plans highlighted by the petitioner include the Wine Australia Act 2013, and the 20202025 Strategic Plan and Vision 2050 put forward by Wine Australia, an Australian Government authority that regulates the wine industry. The petitioner also identifies 40 programs that allegedly support the wine industry, including the Wine equalization tax rebate, The Export and Regional Wine Support Package, and Wine Tourism and Cellar Door Grant, to name a few. These supporting measures, according to the petition, have distorted the production, demand/ supply, and price of Australian wine. The Chinese industry claims that such distortions not only led to a surge of Austr a lian wine imports, but also resulted in a shrink ing of the Chinese domestic wine industry's production and revenue . It claims that China's domestic production in 2019 is nearly a third (38.9%) of the production in 2015 , and the revenue of the domestic industry fell 69% during the same period.On this basis, the petitioner estimates a 202.70% dumping margin, which, if confirmed by the Chinese investigating authorities, would lead to a tariff in that amount.The CADA also filed a petition for a countervailing duty investigation on Australian wine on the same day, which requests additional tariffs on the basis of the alleged subsidies received by the Australian industry.In response to these industry petitions, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce has announced that it would launch both anti" dumping and countervailing duty investigations on Australian wine. We will not know the conclusions of the Chinese investigating authorities for another year or so.ConclusionAt some point, if the Chinese wine producers are able to start exporting significant amounts of their production, the Chinese support for this industry could make Chinese wine subject to complaints about "unfair" trade practices of its own. For now, though, the complaints about "unfair" trade are going in the other direction: It is the Chinese producers who are complaining about "unfair" trade by Australian wine producers. Perhaps these Chinese actions are the result of broader conflicts in Australia" China relations, but if so, that fact can't be used to stop the investigations from going forward. When anti" dumping/ countervailing duty laws are on the books, they can be abused in this and many other ways.If the abusive anti" dumping methodologies that Chinese authorities learned from the United States and other countries become a new normal, we may see more and more high anti" dumping rates coming out of China, just like we have seen from the United States, Australia, and others over the years. Australia and China accuse each other of unfair trade; the United States and China accuse each other of unfair trade; these days, everyone is accusing everyone else of unfair trade. If we are going to copy from each other, winemaking seems like a much better target of appropriation. All of these abuses of anti" dumping, far from allowing us to enjoy what other markets have to offer, may just leave a bitter finish instead.Load-Date: September 10, 2020End of Document

Chinese government puts restrictions on TikTok sale ordered by TrumpStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeSeptember 2, 2020 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MARKETS; Pg. 1Length: 535 wordsByline: Jean GarciaBodyIn Washington on Monday, China's new export measures were widely seen as a potential poison pill for the TikTok deal.The sale of TikTok's U.S. operations to a domestic buyer - likely Microsoft or Oracle - has been thrown into disarray after China rewrote its technology export rules to give itself a veto over the process.The new export control requires ByteDance to get approval from the Chinese government before selling TikTok's USA business.Navarro, one of Trump's trade advisers, said the United States had more Chinese-made apps in its sights after TikTok and WeChat. That data will be used to surveil, monitor and track you, ' Navarro told Fox News' Mornings with Maria.State-run news agency Xinhua cited a trade expert over the weekend who said the revisions would cover a sale of TikTok.The new regulations could make it more hard for Bytedance to sell the wildly popular video app, which features clips of everything from dance routines and hair-dye tutorials to jokes about daily life and politics."Technology exporters who have not completed trading when the new catalog comes into effect and who are preparing to export restricted technologies in the adjusted catalog are advised to suspend the consultation and trade process and fulfill the relevant application procedures", Cui said.China has updated its export control rules which are expected to complicate the video-sharing platform TikTok's sale in the U.S., according to Xinhua.Meghan Markle's Gardening Outfit at Learning Center in LANot afraid to get their hands dirty, Meghan and Harry coordinated their laidback looks for their green-fingered morning. Days after Meghan and Harry's son Archie was born, the pair shared a photo of his feet in front of the bloom.© Reuters File Photo The logos of TikTok and its parent company ByteDance.TikTok argued in the suit that Trump's executive order was a misuse of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act because the platform is not "an unusual and extraordinary threat".President Donald Trump has demanded that ByteDance divest its US -based TikTok assets over concerns that the app could be used by the Chinese Communist Party to store and share data of USA users. TikTok claims about 100 million monthly active users in the US.So far, Microsoft and Oracle have been in talks to buy the business, with the former company partnering up with Walmart to offer a joint bid that will compete with the California-based computer technology company. A Microsoft/Walmart partnership would continue to hedge against rival Amazon on both cloud and retail fronts, respectively.Walmart said in a statement that a deal with Microsoft and TikTok could help it expand its advertising business and reach more shoppers.Kendra Schaefer, head of digital research at consultancy Trivium in Beijing, thinks the Chinese government is doing something similar to what Washington has been doing - placing restrictions on the other country's leading tech firms.Analysts and commentators have suggested that TikTok's operations in the USA could sell for more than $20 billion.Owner, ByteDance Ltd., reportedly has two top bidders. Here's everything we know about the app's future in the U.S. - and everything we don't.Load-Date: September 3, 2020End of Document

Trump’s ban on WeChat threatens a vital network for the region’s Chinese communityPhilly.comSeptember 25, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Distributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWSLength: 1125 wordsByline: Jason Laughlin, The Philadelphia InquirerBodySept. 27--For many local Chinese Americans and immigrants from China, the social media app WeChat is a lifeline to government services, community events, friends, and family living on the other side of the Pacific.If the Trump administration has its way, it’ll be taken away."We are so disappointed, not just because he’s making this hateful language as calling it [the coronavirus] the Chinese flu or the China virus,” said Wei Chen, president of Asian Americans United, a Philadelphia organization focused on fighting discrimination against the Asian community, "but banning WeChat is a hateful action he takes, trying to attack Chinese or China.”The app serves not only as a connection with family overseas, but as the foundation of networking, organizing, and communication for many of the more than 35,000 Philadelphians who are Chinese immigrants or of Chinese descent through the U.S. Census as of 2015, with another 38,326 in the surrounding Pennsylvania and New Jersey suburbs. A ban would prevent the app from being downloaded and bar people who have it from accessing routine upgrades to keep it functional.“If this disappears for the Chinese residents of my district, their ability to communicate and interact with friends, neighbors, businesses, family, will be cut off and they will be bereft,” said state Rep. Jared Solomon, whose Northeast Philadelphia district includes one of region’s largest populations of Chinese Americans.The threat of a ban announced in an August executive order has caused a run on the app, with more than 389,000 downloads reported so far in August and September, according to Apptopia, a mobile app intelligence company. That’s about 40,000 more downloads than in the previous two months.WeChat, owned by the Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings, combines features of Facebook, Venmo, Google Drive, Twitter, Zoom, and text messaging in one app for smart phones and desktops. The Trump administration is concerned data gathered on WeChat and TikTok, another Chinese-owned social media app that has become hugely popular in the United States, could end up in the hands of the Chinese government.She arrived as a teenage refugee -- now she’s the voice of Northeast Philly’s growing Chinese communityThe U.S. Commerce Department was supposed to enforce the ban on Sept. 20, but a federal judge delayed it after a group of WeChat users sued, saying the executive order infringed on free speech. WeChat’s threat to national security was modest, the judge said. The Commerce Department has said it will challenge the injunction.Due to the Chinese government’s own digital restrictions, WeChat is one of the few social media apps accessible in both China and the United States. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s been a balm for people worried about loved ones thousands of miles away.“They want to see our faces," said Tong Su, a pastor at the Church of Grace to Fujianese, a Protestant church in Northeast Philadelphia, who has used the app to have weekly family video chats with siblings in the United States and his parents in China. “If they see the face, it’s easier for them to feel comfort that we’re OK.”Chelsea Zhang, 23, a recent graduate of University of Pennsylvania’s master’s program in city planning and native of Shenzen, China, says she has been using WeChat since she was a teenager. Frequent, free communication through the app soothed her parents' fears about her health.“I was able to call my parents every single day,” she said. “I would say compared to earlier generations, it’s really useful to us because we don’t need to pay to call our parents at home.”Between 3.6 million and 3.7 million people on mobile devices in the United States were active on the app each of the first four months of this year when COVID-19 was surging in China, then in this country, according to App Annie, a mobile data and analytics provider. In August, the most current data available, the app had about 3.3 million users in the U.S.WeChat is also deeply embedded in the fabric of life for Chinese Americans, the rare digital tool embraced across generations.When the pandemic made meeting in person impossible, Su used WeChat’s video function to host Bible studies. Chen found it invaluable for discussing incidents of discrimination faced by Philadelphia’s Asian communities as the coronavirus began spreading in the United States.Deal on new rail cars embroils SEPTA in U.S. suspicions of China manufacturer“Its hurtful for us, even more hurtful for immigrants,” he said. “They know people are staring at them and they have no idea how to respond.”Zhang and her grad school friends share a list of daily and monthly goals on the app, and use it to check in on each others’ progress. The accountability helped give her motivation to finish an online business course.WeChat has proven essential to the Northeast Philadelphia Chinese Association’s efforts to prevent immigrants who aren’t confident speaking English from missing out on city services and being left out of the city’s civic life, said Mingchu “Pearl” Huynh, the organization’s president and founder. Through WeChat, she can reach as many as 10,000 people in the region. On any given day, she said, her organization can participate in disseminating to Philadelphia’s Chinese-speaking population information on COVID-19 tests, gun safety, kung fu lessons, and voter registration. Losing the app, she said, would force her to rebuild a contact base it took her three years to assemble.“I do my community business, all relying on this,” she said. “Imagine if I lost this service?”This isn’t the first time Chinese tech has drawn concern from the U.S. government. Tensions exacerbated by the trade war between Washington, D.C., and Beijing, but with some legitimate concerns about how the Chinese government could use data culled from apps. Federal authorities have blocked or opposed Chinese companies' efforts to acquire a money transfer company, the dating app Grindr, and a mobile marketing firm, Reuters reported.WeChat’s users are aware that what they put on there could be subject to government surveillance and said they act accordingly. Su, the minister, said he doesn’t share anything private. Chen noted the U.S. government monitors social media as well. He didn’t think anything he shared on WeChat would interest to the Chinese government.“A lot of people know that it’s kind of a problem, but we also sort of live with it because it seems like there’s no messaging app that doesn’t have any privacy issues,” Zhang, the former Penn student, said. “We just bear with the idea that we have to live with it.”___ (c)2020 The Philadelphia Inquirer Visit The Philadelphia Inquirer at www.inquirer.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.Load-Date: September 27, 2020End of Document

ONLINE EVENT: A CONVERSATION WITH REP. JOAQUIN CASTRO ON INFORMATION WARFARE: U.S. COMPETITION WITH CHINAStates News ServiceSeptember 17, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 4997 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS):Seth Jones: Hi. I am thrilled to have Representative Joaquin Castro here with me, from the 20th Congressional District of Texas. My name is Seth Jones. I'm the Harold Brown Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Representative Castro is the vice chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee. He's on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. He's also on the House Committee on Education and Labor. And we'll talk about education issues and the Chinese a little bit later in our discussion. And also, chairman of the Congressional Japan Caucus, so has a deep background in Asia, including on ASEAN.So welcome, again. Thanks for coming virtually to CSIS. And let me just ask you first, there's been a lot of concern publicly first coming from U.S. intelligence officials like [William] Evanina from the Director of National Intelligence Office. And then we've heard social media organizations like Microsoft express concern about Chinese meddling in the U.S. election. What is your concern about what the Chinese are doing right now, and to what degree or how serious of a threat do you see the Chinese right now in what will be a very important U.S. presidential, as well as Senate and House, elections?Rep. Joaquin Castro: Yeah. Well, first of all, thank you for having me. It's great to be back, even if only virtually right now, at CSIS, and to discuss China and the topic of misinformation. I think that as a nation we need to take any kind of election interference very seriously. And in many ways, we learned our lesson in 2016, when Russia severely interfered with our electoral process. And so, the reports and the allegations that China is also trying to interfere with our election is obviously something that is very serious for our democracy.Now, before I talk specifically about China, I want to lay out the context here, because I mentioned 2016. There you know, the intelligence agencies have told us that for years different countries have tried to monitor what our politicians are doing, what campaigns are doing, what's going on with U.S. elections, and so forth. That's been true, for example, of Russia and China. What Russia did differently in 2016 was a few things. First, they widely created a lot of fake accounts, fake personas and personalities to spread misinformation in the United States, and even to mobilize American citizens to conduct different actions.So, for example, in my home state of Texas, they got people to show up for pro-Confederate and anti-Confederate rallies in the city of Houston, Texas. So that was one element. The other element also was that whereas previously nations had essentially spied on or attempted to spy on campaigns and so forth, what was partly different this time was that Russia took that information and in concert, working with others, essentially dumped that information and weaponized it for political purposes.So, when you ask the question how concerned should we be about what China's doing, we ought to be very concerned. The question is, what methods are they using, and what are they going to do with that information? Again, all of it is bad, but I think when you see what Russia did in weaponizing that information, that's especially damaging and especially a high degree of interference with a nation. And right now, as far as at least as far as we've seen, Russia and China have been operating on two different levels, where the Russian interference is much more focused, much more directed, and in terms of political impact much worse. Again, not to dismiss what China's doing, because we have to be vigilant about it, but we need the intelligence agencies to continue to figure out what China's purpose is there.Seth Jones: Yeah. China has long collected on companies. I was my information, as well as millions of Americans', was taken among the SF-86 forms in the OPM data breach, and Equifax.Rep. Joaquin Castro: Right.Seth Jones: One thing that is interesting on the weaponization is the New York Times, among other publications, have reported that the Chinese did pursue direct disinformation in the early stages of Covid by forwarding texts to millions of Americans in the United States about the potential for a U.S. government lockdown, quarantine with U.S. federal forces on the streets. In my conversations to U.S. intelligence officials, several of them said to me that was relatively new. It wasn't just stealing information. It was trying to create some fear in the United States and exploiting our vulnerabilities on access to social media in ways that were more like the way the Russians had operated. So, I don't know if you've seen some evidence that the Chinese are getting a little bolder in how they're operating.Rep. Joaquin Castro: Well, I think that's absolutely true of different foreign actors, and even nonstate actors. I think, as you mentioned and as I had said before, traditionally what state actors were doing was collecting information about Americans, whether through data theft, or espionage, and so forth, and then taking it to evaluate that intelligence to figure out what their posture might be towards a particular candidate, towards the nation, you know, a trade issue whatever it might be. What you saw in 2016 was that Russia essentially changed their model. They suddenly not only collected the information, but they were dumping it for political damage.And so, it's not surprising then that with the advent of social media, which allows another a lot more entry points, actually for a nation to be able to get the attention of a group of people, in this case the American public. It's not surprising with these new platforms that nations would start to start to exploit those. You know, one of those platforms, aside from social media as you mentioned, is texting. It gives the ability to widely get our message through text messages to a bunch of Americans.And so, we do have to be very vigilant because I think that nations took the message from 2016 that you can do real damage and inflect real pain in the United States through your methods of not just collection but of how you weaponize that information. And so, it doesn't surprise me. And we have seen we have seen nations start to figure out how they can innovate and do more damage.Seth Jones: Yeah. Let me take us back a little bit to more of a sort of strategic level. And there has certainly been concern, and you've actually written about this, both in Washington and Beijing that the two countries are engaging in long-term strategic competition. I think you wrote in a piece two years ago, there needs to be some competition. Compete not cheat, I think was the title of that of that piece.Rep. Joaquin Castro: Right.Seth Jones: There has been along those lines a lot of focus on military competition, including building of major conventional, even nuclear platforms and systems, certainly on the economic side, which you highlighted in that piece. A lot of people don't often emphasize the information and ideological space. My question here is: How important do you think information is in U.S. competition with the Chinese? And actually, from the other perspective as well, how important is information from the Chinese perspective in competing with the United States?Rep. Joaquin Castro: Well, I think that information no question, with the digital age that we're in, the fact that people can draw their information and their news from so many sources is incredibly important. And we have seen the danger, including in our past election, of completely unmediated information, where the sources can't necessarily be trusted and the impact that that can have. But let's establish two separate baselines here. In the United States you have what is, relatively speaking, a very open society with information flowing from all sides. And somewhat mediated, but not nearly as mediated, or restricted, or regulated as you have in China.So, I would argue that in that competition of ideas, in that competition of thought, that our best weapon is the truth. That our best weapon is the fact that we are open to different ideas, that we don't shy away from opinion and perspective of different kinds. The same can't be said for what you see in China. I remember being there in 2010 for the World Expo, for example, and not being able to get on Facebook even, right? And so, there's still a lot of media sources that are not available to the Chinese people, a lot of information that is kept from them. And to me, that signifies a kind of weakness for China, that in many ways they're still scared of the truth. They're scared of information.That said, they're obviously a very powerful economy. Second largest economy in the world. Our largest trading partner. They have ambitious plans for their future. And their Belt and Road Initiative is very ambitious. And that's why I said in my piece, part of what we've suffered from in the United States is that we don't have, to date, a comprehensive or holistic approach to China. And we have not distinguished, to me, what is an important difference, what it means for China to compete fairly versus what it means for them to cheat. And until we can get at that distinction and understand it, and agree more or less among ourselves even as Americans which is which you know, which is one and which is the other then what you're going to see is this halting kind of one-off, you know, policies towards China, which I think is what we've seen a lot of in recent years.Seth Jones: Yeah, we certainly have. And on your point more broadly about vulnerabilities in the Chinese system, you know, there are certainly vulnerabilities, and there have been historically, when regimes attempt to control access of information to their populations. They often those populations often want more truthful information. So, we'll get actually, a little bit later we'll get into your thoughts on ways to support individuals, including in places like Hong Kong and Taiwan, that are on the receiving end of Chinese information and disinformation operations.But before we go there, I wondered if we could get your thoughts on Covid-19. You know, one of the interesting components this is a disinformation and partly misinformation component which is Beijing both immediately denied that Covid-19 originated in Wuhan, and then actually they went even further, including government officials senior officials from the ministry of foreign affairs openly accusing the U.S., including the U.S. Army, of introducing the virus into China last year.How do you deal with those kinds of accusations? How serious do you take them? And these were Chinese officials arguing that the virus did not originate in China, but actually originated from a U.S. introduction. Do you think these kinds of examples mark a new type of Chinese aggressiveness in the information sphere? I mean, how do you gauge that?Rep. Joaquin Castro: That's a great question. And, you know, part of me says, in my own mind, that that's tough to answer because the world had not seen a pandemic of this nature for 100 years, right, since the so-called Spanish Flu. And I think that the Chinese government and the U.S. government were grappling to deal with it. That said, I think it's fair to be very critical about how about the information or misinformation that China put out.And again, we should lead with the truth. And we should demand the truth of China, and its leaders. But what we can't do, and I think what President Trump had a tendency to fall into, was exaggeration or unfounded claims, because then what we do is we lose credibility, not only, I think, among the people of the world and among some of our own citizens, but certainly with China and, you know, with our allies.And I think the same for them. You know, when they go out and they deny the obvious, when they go out and they deny things that people can see with their own eyes, I think it's the same thing. I think they lose credibility with the world. And so, we should absolutely demand the truth of them.Seth Jones: Yeah. I think that's certainly true. And demand the truth of ourselves too, in what we say.So, I wanted to turn to an issue that is, I think, near and dear to your family and your background, which is education. Your father is a retired teacher. Education system in the U.S. is very important. It makes us competitive. It's also been a source of some debate within the United States. There has been a small proportion and I want to emphasize small proportion of students, including visitors, from outside of the country, including from China.There are examples of espionage at U.S. universities. There's been a lot of debate about the freedom of speech and the freedom to debate the issues as part of the Confucius Institutes at U.S. universities. We now have a professor at Harvard University who's been arrested and is being charged with violating U.S. law as part of the Thousand Talents Program from China.So, from your perspective, how do you navigate between keeping the United states a top, elite country for education including at its graduate and its undergraduate levels but also ensure that we're protecting our own national security? Or how do you balance that?Rep. Joaquin Castro: I think that's an important consideration, right? Look, this country has benefitted from the fact that throughout the generations the world's best and brightest have wanted to come to the United States, not only to study but to do things like start a business here. And because of that in part because of that, at least the United States became the strongest, most powerful economy in the world. So, when you start considering locking people out or shutting people off, you have to think about that history and the context.Now, there's no question that, as you mentioned, there have been high-profile cases of people stealing information from American universities, American research universities. And that we have to be able to vet people better and put a stop to things like that. But what I do disagree with is just wholesale saying: We're not going to take any more Chinese students. We're going to X out the whole country and, you know, you just kind of put a blanket prohibition on a whole group of people. That has existed before, by the way. That was called the Chinese Exclusion Act, which existed for decades in the United States. So, I don't think that that's the answer either.Again, redouble our efforts to vet people, redouble our efforts to be vigilant, to make sure that no one either from China or any other foreign country is stealing data, or intelligence, or secrets, so to speak. I think that's fair. But to say in a blanket way, we're just not going to take you all anymore, I don't think is a best policy. And again, you know, like I said, when they cheat, we have to be there to call them on it. And on those instances, obviously, that fits into the case of cheating.Seth Jones: Yeah. There's another issue that's cropped up this summer, including during Covid, when some American universities have gone virtual and have had students participating in classes from overseas, including Hong Kong, and China more broadly. And there have been a number of reports, newspaper articles from major U.S. newspapers. Princeton, for example, students in a Chinese politics class are using now codes instead of names to protect their identities, so that they can speak freely in class, in some cases, over mediums like Zoom, that can be monitored by Chinese agencies.Do you do you see potential challenges here with free speech in U.S. classrooms now being impacted at all? Or is this a is this kind of an overstated threat? What's your sense about this?Rep. Joaquin Castro: Well, let me start with what we wish for. We wish for, again, a society where opinions, and perspectives, and analyses are freely offered, and people don't have to be fearful of what they're going to say particularly in an academic setting. You know, obviously as long as they're not hurting anybody, they're not engaging in hate speech and so forth, with certain guidelines. But that's what we wish for. So, then the question is, how do you achieve that? And I do think that it's fair to, in a diplomatic way because I've said that we have to lead with diplomacy in a diplomatic way to pressure China to make sure that they allow people to express themselves as freely as possible.And I do think that the United States and its allies around the world including many of the countries that China is getting closer to in Europe, in Latin America, in Africa we need to work together to let China know that this is an important issue to us, that this kind of freedom of expression, freedom of speech and opinion, is an important issue to us. And we should we should pressure them in that way.Seth Jones: Yeah. It certainly is important. I wonder if I can go back in history a little bit and raise this issue of the Cold War. The U.S., with the Soviets, engaged in a several decades-long Cold War. I think, as you noted with the Chinese, this is not just about competition, it's about cooperation. The U.S. did engage in some cooperation with the Soviets, including on arms control issues.But there was an important element, I think particularly as we got deeper into the Cold War, including in the latter part of the Cold War, where information became an important aspect of that competition. So, leaving aside for a moment the differences of which there are many between the Soviet Union and China, there may be lessons and this is what I wanted to ask you about lessons in what we can learn from that rivalry. For example, the U.S. did make a number of significant investments in the information arena.The U.S. expanded its involvement in radio programs, including Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which beamed into the Soviet Union and into Eastern Europe. This goes back to your comment at the beginning of our conversation about populations that face state-run media and repressive media outlets. The U.S. also had established a U.S. Information Agency. So, is there anything we can take from those components of the Cold War that might be worth thinking about as we move in as we move forward in competition with the Chinese, especially the role of information?Rep. Joaquin Castro: Well, I think there absolutely is. I think that we need to strengthen our ability to project our message out into the world. Again, this is a nation that over the generations has been the North Star on things like freedom, human rights, democracy, rooting out corruption. And as long as we make our message consistent with those principles and those values, then I believe more and more people around the world will buy into them, will agree with them. And that's what we see.I believe that people there are people in China that are yearning for more freedom and are also they want human rights to be respected. They want to be able to fully make their own political choices. They want to root out corruption. And, by the way, that's the case not only in China but I think throughout the world, that people yearn for these things. And we're also in an age where people yearn for information. And that's always been true.However, the difference now is that there are so many more platforms by which information can get to people. So, when governments, including the Chinese government, shut off as many avenues as they can in order to control the information, over time I don't see that as a sustainable method of governance. And the United States, as I mentioned, I think our job number one is to get our message out about the principles and the values that we stand for. We do need to strengthen our apparatus for that because it has atrophied of the years. And that makes it harder for the United States to reach the people of the world. We need to do a better job of it.Seth Jones: So, as you look across the U.S. government today, we certainly have substantial funding for the Department of Defense. And what goes along with that are all of the all the money that goes into platforms and systems, from aircraft carriers to submarines, that might engage at some point in conflict. But you also have a background in at least two of the committees you sit on that gets into areas of U.S. national security. And I'm wondering if you have thoughts here on the how well-funded and how well-prepared we are in our other government agencies.State, for example, has had its it's budgets are relatively low, certainly compared to the Department of Defense. We don't even have a U.S. Information Agency anymore. Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty budgets and Voice of America are pretty small right now, and our radio budgets for Asia. What's your sense about how well prepared we are to get our messages out on multiple forums, really outside of the military dimension?Rep. Joaquin Castro: I mean, that's a great question. Look, we have the strongest military in the world. We spend, by far, more money than any nation in the world on our military. But I'll tell you this: I don't believe we can buy enough tanks, jet fighters, or any other kind of military equipment that is going to convince the people of the world that the United States is and should be the North Star for this world. The only way we're going to do that is by living our principles and values, number one, in this country, and then also by telling the people of the world what we're about.And so, to your questions, yes, I think we need to strengthen the infrastructure of diplomacy. Over the last few years, what we've seen is that that infrastructure of diplomacy has been weakened. I won't say it's completely hollowed out because I think that's unfair. But it has been weakened. And I say that realizing that vis- -vis our military we were already leaning on our defense infrastructure more than our diplomatic infrastructure before. And over the last few years, we've weakened our diplomatic infrastructure. So, in the next few years what I see as an imperative for us to strengthen that infrastructure of diplomacy. And of course, that again, that includes our messaging and our information that we put out about what this country stands for, what it's about, you know, the fact that we believe the human rights of people around the world should be respected, that people's rights deserve to be respected. All of those things I think we've got to do a better job about.And also, when you look at the military and its spending, we are, besides I know we're discussing information and misinformation, but when you think about intelligence, China, Russia, and a few other nations are quickly working to develop in the areas of artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and a few other areas. And if they're successful in those missions and if they're successful well before the United States, the risk that we run is that some of even our most sophisticated weaponry the things that we paid billions of dollars for could be rendered useless in a manner of a few keystrokes literally, a few keystrokes if they're able to perfect the technology that they're pursuing. And so to me, not only you know, I said we've got to strength that infrastructure diplomacy and it's true, but even if you just looked at the defense part there are things that we have to adjust in terms of how we're spending in defense and in preparation, in cybersecurity.I don't think that we do nearly enough in cyber. You know, our alliances are not as strong as they could be, although I will give credit that we have tried to strengthen them in the few years since 2016. But still, they are not where they could be, and we've got to put a lot of work into cybersecurity and cyber alliances as well. If not, I'm telling you, with the technology that could be coming, a lot of these weapons that we've paid high dollar for could be rendered useless.Seth Jones: Yeah. One of the things you brought up is artificial intelligence/machine learning in the in your answer to the question. And that does raise one of the final questions I have is the U.S. intelligence community under the Director of National Intelligence in 2019 shut down all access to the Open Source Enterprise so that Americans or researchers can't get access to translated Chinese information. One of the reasons that we've expressed some concern about that, and I have as well, is because during the Cold War, for example, one of the best ways to understand what was going on within the Soviet Union was our Foreign Broadcast Information Service that translated really millions of words of Russian, including from Russia's allies in Eastern Europe, and made them publicly available.So, part of the question is, what role really should open source play? It's certainly not just a government entity because we do have with machine learning and artificial intelligence ways to translate documents, but what has struck me in watching some of the issues like COVID-19 within China is how much there's a robust debate going on on Chinese platforms that most Americans will never see because it is in Chinese and most people do not, A, speak Mandarin; and B, that information is not translated. So, the largest newspaper circulating newspaper in China is a translation into Mandarin of English and other foreign news sources. And part of the question is, how serious should we be taking open-source information as we move into the future?Rep. Joaquin Castro: Well, I think you're right to be concerned and I think that it's essential. And generally speaking, I think that the more eyes you have on these things the better, that you shouldn't just contain it to a smaller group of people. And the reason is that you have a lot of people in the United States in many fields in academia, in research, and others that I believe whose perspectives can be helpful as we examine these things.And look, we don't want a Cold War with China. We don't want a repeat of the decades-long relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States. But we do want to understand China, and we want to understand what they're saying and doing, and that effort goes beyond just a limited group of people in the intelligence community, for example. I think they should lean on their fellow Americans, you know, like I said, in other capacities or working in other capacities who can also be helping help us understand these dynamics. And so, I am hoping for more openness in the coming years.Seth Jones: Last question, and probably the most difficult it's certainly the most sensitive is how do we in the U.S. think about combating disinformation or supporting freedom and democracy overseas, particularly in places like Taiwan and Hong Kong, both of which are on the frontlines of China's information-warfare efforts? So, from your perspective, are there things we want to avoid doing? And are there things that we want to do a little to take a little more seriously, steps we should we should be thinking about that we haven't taken?Rep. Joaquin Castro: I mean, you're right, that is a tough question because when you take the we'll take the example of Hong Kong. Look, we wantSeth Jones: Which you've been active in tweeting about recently, I see.Rep. Joaquin Castro: Yeah, yeah. We've been we've proposed legislation on it with Rep. Curtis in the Foreign Affairs Committee and Marco Rubio had it on the Senate side. We want to be supportive of the folks in Hong Kong as they try to preserve their rights, preserve a democratic Hong Kong. And also, you know, spoke we spoke out against the national security law that China put into place. I think that was very important.So, you asked the question, you know, what is our best approach. And the reason I say it's tough is because, look, what's the effort that's going on in Hong Kong among Hong Kongers has to be seen as a as a native effort. It can't be seen as an effort that is primarily driven by the United States or anyone else, just as things that are going on in the United States need to be seen as things that are being driven by Americans, right? And so and so we want to be supportive, but it's their initiative and it's their effort.Now, I think what we can do is that we can speak out to China and also speak out to the world about what we believe and our perspective on these issues. And of course, within the United States we can try to take legislative action, as I proposed and other Democrats and other Republicans have proposed. But it's important to remember first and foremost that the people in Hong Kong are doing these things because that's what they believe, because that's the future they want, right, because their disagreements with China are their own. And you know and that I think is the tough part, is how do we make sure that the world and that even China knows and realizes that those efforts are native efforts there, and that we support them as Americans.And I'll tell you, I mean, it was it was incredible to see to see during these months of protest the American flags, for example, the statements that have come out of Hong Kong, and the inspiration that Hong Kong has drawn from the United States and from other democracies. And it's going to be important that we continue to speak up and stand up for them.Seth Jones: Well, thank you very much. I think this last issue highlights how important the information component is and how important it is for you and others on the Hill to be taking it seriously, which you have been.So, I just want to thank you very much, Congressman, for taking a few minutes with us here discussing issues related to China, information, disinformation. And thank you very much for all you're doing in support of the American people.Rep. Joaquin Castro: Well, thank you. Thank you very much for having me.Seth Jones: Thanks.Load-Date: September 18, 2020End of Document

He is vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a top advisory group to the Chinese government, according to CUSEF's website.BLJ's FARA filing says the firm provides media relations, media training, crisis communications and “message recasting” for the Chinese embassy. BLJ also operates the embassy's social media accounts, which have numerous posts touting Beijing's position on hot-button issues, including the coronavirus pandemic.

BLJ Worldwide obtained its loan to protect 16 jobs, according to the government database. The Daily Caller News Foundation also received a loan through the program.Loans to businesses linked to China have come under scrutiny because of Beijing's alleged cover up of the severity of the coronavirus pandemic in its early stages.Link to ImageWHO chief Tedros Adhanom and China President Xi jinping  (NAOHIKO HATTA/AFP via Getty Images)U.S. officials and health experts have accused the Chinese government of withholding data about the virus from health authorities for more than a month after it began to spread. The virus, which originated in Wuhan, China in November 2019, has caused more than 850,000 deaths across the globe.BLJ Worldwide, which signed an agreement with the Chinese embassy in June 2017, has amplified Beijing's spin through the embassy's social media platforms. In a Facebook post on May 5, the embassy claimed that it has showed “transparency every step of the way” during the coronavirus pandemic.“#China has shared information on the disease with the international community timely and worked with other countries in the fight against the #coronavirus,” the post reads.BLJ disclosed in previous filings with the Justice Department that it maintains the Chinese embassy's Facebook account.On Jan. 23, the embassy account touted its cooperation with the World Health Organization in the coronavirus response. Just nine days earlier, WHO cited false assurances from the Chinese government that coronavirus was not spreading through human-to-human transmission. (RELATED: WHO Tells Everyone Don't Worry Because China Says Coronavirus Isn't Contagious)The embassy account has also been highly critical of demonstrators in Hong Kong, who took to the streets beginning last year to protest a fugitive law proposed by Beijing.On Nov. 14, 2019, the embassy account accused demonstrators in Hong Kong of “ruining their homeland.”“Their actions are on the brink of terrorism,” the post reads.In aposton Nov. 19, 2019, the embassy called the Hong Kong demonstrations “a revolution started by a bunch of hot heads who do not understand the cost, pain and goal of a revolution.”BLJ Worldwide has provided other consulting services to the embassy, the FARA filing says.The firm has drafted and placed op-eds written on behalf of Chinese diplomats, and arranged meetings with “key influencers, politicians, leaders in academia and business leaders,” according to the filing.Link to ImagePayment details from BLJ Worldwide's FARA filing, Aug. 31, 2020.BLJ says in the FARA filing that its work for the Chinese embassy entails: “1) media training; 2) media monitoring; 3) social media; 4) media relations; 5) message recasting; 6) public diplomacy support; 7) strategic communications guidance and support; 8) crisis communications and hot button issues; 9) influencer relationship building and networking.”The firm conducted four media training sessions in coordination with the embassy, including a “large lecture on diplomatic skills” and “a special media training for senior diplomats.”“BLJ has also helped the Embassy to re-craft its core policy points into talking points, and has helped to edit speeches for Embassy hosted events, or events in which the Embassy has participated,” the FARA filing says.For CUSEF, the Hong Kong-based nonprofit, BLJ has “engage[d] openly with academic and thought leaders, including through the use of salon style dinners.”BLJ has also supported CUSEF-sponsored trips to China for journalists at Vox, Slate, the Boston Herald, the Boston Globe, and The Huffington Post, according to the FARA filing.It is unclear from the filing when those trips occurred. A journalist writing for Vox disclosed taking a CUSEF-sponsored trip to Beijing in a June 13, 2018 article for the website. A Slate article published on July 30, 2018 discloses that the author visited China on a trip sponsored by CUSEF.BLJ operates the Facebook and Twitter accounts for China-U.S. Focus, an opinion website operated by CUSEF.Another public relations firm that represents the Chinese government, Rogich Communications, received a PPP loan.In a FARA filing on Tuesday, Rogich Communications said it represents the Chinese embassy, the People's Republic of China and Cui Tiankai, the Chinese ambassador to the United States.The firm said in the filing it did not provide any services for its clients this year or received any payment.Neither BLJ Worldwide nor Rogich Communications responded to requests for comment for this story.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Justice Dept. charges 8 in Chinese harassment plot in USAssociated Press InternationalOctober 29, 2020 Thursday 1:39 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: WASHINGTON DATELINE; POLITICAL NEWSLength: 768 wordsByline: ERIC TUCKER, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department has charged eight people with working on behalf of the Chinese government in a pressure campaign aimed at coercing a New Jersey man who was wanted by Beijing into returning to China to face charges, officials said Wednesday.The prosecution, which Justice Department officials said was the first of its kind, accuses the defendants of participating in a Chinese government operation known as “Fox Hunt" that was ostensibly created to help Beijing locate fugitives abroad but that U.S. officials say in practice relied on intimidation and bullying to go after dissidents and political opponents.Five of the eight, including an American private investigator who was hired as part of the effort, were arrested Wednesday. The other three are believed to be in China. All eight were charged with conspiring to act as illegal agents for China in a case filed in federal court in Brooklyn.“Without coordination with our government, China’s repatriation squads enter the sovereign territory of the United States, surveil and locate the alleged fugitives and deploy intimidation and other tactics to force them back into China, where they would face certain imprisonment or worse following illegitimate trials," Assistant Attorney General John Demers, the Justice Department's top national security official, said at a news conference announcing the charges.The arrests are among a series of recent actions the Trump administration has taken against China, a country that President Donald Trump has said he regards as a prime adversary and that he blames for the coronavirus outbreak.In July, for instance, the Justice Department charged hackers working with the Chinese government with targeting firms developing vaccines for the coronavirus. The administration also ratcheted up tensions over the summer by ordering China to close its consulate in Houston.“Today’s charges reflect yet another example of China’s ongoing and widespread lawless behavior — and our refusal to tolerate it,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray. “Simply put: It’s outrageous that China thinks it can come to our shores, conduct illegal operations, and bend people here in the United States to their will.”In this case, prosecutors said, the defendants over a period of several years harassed the family of man who had been a city government official in China before arriving in the U.S. 10 years ago. The man and his family were not identified by name by prosecutors, but a 43-page criminal complaint says the Chinese government had accused them of violating bribery and abuse-of-power laws in that country.Between 2016 and continuing through last year, a group of Chinese citizens working with a private investigator and at the behest of the Chinese government sought to bully the man into returning to China through an intimidation campaign that included surveillance and online harassment of the man's adult daughter, unsolicited packages sent to the man's home as well as a threatening note left taped to his front door.The note, written in simplified Chinese characters, said: "If you are willing to go back to the mainland and spend 10 years in prison, your wife and children will be all right. That’s the end of this matter!”At one point, prosecutors said, several conspirators schemed to bring the man's father to the United States to persuade his son to return to China so as to avoid physical harm to the family.There was no immediate response to an email seeking comment from the Chinese embassy in Washington.In another case similar to the one announced Wednesday, the Chinese government passed a message to relatives in the U.S. of a target it could not locate, Wray said. The message explained that the target had two options: either return to China promptly or commit suicide.“These are not the actions we would expect from a responsible nation-state. Instead, it’s more like something we’d expect from an organized criminal syndicate,” Wray said.The Justice Department says the defendants broke the law by failing to notify the U.S. that they were acting as agents of the Chinese government. Several are also charged with conspiracy to commit international and interstate stalking.Three of the five defendants were arrested Wednesday morning in New York or New Jersey, and the other two were arrested in California, said Seth DuCharme, the acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York.As of Wednesday evening, three of the defendants had appeared in federal court in Brooklyn and were released on bond.____Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAPLoad-Date: October 28, 2020End of Document

GLOBAL CALL FOR INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS MONITORING MECHANISMS ON CHINAStates News ServiceSeptember 9, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 545 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:We, the undersigned organizations, join together to call for an international mechanism to address the Chinese government's human rights violations, and urge you to take decisive action to achieve this goal.On 26 June 2020, an unprecedented 50 United Nations experts called for "decisive measures to protect fundamental freedoms in China." They highlighted China's mass human rights violations in Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang, suppression of information in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, and attacks on rights defenders, journalists, lawyers and critics of the government across the country.Our organizations are also concerned about the impact of China's rights violations world-wide. China has targeted human rights defenders abroad, suppressed academic freedom in countries around the world, and engaged in internet censorship and digital surveillance. We deplore China's promotion of rights-free development and the ensuing environmental degradation at the hands of government-backed extractive industries, as well as the racist treatment of people in China, or by Chinese state actors in other parts of the world.We are dismayed at China's efforts to distort the mandate of the UN Human Rights Council by promoting "cooperation" over accountability, and opposing initiatives to bring scrutiny of serious rights violations and international crimes in countries around the world. It has used its seat on the UN's NGO Committee to baselessly deny accreditation to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), while accrediting government-organized NGOs (GoNGOs). It has sought to deny access to human rights defenders to UN premises, denounced speakers on NGO side events as "terrorists," and threatened delegates to deter them from attending UN side events on rights violations, including abuses in Xinjiang.When the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Special Procedures, and dozens of states urged China to comply with international human rights standards, China contended that they were "improper remarks" that "grossly interfered" with China's sovereignty.A state that tries to hold itself above any kind of scrutiny presents a fundamental threat to human rights. That Chinaa state with extraordinary global powerexpects such treatment affects us all.We therefore endorse the call by UN experts for a Special Session of the Human Rights Council to evaluate the range of violations by China's government, and to establish an impartial and independent UN mechanism to closely monitor, analyze, and report annually on that topic. We urge the UN Secretary-General to appoint a Special Envoy, consistent with his Call to Action on Human Rights, and we call on the High Commissioner for Human Rights to fulfil her independent mandate to monitor and publicly report on China's sweeping rights violations. We support the call that UN member states and UN agencies use all interactions with Chinese authorities to insist that the government comply with its international human rights obligations.We write in the spirit of global solidarity and partnership, urging that you act swiftly to counter and remediate grave human rights violations committed by Chinese authorities. No state should be above the law.Load-Date: September 10, 2020End of Document

Why China doesn't care who wins the White HouseCNN WireOctober 21, 2020 Wednesday 10:00 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 910 wordsDateline: (CNN) BodyEditor's note: Jiang Xueqin is an educator and writer based in China. He tweets at @xueqinjiang. The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. (CNN) --  In 2016, when nearly everyone in China thought that Hillary Clinton would win the White House, one group in particular was confident of a Donald Trump victory. Back when most goods flowed from China, merchants in the trading hub of Yiwu received four times more orders for Trump than for Clinton merchandise.This year, just as popular opinion in China is sure that Trump will lose in November, the merchants of Yiwu are back in the spotlight. They report that Trump is beating Joe Biden in orders, but as at least one writer points out, 2020 is not 2016. The trade war means that Americans now order their Trump and Biden stickers and signs from all over the world, making Yiwu a less reliable barometer than last time around.The Trump years have redefined the US-China relationship from one of strategic competition to one of direct confrontation. Trump's policies mean Chinese students, journalists, and entrepreneurs no longer feel welcome in the US, and his tariffs have hurt China's export-heavy economy. (It's worth noting that many foreigners feel less welcome in China too.)But in reality, the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people are mostly indifferent to who wins in November.China still favors a Marxist outlook, and the 2020 American election has confirmed to Chinese that democracy is a circus. Every Chinese I know believes that the United States and China are in a long-term struggle to define the international order, that Trump has initiated a Second Cold War, and that Biden will institutionalize it.In addition, the Chinese people are too distracted by China's decline to worry about America's.Only last year it seemed that the party would never end in China, and Chinese had a swagger as the world became their playground. In 2008, Beijing hosted the Olympics, and China's motto became "Amazing China," ("lihaile wodeguo," meaning "China has become great"), something that was chanted on the streets and on social media each time China shot a rocket up into space.The swagger was hobbled in July 2018 when Chinese vaccines to inoculate children against rabies, and diphtheria and tetanus were discovered to be defective, and people murmured "li haile wodeguo," a pun that transformed the nationalistic slogan into meaning "Greed has destroyed China."Then coronavirus came to cripple China. Despite mishandling early on, it is now contained, but at the cost of China's economic miracle. By July, 460,000 businesses had to shut their doors. And how is the Chinese government helping its people? It's encouraging them to sell things on the streets.Yes, China has managed coronavirus better than the United States --- and that and the trade war are causing nationalism to surge. Chinese are angered by Trump blaming China for infecting the world and the fact that Chinese scholars studying in the United States are coming under suspicion and scrutiny by US officials.I have seen how China prizes loyalty and purity, tightening control over what is taught and who teaches in schools. Many of my US-educated Chinese friends are forced to be vocally anti-American and I know many cadres who have decided against sending their child to America for study, fearing it will taint them professionally. Chinese friends who once saw themselves as building bridges and helping to Westernize China now believe that the United States is intent on preventing China's inevitable rise, and so China must reject American influence and achieve self-sufficiency --- a perspective that neatly dovetails with that of the Communist Party.Trump has been bad for US-China business, but a boon for the Chinese Communist Party. By advocating to "Make America Great Again" and repeatedly calling coronavirus the China virus, Trump has enabled Xi Jinping to rally the Chinese people around ethno-nationalism.In classifying US-based Chinese journalists as state agents, Trump handed China the pretext to expel American journalists. And Trump's tariffs are the perfect excuse to explain a Chinese economy stumbling due to corruption and mismanagement.A Biden presidency would probably be more strategic at rallying global sentiment to contain China. But this does not mean that China favors either Trump or Biden, who is a known and consistent quantity to the Chinese.Chinese think that the world is governed by power dynamics, not personalities, and that's why the Second Cold War is the new normal, regardless of who sits in the White House --- a world view that is not exclusive to China.It has been neat to frame the US-China rivalry as the Thucydides' Trap and compare it to that between Britain and Germany before the outbreak of World War I.But I believe this rivalry is messier, in that both the United States and China seem to be facing a long-term decline. Political polarization in the US is crippling government and the long-term macroeconomic trends in China are even worse, which means leaders on both sides will use fear and loathing as a crutch.Many around the world saw the two old men squabbling childishly in the first presidential debate as the surest sign of an America in decline. In the coming years, the world may see that debate as the best visual representation of the US-China Cold War.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

INDONESIA DEPORTS 4 UYGHUR TERRORISM SUSPECTS TO CHINA, EXPERTS SAYStates News ServiceOctober 23, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1351 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Four Uyghur Muslims convicted in 2015 of terror-related offenses in Indonesia were deported last month after the Chinese government paid the fines imposed on them, two counter-terrorism experts told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service, on Friday.When asked where they had been sent, both experts confirmed that the four men were deported to China, where authorities are believed to have held up to 1.8 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in a network of internment camps as part of an extralegel campaign of incarceration that began in early 2017."They were deported in September and the fines were paid by the Chinese government," Deka Anwar, a researcher at the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC), told BenarNews.The four Ahmet Mahmud, Altinci Bayram, Ahmet Bozoglan ,and Abdul Basit Tuzer were sentenced to six years in prison and were fined 100 million rupiah (U.S. $6,812) by a Jakarta court after being found guilty of entering the country by using fake passports and for attempting to join the Islamic State-affiliated Eastern Indonesia Mujahideen (MIT) militant group.Muhammad Taufiqurrohman, a senior researcher at the Center for Radicalism and Deradicalization Studies (PAKAR), said that the four men were repatriated to China after immigration officers transported them to a detention center from Nusa Kambangan, an island-prison complex off Java, on Sept. 17."Immigration officers came to Nusa Kambangan with a letter to pick them up, saying they were to be transferred to an immigration detention center," Taufiqurrohman told BenarNews. He also confirmed the information that Chinese authorities had paid the Uyghur men's fines.On Friday, BenarNews contacted the Chinese embassy in Jakarta for comment on the four men's deportation, but officials there did not immediately respond.The spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Teuku Faizasyah, said he had no information on the matter and asked BenarNews to contact the Ministry of Law and Human Rights.Reinhard Silitonga, the director general of corrections at the Ministry of Law and Human Rights, told BenarNews he couldn't confirm whether the four men had been deported.And officials at the immigration department could not be reached immediately to confirm that the Uyghurs had been expelled.'Vocational centers'PAKAR's Taufiqurrohman said Indonesia carried out the deportation of the four men in secret because many in the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation criticize China's alleged mistreatment of the Uyghurs, who mostly live in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) in northwestern China."The [Indonesian] government would be heavily criticized and be labelled complicit in the Chinese government's oppression of Uyghur Muslims," if the deportation of the four Uyghurs was made public, Taufiqurrohman said.For more than three years, the Chinese government has allegedly imprisoned hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs in detention camps and subjected those not detained to intense surveillance, religious restrictions, and forced sterilizations, said a report published in June by the Council on Foreign Relations, a U.S.-based think-tank.Chinese officials have repeatedly denied these allegations, saying the camps are centers for vocational training and that the thousands of Uyghur Muslims arrested had links to extremism.BenarNews informed Usman Hamid, executive director of Amnesty International in Indonesia, about Deka's and Taufiqurrohman's assertion that Indonesia had deported the four Uyghurs who had been in prison on terrorism charges.Usman said the Indonesian government must provide an explanation on the fate of the four Uyghurs."The Indonesian government must immediately provide an official statement regarding the truth of the report about the deportation of the four Uyghurs," Usman said."Deporting them to a country that could put them at real risk of human rights violations is illegal under international law. We understand that the pandemic situation poses challenges to the government, but deporting foreigners who are at risk of being subjected to human rights violations is not a solution."Four years ago, Indonesia had turned down a request from the Chinese government to exchange a fugitive Indonesian banker captured in China for the four Uyghur prisoners serving terrorism-related sentences.Indonesia told China that a prisoner swap wasn't possible because the charges against the four Uyghurs were different from those against the Indonesia banker.Back then, an Indonesian official who requested anonymity said Indonesia would face international pressure if the country agreed to deport the Uyghur prisoners to China."Giving Uyghurs back to China is the same as killing them. Most probably, the Chinese government will execute them instantly," the official told BenarNews in April 2019.In the years since, the Indonesian government has faced criticism at home and abroad for its silence on the alleged mistreatment of Uyghurs in XUAR."Indonesia which has played a positive role in the Rohingya refugee crisis has shown its commitment to promoting rights elsewhere in the region. It should do no less for China's Muslims," Human Rights Watch said in January.Last December, thousands of people took to the streets in Indonesia and Malaysia to protest China's treatment of the Muslim minority community."The Indonesian government must not remain silent about the suffering there, because according to our constitution, occupation and oppression must be abolished," a 48-year-old protester told BenarNews during a demonstration outside the Chinese embassy in Jakarta.Days before the protest, Moeldoko, President Joko Widodo's chief of staff, said Indonesia would not interfere in Chinese domestic affairs when asked why the government was not more vocal about the Uyghur issue."Each country has its own sovereignty to regulate its citizens. The Indonesian government won't interfere in the domestic affairs of China." Moeldoko said.His comments came after The Wall Street Journal reported that Beijing had launched a "concerted campaign" to convince Indonesia's religious authorities and journalists that the Xinjiang camps were a "well-meaning effort" to provide job training.Expatriate communities in Turkey, other nationsThousands of Uyghurs have fled China since their alleged persecution began in 2012, and made their way to Turkey and other countries.IPAC's Deka said that between 2014 and 2016, at least 13 Uyghurs had entered Indonesia illegally via Malaysia and joined radical groups.They had left China, via the border with Laos, for Thailand, and then continued their journey to join the thousands of Uyghur asylum seekers in Malaysia, Deka said."In Malaysia, they got help to forge documents so they could go to Turkey. However, many of those who made it to Turkey were eventually deported back to Kuala Lumpur. Some of them then crossed to Batam via Johor," said Deka, referring to an Indonesian island near Singapore."In Batam, they were picked up by members of the Bahrun Naim network," he added, referring to an Islamic State fighter from Indonesia who died in Syria in 2018.The four Uyghurs convicted in 2015 came to Indonesia with the intention of joining the militant MIT group and "performing acts of terror," said the judge who led a panel of jurists that convicted the men.While the Uyghurs' lawyer had argued that they were Turkish citizens vacationing in Indonesia, government lawyers said the men had fake Turkish passports and were en route to meet Indonesia's most wanted terrorist of that time, Santoso, when they were arrested in Central Sulawesi in September 2014.Santoso was killed by security forces in July 2016.Deka and Taufiqurrohman said the four Uyghurs were among the last Uyghur militants in Indonesia after others were killed by police and troops hunting for MIT militants in Central Sulawesi.Six Uyghur men who joined MIT were killed in 2016 during a large security operation in Poso regency.Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Load-Date: October 24, 2020End of Document

China contained Covid-19. Now, hundreds of millions of people there are about to go on vacation at the same timeCNN.comSeptember 28, 2020 Monday 4:17 AM ESTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TRAVELLength: 1375 wordsByline: By Nectar Gan, CNNDateline: Hong Kong BodyChina is on the move again. As October 1 arrives, hundreds of millions of people are expected to pack highways, trains and planes for the National Day holiday, one of the busiest times for travel in the world's most populous country.The eight-day Mid-Autumn Festival break is China's first major holiday since it emerged from the coronavirus outbreak. While life has largely returned to normal in recent months, the upcoming "Golden Week" holiday will be an ambitious test of China's success in taming the virus -- and a much-awaited boost to its economic recovery.Last year, a total of 782 million domestic trips were made during the holiday, generating nearly 650 billion yuan ($95 billion) of tourism revenue, according to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.The ministry predicts 550 million domestic trips to be made this year, while Ctrip, China's largest online travel agency, estimates the number to be over 600 million -- both above 70% of last year's level.The scale of mass movement in such a short period of time is unthinkable in many parts of the world, where governments are still struggling to control soaring infections. In the United States, the number of coronavirus cases topped 7 million over the weekend. Much of Europe is now in the grip of a second wave of infections; even countries largely spared by the first wave, such as Greece and Croatia, have seen cases surging as tourists took summer vacations following the reopening of Europe's internal borders in June.But for now, the virus is much less of a concern for Chinese holidaymakers, given China's close to zero local transmission and some of the world's strictest border control measures.Chen Qianmei, a 29-year-old from the southern city of Guangzhou, flew to Shanghai on Tuesday for her Mid-Autumn Festival vacation. She said she wasn't worried about the virus, although she still took precautions."I think China has (the virus) under pretty good control," she said. "I'm wearing masks and bringing alcohol wipes with me to clean my hands, especially before eating -- although in Shanghai, few people wear masks now."Show of confidenceThe coronavirus, first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan last December before spreading across the globe, has been largely contained in China since March. In the following months, small-scale outbreaks have occasionally flared -- from the country's northeast to the capital Beijing and the far western region of Xinjiang, but all were swiftly contained through stringent lockdown measures and mass testing programs.China has not reported any locally transmitted symptomatic case since mid-August, and is rigorously screening overseas arrivals and workers at risk of exposure to the virus. Last week, it detected its first local asymptomatic infections in over a month, after two port workers unloading frozen imported seafood in Qingdao tested positive for the virus in routine screening.The sense of control is in stark contrast to the anxiety and foreboding that had overshadowed China's last major travel period -- the Lunar New Year holiday in late January. Back then, the coronavirus outbreak was sweeping through Wuhan after local authorities initially silenced healthcare workers trying to sound the alarm. Two days before Lunar New Year's Day, the Chinese government ordered an unprecedented lockdown on the city, but by then, the virus had already spread to other provinces and beyond the country, as hundreds of millions of Chinese people headed home for family reunions or took vacations overseas.More than eight months on, China's restrictions on domestic movement have all been lifted. Officially, some cities still require passengers to produce a green health code on their smartphones at train stations and airports to show they're safe to travel, but implementation can be lax in practice.In a sign of the government's confidence in keeping the virus under control, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said last week that domestic travels can be arranged "as normal" for the upcoming holiday, given all cities in mainland China are marked as low risk for the coronavirus.But the center still recommended travelers obey local epidemic control measures, wear masks on trains, flights and in crowded places, and keep 1-meter (3.2 feet) distance at tourist spots -- the last of which could be difficult if not impossible to observe, given the size of crowds that often inundate popular sites during Chinese holidays.Last week, China's Culture and Tourism Ministry ordered tourist sites to restrict capacity to 75% during the Mid-Autumn Festival, up from a limit of 50% from previous months. To facilitate contact tracing, visitors are required to register online in advance.Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese CDC, told state broadcaster CCTV earlier this month that there is no need to impose extra restrictions for domestic travel during the National Day holiday, because the coronavirus is no longer circulating in society."It is now impossible to contract the virus in social environments," he said. "Although we are still finding dozens of imported cases among travelers arriving in China on international flights, the imported cases are managed in a closed loop and won't spread to society, and therefore won't have much impact on domestic residents."Domestic travel boostChinese authorities -- including the Chinese CDC and foreign ministry -- have urged Chinese citizens to avoid unnecessary overseas travel, citing the still-raging pandemic across the world.The Golden Week holiday -- the longest in China along with the Lunar New Year holiday -- has traditionally seen middle-class Chinese travel abroad in large numbers. Last year, more than 7 million overseas trips were made during the holiday, with Japan and Thailand among the top destinations, government data showed.But this year, overseas trips will be practically impossible to make, given the various visa restrictions and quarantine requirements imposed around the world, as well as a lack of international flights. Upon their return to China, travelers must also face two weeks of strict quarantine -- with at least half of the time required to be spent in government-appointed hotels.The only exception is Macau, which waived quarantine requirements in July for mainland travelers who obtained a negative test result for coronavirus within seven days. Last week, mainland China fully resumed tourist visas for the semi-autonomous region, just in time for the National Day holiday.As Chinese holidaymakers turn to domestic destinations, local governments are competing to attract tourists. According to Ctrip, more than 20 provincial and municipal governments have issued travel vouchers, while some 1,500 tourist spots across China have offered free or discounted tickets.China's railway operator, China State Railway Group, expected a total of 108 million train rides from September 28 to October 8. To cope with the increased Mid-Autumn Festival demand, an additional 1,200 trains have been added to service, but some tickets along popular routes have been snapped up anyway.Some flights have also sold out. Qunar, a Chinese online travel booking site, estimated more than 15 million domestic flight tickets would be sold for Golden Week, a 10% increase from 2019, partly due to a drop in the price of airfares.And on Chinese highways, massive traffic jams are expected again this year. An average of 51 million highway trips per day are expected during the eight-day holiday, a 1% to 3% increase from last year, according to the Transport Ministry.Wuhan, the original epicenter of the outbreak, has become a popular destination for Chinese tourists since its lockdown was lifted in April. Last month, Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, announced that nearly 400 of its tourist attractions would be open for tourists for free until the end of the year. On a booking platform set up by the province since the announcement, more than 3.74 million tickets for tourist sites in Wuhan were booked in just over a month, according to the state-run Hubei Daily.The Yellow Crane Tower, a famous landmark of Wuhan, topped the list of the most sought-after attractions for Golden Week, according to Ctrip.Load-Date: October 7, 2020End of Document

The TikTok Saga Shows How Unpredictable China Policies Are Right NowRealMoneySeptember 15, 2020 Tuesday 7:30 AM EDTCopyright 2020 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 483 wordsByline: Eric JhonsaHighlight: Time and time again, U.S. and/or Chinese tech stocks have made big moves on policy changes in Washington or Beijing that few saw coming.BodyFrom the start, the story of the fate of TikTok's U.S. operations has been a theater of the surreal, one in which observers could only expect the unexpected.Over the last six weeks or so, we've seen:Microsoft  , Oracle  , Walmart  and Twitter  all either confirm or be reported to have held talks with China's ByteDance to buy TikTok's operations in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand. President Trump suggest that the Treasury Department should get a cut of the proceeds from any TikTok sale. The Trump Administration issue executive orders calling for U.S. companies to cease transacting with either TikTok or Tencent's WeChat messaging app, within 45 days. The Trump Administration backtrack a little from those orders, stating that ByteDance would have 90 days to sell TikTok's U.S. ops and that American companies could continue working with WeChat in China. The Chinese government establish export controls allowing it to restrict the transfer of TikTok's content recommendation algorithm, and state that it would rather see TikTok shut down than sold. Microsoft end talks with TikTok after ByteDance stated that it wouldn't relinquish control of TikTok's algorithm or source code. ByteDance  -- it still requires U.S. government approval, which  right now -- under which ByteDance would retain ownership of TikTok, with Larry Ellison's firm acting as a "trusted technology provider" for TikTok in the U.S.. If you were able to predict this chain of events -- events that on a number of occasions  in U.S.-traded equities -- with any degree of accuracy, I tip my proverbial hat to you.Still, while the TikTok saga has been perhaps the most jarring example of a China-related situation involving tech companies in which political developments kept coming out of left field, it's definitely not the only one we've seen in recent years.In 2018 and 2019, trade war-related headlines frequently  in the shares of both Chinese tech firms and U.S. tech firms with significant Chinese exposure. And in 2019 and 2020, chip stocks  by news of new restrictions on sales that directly or indirectly involve Huawei.More recently, we saw chip equipment stocks sell off on reports that the U.S.  Huawei-type export controls on Chinese chip manufacturer SMIC. Also, though markets don't seem too concerned for now, Chinese tech stocks came under a bit of pressure earlier this year on fears that new accounting regulations  to be delisted from U.S. exchanges.It's possible that fewer such surprises would arrive during a Biden Administration. But at the same time, considering  there now is for tougher policies towards China, smooth sailing is hardly guaranteed.And for now, certainly, those investing in either Chinese tech companies or U.S. tech companies that do a lot of business in China should stay mindful of the impact that sudden policy changes in Washington or Beijing could end up having.Load-Date: September 16, 2020End of Document

INDONESIA MUM ON FATE OF UYGHUR PRISONERS REPORTEDLY DEPORTED TO CHINAStates News ServiceOctober 28, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 960 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:The fate of three Uyghurs allegedly deported by Indonesia to China after serving terrorism sentences is uncertain, with government officials in Jakarta tight-lipped about their whereabouts after they were released from prison.Two experts told BenarNews last week citing security sources whom they declined to identify that the trio and one other Uyghur convict had been deported to China, where authorities are believed to have held close to 2 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in internment camps, which the United States and several other nations have sharply criticized.Indonesian government officials have not confirmed or denied the claims by the two experts that the Uyghurs were deported to China in September."I don't have any information. Please check with the Ministry of Law and Human Rights," Foreign Ministry spokesman Teuku Faizasyah told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service, on Wednesday, when asked to comment on the report about recent Uyghur deportations.A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Law and Human Rights confirmed that three Uyghurs had been released from prison on Sept.19 and handed over to immigration authorities. A fourth person was still serving a six-year prison sentence, she said."Three foreign convicts were released from Class IIA Permisan Nusakambangan Penitentiary on September 19, 2020. They are Abdul Basit Tuzer bin Bazit, Ahmed Mahmud bin Mahmud Bozoglan and Abdullah (alias Atinci Bayram). On the same day, the three foreign convicts were handed over to immigration authorities," spokeswoman Rika Aprianti told BenarNews.The three men she named were among four sentenced by an Indonesian court in July 2015 to six years in prison, after being convicted of entering the country illegally with the intention of joining a local Islamic State-linked militant group, the Eastern Indonesia Mujahideen (MIT).Asked if the three had been deported, Rika referred BenarNews to immigration authorities.The head of public relations at the Directorate General of Immigration, Arvin Gumilang, told BenarNews, "We don't have information to share."In SecretLate last week, two experts told BenarNews that the four ethnic Uyghur men had been deported to China and that the Chinese government paid 100 million rupiah (U.S. $6,812) fines, which were part of their sentences.Deka Anwar, a researcher at the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC), and Muhammad Taufiqurrohman, a senior researcher at the Center for Radicalism and Deradicalization Studies (PAKAR), did not disclose their identities of their sources."They were deported in September and the fines were paid by the Chinese government," Deka said, citing sources at the prison where the men had been held."Immigration officers came to Nusa Kambangan with a letter to pick them up, saying they were to be transferred to an immigration detention center," Taufiqurrohman told BenarNews. He also confirmed the information that Chinese authorities had paid the Uyghur men's fines.Taufiqurrohman said Indonesia carried out the deportation of the four men in secret because many in the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation criticize China's alleged mistreatment of the Uyghurs, who mostly live in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) in northwestern China."The [Indonesian] government would be heavily criticized and be labelled as complicit in the Chinese government's oppression of Uyghur Muslims," if the deportation of the Uyghurs was made public, Taufiqurrohman said.For more than three years, the Chinese government has imprisoned hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs in detention camps and subjected those not detained to intense surveillance, religious restrictions and forced sterilizations, said a report published in June by the Council on Foreign Relations, a U.S.-based think-tank.Chinese officials have repeatedly denied these allegations, saying the camps are centers for vocational training and that the thousands of Uyghur Muslims arrested had links to extremism.'The same as killing them'Four years ago, Indonesia turned down a request from the Chinese government to exchange a fugitive Indonesian banker captured in China for four Uyghur prisoners serving terrorism-related sentences.Indonesia told China that a prisoner swap wasn't possible because the charges against the four Uyghurs were different from those against the Indonesian banker.Back then, an Indonesian official who requested anonymity said Indonesia would face international pressure if the country agreed to deport the Uyghur prisoners to China."Giving Uyghurs back to China is the same as killing them. Most probably, the Chinese government will execute them instantly," the official told BenarNews in April 2016.Thousands of Uyghurs have fled China since their alleged persecution began in 2012, and made their way to Turkey and other countries.IPAC's Deka said that between 2014 and 2016, at least 13 Uyghurs had entered Indonesia illegally via Malaysia and joined radical groups.The four Uyghurs convicted in 2015 came to Indonesia with the intention of joining the militant MIT group and "performing acts of terror," said the judge who led a panel of jurists that convicted the men.The Uyghurs' lawyer had argued that they were Turkish citizens vacationing in Indonesia, but government lawyers said the men had fake Turkish passports and were en route to meet Indonesia's most wanted terrorist of that time, Santoso, when they were arrested in Central Sulawesi in September 2014.Santoso was killed by security forces in July 2016.Six Uyghur men who joined MIT were killed in 2016 during a large security operation in Poso regency.Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Load-Date: October 29, 2020End of Document

WISE PEOPLE KNOW THAT WINNING A WAR IS NO BETTER THAN LOSING ONEIPS - Inter Press ServiceSeptember 18, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 IPS - Inter Press Service/Global Information NetworkLength: 1631 wordsByline: External SourceDateline: Sep 18 2020 BodyUS President Donald Trump and his 'war council' - led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo - have amplified their aggression against China. What began as a trade dispute in the 1990s has now escalated into the United States making an existential challenge against China.The threat against China is made not for irrational reasons, but for perfectly rational ones, which are laid out below in our Red Alert no. 9 (also available as a separate download from our website). These have to do with the emergence of China as a major economic and technological power. What most rankles the US ruling class is that the various hybrid war techniques to weaken or overthrow the government are simply not available. The only means at the disposal of the United States to hold on to its power - chillingly - is armed force.Is the United States trying to impose a war on China?For the past several decades, the US has conducted a trade war against China. There are two key issues that worry the United States: first, a trade imbalance that benefits China, and, second, the growth of the Chinese technology sector. Techniques that the US has used against China include: pressuring China to revalue its currency against the dollar, pressuring China to prevent 'piracy' on intellectual property in order to slow down its domestic intellectual property developments, and pressuring China to slow down or cease its Belt and Road Initiative.The US has now begun a war against the Chinese economy. The attempt to isolate Huawei and ZTE from their suppliers and their markets will have a debilitating impact on the growth potential of the Chinese economy. The US has sanctioned roughly 152 companies that make chips and other products for Huawei and ZTE. Increased bans - through the US government's Clean Network initiative - would prevent US companies from using Chinese cloud services and undersea cables, and it would ban Chinese apps from appearing on app stores. The US government has increased pressure on other countries to join in this campaign.The US government has increased its military pressure along the eastern rim of China. This includes the 2017 revival of the Quad (Australia, India, Japan, and the US), the creation of the US' Indo-Pacific Strategy (its key document from 2020 is called 'Regain the Advantage'), and the development of a range of new weaponry, including cyberweapons. This military power has come alongside hostile rhetoric against China, with attention focused on Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and Taiwan, and the depiction of the coronavirus pandemic as a 'China virus'. Evidence is not as important here as the use of older racist and anti-Communist ideas to demonise China.Why is the US increasing its pressure against China?China's technological advances could result in a generational advantage over the West. China's scientific and technological developments came because of the country's investment in higher education and in its ability to transfer technology from firms that entered the country to manufacture goods. In 2018, Chinese scholars for the first time published more scientific articles than their colleagues in the US, and Chinese firms filed more patent applications than US firms. Chinese tech firms have now produced products that appear to be ahead of US, European, and Japanese products. Examples for this include 5G, BeiDou (a better mapping technology than GPS), high-speed trains, and robots.Faced with US pressure, China has crafted an independent trade and development agenda. Since the world financial crisis, China began diversifying its economy from reliance upon the US and European markets to build up its own internal market and to increase engagement with the Global South. The immediate projects that developed included the Belt and Road Initiative, the String of Pearls Initiative, the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and the China-Community of Latin American and Caribbean States Forum. The Chinese government has also begun to pay more attention to the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). These moves come alongside a remarkable poverty eradication programme.Currently, China is highly dependent on imported energy - such as gas from ASEAN nations, Australia, and Qatar. The China-Russia 6000kms 'Power of Siberia' pipeline will bring 38 billion cubic metres of natural gas, a substantial increase to meet the demands for the 90 billion cubic meters consumed by China. In 2014, Russia's multinational energy corporation Gazprom and the China National Petroleum Corporation signed a $400 billion for a thirty-year deal.Increasingly, China has attempted to build institutions outside of Western-controlled trade and development architecture, including the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (founded in 2014). As part of this, China has committed to de-dollarisation; China has proposed to hold its reserves and to conduct trade in currencies other than the US dollar. This is a long-term but inevitable development, and one that threatens the overall role of the Wall Street-Dollar complex. China's cooperation with Russia is most advanced in this arena, with about 50% of Russia-China trade conducted in roubles and yuan (Russia owns about 25% of the global yuan reserves). Both Russia and China are divesting themselves of their dollar reserves. In January 2020, Russia sold $101 billion, or 50%, of its dollar reserves and moved $44 billion into Euros and $44 billion into yuan. The yuan, however, represents only 2% of global currency reserves.Against the eastward expansion of NATO and the emergence of the Quad, China and Russia have crafted a military and diplomatic Eurasian security bloc. This is evident in the arms deals and the military exercises, but also in diplomatic coordination. For example, Russian and Chinese foreign ministry spokespersons Maria Zakharova and HuaChunying said in late July that they would join efforts in combatting the information war against China and Russia. Chinese diplomats have taken a more forthright attitude in their statements; they have been dubbed the 'wolf warrior diplomats', an allusion to a popular film where a Chinese soldier from an elite Wolf Warrior troop defeats a group of terrorists led by an ex-US Navy Seal.Clearly, the US has found that Chinese leadership has been unwilling to go the Gorbachev road - namely, to surrender the Chinese model to the will of the United States. There is no possibility that the Communist Party of China will dissolve itself. The Chinese middle class - possible fodder for a 'colour revolution' - does not have any appetite to overthrow the government. It is content with the direction of the government and sees that its government has improved living standards and has been able - unlike Western governments - to tackle the Coronavirus pandemic (as we write about in a series on 'CoronaShock'). A Harvard University study shows that the government led by the Communist Party of China has increased its approval from 2003 to 2016, largely because of the social welfare programmes and the fight against corruption pushed by both the Communist Party of China and by the Chinese government. The overall approval stands at 93%.What contradictions does the US war project face?Chinese economic developments - such as the country's capacity to outspend the US in development aid to outbid Western firms in trade deals - has produced alliances between China and key capitalist sectors in countries that have otherwise been secure US allies. Examples of this are amongst sections of the capitalist class in the Philippines and Sri Lanka, where Chinese investment has been welcomed.The Chinese state has intensified its intervention in the tech sector inside China, with a $14 billion private and public fund to support tech developments. Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) - China's top chip company - had an initial public offering (IPO) in Shanghai which netted $7. 5 billion. As a consequence of such funds and its own scientific developments, China will soon be able to bypass the US chip firms.China's economic capacity continues to exert pressure on fragments of capital in different countries. For instance, Australian mining companies rely upon China to buy iron ore from Australia. These companies lobby Canberra not to take too hostile a position against China. Roughly one third of Australia's total exports go to China; these include soy, barley, meat, fruits, gas, and the raw minerals. The Australian government is forced to acknowledge these concerns, even though it has a longer-term perspective than the short-term profit concerns of the mining conglomerates. China has already hedged its bets, increasing purchases of soy and meat from Argentina and Brazil, and it will likely buy more mined goods from Brazil (Brazil's Vale is using massive ships to carry mined goods to China).The US military is stretched thin between the conflicts in Venezuela and Iran, and now in China. The US Navy has had four secretaries in a year, part of the chaos in the Trump administration. As a consequence, the US Navy has complained about the lack of ability to handle so many theatres of war at the same time. China has developed sophisticated defence mechanisms, such as cyber warfare techniques that have the ability to shut down US communications, starting with their satellites, and such as their Dongfeng missiles, which are capable of hitting the US navy ships that are in the South China Sea.The eighth century Chinese poet Li Bai wrote of the ugliness of war; as far as war is concerned, nothing has changed over the centuries.Soldiers smear their blood on the dry grassWhile generals map the next campaign.Wise people know winning a warIs no better than losing one.Load-Date: September 19, 2020End of Document

Trump is stealing China's playbook to deal with TikTokCNN WireSeptember 27, 2020 Sunday 00:54Invalid date found for VDI: 1600994732 XCEDOCID: 0 LNI: 60XT-BSW1-DY7V-G1JF-00000-00. Date output 'as-is'.GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1394 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  The race to keep TikTok operating in the United States has turned into a saga of intricate dealmaking and political flattery. It's exactly the kind of scenario that's already par for the course for American companies that want to do business in China (and for those, like Facebook and Google, that are shut out of the world's second biggest economy). Experts warn that the more Washington's playbook starts to mimic Beijing's, the more at risk the world's internet is of fracturing beyond repair with enormous implications for global business. The deal to save TikTok's US business would see Walmart and Oracle take a minority stake in a US-based company called Tiktok Global. While an announcement earlier this month implied that Beijing-based ByteDance would continue to own most of the short-form video app, developments since then have muddied the waters. ByteDance would itself hold zero percent of the new entity, a person familiar with the deal told CNN Business earlier this week. Instead, TikTok Global would be partially owned by ByteDance's international and Chinese investors. The agreement would make Oracle TikTok's "trusted technology partner," and give the California-based tech firm the ability to store the app's American user data and review its source code. Other aspects of the deal have also become heavily politicized. US President Donald Trump said last weekend that he asked the companies involved to "do me a favor" by bankrolling a $5 billion education fund to teach people the "real history of our country." While it doesn't appear that such a fund will ever materialize, Walmart and Oracle have promised that the deal would coincidentally result in US tax payments totaling that exact amount. For American companies that work in China, the broad strokes of this deal might seem familiar. Beijing often forces foreign businesses to form joint ventures with local firms and establish offshoot entities. "I think there is some era of retaliation here, where, 'Hey, if you're going to do this to our companies --- shut us out or force us to localize --- then we're going to do it to you as well,'" said Dipayan Ghosh, the co-director of the Digital Platforms and Democracy Project at the Harvard Kennedy School.More similar to China than EuropeTrump's threat to ban TikTok if the app is not sold to a US company is founded on the fear that otherwise, American user data risks winding up in the hands of the Chinese government. (Tiktok has denied this as a possibility and says it keeps US data stateside, with a backup in Singapore.)The fight over TikTok has sparked a political firestorm in the United States. But it's not exactly an unusual concern overseas, where governments have long been worried about how much access US tech firms have to information about their citizens. That unease has increased in the years since Edward Snowden, a former contractor who worked with the US National Security Agency, revealed in documents leaked to the news media that the American government tapped into people's data through tech companies like Microsoft, Google and Apple.The European Union has for years tussled with US companies over concerns about data privacy and surveillance. That was a big part of the reason for passing 2018's landmark General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which gave consumers much more control over their personal data and forced companies to ensure that the way they collect, process and store data is safe. Europe has continued to strengthen its privacy laws, and this summer struck down an agreement that allowed companies to move data between Europe and the United States over concerns that it did not sufficiently protect Europeans from US surveillance. Now that the United States has been forced to reckon with a foreign company that has broad access to US user data, though, the country is taking an approach that resembles China's far more than it does Europe's. American companies have known for decades that working with China requires a lot of sacrifice. Microsoft, which has a longstanding history in the country, agreed to give the Chinese government access to its source code in 2003 to address national security concerns. The company said at the time that sharing that information was intended to help foreign governments "be confident in the security of the Windows platform."The steps taken by other US firms that have access to Chinese user data bear resemblance to the TikTok proposal in other ways. Apple's iCloud services in mainland China are operated by a Chinese company, for example. The Silicon Valley firm was forced to do so to comply with the country's cybersecurity rules, which require companies to store data on Chinese users domestically."The US is copying what the Chinese have done," said James Lewis, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank based in Washington, D.C. "Trump is taking a nationalistic approach."A nationalistic AmericaThat way of doing things has consequences, though. Experts have for months been warning that tensions between the United States and China are creating a world where tech firms are viewed more as national actors instead of multinational ones. And as the relationship between the world's two largest economies deteriorates, the fallout risks creating what Eurasia Group once called a "new virtual Berlin Wall.""The US was always about the international system and following the rules," Lewis said. "A more nationalistic America is harder for everyone, not just the Chinese." After all, China's philosophy on technology led the country to create its Great Firewall, a massive censorship mechanism that shuts out content widely available elsewhere on the internet. Beijing closely monitors and manages that system, having realized the potential for the internet to impact the way its populace views the world. When the internet was invented more than 30 years ago and became commercialized in the decades afterward, "we thought of this as a platform over which any person in the world can communicate with anyone else in the world," said Ghosh of the Harvard Kennedy School. He added that closing off the web could sow division worldwide. Washington has increasingly indicated that it is willing to head down that path, though. In August, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the government would seek to restrict the reach of Chinese companies in the United States by banning them from app stores, cloud services and other digital networks."What worries me is that the US is becoming China by trying to block off apps," said Susan Ariel Aaronson, a professor at George Washington University, where she directs a digital trade and data governance hub. "We too are censoring; we too are intervening in the markets for data."Many experts have pointed out that the United States has legitimate concerns when it comes to safeguarding the data of American citizens. Instead of singling out Chinese companies, though, they say the United States should develop universal standards for data collection and use.Ghosh, for example, said a European approach, like a US version of GDPR, may be the right way forward. "What that means is that if you want to do business with American consumers over the internet, you have to be subject to these general baseline privacy restrictions," he said. That may include giving citizens the right to delete data or to be "forgotten," a measure that allows citizens to request that links containing personal information about them be removed from search results.Whatever Washington decides, though, the country's actions are likely to set a powerful precedent. Take India, for example, which has already banned a bunch of Chinese apps during a broader geopolitical tussle."If we continue to play the game of whack-a-mole with Chinese apps that are perceived as a threat, I don't think that makes us anymore secure," said Samm Sacks, a fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank New America who studies cybersecurity and US-China relations. "I think that what that does is it creates a ripple effect, where other countries around the world will say, 'This is a blueprint on how to block a powerful technology company under the guise of national security.'" TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

UYGHUR YOUTH HELD AFTER POSTING RARE VIDEOS CRITICIZING GOVERNMENT FROM INSIDE CHINAStates News ServiceSeptember 18, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1035 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A young Uyghur man has been arrested after he published a series of videos that went viral criticizing Chinese authorities over rights abuses against his family and compatriots in the restive Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) where more than a million Uyghurs are locked up in internment camps.A Xinjiang government official confirmed with RFA's Uyghur Service on Friday that Miradil Hesen was arrested in eastern China's Jiangsu province where Hesen said he had been sought by police since August 2018 for downloading Instagramwhich is blocked in the countryto his cellphone."He was arrested because he intentionally attacked and demonized China ... He created a huge issue," a female government party commission official in Onsu (in Chinese, Wensu) county in the XUAR's Aksu (Akesu) prefecture told RFA. "His intentional online attacks and rumor-mongering has caused a huge impact in Wensu county."In six videos posted to YouTube between Sept. 2 and Sept. 4, Hesen slammed the authorities for abuses on his mother, who he said was forced to undergo sterilization that he claimed led to uterine cancer, and his grandfather, who has retired as a village secretary but may have his government pension stripped.His criticism in the videos were accessible by people in Xinjiang, based on interviews by RFA. Usually such videos would have been removed promptly by the authorities.Uyghurs in exile say it's remarkable that a Uyghur inside China would be able to film this and then share it on sites like YouTube.Appearing disheveled and troubled by the alleged abuses of his family and his community, Hesen said that he had graduated from university in Jiangsu but was made to return home to Aksu in early 2018 to "register" with authorities after they pressured his parents.Speaking at times in Uyghur, Mandarin Chinese, and English, Hesen says in the videos that he fled to Jiangsu after being contacted by police in his home district of Dapsen, in Onsu over the Instagram download."The purpose was to arrest me and send me to an internment camp, but I escaped to Jiangsu," he says. Authorities are believed to have held up to 1.8 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in a vast network of internment camps in the XUAR since April 2017, often for similar acts they label signs of "extremism."In the videos, Hesen mentions details about his mother, Tursungul Tohtiniyaz, whom he claims sought cancer treatment at the Hospital of Oncology in Urumqi in 2017 after complications related to forced sterilization."I'm sharing this today to inform you of the bad things that the CCP [the Chinese Communist Party] is doing to Uyghur women in Uyghurstan," Hesen said in one video, using a name preferred by some Uyghurs for their ancestral homeland.Hesen also discussed family planning campaigns that German researcher Adrian Zenz said in a June report had led to a dramatic increase in recent years in the number of forced sterilizations and abortions targeting Uyghurs in the region, suggesting they may amount to a government-led campaign of genocide under United Nations definitions.Hesen posted his last video to YouTube on Sept. 4 and then went silent, suggesting he had been arrested.RFA was able to verify some of the details cited by him in his videos after talking to several officials in Onsu county, including his mother's formal complaint against an administrator of the hospital where she was treated for cancer.From Germany, World Uyghur Congress President Dolkun Isa said he was "deeply worried" about Hesen following his arrest. "We call on the Chinese government to immediately release him and guarantee his life and liberty.""Miradil Hesen risked his life and gave online testimony about the unspeakable suffering of the Uyghur people in recent years under China's brutal rule," Isa said. "He talked about local authorities' horrific treatment of his family and especially the sterilization of his mother and subsequent hospitalization due to uterine cancer."Speaking for the voicelessAccording to Hesen, he has been homeless for the past two years since going to Jiangsu and that he had cut all links with his family members in XUAR, fearing that he could be caught or that his parents might be targeted.While it is not immediately clear why Hesen chose to create the videos despite the danger it could create for himself and his family members, he says he "received messages from God" to "speak out for those who do not have a voice" and could no longer refrain from doing so.In his videos, with Han Chinese pedestrians walking behind him, Hesen refers to himself as the founder of the "Freedom Movement of Uyghurstan" and notes that it is rare for members of his ethnic group to be able to air grievances about the persecution they face in the XUAR under Beijing's policies.While he describes how Uyghurs endure discrimination and restrictions on movement at the hands of Han Chinese authorities in the region, he also details several of the harsher forms of repression RFA's Uyghur Service has documented through its reporting in recent years, including severe restrictions on religion and culture, the internment camp system, and the transition of detainees into forced labor schemes.Hesen's YouTube postings come a month after the BBC published a video of a young Uyghur man who risked severe punishment to take a video of himself in detention in the XUAR and later disappeared, along with his aunt, who sent the video out of the country.The nearly five-minute video showed Merdan Ghappar, a 31-year-old Uyghur model for Chinese online retailer Taobao, shackled to a bed in filthy living conditions while political slogans are played over a loudspeaker outside his barred window.The video, and several text messages Merdan sent, appears to show some of the best evidence yet of China's continuing policy of mass incarceration of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities, in contradiction of a government narrative that all detainees have "graduated" from the facilities that officials refer to as "vocational schools."Reported by Shohret Hoshur for RFA's Uyghur Service.

TikTok ban could herald new era of internet policing, social upheavalThe Miscellany News: Vassar CollegeSeptember 9, 2020 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINIONS; Pg. 1Length: 1235 wordsBodyThe popular video-sharing app TikTok has recently come under fire in many countries, allegedly for user privacy issues. First, India banned it entirely, alongside 59 other Chinese-owned mobile apps. Shortly after, news broke that Australia was considering similar bans. Now, the U.S. federal government has presented TikTok and the highly popular messaging app WeChat an ultimatum-be sold to a U.S. company, or be banned from operating in the United States. Given that the app's data theft has not been confirmed, these actions seem to be less about the app and more about responding to the growing global influence of China. In the face of recent skirmishes between the People's Liberation Army and the Indian Armed Forces that left dozens dead at the Sino-Indian border, increasing Chinese interference in external politics and a burgeoning conflict between India, China and the United States, it's easy to dismiss the TikTok incident as a sideshow to the main tension. I believe, though, that what happens to TikTok will determine the trajectory of the next age in our digital world.Governments banning mobile apps or barring companies from operating is far from new, but typically they are banned for specific legal violations, such as infringing copyright or aiding in unlawful assembly. Think Huawei, the phone company that was banned for violating U.S. sanctions on Iran. The TikTok/WeChat situation in the United States, in contrast, is ostensibly a measure to protect citizen data from Chinese intelligence. From a national security perspective, this isn't inherently a bad idea-limiting the ability of foreign powers to potentially influence and spy on your people through the internet could theoretically do wonders. However, it's also very unlike the Open Internet standards that the United States pioneered and continues to champion. Shutting out foreign internet services to protect the state is ironically much more like modern China. The Chinese government's Great Firewall is effectively the same ban, but applied to nearly all foreign content, and is currently one of the most well-known features of Chinese society. While it may be a one-off decision, an action so drastic suggests the U.S. government is now open to the idea of blocking off large swathes of the internet. If that's the case, previously outlandish ideas of the United States cutting residents off from interacting with the people of rival countries now seem highly probable. Add in the general isolationism and concerns over fake news of the Trump administration, and our free internet suddenly looks much less safe now than it did before.The potential TikTok ban also raises concerns about competing states pressuring individual companies to pick a side. Typically, states economically harm each other with tariffs and trade wars, targeting sectors but not individual companies. As a result, businesses do suffer, but are never specially pressured into bowing down to a rival government to survive. After all, they're just collateral damage in a fight between higher powers. In this case, however, the Trump administration is forcing TikTok to choose-be bought by a U.S. company, which would ensure a ban in China, or stay with China and part with the U.S. market. In other words, pick a side in the world's largest current geopolitical conflict. If the app stays with China, as it's likely to do, it will suffer financially, but the company and the world at large aren't substantially affected. If TikTok's owners decide greater profit is to be found siding with the United States, however, massive repercussions would ensue. Besides being a largely impactful political gesture, TikTok siding with the United States would effectively endorse the country as the better market for businesses. With lots of China's power in relation to the United States stemming from its hugely significant economy, such a large stain on its reputation would pose a threat to its ability to maintain its astronomical growth and global standing.To be clear, TikTok siding with the United States is very unlikely. If it happens, it would show the ultimatum tactic to be effective, and thus make it very attractive to both countries. I find it likely in such a scenario that both countries would subsequently push similar threats onto other corporations, forcing dozens of large businesses to make very difficult decisions. After all, the NBA is a quintessentially American company, but the amount of basketball players in China is reportedly the size of the United States' entire population. From a profit perspective, it's possible that the group might find China the better country for them in the long run. Similarly, many U.S. goods and services have strong ties to China. Popular American services like League of Legends, Clash of Clans and AMC Theatres (the largest theater chain in the world) are entirely owned by Chinese companies. Additionally, the cheap price and lax labor laws of Chinese manufacturing are essential to the business models of many American multinational corporations. If any of these organizations had to choose, there's no guarantee they would stay with the United States. If the world powers see reason to keep pushing companies in this way, the economic impact of hundreds of companies leaving their homes could be disastrous. These possibilities are contingent on TikTok caving into United States pressure, which makes the social media company's current actions all the more important. Regardless of what it decides, however, I believe the ultimatum itself demonstrates a newfound and very ominous display of internet understanding by the U.S. federal government. It means the internet could be used as an avenue for much more policing. In the past, the U.S. federal government repeatedly demonstrated a rudimentary understanding of the digital world, of which the FCC attempting to abandon net neutrality and the confusion at Facebook hearings in 2018 are particularly famous examples. However, technology and social media can be hugely useful to law enforcement-for example, smaller U.S. police departments have used Snapchat stories to bust underage parties, and have tried to pair facial recognition with social media posts to arrest protesters and rioters. The sudden shift from the U.S. government chronically misunderstanding the digital age to being cognizant of, and taking action over, data theft at the highest levels of government-plus the heavily covered meetings between Trump and Big Tech leaders-shows that the U.S. government has finally started to catch up. Coupled with the presence of a government that has shown authoritarian aspirations, I think it's very likely the TikTok ban signals the beginning of a new age of increased digital surveillance in this country. At the end of the day, the Trump administration banning TikTok, in and of itself, is likely something we'll forget in the years to come. A rival social media site will supplant it in whatever country it leaves behind, and the world will move on. I think, however, that it is the canary in the coal mine, signaling the coming of a new era in the information age. Depending on how the end of 2020 plays out, with strife amplified by the concerns of the pandemic, border skirmishes and a globally receding economy, the TikTok ultimatum could be the start of a much more turbulent and much more surveilled digital age worldwide.Load-Date: September 10, 2020End of Document

Weird science: How a 'shoddy' Bannon-backed paper on coronavirus origins made its way to an audience of millionsCNN.comOctober 21, 2020 Wednesday 7:39 PM ESTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 2671 wordsByline: By Rob Kuznia, Scott Bronstein, Drew Griffin and Curt Devine, CNNBodyIt was a blockbuster story. A respected Chinese virologist appeared on Tucker Carlson's show on Fox News in mid-September to share the results of her just-completed report. The conclusion: The novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19 was likely engineered in a Chinese lab. On Carlson's show, she claimed it was intentionally released into the world.Then, its validity began to unravel. The publication of the paper by lead author Li-Meng Yan -- an expatriate from China seeking asylum in the US -- was quickly linked to former White House adviser Steve Bannon, long a strident critic of China's government. The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security -- a leading authority on the pandemic --?criticized the science behind the report, and pointed out that Yan and her co-authors "cite multiple papers in their reference section that have weaknesses or flaws."A CNN review of Yan's research found it was also built on what appears to be the same theories, similar passages and identical charts presented by an anonymous blogger whose writings were posted on a website linked to Bannon months earlier. Additionally, a source told CNN the three co-authors of Yan's paper used pseudonyms instead of their real names, a practice frowned upon in scientific and academic work.Yet, even after Facebook slapped a "false information" flag on Carlson's September 15 interview with Yan and Twitter suspended Yan's account, Carlson, Bannon and Yan have pressed forward."You'd think that our media would want to get to the bottom of this pandemic," Carlson said on his October 6 show, "but instead they ignored her claims."Yan -- who is back on Twitter -- published a second report on October 8 titled "SARS-CoV-2 is an Unrestricted Bioweapon," which doubled down on the theory that the virus sweeping the globe was manmade and added that its "unleashing" was intentional. That study also included material seemingly copied from the anonymous blogger.Both of Yan's controversial papers link to Bannon.Prominently featured on both -- just beneath the title and authors, in a manner that resembles how university affiliations and funding sources are often listed -- are the Rule of Law Society and the Rule of Law Foundation.The twin non-profit ventures were announced in November 2018 by Bannon and billionaire Guo Wengui, aka Miles Guo, a Chinese exile and fierce critic of the current regime in China. Bannon was arrested on Guo's yacht this summer for the unrelated allegation that he defrauded donors who contributed to his crowdfunding campaign to support President Donald Trump's border wall.The two men have repeatedly advanced the theory that the coronavirus came out of a Chinese bioweapons program -- a claim that has been widely panned as groundless -- using as their primary platforms a podcast hosted by Bannon and a website called G News, which publishes their content. Their names are prominently displayed in the top banner of the site's home page.This month, while praising Yan's work on Bannon's podcast, Bannon and Guo went as far as to suggest that China deliberately infected President Trump with the coronavirus.That podcast -- called "War Room: Pandemic" -- was recorded the day after Trump was hospitalized for Covid-19.Bannon credited Guo for saying from the beginning that the virus not only purposefully emerged from the labs, but that "a target is Donald J. Trump."Bannon asked Guo: "Do you believe that a super-spreader or somebody, was actually sent and somehow has been focused on the White House or focused on President --""100 percent," Guo said.Bannon himself appeared on Carlson's show on September 17 -- two days after Carlson's interview with Yan -- where he touted Yan's "amazing paper" and blasted social-media outlets for slowing its spread without revealing his own connection to the study.Carlson included a disclaimer in a later interview with Yan on October 6, saying, "we are not endorsing your findings." But a Fox News spokesperson declined to address CNN's question of why Carlson hasn't disclosed Bannon's involvement with Yan's paper when discussing her research on several shows.Bannon did not respond to CNN's request for comment; Yan declined a request to be interviewed and did not answer repeated requests for responses to specific questions.Flawed citations, copied passages, mysterious co-authorsIt was precisely the megaphone provided by Carlson and Bannon online and on TV that prompted the researchers at Johns Hopkins to issue a rebuttal, according to two of the Johns Hopkins authors, who spoke with CNN."It was clear on social media that the paper was getting more and more attention," said Nancy D. Connell, a microbial geneticist and a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins. "We talked carefully and thought for a long time whether to do it.""On the one hand we don't want to give credence to just so much garbage," added Gigi Kwik Gronvall, an immunologist who is also a senior scholar at the institution. "On the other hand, because it's getting taken seriously, it's important to point out that this is not science ... It's infuriating, because everybody has better things to do."The Johns Hopkins response to Yan's paper takes issue with the science, launching into a point-by-point rebuttal. It also includes a section pointing out "weaknesses or flaws" in the paper's citations.One footnote, for instance, leads to an essay by an entrepreneur that only appears on his LinkedIn page after it was rejected by a scientific journal. Billy Zhang, a sole-proprietor consultant in Massachusetts who works with investors and governments in China, told CNN he was surprised to learn that his critique was cited in Yan's report. LinkedIn initially removed his post, but later decided to reinstate it.Another footnote is attributed to an article authored by a writer and editor for an anti-genetically modified food website. Another still traces to an author CNN could not locate, who says he runs a company that appears not to exist. The paper of that author, Dean Bengston, links to a page listing him as the CEO of a Las Vegas company called Meandering Path. But a search of the business name on the Nevada Secretary of State website?-- as well as registries for surrounding states and other business databases --?turned up no matching results.Equally troubling for a scholarly paper was CNN's discovery that Yan's papers bear a strong resemblance to blogs first published on G News. Yan's papers contain paragraph after paragraph of identical theories and similar phrasing to the blogs, with some lines lifted nearly word for word.What's more, Yan's three co-authors in both papers -- Shu Kang, Jie Guan and Shanchang Hu -- are pseudonyms, a source told CNN. It's a practice that is highly unusual in such research and generally discouraged due to the resulting lack of accountability and transparency, experts told CNN. The source didn't know why the use of pseudonyms wasn't disclosed in the papers."They are all Chinese but based here in the US," the source said. "They did not want their real names out there for fear of their families back in China."Dr. Daniel Lucey, an infectious-disease epidemics expert at Georgetown University, said he can't think of another case of authors using pseudonyms in a scientific paper."If you used a fake name, then it would start calling into question, under normal circumstances -- if they weren't honest about their name, then what else are they not honest about?" he said.But Lucey said the authors' concerns in this case might have merit."I would also think that the four coauthors would be worried about themselves in terms of ever going back to the mainland or Hong Kong," he said. "It's a real thing."As part of its review, CNN spoke with a half-dozen experts from multiple institutions, and all of them found Yan's methodology to be flawed. They described her report as "junk science," "leaps of logic" and "window dressing."Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University, said she believes Yan's report set out to deceive for the purpose of spreading "political propaganda.""This paper is very deceptive to somebody without a scientific background, because it's written in very technical language, using a lot of jargon that makes it sound as though it is a legitimate scientific paper," she told CNN. "But anybody with an actual background in virology or molecular biology who reads this paper will realize that much of it is actually nonsense."Anna Mapp, an associate dean and research professor at the University of Michigan, agreed. "I was really disturbed to see such a shoddy piece of work that I would not accept if turned in to me by one of my own students receiving such attention and being treated as a valid scientific paper," she told CNN. (It was Mapp's graduate student, Amanda Peiffer -- who's working toward a PhD in chemical biology -- who first alerted CNN to issues with the citations at the end of Yan's paper.)Lucey of Georgetown told CNN that he met with Yan in person to discuss her paper on September 6 -- eight days before it was published.His criticism was more muted than that of the other scientists who spoke with CNN; Lucey said he found some of what Yan had to say noteworthy. Ultimately, though, he said he disagrees with Yan's conclusion and told her he couldn't vouch for her science because he's not a molecular virologist.Lucey said at one point, after much back and forth, he asked Yan a big-picture question: Why would China release a government-engineered virus in Wuhan? Lucey said Yan couldn't provide an answer that he considered plausible.Lucey said he believes the virus originated in nature. But he disagrees with the much-publicized theory that it jumped from an animal to a human at a seafood market in December."Based on what I know about how epidemics have started, I think that it was at least several months earlier," he said. "It could have been out there for more than a year (before December). It's possible."To be sure, there is no scientific consensus on where the novel coronavirus -- SARS-CoV-2 -- originated. Most of the scientific community -- including Anthony Fauci, the United States' top infectious disease expert -- believes it was not manmade. Other credible scientists ?floated the possibility the virus may have leaked from a Wuhan lab, although some contend that an article in Nature Medicine has debunked the notion.?Yan's first paper claims to refute that widely cited Nature Medicine article, published in mid-March, which concluded that SARS-CoV-2 most likely came from nature and not "purposeful manipulation."Neither of Yan's papers are peer-reviewed, which by itself is not a disqualifier. Researchers often publish early drafts of their work on what are known as scientific preprint servers to quickly share findings that could benefit the public -- a practice that has accelerated in the urgent age of the coronavirus.?Yan says she's in hidingMany experts who read Yan's research said they found it hard to reconcile the work with her seemingly impressive pedigree, which includes a stint at the University of Hong Kong's public health laboratory -- a World Health Organization collaborating facility. She has been published in Nature and The Lancet -- two prestigious academic journals -- and says she was among the first researchers in the world to become privy to the dangers of SARS-CoV-2."Dr. Yan's history and training is excellent," Rasmussen said. "I'd really like to hear from her why she decided to do this, because effectively, it has ruined her credibility as a virologist and it would be a career ending mistake to make."Yan says she fled to the United States in April, according to a Fox News story. In that July piece, she went public with an allegation: Yan claimed that the Chinese government and the WHO had kept mum about their knowledge of the person-to-person transmission of the virus for weeks, even after Yan herself had said she raised the issue with her superiors in late December or early January."The reason I came to the US is because I deliver the message of the truth of COVID," Yan, saying she feared for her life, told the network from an undisclosed location in the US.The Chinese government, WHO and the University of Hong Kong have vehemently denied her July accusation of a coverup.In her October 6 interview with Carlson, Yan said her mother was arrested by Chinese authorities for making allegations against China on her prior appearances on Fox News. The Chinese government didn't respond to a detailed list of questions from CNN about this and other allegations by Yan.It's unclear where Yan is staying in the US -- and the extent to which she knows Bannon and Guo.But a photo that circulated on Twitter last month and was posted on G News appeared to capture the reflection of a smiling Yan in the mirror behind the two men in the foreground: Wang DingGang, board chair of the Rule of Law Society, and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Bannon's image can also be seen in the photo.Although Bannon and Guo's Rule of Law Society and Rule of Law Foundation are listed under the titles of Yan's reports, neither paper mentions Bannon or Guo, or elaborates on the role the organizations have played in their creation.Guo responded to CNN's questions about the link with a statement that said Yan's publications were researched and written independently."I have repeatedly stated since as early as January of this year that the COVID-19 pandemic was created by the Chinese Communist Party with the worst of intentions. I stand by these statements," Guo said. "I proudly support Dr. Yan in her efforts to stand up against the CCP mafia and tell the world the truth about COVID-19. Dr. Yan is a hero for her whistleblowing against the CCP and should be commended for her work and personal sacrifice."Bannon has played up the nonprofits' early and persistent promotion of the lab-origin story.?"I want to thank Miles Guo because it was Miles Guo and the whistleblower movement, Miles Guo and the Rule of Law Society, the Rule of Law Foundation, that back in early January really got us to start to focus on this," Bannon said on his podcast on October 3.The two also discussed Yan in that episode, with Guo suggesting she could help prove that the virus was made in a lab. But they made no mention of their connection to her report.?Yan herself has appeared several times on Bannon's podcast. In August, she said the communist regime does "evil things" and discussed its history of persecuting its own people.The Rule of Law Foundation and Rule of Law Society responded to questions from CNN with two identical statements, signed by their respective board chairs, Hao Haidong and Wang DingGang.Each statement expresses support for Dr. Yan "and any other Chinese asylee who seeks to tell the world the truth about the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) corruption, atrocious human rights record, and its role in the spread of COVID-19."Dr. Yan has independently researched COVID-19 and we respect her findings and desire to speak the truth about COVID-19 to the public," the statement says."Our support of Dr. Yan has never included influencing, altering, or editing her scientific research and findings."The statement said her reference to the organizations in the report "was solely done as an appreciation of our support in helping her flee Hong Kong and avoid arrest for her COVID-19 whistleblowing."Rasmussen of Columbia University says the possibility of an accidental lab release or even of an engineered virus can't be ruled out, but said either scenario is extremely unlikely -- and Yan's reports provide no credible evidence.The "extraordinary claim," she said, shouldn't be made without "extraordinary evidence.""As much as I hate to think of the idea of competent scientists using their work for political propaganda, to me, that's what this seems to be," she said. "And certainly the affiliation with Steve Bannon and Miles Guo and the Society for the Rule of Law does nothing to dispel that suspicion."Load-Date: October 22, 2020End of Document

But a Fox News spokesperson declined to address CNN's question of why Carlson hasn't disclosed Bannon's involvement with Yan's paper when discussing her research on several shows. Bannon did not respond to CNN's request for comment; Yan declined a request to be interviewed and did not answer repeated requests for responses to specific questions.Flawed citations, copied passages, mysterious co-authors It was precisely the megaphone provided by Carlson and Bannon online and on TV that prompted the researchers at Johns Hopkins to issue a rebuttal, according to two of the Johns Hopkins authors, who spoke with CNN. "It was clear on social media that the paper was getting more and more attention," said Nancy D. Connell, a microbial geneticist and a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins. "We talked carefully and thought for a long time whether to do it." "On the one hand we don't want to give credence to just so much garbage," added Gigi Kwik Gronvall, an immunologist who is also a senior scholar at the institution. "On the other hand, because it's getting taken seriously, it's important to point out that this is not science ... It's infuriating, because everybody has better things to do." The Johns Hopkins response to Yan's paper takes issue with the science, launching into a point-by-point rebuttal. It also includes a section pointing out "weaknesses or flaws" in the paper's citations.One footnote, for instance, leads to an essay by an entrepreneur that only appears on his LinkedIn page after it was rejected by a scientific journal. Billy Zhang, a sole-proprietor consultant in Massachusetts who works with investors and governments in China, told CNN he was surprised to learn that his critique was cited in Yan's report. LinkedIn initially removed his post, but later decided to reinstate it. Another footnote is attributed to an article authored by a writer and editor for an anti-genetically modified food website. Another still traces to an author CNN could not locate, who says he runs a company that appears not to exist. The paper of that author, Dean Bengston, links to a page listing him as the CEO of a Las Vegas company called Meandering Path. But a search of the business name on the Nevada Secretary of State website -- as well as registries for surrounding states and other business databases -- turned up no matching results.Equally troubling for a scholarly paper was CNN's discovery that Yan's papers bear a strong resemblance to blogs first published on G News. Yan's papers contain paragraph after paragraph of identical theories and similar phrasing to the blogs, with some lines lifted nearly word for word. What's more, Yan's three co-authors in both papers -- Shu Kang, Jie Guan and Shanchang Hu -- are pseudonyms, a source told CNN. It's a practice that is highly unusual in such research and generally discouraged due to the resulting lack of accountability and transparency, experts told CNN. The source didn't know why the use of pseudonyms wasn't disclosed in the papers. "They are all Chinese but based here in the US," the source said. "They did not want their real names out there for fear of their families back in China." Dr. Daniel Lucey, an infectious-disease epidemics expert at Georgetown University, said he can't think of another case of authors using pseudonyms in a scientific paper."If you used a fake name, then it would start calling into question, under normal circumstances -- if they weren't honest about their name, then what else are they not honest about?" he said. But Lucey said the authors' concerns in this case might have merit. "I would also think that the four coauthors would be worried about themselves in terms of ever going back to the mainland or Hong Kong," he said. "It's a real thing."As part of its review, CNN spoke with a half-dozen experts from multiple institutions, and all of them found Yan's methodology to be flawed. They described her report as "junk science," "leaps of logic" and "window dressing." Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University, said she believes Yan's report set out to deceive for the purpose of spreading "political propaganda." "This paper is very deceptive to somebody without a scientific background, because it's written in very technical language, using a lot of jargon that makes it sound as though it is a legitimate scientific paper," she told CNN. "But anybody with an actual background in virology or molecular biology who reads this paper will realize that much of it is actually nonsense." Anna Mapp, an associate dean and research professor at the University of Michigan, agreed. "I was really disturbed to see such a shoddy piece of work that I would not accept if turned in to me by one of my own students receiving such attention and being treated as a valid scientific paper," she told CNN. (It was Mapp's graduate student, Amanda Peiffer -- who's working toward a PhD in chemical biology -- who first alerted CNN to issues with the citations at the end of Yan's paper.)Lucey of Georgetown told CNN that he met with Yan in person to discuss her paper on September 6 -- eight days before it was published. His criticism was more muted than that of the other scientists who spoke with CNN; Lucey said he found some of what Yan had to say noteworthy. Ultimately, though, he said he disagrees with Yan's conclusion and told her he couldn't vouch for her science because he's not a molecular virologist. Lucey said at one point, after much back and forth, he asked Yan a big-picture question: Why would China release a government-engineered virus in Wuhan? Lucey said Yan couldn't provide an answer that he considered plausible. Lucey said he believes the virus originated in nature. But he disagrees with the much-publicized theory that it jumped from an animal to a human at a seafood market in December. "Based on what I know about how epidemics have started, I think that it was at least several months earlier," he said. "It could have been out there for more than a year (before December). It's possible." To be sure, there is no scientific consensus on where the novel coronavirus -- SARS-CoV-2 -- originated. Most of the scientific community -- including Anthony Fauci, the United States' top infectious disease expert -- believes it was not manmade. Other credible scientists  floated the possibility the virus may have leaked from a Wuhan lab, although some contend that an article in Nature Medicine has debunked the notion.  Yan's first paper claims to refute that widely cited Nature Medicine article, published in mid-March, which concluded that SARS-CoV-2 most likely came from nature and not "purposeful manipulation." Neither of Yan's papers are peer-reviewed, which by itself is not a disqualifier. Researchers often publish early drafts of their work on what are known as scientific preprint servers to quickly share findings that could benefit the public -- a practice that has accelerated in the urgent age of the coronavirus.  Yan says she's in hidingMany experts who read Yan's research said they found it hard to reconcile the work with her seemingly impressive pedigree, which includes a stint at the University of Hong Kong's public health laboratory -- a World Health Organization collaborating facility. She has been published in Nature and The Lancet -- two prestigious academic journals -- and says she was among the first researchers in the world to become privy to the dangers of SARS-CoV-2. "Dr. Yan's history and training is excellent," Rasmussen said. "I'd really like to hear from her why she decided to do this, because effectively, it has ruined her credibility as a virologist and it would be a career ending mistake to make." Yan says she fled to the United States in April, according to a Fox News story. In that July piece, she went public with an allegation: Yan claimed that the Chinese government and the WHO had kept mum about their knowledge of the person-to-person transmission of the virus for weeks, even after Yan herself had said she raised the issue with her superiors in late December or early January. "The reason I came to the US is because I deliver the message of the truth of COVID," Yan, saying she feared for her life, told the network from an undisclosed location in the US. The Chinese government, WHO and the University of Hong Kong have vehemently denied her July accusation of a coverup. In her October 6 interview with Carlson, Yan said her mother was arrested by Chinese authorities for making allegations against China on her prior appearances on Fox News. The Chinese government didn't respond to a detailed list of questions from CNN about this and other allegations by Yan. It's unclear where Yan is staying in the US -- and the extent to which she knows Bannon and Guo. But a photo that circulated on Twitter last month and was posted on G News appeared to capture the reflection of a smiling Yan in the mirror behind the two men in the foreground: Wang DingGang, board chair of the Rule of Law Society, and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Bannon's image can also be seen in the photo.Although Bannon and Guo's Rule of Law Society and Rule of Law Foundation are listed under the titles of Yan's reports, neither paper mentions Bannon or Guo, or elaborates on the role the organizations have played in their creation.Guo responded to CNN's questions about the link with a statement that said Yan's publications were researched and written independently. "I have repeatedly stated since as early as January of this year that the COVID-19 pandemic was created by the Chinese Communist Party with the worst of intentions. I stand by these statements," Guo said. "I proudly support Dr. Yan in her efforts to stand up against the CCP mafia and tell the world the truth about COVID-19. Dr. Yan is a hero for her whistleblowing against the CCP and should be commended for her work and personal sacrifice." Bannon has played up the nonprofits' early and persistent promotion of the lab-origin story.  "I want to thank Miles Guo because it was Miles Guo and the whistleblower movement, Miles Guo and the Rule of Law Society, the Rule of Law Foundation, that back in early January really got us to start to focus on this," Bannon said on his podcast on October 3. The two also discussed Yan in that episode, with Guo suggesting she could help prove that the virus was made in a lab. But they made no mention of their connection to her report. Yan herself has appeared several times on Bannon's podcast. In August, she said the communist regime does "evil things" and discussed its history of persecuting its own people.The Rule of Law Foundation and Rule of Law Society responded to questions from CNN with two identical statements, signed by their respective board chairs, Hao Haidong and Wang DingGang. Each statement expresses support for Dr. Yan "and any other Chinese asylee who seeks to tell the world the truth about the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) corruption, atrocious human rights record, and its role in the spread of COVID-19. "Dr. Yan has independently researched COVID-19 and we respect her findings and desire to speak the truth about COVID-19 to the public," the statement says. "Our support of Dr. Yan has never included influencing, altering, or editing her scientific research and findings." The statement said her reference to the organizations in the report "was solely done as an appreciation of our support in helping her flee Hong Kong and avoid arrest for her COVID-19 whistleblowing." Rasmussen of Columbia University says the possibility of an accidental lab release or even of an engineered virus can't be ruled out, but said either scenario is extremely unlikely -- and Yan's reports provide no credible evidence.The "extraordinary claim," she said, shouldn't be made without "extraordinary evidence." "As much as I hate to think of the idea of competent scientists using their work for political propaganda, to me, that's what this seems to be," she said. "And certainly the affiliation with Steve Bannon and Miles Guo and the Society for the Rule of Law does nothing to dispel that suspicion."CNN's Yahya Abou-Ghazala and Benjamin Naughton contributed to this report.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Chinese Markets Pop as Mainland Investors React to Trump IllnessRealMoneyOctober 9, 2020 Friday 8:34 AM EDTCopyright 2020 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 885 wordsByline: Alex Frew McMillanHighlight: Shares were up and the yuan posted its largest one-day gain since the end of a U.S. dollar peg.BodyChinese shares popped on a return to trading after the Golden Week national-day holiday. On the first opportunity for mainland investors to react since President Donald Trump contracted the coronavirus, punters in Shanghai and Shenzhen appeared encouraged that the episode increases chances of a victory for Democratic challenger Joe Biden.Biden is viewed in China as certainly being less hawkish on trade tariffs with the Middle Kingdom. The unpredictability of the Trump presidency, during which Trump has looked to boost trade with China while penalizing Chinese imports, has hurt the prospects of U.S.-focused Chinese businesses, as well as the Chinese operations of U.S. companies.The CSI 300 index of the largest mainland companies rose 2.0% on Friday. The Shanghai and Shenzhen markets have been closed since the end of trade on Wednesday September 30, after which the Mid-Autumn Festival - China's equivalent of Thanksgiving - coincided with the October 1 anniversary of the founding of Communist China.The Chinese currency performed even more strongly. The yuan strengthened 1.3% as onshore markets for the currency opened again. Offshore trading has continued but always has much lighter volumes, while the Chinese government attempts to manage the onshore market, not always successfully.The U.S. dollar now buys C¥6.70. That is the yuan's strongest level since April 2019. The 1.3% rise is the strongest day for the yuan since 2005, when China abandoned a fixed peg to the U.S. dollar, a one-off move that revalued the yuan by 2.1% at the time.Trump has blamed mainland authorities for unleashing the "China virus," which had its initial epicenter in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Chinese authorities undoubtedly hushed up the initial outbreak, downplayed the potential for person-to-person transmission, and failed to stem travel at the vital Lunar New Year holiday.But Trump's sickness has refocused attention on his apparent carelessness, both in terms of personal protection, and in protecting the U.S. nation from the virus. There has been widespread glee over the episode on the Chinese social-media platforms WeChat and Weibo, which some see as a comeuppance for Trump, although the conspiracy minded in greater China have suggested he may have contracted the virus on purpose to boost his re-election prospects.Officially, of course, Chinese President Xi Jinping and wife Peng Liyuan wrote a letter to Trump and his wife Melania, expressing shock and wishing them a speedy recovery from Covid-19.On the domestic front, the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets are reflecting the improving prospects for recovery in China's economy. Factory activity has increased for seven straight months.However, everyday life is not yet back to normal, and consumers remain reticent, with the bounce back mainly driven by industrial activity. Domestic tourist sites saw 637 million visitors over the eight-day holiday, 79% of the 2019 total, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism reports.Mainland authorities appear confident enough in their ability to contain systemic risk in the Chinese financial system to push ahead with forced deleveraging of indebted companies, particularly in the debt-reliant real-estate industry. The property sector accounts for around 30% of all bank loans in China.China's central bank and housing ministry started pushing change in August, and have since reportedly met with the 12 biggest developers to ask them to submit debt-reduction plans. These would require them to reduce borrowing within a year, and fully meet deleveraging targets within three years.Of the 180 listed property developers in China, 53% face forced debt reduction, according to Bloomberg analysis. The listed developers are likely in much better financial positions than the 97,000 or so privately held developers."Therefore, well over half of the combined balance sheet of the entire real estate sector would face material deleveraging pressure over the medium term," Société Générale analysts Wei Yao and Michelle Lam conclude.Late last month, there were serious concerns over the credit position of China Evergrande Group  , the largest property developer in China. It is also the most indebted. The company would cross all three government "red lines" of a 70% ceiling on debt-to-asset ratio, 100% cap on net debt ratio and 100% cap on short-term debt/cash ratio.Evergrande shares and bonds plunged 15% after a letter was leaked in September in which it asked for financial help from the government of Guangdong Province, next to Hong Kong. The letter, which it said was fake news but Reuters and other news sources conclude was authentic, warned Evergrande faced a cash crunch causing potential systemic risk. Evergrande is attempting a backdoor listing of a subsidiary in Shenzhen, but if that does not go through by January 31, 2021, it will have to pay back C¥144 billion (US$20.3 billion) to investors, which it said it could not afford to do.The SocGen analysts conclude Evergrande is not in the clear, and the episode will have "steeled the resolve" of policymakers to push ahead with deleveraging. The events "have laid bare the financial fragility of this sector, and offered policymakers a glimpse of the magnitude of the threat that such fragility could pose to the financial system."Load-Date: October 10, 2020End of Document

Instruction Under SurveillanceThe Chronicle of Higher EducationOctober 1, 2020Copyright 2020 The Chronicle of Higher Education All Rights ReservedLength: 1740 wordsByline: Karin FischerHighlight: Chinese students stuck overseas bring censorship concerns into newly global online classrooms Chinese students stuck overseas bring censorship concerns into newly global online classrooms.BodyChinese students stuck overseas bring censorship concerns into newly global online classrooms One minute the class looked like any online session, neat boxes framing the faces of students and their professor.The next, some of those faces disappeared, replaced by avatars, pseudonyms, and shots of the ceiling. The reason: Discussion in the course on Chinese society had turned to politics, and students in the class from China had pulled out of the conversation, afraid that their government could be listening in.The incident was reported last spring at Emory University, part of a survey of Chinese students and instructors at the private college about their experience with the shift from in-person classes to online.On top of routine headaches like spotty Wi-Fi and the adjustment to asynchronous learning, students in countries such as China must worry about censorship and running afoul of local security laws. As remote learning stretches into fall and beyond, they may find themselves pursuing an American education without the benefit of academic freedom and open discourse. Meanwhile, their large presence may undermine those very principles at American colleges. Faculty members face tough choices teaching in newly global virtual classrooms: Do they change their courses to eliminate potentially contentious topics, or create two sets of materials, one for students in the United States, another for those abroad? Or do they stick with their original lesson plans, potentially putting their students at risk? Do they say to students, Sorry, this class is off limits if you're studying from China?These challenges are not limited to courses in directly related disciplines, like modern Chinese history. Subjects like gender, LGBTQ rights, international relations, and economic theory also can trigger sensitivities.Sarah McLaughlin, of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, said professors risk importing more-restrictive attitudes toward campus speech from abroad into American classrooms. "A professor in Minnesota shouldn't remove material because it might offend students in a few countries," she said. "The worst thing we could do is to make Chinese laws applicable around the world."    The worst thing we could do is to make Chinese laws applicable around the world.        Concerns about security and privacy aren't unique to China. Countries including Russia, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia also have stringent censorship laws and monitor the internet.But China looms large because of the size of the Chinese-student population in the United States. In the 2018-19 academic year, 370,000 Chinese students were enrolled in American colleges, one of every three international students. While most of those students stayed in the United States as the coronavirus pandemic spread - the Institute of International Education reports as many as 90 percent of current international students chose not, or were unable, to return home - many did not. And with consulates shuttered and borders closed, almost all new students must study remotely.The Chinese government has long limited speech in its own university classrooms and online, with students and instructors reporting on one another for expressing taboo opinions. Perry Link, a China scholar and a professor of comparative literature at the University of California at Riverside, once famously compared the fear of saying something forbidden to an anaconda in a chandelier, a threatening presence keeping the Chinese people in line.Under President Xi Jinping, those restrictions have markedly tightened. In June, China's National People's Congress passed a new national-security law for Hong Kong that makes speech it deems critical of the Hong Kong or Chinese governments unlawful - regardless of the citizenship or location of the offender. Exactly what speech is problematic isn't defined, leading to fears the law could be broadly interpreted.The extensiveness and the ambiguity of the new law could chill speech in American classrooms, said James A. Millward, a professor of Chinese and central Asian history at Georgetown University. "Now we all have to worry about the anaconda even when we're dialing in from somewhere else," he said.The rise of online teaching during the pandemic compounds the problem. Not only are students in China at potentially greater legal jeopardy, but videoconferencing applications like Zoom used in remote instruction are vulnerable to Chinese government surveillance and data collection. Zoom came under fire in the spring for temporarily shutting down user accounts outside of China at the Chinese government's behest, but the company said it has changed its policy and increased data protections.Alarmed, Millward and a group of scholars of Asian studies drafted a statement and a set of recommendations for teaching remotely about China and students studying there. In it, they warn about the risks of requiring students to download readings that may be prohibited locally and of recording class discussions in which students are easily identifiable. "Such files can be duplicated and could potentially pose a risk to class participants years after the class has finished," they write.Students are already aware of the hazards. In the Emory survey, one student reported being nervous when a professor played a song during class that is banned in mainland China, said Hong Li, a professor and the former director of the Emory College Language Centerand one of three researchers who conducted the study. The student was afraid a neighbor might report her to authorities for listening to forbidden music.Another student chose not to return to China when the Emory campus closed. Her family lives on a military compound, she told the researchers, making it impossible to discuss sensitive topics when studying there.One solution could be to use a virtual private network, or VPN, which allows users to navigate around internet firewalls to obtain blocked content. Websites frequently used in classroom settings, such as Google, YouTube, and The New York Times, are banned in China.Academics traveling to China have long made use of VPNs, but unauthorized internet connections are now illegal in China as well as in Russia, said Aynne Kokas, an associate professor of media studies at the University of Virginia.    We shouldn't be urging students to commit a crime.        While the ban is not regularly enforced, students caught using a VPN could have the infraction on their records for life, and it could have repercussions for their families. "We shouldn't be urging students to commit a crime," Kokas said.Instead, professors could use homegrown Chinese platforms in their courses or opt for Western ones that are accessible in China. College IT departments can also provide technical assistance to professors, such as helping them find online platforms that work overseas or that have greater security measures. Because colleges are such significant users of videoconferencing platforms, they also could band together to push providers to increase security protections, Kokas said.Alibaba, a Chinese online provider, has been marketing its services to Western universities, saying that it can get around strict internet controls. While the partnership had raised fears of Chinese interference, British officials who were part of a pilot project said that students in China were able to access the same course content as their classmates in Britain.But the answers aren't always technological. Professors could offer individual or small-group tutorials to students in China and similar countries to limit their exposure. They could allow students to opt out of controversial discussions without penalty to their grades or to take part in classes anonymously.While it should be up to individual faculty members to decide how to navigate these sensitive issues in their own courses, college administrators can provide important support. For example, they can set a strong campuswide policy against students recording class sessions, said Kerry Ratigan, an assistant professor of political science at Amherst College. "That has more teeth."Some faculty members have suggested that students wait until they are back on campus to enroll in certain courses. But Yingyi Ma, an associate professor of sociology at Syracuse University and the author of Ambitious and Anxious: How Chinese Undergraduates Succeed and Struggle in American Higher Education, said that while instructors are well-meaning, they could have the effect of limiting academic options for Chinese students alone. "I worry that this potentially undermines Chinese students' learning opportunities," she said.Meg Rithmire, an associate professor at Harvard Business School, collaborated with several other China scholars, including Ratigan, to draft a set of strategies for instructors and institutions. In her own course syllabus, she is upfront with students about the content of the course, the expectations for discussion, and the potential risks associated with the security law. Some students will steer clear, while others still sign up."The responsibility of the instructor is to communicate risk and to, as much as possible, provide a safe environment," Rithmire said. "It's not to notteach certain things."Gwendolynne Reid teaches first-year writing courses to international and multilingual students at Emory's Oxford College; about two-thirds of her students this fall are Chinese. When Reid realized that many of her students would be studying online from China, she thought long and hard about her approach.She decided to allow students to take the lead. During the initial class sessions, they talked about the challenges of open discussion and together developed a set of ground rules so that students can indicate when they are uncomfortable with a certain topic. Likewise, she decided to allow students to choose their own topics for papers and to make their own assessment of risk. She didn't want to be "complicit in government censorship of my students," she said."These are their choices," she said. After all, her students have a more sophisticated understanding than she can of the social and political limits they're up against.Karin Fischer                    Karin Fischer writes about international education, colleges and the economy, and other issues.

GROUPS, ACTIVISTS CAMPAIGN AGAINST CHINA'S BID FOR UN RIGHTS COUNCIL SEATStates News ServiceOctober 8, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1346 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:International rights groups are calling on United Nations member states not to vote to allow China to retain its seat on the U.N. Human Rights Council, saying Beijing has tried to undermine the international human rights system and continues the mass persecution and incarceration of Muslims in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR).The New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) and the Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) network have both issued statements this week calling attention to serial rights abuses in China and Saudi Arabia, saying member states voting for the next Human Rights Council on Oct. 13 to take into account the rights violations of candidates."We urge UN member states to take strong and effective action in response to increasing human rights violations in China and the government's failure to fully implement [U.N.] recommendations," CHRD said via its Twitter account on Thursday ."The Chinese government has failed to protect and promote human rights in any meaningful way and has exploited the United Nations Universal Periodic Review process," the group said in a statement on its website.It said the ruling Chinese Communist Party has failed to implement any of the 58 recommendations made during its human rights review in November 2018 ."Under the increasingly draconian rule of Xi Jinping, the Chinese government has escalated human rights repression, in particular, in its crackdown on critics of the government's handling of COVID-19 pandemic, persecution of ethnic religious minorities in Xinjiang and Tibet, and curtailment of civil and political liberties in Hong Kong," the statement said.Beijing-based rights activist Hu Jia said Beijing's growing presence and influence in U.N. agencies should be a cause for global concern."Faced with censure from Western nations, the Chinese Communist Party has gone on the offensive so as to evade public criticism," Hu told RFA in a recent interview. "Based on Nazi propaganda minister Goebbels' idea that a lie repeated often enough becomes the truth, their voice has gotten loud enough for Beijing to consolidate its position as a leader of authoritarian nations in a very short space of time.""China engages in dollar-diplomacy to win over countries with bad human rights records to join its gang, and is forming a network of transnational underworld interests in the international community who protect each other," Hu said. "They are destroying any value or significance that the United Nations ever had."#VoteNoChinaChinese nationals now occupy the top job in four U.N. agencies: Qu Dongyu at the Food and Agriculture Association (FAO); Fang Liu at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO); Zhao Houlin at the International Telecommunications Union (ITU); and Li Yong at the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).The Uyghur Human Rights Project (UHRP) added its voice to the campaign, under the #VoteNoChina hashtag on social media, saying Beijing is "currently committing genocide against Uyghurs," in the XUAR."It's difficult to comprehend the perverse logic behind the possibility of electing Chinathe government currently committing genocide against Uyghursto the UN body responsible for overseeing human rights protections around the world," the group's executive director Omer Kanat said in a statement.The group said the Chinese government "persistently blocks human rights investigations in its own country," including investigations into violations of cultural rights, the right of assembly, enforced disappearances, freedom of expression, privacy and abuses committed in the name of counter-terrorism.In 2017 and 2018, World Uyghur Congress (WUC) president Dolkun Isa was ejected from the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues at the behest of Wu Hongbo, who later admitted he had acted in the interest of the Chinese government, the UHRP said."While we recognise the importance of the Council in its unique ability to bring states together for critical dialogue and exchange, for it to remain a credible body it cannot tolerate members committing genocide," the statement said.HRW's U.N. director Louis Charbonneau agreed."China and Saudi Arabia have not only committed massive rights violations at home, but they have tried to undermine the international human rights system they're demanding to be a part of," Charbonneau said in a statement on the HRW website.He said if no suitable candidates were available, member states should refuse to vote.Saudi Arabia, China, Nepal, Pakistan, and UzbekistanThe UN resolution that created the Human Rights Council urges states voting for members to "take into account the contribution of candidates to the promotion and protection of human rights," HRW said.Council members are required to "uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights" at home and abroad and "fully cooperate with the Council," it said.Saudi Arabia, China, Nepal, Pakistan, and Uzbekistan are all competing to fill the four seats available to the Asia and Pacific group on the council.HRW said China has a history of using its seats on the Human Rights Council to prevent scrutiny of its own abuses and those by its allies, with China repeatedly taking action to prevent the participation of rights defenders at U.N. events."It's not good for human rights or for the rights council when the worst rights violators get elected," Charbonneau said.CHRD said China had "partially implemented" just three out of the 58 recommendations made during its last review process two years ago."Women have continued to face gender-based discrimination in employment," CHRD said after a follow-up investigation of China's rights record."LGBTQI+ people have continued to face discrimination at home, at work, in schools and in public and China did not legalize same-sex marriage when adopting the Civil Code in 2020," it said.Racism against African migrants was frequently reported during the COVID-19 pandemic, while ethnic and religious minorities "have continued to face discrimination in employment and housing and many faced arbitrary detention for practicing their religion and culture," it said."Persons with disabilities have continued to face discrimination and a lack of reasonable accommodation in areas such education, healthcare, poverty relief and employment," the report found.Growing international scrutinySince the November 2018 review, China has intensified its "Sinicization" policies targeting religious groups, and continued to maintain "internment camps for Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang, where individuals have been arbitrarily detained for exercising their right to religious freedom.""Muslims including Uyghurs, Hui, and other Turkic groups, Tibetans, Christian house churches and Falun Gong continue to face brutal persecution," the report said.Meanwhile, human rights defenders including journalists and lawyers continue to face arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, torture, administrative penalties, collective punishment against their families, and targeted surveillance in response to their work to promote and protect human rights, it said.Many have been prosecuted for "endangering national security", with 991 human rights defenders currently behind bars in China, it said.Earlier this week, the U.K. and Germany led a group of 39 member states in condemning China's treatment of Uyghurs and imposition of harsh security measures in Hong Kong at the U.N. General Assembly, signaling increasing opposition to Beijing's policies from the international community.In a joint statement issued late on Tuesday to the General Assembly's human rights committee, the two nationsas well as the U.S., Canada, Australia, Japan, and several members of the European Unionslammed China for its persecution of Uyghurs in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR).Reported by Ng Yik-tung and Sing Man for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by He Ping for the Mandarin Service.

China Bunker Fuel Market Report 2020: Trade Tension Between the United States and China is Likely to Negatively Impact the MarketGlobeNewswireOctober 30, 2020 Friday 3:03 AM PTCopyright 2020 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: RESEARCH ANALYSIS AND REPORTSLength: 974 wordsBodyDublin, Oct.  30, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "China Bunker Fuel Market - Growth, Trends, and Forecasts (2020 - 2025)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.   The China bunker fuel market is expected to grow at a CAGR of around 4.5% during the forecast period. Factors such as high trade activities with major economies across the globe is expected to drive the market. However, as the country is a net exporter to a diversified destination, so with the outbreak of COVID-19, the global economic slowdown had a significant negative impact on the Chinese maritime industry during 2020. With the slow recovery from COVID-19 in some major export, destinations are likely to hinder the market growth during the forecast period.Trade tension between the United States and China is likely to have a negative impact on the Chinese maritime business and the country's bunker fuel market during the forecast period.Chinese Ministry of Transport plans for building infrastructure and utilizing LNG as a marine fuel by 2025 is likely to create an opportunity for the LNG marine fuel growth in the near future.The container vessels held a significant market share in 2019, and is likely to continue its dominance during the forecast period.Key Market TrendsTrade Tensions between the United States and China is Likely to Restrain the Market GrowthTrade tension began between the United States and China due to high tariffs imposed and other trade barriers on Chinese goods by the United States government in 2018.• During 2018, the United States imposed a tariff of more than USD 360 billion on Chinese goods, and on retaliation, China imposed tariffs of more than USD 110 billion on United States' products.• The last tariff imposed by the United States was in September 2018 on food items and various other musical instruments. The trade war continued till June 2019, when the Chinese government imposed a tariff of USD 60 billion on the United States' goods.• The high tariff on both sides affected the trade and marine transportation between the countries and significantly affected the trade volume. In 2019, the trade volume of goods handled by the Chinese coastal ports decreased by nearly 0.3 billion metric tonnes compared to 9.46 billion metric tonnes in 2018.• With COVID-19 outbreak, the trade war took a new dimension. The United States government considered China a primary reason for the pandemic and accused the country of suppressing vital information regarding the first virus outbreak in China.• Though the conflict was not related to trading, the United States banned Chinese company, Huawei, from using United States' software and hardware in strategic semiconductor processes in May 2020. The United States also pressurized the European government to refrain from collaborating with Huawei. Thus, such a situation is expected to repeat the 2018 trade relation of the United States and China, which is likely to negatively affect the sea trade market and the marine fuel market during the forecast period.Container Vessels to Witness Significant GrowthContainer fleets are cargo ships with truck-size intermodal containers used to carry all the load. These are widely used for commercial intermodal freight transport. These are typically large, fast, and complex ships operated on a liner service.• The capacity of the container fleet is measured in Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEU). These container fleets hold a capacity of 20-foot to 40-foot (2-TEU). Modern container ships today hold the ability to carry over 19,000 TEU.• About 85% - 90% of the non-bulk cargo is transported through container fleets. The containerized form of freight is the preferred medium of transportation for various industrial products.• Container vessels are mostly operated on China and the United States sea route, which is mostly used to transport goods like meat, toys, electrical machinery, electronic goods, etc.• Ports that handle the highest number of container vessels in China are Shanghai, Shenzhen, Ningbo-Zhoushan, Guangzhou Harbor, Hong Kong, Qingdao, Tianjin, Kaohsiung, and few others. During 2019, the ports handled 231 million TEUs.• With increasing trade relation with countries like Greece and Israel, and on order five new 23,000 TEU containers vessels by Orient Overseas Container Line (OOCL), it is expected to have significant growth in containers vessels traffic in Chinese ports, which is likely to a positive impact on the market growth.Key Topics Covered:   1 INTRODUCTION2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 3 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 4 MARKET OVERVIEW4.1 Introduction4.2 Market Size and Demand Forecast in USD billion, till 20254.3 Recent Trends and Developments4.4 Government Policies and Regulations4.5 Market Dynamics4.5.1 Drivers4.5.2 Restraints4.6 Supply Chain Analysis4.7 PESTLE Analysis 5 MARKET SEGMENTATION5.1 Fuel Type5.1.1 High Sulfur Fuel Oil (HSFO)5.1.2 Very-low Sulfur Fuel Oil (VLSFO)5.1.3 Marine Gas Oil (MGO)5.1.4 Others5.2 Vessel Type5.2.1 Containers5.2.2 Tankers5.2.3 General Cargo5.2.4 Bulk Carrier5.2.5 Other Vessel Types 6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE6.1 Mergers and Acquisitions, Joint Ventures, Collaborations, and Agreements6.2 Strategies Adopted by Leading Players6.3 Company Profiles6.3.1 Fuel Suppliers6.3.1.1 PetroChina Company Limited6.3.1.2 Sinopec Fuel Oil Sales Co.

CHINA AND THE ABRAHAM ACCORDS PEACE AGREEMENTStates News ServiceSeptember 22, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1978 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Middle East Institute:Giorgio Cafiero, Daniel WagnerThis essay is part of the series "All About China"a journey into the history and diverse culture of China through essays that shed light on the lasting imprint of China's past encounters with the Islamic world as well as an exploration of the increasingly vibrant and complex dynamics of contemporary Sino-Middle Eastern relations. Read more ...On September 15, President Trump presided over a ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and the foreign ministers of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain, Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Abdullatif Al Zayani, respectively, signed a general declaration of principles, called "The Abraham Accords."[1] Numerous analysts have focused on the regional impact of the normalization of relations between Israel and these two Gulf Arab countries. However, this development has worldwide geopolitical implications including for China.A day after the agreement between Israel and the UAE was first made public, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian stated that Beijing was "pleased" to see the two countries taking steps to reduce tensions in the Middle East.[2] He also stated, "We hope the relevant parties can take concrete actions so that the Palestinian issue can return to the equal footed dialogue and negotiations," adding that China intends to "play a constructive role" toward the achievement of a Palestinian state.[3]This initial reaction is consistent with Beijing's modus operandi of "balanced vagueness" regarding conflicts in the Middle East.[4] Such ambiguity has enabled China to maintain cordial relations with governments on all sides of geopolitical fault lines across the region and facilitated its development of extensive economic ties throughout the region. China's support for the Palestinian cause has not prevented it from also being a friend and strategic business partner of Israel. Nor has Beijing's growing partnership with Saudi Arabia and the UAE come at the expense of Sino-Iranian relations.Opportunities and RisksChinese interests in the region are centered on the acquisition of natural resources and the advancement of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which depends on regional stability. Put simply, if the agreements result in reduced conflict in the MENA region, China stands to gain immensely. But officials in Beijing share the concern of many analysts that the Abraham Accords will end up fueling polarization and radicalization in the region. If so, this will be at the expense of BRI's future success.China sees a continued opportunity for cooperation with the Israelis and Emiratis in the domains of technology and cybersecurity as a result of their formalized diplomatic relations. Given that the UAE has used Chinese surveillance technology and Beijing has demonstrated its interest in obtaining such technologies from both Israel and the UAE, it is not difficult to imagine the Chinese government benefitting from enhanced Emirati-Israeli trade in high technology and cybersecurity sectors. This is highly relevant to Beijing's ongoing rollout of its Social Credit System and its advanced development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), in which it is planning to invest as much as $150 billion by the end of this decade.[5]Another way in which China could see itself gaining from the Abraham Accords pertains to the balance of power in the Mediterranean Sea. Because Beijing views Turkey's conduct in Libya as destabilizing (despite Beijing and Ankara both officially supporting the same government Libya's civil war), the possibility of a more solidified Emirati-Israeli geopolitical partnership successfully countering Turkish ambitions there and in the gas-rich eastern Mediterranean could serve China's interests in seeing Ankara return to its "strategic box" and curtail its "neo-Ottoman" foreign policy ambitions.[6]However, when Iran-related considerations enter the picture, China has reason to be nervous. Beijing wants to deepen its diplomatic, economic, and military relations with Tehran, which the Israel-UAE agreement could make more difficult and riskier for the Chinese. The Trump administration's decision to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and apply "maximum pressure" on Iran in the form of sweeping and stringent sanctions, has negatively impacted Beijing. The sanctions have forced the Chinese to significantly reduce their purchase of Iranian oil; and their trade relations with Tehran have come under greater scrutiny. Beijing is concerned that the Israel-UAE agreement has implications for the regional order that could come at the Islamic Republic's expense in ways that bode poorly for Sino-Iranian relations.[7]If the leadership in Tehran feels increasingly threatened by a growing Gulf Arab-Israeli coalition, which also includes Bahrain and Saudi Arabia despite the latter not having formalized diplomatic relations with Israel Iran might feel pushed into a corner, which could result in Tehran acting even more provocatively in the region. Such a scenario could further dim prospects for long-term peace and stability in the Persian Gulf and wider MENA region.Hamas in Gaza and other groups in the region could become more radicalized. Given Bahrain's decision to follow in the UAE's footsteps and normalize its own diplomatic relations with Israel, one interpretation is that Saudi Arabia (which joins the UAE in making all of Bahrain's foreign policy decisions) is effectively abandoning the Arab Peace Initiative, which then-Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah proposed in 2002. There is already widespread anger among many Arabs and Muslims throughout the region about Bahrain and the UAE's actions, and the risks of blowback are real. This raises concern about the potential eruption of new security crises in the region stemming from US-friendly Arab states having "betrayed" the Palestinians. Beijing understands the sensitivity of the Palestinian issue and is no doubt worried about how the UAE and Bahrain's signing of the Abraham Accord may generate unintended consequences that further destabilize the MENA region.US PrimacyA popular argument made by a wide range of analysts, including the Atlantic Council's Ariel Cohen, is that the Israel-UAE deal was, at least in part, geared toward reasserting American hegemony in the MENA region and pushing back against Chinese and Russian clout in the region.[8]All six GCC states, including the UAE, have operated within Washington's orbit for decades. Yet throughout the 21st century, all of these monarchies have forged increasingly strong partnerships with China, playing their cards shrewdly to increase their perceived value to Beijing from a geographical, financial, and energy perspective. In anticipation of a post-US order, the Emiratis have diversified their investments in China and elsewhere in Asia. Israel has also been strengthening its relationship with Beijing in ways that have unsettled Washington, especially its close investment relationship with Chinese entities in the technology and military sectors.In 2019, US lawmakers warned Israel against permitting China to operate the Port of Haifa, urging "the Government of Israel to consider the security implications of foreign investment in Israel."[9] During US Secretary of State Pompeo's May 2020 visit to Israel, the issue of Chinese investment in the Jewish state's infrastructure was a central point of discussion. As a result of Pompeo's pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu, the Israeli government later rejected China's bid to run the Shorek 2 desalination plant in Palmachin, the country's largest desalination plant.[10] Such episodes illustrate Israel's delicate position in a multipolar world being increasingly shaped by China's geo-economic rise. Between China, which seeks to strengthen its diplomatic and economic ties to Israel, and pressure from Washington not to proceed with a deeper partnership with Beijing, the Israeli government finds itself closer to the epicenter of Sino-American competition for global geopolitical influence. Looking ahead, Dubai state-owned DP World and Israel's Dover Tower are preparing a joint bid in the privatization of the Port of Haifa, where China has already made substantial investments. This will likely further contribute to some analysts' belief that the Abraham Accords are designed to counter Beijing's geo-economic power.[11]There are many geopolitical dimensions to the Israel-UAE deal. On the regional level, these pertain to shared Emirati and Israeli perceptions of Iran, Turkey, and the Muslim Brotherhood as threats. Undoubtedly, Trump's fierce re-election bid was also a factor motivating both Israel and the UAE to make the agreement. However, when considering why the Trump administration worked hard to broker the Abraham Accords, which even his Democratic foes in Congress welcomed, we should not forget Washington's efforts to reinforce US primacy in the MENA region, consolidate its influence over two states that have served as close partners for many decades, and push back against a rising China in the region.ConclusionBeijing is under no pressure to act quickly or boldly in relation to the Abraham Accords. As is the case with countries throughout the world, China has yet to fully realize the implications of the agreements. Officials in Beijing will undoubtedly closely monitor how the Accords play out regionally. The Chinese leadership will do everything in its power to mitigate any perceived risk that the formalization of Israel's relationship with Bahrain and UAE represents to Beijing, while also seeking to take full advantage of potential opportunities which the agreement may offer.[1] For the full text of the Abaraham Accords and agreements between Israel and United Arab Emirates/Bahrain, see CNN, September 16, 2020, https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/15/politics/israel-uae-abraham-accords-documents/index.html.[2] "China welcomes Israel-UAE accord to establish diplomatic ties," Yahoo, August 14, 2020, https://in.news.yahoo.com/china-welcomes-israel-uae-accord-113449433.html.[3] Ibid.[4] Alessandro Arduino, "Here's the real reason China isn't taking sides in Libya," South China Morning Post, January 28, 2020, https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/opinion/article/3047944/heres-real-reason-china-isnt-taking-sides-libya.[5] Arjun Kharpal, "China wants to be a $150 billion world leader in AI in less than 15 years," CNBC, July 21, 2017, https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/21/china-ai-world-leader-by-2030.html[6] "Turkey's strategic assertiveness a dangerous development," Arab News, September 10, 2020, https://www.arabnews.com/node/1732581.[7] Samuel Ramani, "Russian and Chinese views on the Israel-UAE normalization deal," Middle East Institute, August 27, 2020, https://www.mei.edu/publications/russian-and-chinese-views-israel-uae-normalization-deal.[8] "Ø ØªÙØ Ù, Ø Ù Ù† Ø¥ØØØ Ø Ù Ù„ ÙˆØ Ù„Ø ØØÙ Ù† ÙˆØªØØ ÙØ Ù ØµÙÙ‡ Ø Ø Ù„ØªØ ØÙ ØRÙ " ["An agreement between Israel, Bahrain and Trump describes it as historic"], Alhurra, September 11, 2020, www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa_Yakm08BUandlist=PLlXih_wfMeQC0KnASwYzTBJsQ-5wAkq2Eandindex=2andt=0sandapp=desktop.[9] Herb Keinon, "Israeli government at odds over inspecting Chinese ventures," Jerusalem Post, July 14, 2019, www.jpost.com/israel-news/govt-officials-at-odds-over-mechanism-overseeing-chinese-investments-595666.[10] Itamar Eichner, "China loses bid to run Israel's biggest desalination plant after U.S. pressure," Ynetnews, May 26, 2020, https://www.ynetnews.com/article/HkBaQNco8.[11] "Dubai's DP World and Israeli group to jointly bid for Haifa port," Al Jazeera, September 16, 2020, https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/dubai-dp-world-israeli-group-jointly-bid-haifa-port-200916133311485.html.Load-Date: September 22, 2020End of Document

NBA leaves US government decision to operate in ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 24, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 409 wordsBodyNBA Commissioner Adam Silver leaves the U.S. government's decision to continue the league and its business in China. It's been 11 months since the Chinese government asked state television China Central TV not to broadcast Rockets games, and they recently said they won't broadcast NBA games in Orlando. This conflict broke out when a tweet from Daryl Morey, an executive for the Houston Rockets, noted "Fight for freedom. Support Hong Kong.""There are definitely trade-offs there and someone might say that, given the system of government in China, the NBA should make the decision not to operate there. I'd just say those are our government's decisions in terms of where American companies should operate. I still believe that the exchanges between people we're watching play in China are positive, it's helping cultures learn from each other," Silver said in a CNN interview.The Commissioner also alluded to the financial benefit of maintaining the NBA's connection to China, referencing its partnership with Tencent, a technological conglomerate that has exclusive internet transmission rights. According to reports from the Chinese press, they are worth about $1.58 billion. The NBA could lose up to $400 million by cutting off its relations with the Asian giant. In a period of instability between the two governments, U.S. President Donald Trump has openly criticized the NBA for its relations with China."The way they serve China, the way they bow to them, is frankly a disgrace. And they make a lot more money here than in China. But we have a system that allows you to disrespect your system, and it's a shame. They don't appreciate what they have here," Trump opined on Fox Sports.The statements were uttered following the latest NBA-related scandal in China. ESPN uncovered in July this year, a case of abuse and mistreatment of young players from the Asian country at the association's academies in the Asian country.NBA deputy commissioner and chief operating officer Mark Tatum confirmed that the commissioner is "reassessing the situation and considering other goals" for the league's development program in China, where young people want to be "the new Yao Ming."Trump has contributed to instability between countries through two executive orders prohibiting U.S. companies from transacting with Chinese companies ByteDance, owner of the TikTok viral video platform, and Tencent, to which the WeChat message app belongs.[email protected]Load-Date: September 25, 2020End of Document

Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Monday, October 19th.Your top stories right now 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.We're in countdown mode to the November decision, now 15 days to go before the 2020 general election.President Trump and Joe Biden headed into the home stretch on the campaign trail as both gear up for this Thursday's big debate.But controversy is still swirling around the Bidens' e-mail from Hunter Biden's laptop revealing massive business transactions with foreign companies while his father was sitting vice president. Hunter was getting payoffs apparently for setting up meetings with his father to the tune of millions of dollars, tens of millions.Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is here to discuss this.Plus we will get exclusive insight from the Director of National Intelligence this morning, John Ratcliffe, at the top of the next hour. Don't miss that.Meanwhile, markets are rallying this morning. Futures indicating a triple digit move at the start of trading. The Dow Industrials up 220 points. Markets are getting boosted by positive GDP and retail sales out of China. Dow Industrials right now up 221 points. Nasdaq up 129. The S&P higher by 30 points.This after a mixed session on Friday.

New lockdowns in place in the Eurozone because of spikes in coronavirus.In Asia overnight, markets were mostly higher, boosted by that news out of China, reporting a 4.9 percent expansion in third quarter GDP from a year earlier, also China retail sales up 3.3 percent. Of course these numbers are from the Chinese Communist Party so we always look at that skeptically.Some of the top stories that we are watching this morning now.President Trump slamming Joe Biden over newly released e-mails showing his son, Hunter Biden, cashing in on his father's position when he was vice president.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Joe Biden is and always has been a corrupt politician. He always has been. And as far as I'm concerned, the Biden family is a criminal enterprise.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: "The New York Post" reporting Twitter will not unlock its account unless tweets about this bombshell report are in fact deleted. Twitter will not disseminate the story. In fact, Twitter and Facebook are both under fire for saying that they will limit or censor the article.Meanwhile Joe Biden blasting President Trump and his response to the coronavirus pandemic during a rally in North Carolina.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Trump said at one of his rallies, we've turned the corner. My grandfather would say this guy's gone around the bend if he thinks we've turned the corner.Turned the corner? Things are getting worse. He continues to lie to us about the circumstances.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Today President Trump is headed to Arizona for two rallies.Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says she'll give Democrats and Republicans 48 hours to reach a deal if they want to pass coronavirus relief before the election. The ultimatum comes as both sides butt heads on money for local governments, business protections and overall spending on the package. President Trump says he is willing to help get Republicans onboard with a larger package to get a deal done.Global cases of coronavirus meanwhile reportedly crossing the 40 million mark. This according to new Reuters tally. Despite the increase, coronavirus task force member Dr. Anthony Fauci is suggesting no lockdowns. He says he would recommend a national lockdown only if the numbers get quote, "really, really bad". He goes on to say the country right now is fatigued with restrictions.And the Hong Kong stock exchange is holding a listing hearing today to determine whether the Ant Group's initial public offering can proceed. It likely will since China's securities regulator already approved financial tech firm's planned dual listing worth about $35 billion. This will be the largest IPO.The company still has to complete its registration for the Shanghai leg of the IPO. Ant is backed by e-commerce giant Alibaba group and it could earn a market valuation of between $200 billion and $300 billion.It's time for "The Word on Wall Street". Top investors watching your money this week.Joining me right now is Requisite Capital Management managing partner Bryn Talkington. Along with Bulltick Capital Markets head of global research Kathryn Rooney Vera. Strategic Wealth Partners investment strategist Luke Lloyd.Great to see everybody this morning. Thank you so much for being here. And it's a good day to talk.We've got a nice rally underway this morning. Futures pointing to a gain of 228 points at the start of trading. 127 points higher on the Nasdaq as investors assess the potential for a stimulus package as well as review China's economic numbers overnight.Kathryn, we had some really good numbers out of China. Does that tell you anything about the backdrop in the United States?KATHRYN ROONEY VERA, HEAD OF GLOBAL RESEARCH, BULLTICK CAPITAL MARKETS: I think we're unequivocally in an economic recovery, Maria. The question is that initial V-shape, what was it driven by? And I think it was driven by both fiscal and monetary stimuli. So if more is in the offing, we go higher.But the risk of a sputtering out of that initial phase of that V-shape is real. And if you look, Maria, in March when we got the Cares Act and we got a quadrupling of the fiscal deficit and of the fed's commitment to a $700 billion asset purchase program, you saw personal incomes rise or government benefits as a percent of personal incomes rise to 30 percent. That's an enormous number and that should scare us.That is what has driven us to current highs and I think that the market is absolutely, Maria, banking on an additional multitrillion dollar fiscal stimulus package. I think it's inevitable. It's not going to come before election day though, Maria.BARTIROMO: Ok. It's just funny to hear Nancy Pelosi say I'm going to give you, you know, 24 hours, 48 hours and yet it's been her that's been stopping any deal.ROONEY VERA: Right.BARTIROMO: And yet, She's over here, saying I'm going to give you this. It's --ROONEY VERA: Yes.BARTIROMO: Fresh data shows --ROONEY VERA: It is incredible.BARTIROMO: -- China's GDP was up 4.9 percent year on year in the third quarter. This is a reminder that the data is released by the communist party but Bryn, you do have some good numbers here showing up on the economy in China. What's your take on this?BRYN TALKINGTON, MANAGING PARTNER, REQUISITE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Yes, I mean, I think in the second quarter, you know, China did 3.2 percent. This quarter, to your point, it's 4.9.And we all knew that obviously the epicenter of COVID-19 was in China, they had very strict lockdowns, contact tracing. That means that I think it gives us a good glimpse as once this passes and as we get closer to a vaccine and therapeutics over the next couple of months, how quickly markets can rebound.But I do think within China and you mentioned this, you know, before we started, I think investors should really be looking at the much anticipated Ant Group, you know, parent company of Alipay, IPO in the next month or so, I think that, you know, Alipay is looking to be, I think, one of the largest IPOs ever. And, you know, last year had close to 16 trillion of gross payment volumes going to their system.And so I think, you know, as we see China recover, it's a good glimpse that if we can get some stimulus, our market wants to go higher and I think that it's a good time for investors to stay invested because this will pass.BARTIROMO: Yes. I think this is a good point that you make. You've got the Ant Group IPO. And you've got a consistency in terms of lots of IPOs in the calendar and that's been a really robust calendar.We're showing on the screen a deal that's crossing right now. ConocoPhillips, all stock deal to acquire Concho. Transaction valued at almost $10 billion.So the deal flow has also been there with deals and IPOs pretty strong. Does that indicate to you Bryn, that this market has resiliency? Are these things positives for a rally.TALKINGTON: Absolutely. I mean the market wants to go higher, we haven't (INAUDIBLE). And so the investors just need to sit back, climb the wall of worry and, you know, stay invested and enjoy next year and later on this year.I do think we will have a vaccine, we will have better therapeutics.BARTIROMO: All right.Then there's third quarter earnings season, kicking into high gear this week. Eight Dow components reporting, including IBM, Intel, Verizon Communications. There are 80 companies that are on tap. It's going to be a big week.Luke, your expectations and how do the earnings so far appear to you?LUKE LLOYD, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, STRATEGIC WEALTH PARTNERS: We saw bank report earnings last week, they were better than expected. The previous round of stimulus is keeping earnings afloat. That's why hopes of another round is propping up the stock market.All eyes are going to be on technology over the next two weeks. Technology was one of the main sectors that benefited from the pandemic. If that sector shows signs of weakness, all sectors are going to show signs of weakness.So really investors are going to be paying attention to the optimism of technology, the CEOs and their (ph) team over the next couple of years.COVID-19 cases are rising again, European countries are starting to shut down again. If we shut down the economy again, we'll see what we have on the first time but on steroids. Shutting down the economy the first time was like breaking the left arm. Right now, our left arm is still broken. That's small business.If we shut down the economy again it's like breaking our right arm and falling down. We're not going to be able to get up and it's going to take a long time for us to recover. That's large corporations.We saw a disconnect between Main Street and Wall Street. That disconnect might not be anymore if we shut down the economy again. And that's going to be something you want to look for in earnings as well.So it's important to be proactive and not reactive with your portfolio. It's important to be active over passive and stay disciplined in this environment. Because that's how you add up with your portfolio over time.BARTIROMO: Are you saying that you want to buy stocks here or are you being real selective in terms of what you want to buy, obviously.LLOYD: Absolutely, you have you to be selective and active with your investment strategy. If you're not, there's a reason -- last week -- two weeks ago when I was on I talked about why it's important to own winners less than losers. There's a reason that stocks are winning. It's because they're growing right.So you want to own the winners and be active and make sure that you pay attention in the current environment because things are changing every single day.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll leave it there.Bryn Talkington, Kathryn Rooney Vera and Luke Lloyd, thank you so much. We appreciate it.Markets up 200.Also ahead this morning coming up, former New York city mayor Rudy Giuliani is here talking about the Hunter Biden corruption report, wrongdoing on the Democratic side, and his take on the election just two weeks away.Next hour, we will get exclusive insight from the director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe on the Hunter Biden report plus Twitter's censorship of conservative voices.And assistant to the president and director of Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy Peter Navarro joining me on a new report on the economy of swing states. He is zeroing in on the economy in swing states this morning. He kicks off with Michigan.Joining the conversation all morning: Dagen McDowell and Lee Carter. We've got a lot to talk about after this break with the panel.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.More fallout over the Hunter Biden bombshells, e-mails from the former vice president's son's laptop reveal massive business transactions with foreign entities including a potential deal with a Chinese energy company.I spoke with Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" about Biden's involvement in these transactions.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: There's one e-mail that Fox News has been able to verify. In that e-mail it indicates that we're going to hold some money or something aside, 10 percent, for the big guy. Who is the big guy?SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI): Well, people of course, are assuming that is Vice President Biden and of course, there's a completely different computer now with different e-mails. This man, together with Archer Devin, was convicted. He's sitting in jail. Archer Devin, oddly enough, his jury conviction was overturned by a judge who just happens to be married to one of the members of the Mueller's special counsel team that was a lead prosecutor in the Paul Manafort trial.What we're finding is we're finding more and more validation that these e- mails are true. This requires serious investigation and the fact that the mainstream media is suppressing this information from the American public is a scandal in and of itself.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Trump 2020 presidential campaign senior advisor Jason Miller.Jason, the amount of corruption is just striking. It's really -- it's really unsettling and upsetting to see what has taken place -- what has taken place in Washington these last four years and beyond.Do you think this is resonating with the American people? Do you think people are going to vote based on what we're seeing, this corruption?JASON MILLER, TRUMP 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISOR: Maria, good morning.And absolutely, just in the same way that we saw Clinton Inc. become such a big deal down the home stretch in 2016, Biden Inc., a reminder that Biden is a 47-year fixture in the swamp here in Washington, D.C.This is a big part of the reason why voters rejected Hillary Clinton in 2016, why they're going to reject Joe Biden in 2020. Voters are sick and tired of our politicians going to Washington, getting elected and then getting themselves and family members rich, selling access to their office while other people get left behind.And Maria, that was a great clip you played there from Senator Ron Johnson. There's some serious national security issues right now. I think Joe Biden is compromised. He's clearly compromised by the Chinese, if not multiple other governments and it's a real simple answer, Maria.Joe Biden has now dodged this multiple times. Just real basic, former vice president, are you the big guy? Are you the chairman? Is Hunter Biden handling family expenses and setting aside money for you? It's a yes or no question.BARTIROMO: So we've got e-mails that indicate Hunter Biden was being paid out by Ukrainian companies, Chinese companies. Now it appears that there's something on companies in Kazakhstan as well.How is it possible that this all went on under the radar, and people didn't understand that Hunter Biden was traveling with his father, setting up meetings, saying to them pay me and then I'll introduce you to my father.How did this go on with a vice president in place for two terms?MILLER: Because the media only covers it if it's a Republican. They've turned a blind eye to anything Democrats do. I mean again, for folks that are watching at home, you might not realize this. They did it all out in the open.Hunter Biden flew to China on Air Force 2 with former vice president Biden to go try to close this $1.5 billion investment deal with a bank that's tied in with the Chinese government.I mean, the fact that they do this out in the open is just ridiculous and $10 million a year, simply just for access or a board putting you on an energy company for $83,000 a month with no energy experience.It's all for one thing. It's to sell access. And Maria, right now we're talking about the information has been backed up by Fox News independently, by the way, in addition to "The New York Post".We haven't even started scratching the surface of Frank and James -- Joe Biden's brothers who are also lobbyists and grifters who have been making a lot of money off the system for years. I think we're just getting started here.BARTIROMO: So the Biden campaign is not denying that these e-mails are Hunter Biden's but Joe Biden is not answering any questions on it. There's video that a reporter asked Joe Biden what's your comment on the FBI seizing Hunter Biden's laptop last year? And he just -- he just walked away.I assume this is going to come up on Thursday night for this upcoming debate. Is the president planning on bringing this up if the moderator doesn't? I mean, the president weighed in on the scandal this weekend with a tweet and the president tweeted this. "Hunter Biden's laptop is a disaster for the entire Biden family but especially for his father, Joe. It's now a proven fact and cannot be denied that all of the information is the real deal. That makes it impossible for 50 percent or 10 percent Joe to ever assume the office of the president."And of course, he's referring to the 10 percent for the big guy e-mail. Is the president planning on bringing this up Thursday night?MILLER: Well, if Kristin Walker (ph) the moderator doesn't bring it up, I think you're pretty safe to assume that the president will. Again, these are real simple questions that Joe Biden needs to answer to the American public.And keep in mind this is also supposed to be a debate on foreign policy. I know the debate commission is now trying to move the goal post yet again and work in a bunch of other issues. But we're going to talk about Biden's support for endless wars. We're going to talk about the pallets of cash they loaded up to billions of dollars, sent them to Iran. And then you better believe we're going to talk about all the foreign corruption, the foreign money that's been coming into the Biden family.And if Joe Biden can't answer these real simple questions, you know he's running from something.BARTIROMO: Are you serious? The debate was supposed to be about foreign policy and now the debate commission is changing it after this news broke? This is -- you know, the American people --(CROSSTALK)MILLER: Absolutely. It was supposed to be --BARTIROMO: -- just want honesty. That's all we want is an honest election.Jason, it's good to see you this morning. Thank you so much.MILLER: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Jason Miller from the Trump campaign.Be sure to tune in next hour. I'll be getting exclusive insight from the director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe sees more intelligence than anybody else other than the president.He is going to tell us if this is real, if this is Russian disinformation. He will tell us what he knows about the Hunter Biden corruption reports coming up. That's at 8:00 a.m. Eastern, don't miss it.We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.More fallout from the Biden bombshell this morning from Hunter Biden's e- mails which revealed huge business transactions with foreign companies while his father was the vice president. Hunter was getting payouts for setting up meetings with his father to the tune of tens of millions of dollars, setting up joint ventures.President Trump says the information reported by "The New York Post" is, quote, "the real deal". On "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" I spoke with Donald Trump, Jr. and got his take. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, JR., EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, TRUMP ORGANIZATION: What we're finding right now is everything that the Democrats and the media -- and I group them as one and the same at this point because that's pretty clear. And you can include social media with that.Everything that they hoped and prayed I was doing, that they made me testify for 30 hours for, that they said that I committed treason doing -- Hunter Biden was actually doing with knowledge of Joe Biden.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: This is unbelievable.And Dagen, you know that what I'm most struck by is the fact that the FBI had this information a year ago. The fact that the FBI had the e-mails and the laptop in its possession in November of 2019. They had it in December of 2019.And a month later, the Senate impeached Donald Trump because of a phone call he had with the head of Ukraine. If you are in possession of information that indicates that his opponent, Joe Biden, was actually having his son do deals with Ukraine, wouldn't that have been information to take to Congress to raise your hand about, while a Senate impeachment trial is underway, Dagen?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Right. The American people deserve an answer from the FBI as for what was going on there and I know that it's more than a dozen GOP members of the House have called on the FBI to answer that.And we should point out that Joe Biden on Friday was asked at a Detroit airport about the story about Hunter Biden's laptop and his response was I have no response, another smear campaign, right up your alley which was directed at the CBS reporter. So that's his response. And it was a testy response.BARTIROMO: That's the response even as Senator Ron Johnson is calling on the FBI director, Christopher Wray, to confirm or deny the details related to the Hunter Biden laptop scandal. I mean Trump is saying that his father will clean up the FBI in a second term. Here's Donald Trump, Jr.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)D. TRUMP: And the reality is, I think when Donald Trump wins, he has to break up the highest level of the FBI. He has to get rid of these things and more importantly, maybe break up the swamp in general.You know, why is the Department of the Interior headed out of Washington. Why don't we spread all of those things up throughout America and maybe these people and leaders, I use that in very loose air quotes, can actually be more around the people that they truly represent rather than being controlled by the swamp that we now recognize is totally corrupted and totally broken.BARTIROMO: Yes.D. TRUMP: That's Donald Trump's next move if I'm him and if he wins which I think he will because what's going on is disgusting. This is the stuff of Communist China.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Lee Carter, your reaction to this? Should Donald Trump get a second term I would expect that Christopher Wray is going to be out. Same with Gina Haspel.Let me just remind you of one other thing. It took John Ratcliffe, the director of National Intelligence, to out the e-mails and the John Brennan notes that indicate Hillary Clinton's idea to tie Donald Trump to Russia. It was all Hillary Clinton's idea.These are handwritten notes from John Brennan and they were sitting there at the FBI, Christopher Wray's overseeing it. It took the director of National Intelligence to declassify that, to allow America to understand what took place.This is what's been going on the last four years. The FBI sitting on documents. That's called obstruction of justice.LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS: I think what we're going to see now, and we have seen for some time, is trust in institutions that are most important to us is dead. And when you lose trust in institutions, then we really lose a lot in this country. And that's when things can get really, really dangerous. So I think it's very, very important that the integrity of these institutions is restored.BARTIROMO: I could not agree more. Bingo.Coming up, probing wrongdoing. We're going to talk with former New York city mayor, Rudy Giuliani. He is here to discuss the Hunter Biden corruption reports that he helped to break. What he knows, what's coming out, next.Apparently there is a trove, a treasure trove, they're calling it of information that will be released this week.Plus name that tune, Google has a new tool to help you find the song that's been stuck in your head. It's making a buzz this morning.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA, live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, October 19. A look at markets this morning, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast, we've got a rally underway this morning, Futures indicating a gain of 200 points on the Dow Industrials right out of the gate, the NASDAQ is up 119, and the S&P 500 higher by 28. Markets are being boosted by positive GDP and retail sales numbers out of China, indicating a recovering economy.Friday, meanwhile, the market was mixed but investors there too reacted to strong retail sales numbers, and of course hopes for a vaccine by year-end. The Dow Industrials were up 112 points on Friday, the NASDAQ was lower by 42, the S&P 500 higher Friday by half of a point.Meanwhile European markets look like this, this morning new lockdown measures are in effect across Europe after spikes in coronavirus. The FTSE100 is down 14, the CAC quarante is up 16, and the DAX Index in Germany lower by about 8 points.In Asia overnight, markets mostly higher. Interesting to note that the Shanghai Composite did not react to pretty good news out of China, reporting a 4.9 percent expansion in third quarter GDP from a year earlier, retail sales were up 3.3 percent; these numbers of course of the Chinese Communist Party. And the best performer overnight was Japan, Nikkei average up better than 1 percent.Back here this morning, more fallout from Hunter Biden's emails, revealing huge business transactions with foreign companies, tied to those foreign governments, while his father was the sitting Vice President.Hunter was getting payouts for setting up meetings with his father to the tune of tens of millions of dollars and also setting up joint ventures where he and potentially his father could have a stake in them. I spoke with California Congressman Devin Nunes on Sunday Morning Futures yesterday to get his reaction to last week's bombshell news.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Your colleague over in the Intel Committee, Adam Schiff, is telling the press that this is all Russian disinformation. And you say?REP. DEVIL NUNES (R-CA): Well, I would just say go back for the last four years, this is the genius that said he had more than circumstantial evidence that the Trump campaign was colluding with Russia. What we now know is, we now have evidence it was actually the Democrats, the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign that were colluding with Russia.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Former New York City Mayor, President Trump's Personal Attorney, Rudy Giuliani. Rudy, it's good to have you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us. You have been talking about this for a long time and finally, we have some evidence here from these emails. Tell us how you see it. What took place here, Rudy?RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: Well, I mean, I've proved this about four different times including eyewitnesses' tapes that go back a year. The hard drive, when viewed completely, which I have now done, I mean, is a damning piece of evidence, not just against Joe Biden, but against a number of members of this family.And what it shows is, out of the words of his son, a 30-year conspiracy in which his son, his brother, several other relatives who would act as bagmen, meaning they collect the money, and at least half of it would go back to Joe, sometimes more. So we have one specific transaction where Joe is getting - this is after he's out of office and - actually he's in business with what is probably a front for a Chinese communist operation.The guy who was running is a Chinese communist operative named Xi - Ying Ming (ph) who now is probably sitting below the Yangtze River, and Joe family is going to get $10 million a year, and they're going to get 50 percent of the profits.Joe will get, according to the calculation done by his relatives on the hard drive, Joe will get about half of that, but then he'll get 10 percent of the overall profit. And you see that on the piece of paper you just put on, it says 10 percent to H, meaning Hunter, for the big guy. So now we've got to figure out who the big guy is unless - unless you're The New York Times and The Washington Post and the corrupt media, you know who the big guy is, it's Joe.But just in case you wonder, the next - the very next or second email after that, they're giving out the keys to the new office of this Chinese communist front. Well, the first two keys are going to go to Joe Biden and Jill Biden.I mean it's outrageous, Maria, this is outrageous. The guy was going to be in business with Chinese communists and he's running for President. And his son was in business with the Chinese government, when he was Vice President. It's outrageous.(CROSSTALK)And why did he - and he sold us out to China.BARTIROMO: And I think that's why most - many people cannot believe this. I mean, it's so extraordinary.GIULIANI: I can't believe it.BARTIROMO: It's so outrageous.GIULIANI: This is an outrageous scandal.BARTIROMO: That Hunter Biden is travelling with his father who was Vice President--GIULIANI: It's been going on for 30 years. All over.BARTIROMO: Yes, so I mean, did President Obama know--GIULIANI: He was on Air Force Two more often than anyone.BARTIROMO: Did any - but doesn't Trump understand--GIULIANI: How could President Obama not know? Was he stupid?BARTIROMO: --I mean that's why. When you first - hold on, when you first look at this - when you first look at the story, it's so outrageous, it's so corrupt that most people say it could not have happened, how is this possible? But this happened.I mean, did President Obama know? Did anybody else in the administration know? How is it possible that Hunter Biden is profiting off of the fact that his father is Vice President and they're doing side deals that say Hunter's going to get 10 percent, the big guy's going to get 10 percent, we've got a joint venture, just so that Hunter can, in exchange for the money, give influence and give meetings with the Vice President of the United States. Who else knew in the administration, in your view?GIULIANI: Well, if they didn't know, they didn't know deliberately. I mean, if they didn't know, we don't have an intelligence service during the Obama administration. I mean, his contacts with Ukraine, Russia, China had to be monitored. He's the son of the Vice President.Meanwhile, half the time, he's out on crack, just look at the photographs, out on crack during most of the time. You don't think the Chinese have that? You don't think the Russians have that? If they don't have it, we don't have enemies. I mean, they're not even worthy adversaries.Of course, they have it. They got Joe locked up about 10 different ways. And then we wonder why did Joe sell out to China. We think because he is stupid, maybe because he was getting $30 million, $40 million from China, I don't know. Nobody else will get that break if they were selling out and their kid was getting $30 million or $40 million and he was getting half of it. I mean, Joe lost every negotiation with China.BARTIROMO: What you're hitting on now, it goes beyond just corruption.GIULIANI: He sold out our country.BARTIROMO: What you're hitting on now are National Security--GIULIANI: Damn right I am.BARTIROMO: --issues for the United States of America.GIULIANI: 100 percent.BARTIROMO: If China has all of this on Hunter Biden and has all of this on Joe Biden, that's a National Security problem. That is - that's exactly what they were saying about Trump four years ago--GIULIANI: Gigantic one.BARTIROMO: --Russia has this and Russia has that on Trump, obviously not true at all. But this is where this gets to. So my next question has to be, why did the FBI sit on this? The FBI had this laptop in November of 2019.Two months later, there was a Senate trial to impeach Donald Trump, President Trump impeached by the Senate, and you're telling me that the FBI is sitting on information about payouts to Hunter Biden from Ukraine, exactly what they're talking about with Trump and the impeachment, and they don't raise their hand, they don't send this stuff to Congress? I don't understand this.GIULIANI: Yes, I understand it, and now I do. I mean they didn't send the Brennan note either that would actually obviate the whole Russian probe. Hillary is responsible for the Russian probe, according to the Brennan memos. They hid that.I mean, only thing I can conclude is, there is a small group at the top of the FBI that hates Trump, and they haven't been rooted out. They haven't been taken out. They're still there. And they hate this country. I'm sorry, you don't do this to this country. Look, when you see Hunter Biden next to Barack Obama--BARTIROMO: This is an extraordinary scandal.GIULIANI: --OK, Maria let me just get this output, when you see Hunter Biden next to Barack Obama, I'll give you a picture of Hunter Biden in a crack den three days later. Now, the Intelligence Service doesn't know that they're letting into the White House and putting on Air Force Two a completely degenerate crack addict. The pictures of him smoking crack are overwhelming. And I'm not going to tell you what the other pictures are.The pictures of him smoking crack are overwhelming, with women, without women, by himself, locked up in a closet.BARTIROMO: See, I think the whole thing about--GIULIANI: This isn't a national security risk that other say (ph), this guy is walking around the White House, he's on Air Force Two, he's on Air Force One, and our Intelligence Service doesn't know it. If they did know it--BARTIROMO: That's bad, that's bad. I get that, that's bad. But I would rather not focus on the drug part of this, because people have problems, he obviously has problems. That's his problem, I wish him well.But if he is raping the United States, if he is taking money from Chinese companies that are tied to the Chinese Communist Party and enriching his own family, including a sitting Vice President, that's something that the whole country should be outraged about. Put the drugs aside, I just want to talk about what potentially went on here and what the national security risks are?GIULIANI: I can't put the drugs aside, Maria, I can't. Nobody hires a drug addict and gives him $20 million. I mean, how many things do we need to prove that Joe Biden was getting this money?When the crooked Ukrainian oligarch gave the family anywhere from $10 million to $14 million, you mean to tell me they were paying for Hunter Biden who just got tossed out of the Navy because of drugs? His drug problem is not just his personal drug problem. It's a drug problem that his father imposed on the United States of America--BARTIROMO: OK, that's a fair point.GIULIANI: --and imperiled the security of the United States of America. And I used to give Joe the benefit of the doubt. I used to say he sold out to China because he's dumb, because he's been dumb since he's a kid. He didn't sell out to China because he's dumb. He sold out to China because China owns him lock, stock and barrel. In any case, the people who were screwed here are the people of the United States.BARTIROMO: That's absolutely right.GIULIANI: Every negotiation he was involved in, he lost. Every negotiation he was involved in, the crooked Biden crime family made millions, and the outrageous press is hiding it. They're just as guilty as he is.BARTIROMO: What you're going to - that's another massive scandal, the fact that the press is hiding this, you're not seeing this disseminated on the mainstream media, Twitter and Facebook have made a decision, we will not disseminate this information.What are you going to do about it? How are you going to ensure that the American people understand what took place here? Anybody would be outraged by this. Then again, for four years, the mainstream media went with this story of collusion, President Trump colluding with the Russians and then they were - the whole story blew up in their face and there's been no mea culpas there either. So maybe I'm not surprised that the media is totally hiding this story. They've taken a side.GIULIANI: Maria, all I can do is speak the truth, which I've been doing from the very beginning. I've been attacked, I've been threatened, I've lost clients, I've lost friends, I've been called all kind - and I've been investigated by the Southern District of New York for no reason at all except harassment. I mean, they've done everything to silence me they can possibly do. And all that does is make me more determined because they are hurting my country very, very badly.This is a criminal conspiracy by the Bidens to sell out the United States of America. What they leave behind in Ukraine, in China, in Russia is the impression that we're a corrupt country. All of us are corrupt.BARTIROMO: That's right. Well, this is outrageous.GIULIANI: And by the way, the way some of our corporations are acting, maybe we are. Maybe too many of us are corrupt and we should get them the hell out of government and get them the hell out of business, because we're mostly honest people.BARTIROMO: Yes. We got to jump.GIULIANI: America is not a corrupt country.BARTIROMO: Real quick, is there's more coming up, Rudy, that the public has not seen - is there more that the public hasn't seen in this?GIULIANI: Yes, Maria. There is more coming out, and the only reason I'm putting it out this way is because if I put it out all at once, they just dismiss it all at once. I'm putting it out this way--BARTIROMO: Right.GIULIANI: --because I hope that, with the accumulation of this, people will see the truth. Yes, there is more coming out. There's more money, there are more sordid acts, and there's some pretty damn disgusting things this family was involved in, really disgusting.BARTIROMO: Wow. Rudy Giuliani, thank you very much for being here. We'll see - we obviously will be watching that.GIULIANI: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: We've got John Ratcliffe coming up on the other side of this break. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Jobs in America, both President Trump and Joe Biden making American jobs a cornerstone of their presidential campaigns, the candidates are calling for supply chains to be brought back from China, back to the United States as the Made in America remains a priority. But, what would this mean for real estate with - the boom in American business? Joining us right now to talk more about all of that is Rockspring Founder and CEO, Jim McAlister. Jim, it's great to see you this morning. Thank you so much for being here.JIM MCALISTER, FOUNDER, PRESIDENT & CEO, ROCKSPRING CAPITAL & MCALISTER REAL ESTATE: Hey, Maria. Great to be back with you.BARTIROMO: You know, I think during this pandemic, many Americans figured out and learned the fact that 70 percent of the active ingredients in our prescription drugs are made in China. And I think many people said -MCALISTER: Yes.BARTIROMO: Whoa, whoa, we cannot rely on foreign governments to produce something so important as penicillin and ibuprofen, et cetera. That was one of the springboards to getting this theme going where we've got to produce here, we've got to create jobs here, we got to fire up the manufacturing base. How easy is it to do that? That can't happen overnight though, right? We've got a lot of manufacturing of American important items happening in China.MCALISTER: That's correct, Maria. But it is going to happen, no doubt. There's too much of a spotlight on this very serious problem and so there's going to be millions of manufacturing jobs coming back to the good old U.S.A., away from China, which is great. And I have no doubt in my mind that Texas will receive more of those jobs than any other state. We have the - one in (ph) scale. We have the 10th largest economy in the world, low taxes, low regulations, natural resources, infrastructure, and - so, I can tell you without a doubt that the crane will continue to be the state bird of Texas for quite some time.BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, you've got a high-tax exodus, Texas becoming one of the hottest markets for business, leaving states like California because of the high taxes there, New York as well. Comparing the taxes on businesses, California puts a nearly 9 percent corporate tax rate on companies while Texas charges less than 1 percent franchise tax, Jim, no income tax there as well. What has happened as a result of all of this?MCALISTER: So Maria, pre-COVID, Texas was leading the nation in job growth and population growth. What we've seen since COVID hit is an acceleration into the migration into Texas. Because of these extreme lockdowns, extreme problems that these other states are having, so the movement into Texas is happening at even a faster pace than before and that's having a dramatic positive impact on our real estate market throughout the state, throughout the very different sectors too.BARTIROMO: Real quick, where are the jobs in America right now, Jim?MCALISTER: The jobs are happening - Texas is for sure leading. They're just - jobs are flooding away from high-tax, high-regulation places like New York and California, and flooding into primarily Texas, and throughout the other states that have similar attributes as Texas.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll leave it there. Jim, it's good to see you this morning. Thank you so much, Jim McAlister.MCALISTER: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Be sure to preorder my new book, "The Cost: Trump, China, and American Revival." The book is out next week. You can preorder it right now at thecostbook.com. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Time for the morning buzz. First up, a private movie night. AMC now allows you and up to 20 friends to rent out a theater, starting at $99. Prices could go up to $349 depending on the film you want to watch. It's the latest way hard-hit movie theaters are trying to create some revenue, get some customers back. Lee, what movie would you screen for - for friends? It's a good idea.LEE CARTER, POLLSTER AND MASLANSKY + PARTNERS PRESIDENT: You know, there's a hundred movies that I'd would love to go and see with my friends. I think this is a great idea. I love to see how businesses are adapting, innovating, trying to find ways to keep going through tough times. What a great idea, to go - even just be able to go with just your family to a movie theater and have some semblance of normalcy for a night, and even feel like it's exclusive. I think it's a great idea.BARTIROMO: I think so too.CARTER: Sign me up.BARTIROMO: OK, guys. How about this? You know when you have that song in your head and you can't remember what it is? You are trying to name that tune, just hum it. Google has a tool that lets you search for a song by either humming it, singing it or whistling the tune. The feature is available on Android phones and iPhones. Dagen, do you plan to use this feature?MCDOWELL: No. My great aunt, Irene (ph) used to hum all day long everyday; drove my entire family bananas because it was in the work place. Number one, the only humming that I'll do is tapping (ph). Guess that movie.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: I know the movie.CARTER: Wolf of Wall Street.BARTIROMO: That's Wolf of Wall Street.MCDOWELL: Yes. Wolf of Wall Street; Mark Hanna was a real person.BARTIROMO: That's exactly right.

CODDLING CHINA: WHEN WILL IT END?States News ServiceOctober 27, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1349 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: CHICAGO, IL BodyThe following information was released by the Heartland Institute:By Duggan FlanakinOriginally posted on Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT)Now US social media aid and profit from Chinese censorship skills, instead of challenging themWhat is it about China that enables the world's most populous nation to be such a favorite of the international globalist, socialist community (while lambasting Russia, which officially abandoned communism three decades ago)?In 1997, six years after the demise of the Soviet Union, China was granted an exemption from any obligations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions under the Kyoto Protocol (as was India) on grounds that it was a "developing nation." And despite the posturing over the Paris climate agreement, China's CO2 emissions soared while the ink on President Xi's signature was still wet.One reason cited by President Trump for pulling the U.S. out was that the Paris accords committed the U.S. to massive, immediate CO2 emission reductions (26 to 28 percent by 2025). China only committed to its previously announced goal to increase non-fossil-fuel electricity to about 20 percent by 2030.China today, with the world's 59th highest per capita income (IMF data, with India at No. 139), is building or planning over 300 coal-fired power plants in places as widely spread as Turkey, Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Egypt, and the Philippines. The world's leading emitter of CO2 is also building what Wired calls "an insane number" of new coal-fired power plants at home with little objection from the gatekeepers at the United Nations.Meanwhile, over half of the people in sub-Saharan Africa lack access to electricity, largely because the United Nations' "sustainable development goals" dissuade investment in coal, natural gas, or even nuclear power plants while favoring dung, wood, wind, and solar (in nations without electric grids or highways).According to Human Rights Watch, China's government sees human rights as an "existential threat," a stance which "could pose an existential threat to the rights of people worldwide." The Nobel Peace Prize winning organization says that the Chinese Communist Party "has constructed an Orwellian high-tech surveillance state and a sophisticated internet censorship system to monitor and suppress public criticism."Human Rights Watch singled out "a void of leadership among countries that might have stood for human rights, and a disappointing collection of democracies willing to sell the rope that is strangling the system of rights they purport to uphold."And now, with massive help from Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Google, and other willing collaborators, the Chinese Communists are aiding and abetting a recipient of Chinese largesse, a veteran of coddling China, to this nation's highest office. [One example: Hunter Biden worked with Chinese investors to fund China General Nuclear Power Corp., a firm recently charged by the FBI for stealing nuclear secrets in the United States.]These organizations, hiding behind the fa ade of "private enterprise," have led an assault on First Amendment freedom of speech by censoring content unfavorable to their causes. [These same organizations never objected to infringement of the rights of an Oregon bakery's First Amendment claim regarding baking a cake.]They have been joined by Democratic governors who, with no legislative directives, used the cover of COVID 19 to impose outright bans on church attendance even Bible studies in private homes and to destroy selected businesses while sanctioning violent protests.Universities have imposed Draconian bans on freedom of speech, assembly, religion, and other rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. Others now insist that the Constitution itself is outdated and should be immediately replaced along with all of its protections for the individual against the imperial state.The whole world knows very well that China wants to see Joe Biden in the White House. Perhaps that is why Democrats have unilaterally attacked "Russian interference" with the U.S. elections and totally ignored the massive contributions being made by the Chinese government.Brand new evidence of Chinese collusion came to light with the revelation (with more new shocking evidence daily) that Chinese communists are advising Facebook on how to censor, de-platform, and shadow ban information that might favor the Republican candidate or cast the Democratic candidate in a poor light.Iranian-American journalist Sorrab Ahmari obtained (and confirmed) information from a Facebook insider that the social media giant's "Hate Speech Engineering" team is loaded with Chinese PhD's whose specialty is "machine learning" teaching computers how to learn and act without being explicitly programmed so that certain content ends up at the top of the news feed and other content shows up "dead last."While a Facebook spokesperson haughtily condemned any suggestion that "these employees have an outsized influence on our broader policies" as "absurd," Ahmari is quite correct in asking what's to stop these Chinese engineers from delivering intelligence to the Chinese government?Facebook's total ban on negative information on the Biden family's business dealings with Chinese companies is a strong indicator that the company is serving China's interests in securing the election of "the Big Guy." According to a new Project Veritas expose, Google (now facing a federal antitrust case*) is intentionally manipulating results in order to benefit Democrats and to hinder President Trump's campaign.[*The Justice Department, together with the Attorneys General of 11 states, alleges in a nonpartisan case that, "For years, Google has entered into exclusionary agreements, including tying arrangements, and engaged in anticompetitive conduct to lock up distribution channels and block rivals."]Despite the angst of the intellectuals, the media, the socialists, and many leaders of the Democratic Party, a new poll announced by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. (CSIS) found that a majority of Americans view China negatively and believe (along with Human Rights Watch) that it is the country that presents the greatest threat to the United States (and the rights of the individual).The broad-based support for banning China's Huawei Technologies from 5G networks reflects worldwide concerns over Chinese human rights violations. Scott Kennedy, Chinese business and economics chair at CSIS, asserted that "Americans and others around the world have given up on the idea that the goal should be to change China into a free-market economy."A recent article by MSN News noted that historically, Joe Biden had embraced the idea that the U.S. could coax China into acting as a "responsible stakeholder," but that he no longer adheres to that viewpoint.The former Vice President has taken few questions from the media about his China policy, though he did claim he would end the Trump tariffs on Chinese imports. But that statement was almost immediately walked back by aides to clarify that Biden would only "reevaluate the tariffs upon taking office."The acceptance by the Biden-Harris campaign and many of its supporters of Chinese-style restrictions on human rights may be a signal that the U.S. Democratic Party sees the Xi-led Chinese Communist Party as a kindred spirit.Yet, despite the near-total media blackout on the recent revelations regarding the Biden family and Chinese business (hence military) interests, a President Biden might have to show a new toughness against China to put out what could become a raging forest fire of California proportions. Too many Americans are not willing to see jobs recently regained from slave laborers be returned to the Middle Kingdom.That is, unless the Democrats and their social media and old media allies have perfected censorship enough to drown out any legitimate opposition that would threaten their absolute reign.And if that happens, who will dare challenge China's environmental callousness?[Originally posted on Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT)]Load-Date: October 27, 2020End of Document

Center for American Progress: 'There Is a Solution to the Huawei Challenge'Targeted News ServiceOctober 16, 2020 Friday 9:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2076 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Center for American Progress issued the following report entitled "There Is a Solution to the Huawei Challenge" by Melanie Hart, senior fellow and director of China policy, and Jordan Link, China policy analyst for national security and international policy.Here are the excerpts:Introduction and summaryChinese telecommunications titan Huawei is on track to become the world's biggest fifth-generation (5G) mobile network equipment supplier./1That is a problem. U.S. intelligence agencies fear that if global networks run on Huawei equipment, Beijing could use that equipment to gather intelligence, steal trade secrets, track down and punish its critics, and potentially bring down networks to incapacitate other nations in times of crisis. The Trump administration is trying to convince other nations that these risks warrant banning Huawei from their 5G networks. Thus far, few countries are signing on to that approach./2The reasons are simple. First, the mobile network equipment market is an oligopoly with just four major vendors to choose from--none of which is a U.S. company. Second, Beijing deploys powerful industrial policies to make Huawei equipment cheaper to deploy than the three alternatives.For the telecom companies making network equipment purchases--and the national governments who regulate them--the security risks associated with Huawei equipment are theoretical and hard to quantify. But the cost associated with choosing an alternative vendor (Ericsson, Nokia, or Samsung) and forgoing the lucrative incentives Beijing offers to Huawei's customers are immediate and measurable. Thus far, the United States has largely overlooked the market-distorting industrial policies that Beijing uses to make Huawei the global front-runner. This must change. If the United States can successfully counter those policies to make this market more competitive, that will make the security side of the 5G challenge much easier to solve.The shift from fourth- to fifth-generation mobile telecommunications creates an opportunity for the United States not only to tackle China's market-distorting industrial policies but also to help U.S. firms play a much bigger role. Network equipment is a single-vendor market: When an operator purchases equipment from one vendor, it cannot mix in technology from other companies. This market is overdue for a shift to interoperability. For example, in the personal computing market, buyers previously had to buy their desktop, monitor, and printer from the same vendor, but today they can mix and match. Mobile telecom operators should be able to do the same, and pressure is growing to move the market in this direction. If the mobile network equipment market becomes truly interoperable, it will no longer be an oligopoly. U.S. firms will have new opportunities to enter the market, and it will be much harder for Beijing to suppress competition and maintain Huawei's dominant position.While the U.S. Congress is already taking steps to support the shift toward a more diverse and interoperable equipment market, the United States has not yet taken on China's market-distorting industrial policies./3Many U.S. observers appear to assume Huawei is a naturally strong competitor that gained its dominant position through good business strategy. Huawei certainly made good decisions along the way, but it owes its rise to Chinese industrial policies that have suppressed global competition for nearly two decades. The United States cannot succeed in bringing new competition to this market--and new opportunities for U.S. firms--until it effectively counters Beijing's market distortions. Three aspects of Beijing's playbook are particularly important:1.China provides direct and indirect subsidies--including guaranteed market share within China and cheap credit from Chinese state banks--that reduce Huawei's operational costs, speed time to market for Huawei's products, and allow it to price its products well below prices set by its competitors.2. Chinese state banks provide generous financing to Huawei's customers on terms most commercial banks cannot match, making Huawei equipment cheaper to deploy at any price.3. Chinese officials interfere in the standardization process at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to increase Huawei's share of the emerging global 5G standard, making Huawei equipment even harder to avoid and setting it up to extend its dominance into 6G and beyond.These three aspects of Chinese industrial policy are mutually reinforcing. Together, they fuel Huawei's takeover of the global telecom market and are making it difficult for the United States to convince other nations to choose a more secure option.This report details the most important distortionary policies Beijing deploys and offers policy measures the United States can implement to push back. It draws on authors' interviews with 20 technical experts working across the 5G supply chain, ranging from engineers putting forward technical contributions at the ITU to mobile network operators weighing their 5G equipment options. The authors utilized open-source Chinese government documents and media reports to gather new insights about Beijing's intentions and actions. As is often the case, Chinese leaders are straightforward about their aims when speaking to their own domestic audience and sending orders down the massive Chinese government bureaucracy. The authors also tracked Huawei's equipment deals around the world and compiled a database--shared in the Appendix--of the loans Chinese state banks provide to Huawei's global customers.Countering China's market-distorting industrial policies and speeding the shift toward a more interoperable, diverse, and competitive 5G network equipment market are goals many other nations share. Broadening the U.S. approach to include this aspect of the Huawei challenge will make it easier for the United States to work in concert with its allies and partners. By building a broad coalition, nations can work toward common objectives--instead of working in isolation, as the Trump administration is doing.To effectively counter China's market-distorting industrial policies, support the shift toward a more diverse and interoperable wireless network ecosystem, and open the door to new U.S. market entrants, this report argues that the United States should:* Form a coalition of nations to assess how Beijing's direct and indirect subsidies harm the global market and devise appropriate trade remedies. The European Commission's 2010-2014 investigation--which reportedly compiled enough evidence to justify countervailing duties of up to 70 percent--provides an excellent starting point.* Conduct a comprehensive review to assess how Beijing uses credit to advantage Chinese firms over their competitors and engage the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized democracies to develop new rules limiting those actions. Current trade rules allow Beijing to leverage the nation's state banks to distort global markets and drive foreign firms out of business. That cannot continue.* Provide fast-track export financing for American vendors deploying disruptive technologies--such as virtualized networks--and conducting their research, development, and manufacturing in the United States. American companies are developing innovative approaches that could revolutionize 5G, but financing is a challenge, particularly for smaller firms.* Form a coalition of export credit agencies to support vendors seeking to compete against Huawei and the loans that Chinese state banks offer its customers. This coalition should set high standards for interoperability and security, including supply chain security.* Engage the key 5G standardization partners--the European Union, Japan, India, and South Korea--to improve leadership transparency and diversity at the ITU. The ITU should not allow Chinese government officials to move directly from the nation's telecom ministry to key ITU positions or serve in the same positions without term limits.* Provide targeted financial support to increase U.S. participation in ITU standardization forums. The United States should empower smaller vendors to increase their voice, particularly those working on interoperable or disruptive solutions and those doing their research, development, and manufacturing in the United States.* Push the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to adopt the O-RAN Alliance open fronthaul interface as a common global standard. A truly open interface is needed to give smaller vendors--including disruptive U.S. vendors--a foothold in the 5G ecosystem.* Speed time-to-market for disruptive U.S. innovation and reduce global dependence on 5G radios and other network components that are primarily developed and manufactured in China. Targeted public investments are needed to help U.S. firms overcome the market barriers that Beijing has created through decades of distortionary industrial policy in this sector.With this set of policies in place, the United States can pursue a much more comprehensive strategy that will address both the security and the market aspects of the Huawei challenge, driving the global market toward a more diverse and competitive ecosystem that will enable the United States to achieve its goals in 5G, 6G, and beyond. Understanding and countering China's market-distorting industrial policies is the first step.* * *ConclusionHuawei is currently on a path to become the world's biggest 5G mobile network equipment provider, but it is by no means traveling that path alone. Huawei owes its rise to Chinese industrial policies that have suppressed global competition for nearly two decades. Effectively countering those policies is a critical first step in allowing the global community to move toward a more open, secure, and diverse mobile network ecosystem. That transition will benefit the United States and all other nations that prefer a level playing field over one in which Beijing determines global market outcomes. The policies outlined above can help the United States pave the way toward this new path.* * *About the authorsMelanie Hart is a senior fellow and director of China Policy at the Center for American Progress.

CAMBODIA SLAMS US SANCTIONS ON CHINESE DEVELOPER AS ATTACK ON SOVEREIGNTYStates News ServiceSeptember 16, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1315 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Cambodia's government on Wednesday condemned the U.S. Department of Treasury's decision to sanction a Chinese developer building a massive project in the country's Koh Kong province over graft and rights abuses, calling the allegations "false" and saying the jungle resort plan was going ahead.The Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on Tuesday sanctioned Union Development Group (UDG) for the "seizure and demolition of local Cambodians' land" during construction of the Dara Sakor project, prohibiting the company from doing business with any U.S. citizen and cutting it off from the U.S. financial system.The Treasury said that in order to obtain the land for the U.S. $3.8 billion-dollar projectwhich includes an airport, deep water seaport, and casino resort as part of an investment zone in the middle of the jungleUDG falsified its registration to say that it was Cambodian owned before reverting to its true Chinese ownership and continuing to operate without repercussions.UDG was designated under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act for "acting for or on behalf of a current or former government official, who is responsible for or complicit in, or has directly or indirectly engaged in corruption"in this case, a Chinese-owned company acting on behalf of a Chinese official.The Treasury said some of UDG's "seizure and demolition" of land for the Dara Sakor project was conducted through Kun Kim, a former senior Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF) who the agency sanctioned in December last year for corruption. It said Kun Kim had directed military forces to prevent villagers from planting rice paddy fields on disputed lands, as well as burn down their houses and control their movements.The agency also raised concerns that Beijing may be using the project to secretly build a deep-water port naval base and airstrip for military use there as part of a bid to secure its territorial claims in the disputed waters of the South China Sea. It noted that Cambodian government spokesperson Phay Siphan has said Dara Sakor could be converted to host military assets.On Wednesday, Phay Siphan posted a message on his Facebook page denouncing the Treasury's "false allegations" and said the agency had misquoted him."It is an exaggeration," he said of the statement.RFA's Khmer Service was unable to reach Phay Siphan for comment on the sanctions. Calls to Kun Kim also went unanswered on Wednesday.Sok Ey San, spokesperson for Prime Minister Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP), told reporters that while Washington acted within its rights in leveling sanctions against UDG, the company's project plan was vetted and approved by the Cambodia Development Council and would proceed as planned."What we have done is a matter of sovereignty," he said. "Foreign sanctions will have no impact as the development is moving forward without any obstacles."Sok Ey San said he did not expect that the Treasury's decision would affect bilateral relations between Washington and Phnom Penh.Sanctions welcomedThe Dara Sakor project has been mired in controversy ever since UDG's parent company, Tianjin Wanlong Group, was granted a 99-year lease to 90,000 acres along 20 percent of Cambodia's coastline in May 2008.The lease, which was handed to Tianjin Wanlong without an open bidding process, provided the company with more than triple the size of any concession allowed under Cambodia's land law and exempted it from any payments for a decade.UDG soon began clearing large swathes of forest from Botum Sakor National Park that was included as part of the land lease and forcing hundreds of families to relocatemany of which have yet to receive compensation they were promised as part of the deal 12 years ago.Meanwhile, much of the Dara Sakor project remains unfinished, and structures that wee builtsuch as the casino and hotelhave been largely left to rot. Few tourists visit the area and not many companies have signed deals to set up a presence in the investment zone.Thorng Chandara, Koh Kong provincial coordinator for local rights group Adhoc, told RFA that the project has affected residents of two of the province's districts, "more than 1,000 families" yet to receive compensation for being uprooted.He said residents were never informed about the development or given the opportunity to discuss how it should proceed.Alejandro Gonzalez-Davidson, the founder of domestic environmental watchdog Mother Nature, welcomed the sanctions, saying Washington had sent Hun Sen a message that there will be more to come if he continues to abuse human rights and destroy Cambodia's natural resourcesand particularly if he allows China to build a military base in the country."If the government allows Chinese military installations, not only will Try Pheap or Kun Kim be targeted, sanctions will affect Hun Sen's family as well," he said."This is a message for Hun Sen to back down."Rampant timber trafficking in Cambodia led the Treasury Department to sanction Try Pheap, a business tycoon with close ties to Hun Sen, and 11 of his registered entities at the same time as Kun Kim. Treasury cited his establishment of "a large-scale illegal logging consortium that relies on the collusion of Cambodian officials, to include purchasing protection from the government, including military protection, for the movement of his illegal products."The possibility that China could establish a military foothold in Cambodia has long worried Washington. Vice President Mike Pence in 2018 wrote a letter to Hun Sen expressing fears that Cambodia might be planning to host Chinese military equipment at the Ream Naval Base in the coastal city of Sihanoukville, but Hun Sen dismissed the concerns.Ream base was at the center of controversy last year after The Wall Street Journal in July cited U.S. and allied officials as confirming a secret deal to allow the Chinese to use part of the base for 30 yearswith automatic renewals every 10 years after thatand to post military personnel, store weapons and berth warships.The reported deal, which would provide China with its first naval staging facility in Southeast Asia and allow it to significantly expand patrols on the South China Sea, was vehemently denied at the time by Hun Sen, who said permitting foreign use of a military base in the country would "be in full contradiction to Cambodia's constitution."Beijing decries ' unwarranted allegations'On Wednesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters at a regular press briefing in Beijing that the Chinese government requires overseas Chinese companies to abide by local laws and regulations and stressed that bilateral cooperation between China and Cambodia is "open, transparent, mutually beneficial and equal."Wang said the U.S. "has repeatedly used unwarranted allegations that China's relevant projects in other countries could be transformed into military bases to discredit and attack our normal cooperation with relevant countries.""However, the United States itself has hundreds of military bases in more than 150 countries around the world," he said, calling Washington's approach "hypocritical."Wang alleged that Washington has been "violating international law ... to illegally impose sanctions on Chinese companies" in order to "contain and suppress China" and vowed that Beijing will "take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of its own enterprises."The Chinese Embassy in Phnom Penh issued a statement on its Facebook page Wednesday claiming that the Trump administration had "exaggerated the truth" in order to sanction UDG, calling the action a violation of Cambodian sovereignty and demanding that Washington reverse course.Reported by RFA's Khmer Service.

Commentary: 'Mulan,' Disney and the Dilemma of Doing Business in ChinaUSNEWS.comOctober 6, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Best Countries; Vol.; No.Length: 1075 wordsByline: David JacobsonHighlight: The release of the Disney film shows the challenge international companies have balancing Beijing's demands with preserving reputations at home.BodyDisney's "Mulan" was intended to be a big hit globally, particularly in mainland China, but the film's troubles, and by extension Disney's, would begin long before the film was ever released. One of the first incidents was when lead actor Liu Yifei voiced support on social media for the Hong Kong police during the city's pro-democracy protests. Then came numerous release delays and eventually a straight-to-streaming release in the United States due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The latest incident was the revelation, in the film's credits, that parts of the film were shot in Xinjiang, a province in China that has become notorious for being the region where Uighur Muslims -- a Turkic-speaking ethnic minority -- live under a brutal system of oppression and human rights abuses. In the credits the makers of the film also thank governmental bodies, including a police bureau that is on a U.S. government blacklist of Chinese organizations that American companies are not supposed to do business with. This led to the #BoycottMulan hashtag on social media with activists calling for a boycott of the film. The cumulative result of all this is that "Mulan" has become a major box office disappointment in China. At the core of the "Mulan" controversy is a larger, more generalized dilemma that Disney is now faced with, one that many other companies that also do business in China similarly face: trying to balance significant business interests in the world's second-largest economy with corporate image and reputational risk both at home and abroad (i.e. non-Chinese countries). Reputational risk -- or the potential losses a company can incur due to damage to its reputation -- is nothing new. Some of the factors that companies now face in today's business world, however, are in fact somewhat new. For instance, cancel culture is a relatively new phenomenon that companies now have to consider as part of their risk management. The other more recent development is how increasingly complex the political, ethical, and financial realities of doing business in China have become, to the point where it's virtually impossible to cleanly navigate these complex realities. Observing how Disney chooses to move forward with this issue will be an important case study in how one of the biggest companies in the U.S. handles what will become an increasingly common problem for American companies. Let's start with why China represents such an important market for Disney and Hollywood in general. While it is overly simplistic to say that streaming has hurt Hollywood as a whole, it has certainly cut into cinema attendance, and there is no question that COVID-19 has been disastrous for movie theaters. As a result, studios are relying more than ever on international box office revenue, particularly in China, which represents a massive market. China, however, isn't about to provide open access to that market without demanding a few things in return. For one, the Communist Party expects loyalty, overt or implicit, for businesses such as Disney that have entrenched interests there. This puts Disney in the hot seat because U.S. lawmakers are watching the company's response to the "Mulan" controversy, and for Disney there may be real consequences if they don't respond in a way that's deemed satisfactory. Their copyright for Mickey and Minnie Mouse, for instance, expires in early 2024 and it's likely that Disney is lobbying Congress to pass legislation that will allow them to extend those copyrights. They would thus not want to be in the position of upsetting Congress. Meanwhile, China will also be keeping keen eyes and ears on them. If Beijing does not like what they see or hear, that could have disastrous financial consequences for Disney since they have sizable business interests in China, including the Shanghai Disneyland theme park, digital joint ventures, and future movie releases, making this a much larger issue than about "Mulan" alone. For Disney to maintain business privileges in China they must maintain something called a corporate social credit rating. Corporate social credit is a reputational tracking system that China uses to gauge how well individuals and companies are complying with their demands and expectations. Anything that the Chinese government considers as being disruptive of their social equanimity can result in deductions, and falling too low in credit ranking can result in getting blacklisted from doing business in China. The problem is that what's considered "disruptive" is kept ambiguous and is subject to the Chinese government's whims. For Disney, getting on China's bad side wouldn't just mean losing the privilege of releasing movies there; it could also mean losing what they have already invested and built. Shanghai Disneyland, for example, is a joint venture between Disney and Shendi, a government-owned company. A wrong move by Disney from the Communist Party's point of view could result in a legally sanctioned termination of the joint venture, with Disney forgoing any of its intellectual property in China and the latter inheriting full ownership. Being watched by both the U.S. and Chinese governments, hence, puts Disney between a rock and a hard place. They could publicly denounce China's human rights abuses, which may persuade U.S. lawmakers and the American public that they are serious about not being complicit in China's human rights abuses, but they would risk losing a market that they essentially depend on. Or they could respond in a way that pleases the Chinese government but put their reputation at home at risk. Realistically, they will probably not wish to stop doing business in China altogether, in which case they will have to find a way to not explicitly condone China's policies and practices of oppression and, at the same time, not lose their corporate social credit rating. This is a tall order, to say the least. What they will need to do is conduct contingency planning for "black swan" events -- unpredictable or unforeseen episodes that typically have extreme consequences. Those plans will need to envision worst-case scenarios with respect to both China and the U.S., and companies will need to decide what they are willing to risk, and then plan and act accordingly. They should not wait too long to do this. The world is watching.David Jacobson, J.D., teaches global business strategy to MBAs and online MBAs in the Cox School of Business at SMU. Graphic Picture, People wait beside a poster for the Disney movie "Mulan" at a bus stop on the day the movie opened in Beijing on Sept. 11, 2020., (GREG BAKER/AFP via Getty Images)Load-Date: October 7, 2020End of Document

Uighur Couple, Official's Article Confirm China's Ban on Islamic Marriage VowASEAN TribuneOctober 1, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 ASEAN Tribune All Rights ReservedLength: 1013 wordsBody 1 October 2020 (VOA) While more findings are surfacing about the destruction of mosques and shrines in the Xinjiang Muslim region of China, some Uighurs tell VOA that Chinese authorities have banned the Islamic marriage vow known as nikah in wedding ceremonies, a claim corroborated by an article previously written by a Chinese official.A Uighur couple in their late 20s, who spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, had to omit nikah during their wedding ceremony after lawfully registering and obtaining a marriage certificate issued by the local government in China's northwest region of Xinjiang last fall.Nikah is a formal Islamic marriage vow. It is considered integral to a religiously valid Islamic marriage and outlines the rights and responsibilities of the groom and the bride. Verses from the Quran are read, and a religious scholar must be involved. The majority of Uighurs follow the Sunni denomination of Islam, and Islamic religious elements such as nikah play a significant role in their traditional marriage.'Even though we are granted religious freedom on paper [in the Chinese constitution], we were already fully aware that attempting to have the ritual would put us on the list [for detention],' the couple told VOA.'Having that [nikah vow] in weddings nowadays here [in Xinjiang] equals to being a religious extremist, which would land anyone involved in the ritual in reeducation or even a long prison sentence,' they said.Official affirmationIn an article posted in 2018 on the Chinese social media platform WeChat, Behtiyar Ablimit, a committee member of the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Poskam county in southern Xinjiang, attested to the government's proscription of nikah, while contradicting Chinese official statements, which often emphasize that the religious rights of Uighurs are 'fully respected' in Xinjiang.The article details the return of 'four activities' to the secular world.The 'four activities' referred to are wedding, funeral, naming and circumcision ceremonies.'With the return of the 'four activities' to the secular world, not only [Chinese Communist] Party members and public officials but also a lot of masses spontaneously reject the interference of religion on the 'four activities,' and they do not invite religious figures to their weddings, funerals, naming and circumcision ceremonies,' the article said.According to Tim Grose, a professor of China studies at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Indiana, the CCP has been restricting the religious elements of Uighur traditional ceremonies since the 2010s.'By monitoring and eliminating the religious elements of these rituals, the CCP can take another step in their efforts to secularize and therefore Sinicize the Uighurs,' Grose said, adding that the 'four activities' provided Uighurs an opportunity to express their distinct ethno-religious identity.Nury Turkel, a commissioner on the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), told VOA his organization was deeply concerned about the Chinese government's ban on traditional Uighur marriage ceremonies.'As USCIRF noted in its 2020 annual report, these restrictions are part of the government's campaign to forcibly assimilate Uighur Muslims into Han Chinese culture,' Turkel said, adding that USCIRF monitors such violations of religious freedom and informs the U.S. president, Congress and the rest of the U.S. government through its reporting.Destruction of religious sitesThe Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) last week released a report about the destruction of mosques and Islamic sites in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR).The report, which used satellite imagery, estimated that approximately 16,000 mosques in Xinjiang (65% of the total) have been destroyed or damaged as a result of Chinese government policies.'An estimated 8,500 have been demolished outright, and for the most part, the land on which those razed mosques once sat remains vacant. A further 30% of important Islamic sacred sites (shrines, cemeteries and pilgrimage routes, including many protected under Chinese law) have been demolished across Xinjiang, mostly since 2017, and an additional 28% have been damaged or altered in some way,' the report said.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin called the ASPI's report 'nothing but slanderous rumors' against China, adding that 'such a shoddy report has no credibility at all.'Rian Thum, a historian of Islam in China at the University of Nottingham, told VOA that the CCP sees threats to its control through racist and Islamophobic lenses.'Expressions of distinctive culture are treated as a threat, even more so when that culture is connected to Islam,' Thum said.Defending policies in XinjiangWhen faced with international backlash over the persecution of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang in recent years, including the detention of nearly 1.8 million in internment camps, Chinese authorities reject the accusations, saying it is running a "transformation-through-education centers" campaign in Xinjiang where it faces 'threat' from extremism and terrorism.Last week, Chinese President Xi Jinping said his government's policy in Xinjiang has achieved great results, while hailing the CCP's 'unprecedented achievements' since 2014.'Practice has proved that the party's strategy of governing Xinjiang in the new era is completely correct and must be adhered to for a long time,' Xi said during a high-level CCP meeting on Xinjiang policy in Beijing, according to Xinhua, a Chinese state-run news agency.Joanne Smith Finley, an expert on Uighur studies at Newcastle University, said the Chinese state has associated all forms of Uighurs' Islamic practice, however peaceful and ordinary, with religious extremism.'The Chinese state under Xi Jinping has become increasingly Han-majoritarian and Han assimilationist since 2012. It has reconstructed the Uighur body, mind, language, religion and culture as an existential and biological threat to the Chinese nation,' she told VOA.Load-Date: October 2, 2020End of Document

State Department: The Hypocrisy of the PRC's Propaganda SystemTargeted News ServiceSeptember 11, 2020 Friday 7:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1174 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Department of State issued the following news release on Sept. 9:The Chinese Communist Party's main propaganda newspaper, the People's Daily, refused to run an Op-ed written by our Ambassador in Beijing, Terry Branstad, citing a litany of grievances. Ironically, the Op-ed called for more positive relations between our two countries and asked to "build relationships through unrestricted engagement and uncensored discussion." The People's Daily's response once again exposes the Chinese Communist Party's fear of free speech and serious intellectual debate - as well as Beijing's hypocrisy when it complains about lack of fair and reciprocal treatment in other countries.In contrast, in our vibrant and confident democracy, Chinese government officials have enjoyed the ability to talk directly to the American people and provided its government's views through our free media. China's Ambassador to the U.S. Cui Tiankai alone has published five Op-eds this year in prominent U.S. news outlets such as the Washington Post and Politico, and given exclusive interviews to the likes of CNN and CBS. China's Foreign Ministry and state-owned propaganda organs like the Global Times and China Daily regularly use free access to American social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook to attack our policies, our way of life, and the very system that protects their ability to speak freely. They do this in other democratic countries, too.If Communist China is sincere about becoming a mature power and strengthening relations with the free world, General Secretary Xi Jinping's government would respect the right for Western diplomats to speak directly to the Chinese people, allow foreign journalists back into China, and stop the intimidation and harassment of investigative journalists, foreign and Chinese, who strive to uphold the integrity of the fifth estate to serve the public good. Their refusal to do so shows just how much China's unelected Party elites fear their own people's free-thinking and the free world's judgment about their governance practices inside China.Read the response from the People's Daily here: https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Peoples-Daily-Response-Letter.pdf* * *Resetting the Relationship Based on ReciprocityBy The Honorable Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to ChinaWe have long said we want a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, and that view has not changed. A constructive relationship means that we are honest and candid not only about our shared interests, but also about the issues that divide us. We need not just endless reaffirmations of our respective interests, but concrete outcomes that truly benefit our peoples.From a U.S. perspective, we have made too little progress. For years, the Chinese leadership has urged us to focus on areas of cooperation while setting aside our differences, and for years, the United States had agreed to that approach in the expectation that, over time, we would address our concerns as well. But the Chinese leadership has exploited this approach. Often it has insisted we sweep differences under the table as a prerequisite for engagement. Sometimes it made promises to address our concerns yet failed to follow up. As a result, our relationship has delivered fewer and fewer of the results that matter to the American people.At the same time, the relationship became increasingly imbalanced. An example is unequal access for U.S. companies, journalists, diplomats, and even civil society. As an open society, the United States has welcomed Chinese companies into our markets to sell products to American consumers, to invest and bid on projects, and to raise capital. We have welcomed Chinese students and researchers into our universities and laboratories, where they have acquired knowledge to modernize and develop China's economy. While U.S. journalists face restrictions on reporting and even entering China, Chinese state media workers have long enjoyed open access in the United States. PRC diplomats have open access to American society, while our diplomats in China are required to navigate a state approval system for even the most basic engagements with the Chinese people.The Chinese government, while benefiting from our openness, has exploited it - in a way that is increasingly inconsistent with international norms. Some Chinese entities have purchased American companies not to create jobs, but to acquire technology that is then taken back to China and developed to compete against us. Some Chinese companies have raised money on our stock exchanges yet refused to subject themselves to the standard auditing rules required by all other listed companies, U.S. or foreign. A small number of Chinese students and researchers use access to our universities, research facilities and companies to steal American intellectual property. These actions have not only harmed our bilateral relations but also tarnished the remarkable legitimate economic progress that the Chinese people are rightfully proud of.President Trump came to office vowing to make the overall relationship more balanced and reciprocal. The phase one trade deal and recent U.S. policy actions are an important step in our quest to create a genuine level playing field for American stakeholders. Many claim this is an effort to thwart China's legitimate development aspirations, to "contain" China's rise, or to "decouple" from China. This is categorically false. The root cause of the current tensions in the relationship is China's longstanding strategy of only selectively "coupling" with the United States and systematically controlling the access of Americans to Chinese society. At our universities, we continue to welcome the vast majority of Chinese students, but we have taken action to deny visas to those who illegally acquire U.S. intellectual property and research results, or who gain knowledge in order to compete unfairly with us in the cutting edge technologies of the 21st century. We have also taken action against Chinese companies, including well known ones like Huawei, that have stolen U.S. intellectual property, circumvented U.S. export controls, or posed a threat to the security of our citizens' private data and our communication networks.We are two different nations with different pasts. The United States continues to learn from its mistakes and push forward to forge a better future. We hope that China can do the same. In this endeavor, we will need to build a foundation for understanding and true reciprocity. It must start with the Chinese government being willing to address our concerns about the imbalance in the relationship and allowing our two peoples to build relationships through unrestricted engagement and uncensored discussion. Only then will I enjoy the freedoms to engage the Chinese people that we guarantee Ambassador Cui in the United States, and only then will we have genuine reciprocity and a genuinely balanced relationship.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7229857 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: September 11, 2020End of Document

Sen. Warner: U.S. companies, allies must be engaged in far-reaching strategy to counter China challengeInside Cyber SecuritySeptember 22, 2020Copyright 2020 Inside Washington Publishers All Rights ReservedLength: 1284 wordsBody September 17, 2020 | Charlie Mitchell Facing what he described as an unprecedented economic and security challenge from China, Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) says the U.S. must lead a global effort to instill the values of transparency, interoperability and human rights into the development of technology, including re-engaging in standards-setting bodies, bolstering alternatives to Chinese products, and persuading companies to rethink their involvement in that country.Warner on Wednesday offered his vision of a strategy toward China's Communist government that he contrasted with the "reactionary" approach of the Trump administration.For one thing, he said, "We need to have a real heart-to-heart with American businesses," where there's a "growing recognition" that the price of admission into Chinese markets "may be too high," in ways ranging from government-sanctioned theft of their intellectual property to use of their technologies to stifle dissent and oppress minorities such as the Uyghurs.Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, spoke on a webinar sponsored by the National Democratic Institute, "Democracy, Technology, and China: US Strategy for Innovation in the 21st Century". NDI is chaired by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who introduced Warner.Underscoring the immediacy of the challenge, the Justice Department on Wednesday announced a new round of indictments of hackers allegedly tied to the Chinese government. Further, a new Crowdstrike report identified Chinese hacking efforts aimed at the telecom sector, Cyberscoop reported, while DHS revealed an operation targeting software vulnerabilities in U.S. government networks.Warner criticized what he called a scattered approach by the Trump administration, poorly articulated to allies and the rest of the world. Creating a new "coalition of the willing" to meet the China challenge is going to take a new president, Warner said, after President Trump has demonstrated "a complete inability to lead a global alliance."Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday that U.S. allies are beginning to feel more comfortable standing up to China "so long as America is prepared to do it alongside them," Inside U.S. Trade reported. During an event sponsored by the Atlantic Council, Pompeo was asked about critics of the Trump administration who say it should do more to enlist allies in combating China. "My view is that the tide has turned," he said, suggesting other countries were affected by what he called "the coverup that took place with respect to the Chinese virus" and "predatory activity."But Warner charged that the U.S. has ceded leadership to China in international standards setting bodies and has taken "an erratic, reactionary approach" to Beijing -- and even to allies like Canada -- through tools such as tariffs. The approach is "wearing thin" among U.S. friends throughout the world, Warner charged.In his prepared remarks, Warner said, "Today, we see China flooding ICT standard-setting bodies to set communication protocols and standards for mobile technology equipment. And it's not just telecom: As seen in the CCP's upcoming China Standards 2035 plan, China's leaders aim to influence the whole suite of next generation technologies, including artificial intelligence and facial recognition."Warner said he and others were wrong in assessing the liberalizing impact open trade would have on China and said, "We face a starker reality, a challenge from non-market, state capitalist, authoritarian regimes -- led by China -- that have deftly exploited, and undermined the rules-based international trading system that we had long thought would bring greater openness."On technology, Warner said, "China's Great Firewall has defied all expectations -- effectively stifling dissent and free inquiry at-scaleÉ and facilitating extensive, sophisticated surveillance. The longstanding consensus was that the Chinese people would balk at these limitations and that China's innovation would suffer -- forcing the Chinese government to adopt greater openness, if only out of self-interest. That consensus was clearly wrong."Rather, Warner said, "China has reared a generation of innovative technologies that in many cases have launched new products and services ahead of Western competitors. We need to think about what this means for global standards-setting, and liberal values of openness, transparency, interoperability and respect for human rights."Warner offered a five-part strategy, saying, "So, first: we need to be in this together. The private sector, the U.S. government, and private citizens all need to work together to stand up for human rights, as well the civil rights and civil liberties guaranteed to all Americans under the Constitution."He noted that "for the last two and a half years, I have worked on a bipartisan basis to convene CEOs and university presidents, to share with them classified intelligence briefs on the CCP's strategies and tacticsÉ so that American enterprises can make better-informed, risk-based decisions about collaborating with the PRC and its state-directed companies."Further, he called for "clear prohibitions -- beyond the slow and convoluted export control regime -- on U.S. companies facilitating state-sponsored repressive efforts. U.S. companies and researchers should not be collaborating on biometric profiling, facial-recognition, AI, or other antidemocratic efforts by CCP-affiliated companies and research institutions."Second, Warner said, "we need global allies, especially democratic ones. We can't counter the expansion of Chinese internal governance and international norms on our own.""Whether it's building international norms on cybersecurity at the UN or the Paris CallÉ or establishing sensible rules of the road around social media abuse and exploitation-- the U.S. should prioritize striking common ground with our allies around the world," Warner said.Third, he said, "we need to set up our country to stay competitive in the future. We need to lead with standards based on our values of open competitionÉ privacyÉ freedom of thoughtÉ respect for human rightsÉ and accountability, particularly when it comes to technologies that undergird wider innovation ecosystems."He noted, "It's not just about keeping Huawei out of our networks. If Huawei's market share continues to grow, it will jeopardize the stability of Western alternatives that remain. We've been told that if Huawei is able to gain 50% global market share, it will send Ericsson or Nokia -- and potentially in the longer term, both -- into a tailspin. Imagine the resulting vulnerabilities for our entire economy, sectors like agriculture and medicine, and our military."Warner said, "I've led efforts in Congress, introducing a bipartisan 5G bill, the USA Telecom Act, devoting over $1 billion to what we can do to change the terms of competition in order to encourage innovation and challenge Huawei's advance. It would set up a Multilateral Telecommunications Security FundÉ laying the groundwork for an international consortium with our closest allies and trading partners to develop competitively priced, secure equipment. Our approach plays to U.S. strengths like software and network virtualization. And it would mean we have a wider set of firms -- including American firms -- competing against Huawei."Fourth, he said, "we need a vision of technology that reflects our values and evaluates technology in a risk-based way."And fifth, "rather than evaluating technology only in terms of global risk, we need policies that put human rights and individual dignity at the forefront of our approach." -- Charlie Mitchell (cmitchell@iwpnews.com)Load-Date: September 23, 2020End of Document

PHILIPPINE COMMUNIST LEADERSHIP ORDERS GUERRILLAS TO GO AFTER CHINESE FIRMSStates News ServiceOctober 14, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1083 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:The outlawed Philippine communist party directed its armed wing on Wednesday to target Chinese companies involved in infrastructure projects, including state-backed firms that the United States has blacklisted for their part in Beijing's militarization in the South China Sea.The communists announced the move six weeks after the Philippine government their enemy for the past half-century declared that it would not follow Washington's lead by cutting ties with firms involved in China's building of artificial islands and military installations in the disputed waterway. At least one of those 24 firms sanctioned by the U.S. is involved in Philippine infrastructure projects.In a statement issued Wednesday, the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) did not name the Chinese firms, but said they were involved in the construction of Chinese installations and "in the plunder and destruction of Philippine marine resources in the West Philippine Sea, in violation of Philippine sovereignty."The West Philippine Sea is how Filipinos refer to the South China Sea. Both the Philippines and China have contending claims in the waterway."Some of these same Chinese companies are involved in some big-ticket infrastructure projects for the construction of mining roads and dams that are encroaching deeper and deeper into the ancestral lands of the national minorities and forests in various parts of the country," the CPP said."These infrastructure projects not only displace thousands of peasants and minorities from their lands, they also wreak havoc [on] the natural ecosystem of the country's remaining forests," it added.Asked if this meant that Chinese firms would be targeted by the CPP's New People's Army (NPA) guerrillas, group spokesman Marco Valbuena, said: "They and their armed ... securities are targets.""How? it depends on the assessment of local NPA commands, how best to frustrate their plans and their plunderous [sic] operations typically accompanied with militarization of lumad [the indigenous peoples of Mindanao] communities," he told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.The NPA, whose force today comprises some 5,000 fighters scattered in different parts of the Philippine archipelago, have been waging Asia's longest-running rebellion since 1969. Their ideology was originally inspired by the founding father of the People's Republic of China.To this day Mao caps, with a red star emblazoned on the front against a field of green, are popular among them. In the 1970s, when the Cold War was still raging, China was known to supply the Philippine communists with weapons in their fight against the U.S.-backed Marcos administration. But the CPP has long since repudiated links with Chinese communist doctrine in favor of their own ideological brand.Valbuena said that the Philippine communist leadership hoped to "put a spotlight" on what he described as widespread destruction wrought by Chinese firms on the country's environment.CPP founder Jose Maria Sison, who lives in exile in the Netherlands, warned that these Chinese firms were "vulnerable to guerrilla operations."The main message of the CPP was to order the NPA to "mount more tactical offensives nationwide," Sison told BenarNews by phone on Wednesday.In its statement, the CPP said it was ordering all of its guerrilla units to "mount more frequent tactical offensives" against the government and the Chinese firms."Use all possible types of weapons from rifles and command-detonated explosives, to spears and punji sticks against the enemy," the CPP said.When Benar News contacted them, officials with the Philippine military declined to comment on the CPP's announcement. Meanwhile, representatives of the Chinese Embassy in Manila were not immediately available for comment.Manila: 'We will pursue our national interest'In early September, the Duterte administration defiantly said that it would not severe links with Chinese firms, which have invested billions of dollars in big-ticket projects in the Philippines.In July, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared that Beijing's claims to nearly all of the South China Sea on the basis of "historic rights" were unlawful. In late August, the United States announced that it was blacklisting two dozen Chinese companies as well as individuals for their involvement in reclamation activities in the sea.On Sept. 1, Philippine presidential spokesman. Harry Roque said the government would keep working with Chinese firms because it was in the "national interest" to complete flagship infrastructure projects in the country."I will be categorical. [The] Sangley project will continue [and] all other projects involving Chinese companies that are banned in the U.S. can continue in the Philippines," Roque said. "We are not a vassal state of any foreign power and we will pursue our national interest."One of the firms sanctioned by Washington, the state-controlled China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), has landed a U.S. $10 billion deal to construct an international airport at Sangley Point, just south of Manila.CCCC has also secured approval for five other local infrastructure projects in Davao, Cebu, and the former Clark U.S. Air Force Base north of Manila. A third firm, China Energy Engineering Corp., is involved in a multi-million dam project up north.Lately, nationalist groups have also expressed concern about another Chinese firm, China Telecom, which is part of a consortium called Dito Telecommunity Corp. The government has green-lighted it to build telecommunications towers and systems at Philippine military camps.Apart from the Philippines, five other Asian governments Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam have territorial claims or maritime boundaries in the South China Sea that overlap with China. While Indonesia does not regard itself as a party to the South China Sea dispute, Beijing claims historic rights to parts of that sea overlapping Indonesia's exclusive economic zone.President Rodrigo Duterte, a self-styled leftist, was once a college student of CPP founder Sison, and there had been high hopes initially that a peace deal with the communists would finally be signed after Duterte took power in mid-2016. But the president broke off preliminary talks in 2017 after accusing the New People's Army of continuing to carry out attacks against the military and police.Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Load-Date: October 15, 2020End of Document

US Ambassador to China Terry Branstad stepping down following Trump campaign askCNN.comSeptember 14, 2020 Monday GENERAL_EDIT_CORRECTION ERROR Document ID 0 Has error Validate old format failed - Input Date Invalid - 0057: Unparseable date: "0057"ESTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 1241 wordsByline: By David Culver, Ben Westcott, Kylie Atwood and Kaitlan Collins, CNNBodyUS ambassador to China Terry Branstad is leaving his post before the November election in part because President Donald Trump urged the former governor of Iowa to come back and help him campaign, multiple sources told CNN Monday.Because Branstad always intended to serve only one term, his departure was expected, according to multiple administration officials and people familiar with his thinking. But as of a few weeks ago, Branstad was planning to remain in Beijing until after the election, according to two sources familiar. That changed when Trump asked Branstad to come back to the US and campaign for him after more than three years in Beijing."That is why he is ending it early -- because the President asked," said a source familiar with the request.The news comes amid increasing tensions between the US and China on several fronts. The Chinese government announced on Friday it would be imposing unspecified restrictions on senior US diplomats and personnel inside China after Washington put in place a similar measure targeting Beijing's diplomatic corps on September 3.Branstad has been friends with Chinese President Xi Jinping since the 1980s, though his role as ambassador became increasingly fraught in recent months as the US-China relationship frayed amid the coronavirus pandemic. Branstad was ultimately never able to leverage the personal relationship to benefit the bilateral relations.Trump referenced the outgoing ambassador and his son Eric Branstad -- who is a senior adviser to Trump Victory 2020, the joint fundraising committee between the campaign and the Republican National Committee -- during a phone call with Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst."Eric Branstad's fantastic and you know, Eric's father is coming home from China because he wants to campaign," Trump said on the call, which Ernst tweeted in a video on Saturday.'He still plays well in the Midwest'A source familiar with the move says Trump wanted him back in the US to help campaign in Iowa. Branstad had told the President in recent months as they discussed his departure that he wanted to stay on in his role through the agricultural purchases that happened over the summer.The Trump campaign believes that Branstad could have an impact on voters in Iowa, Wisconsin, Missouri and even Minnesota, according to two sources familiar."He still plays well in the Midwest. He has high name ID and is probably the best person to talk about the China influence," said a source close to the Trump campaign.Biden and Trump remain in a very tight race in Iowa, according to polls over the last few months. Trump won the state by about 10% in 2016.It is unclear if someone told Trump that it would be a good idea for Branstad to come back and campaign or if the President came up with the idea on his own.Experts say that the repercussions are not expected to be major, given that Branstad was not a central player in the US-China policy space. While Branstad is not a leading voice in the Trump administration's tough on China approach, he is expected to assume a "more forward leaning approach" when he hits the campaign trail, said the source close to the campaign.In a Twitter post early Monday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo thanked Branstad for his service to the American people as the US Ambassador."President (Donald Trump) chose Ambassador Branstad because his decades-long experience dealing with China made him the best person to represent the Administration and to defend American interests and ideals in this important relationship," Pompeo said.Pompeo didn't give a reason for Branstad's departure, or any announcement about a potential successor to the important diplomatic post.One of Trump's first ambassadorial picksBranstad was one of then-President-elect Trump's first ambassadorial picks in December 2016, shortly after Trump won the US Presidential election.Trump said at the time that the then-Iowa governor was picked for his experience in public policy, trade and agriculture, as well as his "long-time relationship" with Xi, whom Branstad had known since 1985 through US-China government exchanges.During that period, the two were believed to have maintained a friendship of sorts, with Xi meeting again with Branstad during a visit to the US in 2012 while still vice-president.Originally Branstad's appointment was welcomed by Beijing, with Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang lauding him as an "old friend of the Chinese people."But Branstad has overseen one of the rockiest periods of US-China relations in recent history. Since his appointment, the Trump administration has placed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese goods as part of a long-running trade war. It has also banned Chinese technology firms such as Huawei from the country's communications infrastructure and receiving US components, and tightened visa restrictions on Chinese state media journalists working in the US.On September 9, an opinion piece written by Branstad, in which he accused the Chinese government of "exploiting" US openness in recent decades, was rejected for publication by Communist Party mouthpiece People's Daily for being "seriously inconsistent with facts.""If you do wish to publish this op-ed in the People's Daily, you should make substantive revisions based on facts in the principle of equality and mutual respect," the state media publication said in its rejection letter.In response, Secretary of State Pompeo accused People's Daily of "hypocrisy," saying that if the Chinese government was a mature power, it would "respect the right for Western diplomats to speak directly to the Chinese people."Branstad, who has been largely out of the limelight despite being America's top diplomat in Beijing during one of the most contentious moments in US-China history, has been viewed as loyal to Trump throughout his tenure. Those who know Branstad believe that he will do what the Trump campaign asks."He is a good soldier, especially if he is coming back to potentially play a role in a second Trump admin. He will talk about how taking on China was needed to save the farmers," said Stephen Orlins, the president of the National Committee on US-China relations. "His message will be consistent with what the campaign asks him."Working-level State Department officials who focus on Asia were not aware of plans by the Trump administration to nominate a new ambassador between now and election day, but they were also largely surprised by Branstad's departure at this moment in time, said two State Department officials.In recent months, Branstad has assumed an even quieter role as in Beijing as tensions between the two countries have heated up. In one instance, he canceled an off-the-record Zoom appearance with Americans engaged in US-China relations in June, which was planned to take place just a week after the US shut down the Chinese consulate in Houston, according to a source familiar with the event."The unfortunate reality is that Branstad was never a key channel for communicating or negotiating with Beijing. While the symbol of the US ambassador is significant, in this instance he just did not play that role," explained Evan Medeiros, a former National Security Council Asia director during the Obama administration. "China policy was being run by Pompeo. Washington did not use Branstad like ambassadors are traditionally used."This story has been updated with additional developments Monday.Load-Date: September 15, 2020End of Document

China's chilling response to former UQ student's arrestStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeSeptember 3, 2020 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: CULTURE; Pg. 1Length: 662 wordsByline: Julia GonzalesBodyAustralia had been informed by Chinese authorities on August 14 of her detention, but made its first public statement on Monday.An Australian citizen who worked as an anchor for China's state-backed CGTN news network has been detained without explanation.The Chinese foreign ministry has not yet divulged any details surrounding the disappearance of a foreign journalist,Cheng Lei."As Australia is a close ally of the USA, certain Australian people and forces seem to be "infected" with paranoia, dominated by China-phobia and conjectures, to the extent of losing all sense of rationality and justice that they make various accusations against normal educational and people-to-people exchange between China and Australia", she said.Australian officials experienced a consular take a look at through video clip website link withCheng Lei at a detention facility last Thursday, International MinisterMarise Payne explained in a assertion Monday.Richard McGregor, a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney who studies Chinese politics and foreign policy, said it was unclear whether Ms. Cheng's nationality was a factor in her detention."In China, due process will be observed", the family said."She certainly knows her boundaries very well, extremely well, and she's never really crossed those boundaries as far as I can see", she said.In the months since Australia pushed for an worldwide inquiry into China's handling of Covid-19, China has increased tariffs on Australian barley, citing dumping, and banned imports from some abattoirs over alleged compliance issues.The Australian government refused to speculate about why Cheng was detained, citing "privacy obligations", but Australia's diplomatic relations with China have deteriorated steadily since the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak. China in recent months has placed tariffs on Australian barley, banned some meat products and launched an anti-dumping probe on its wine exports.Large antibody study offers hope for virus vaccine effortsThis means self-isolating for 10 days and 72 hours after symptoms and fever subside, or until they receive a negative result. The news that natural antibodies don't quickly disappear "will be encouraging for people working on vaccines", Angus said."The Chinese Community Party in this is trying to create a pressure point with Australia". "I felt my skills could be better used in China", she had once said.Trade Minister Simon Bermingham on Tuesday called on the Chinese Government to agree to ministerial level conversations.Cheng was an organisation anchor on CGTN, the worldwide arm of China's state-owned broadcaster CCTV, which has actually considering that scrubbed all referral to her from its site and social networks.In a statement, her family said they are in "close consultation" with the Australian government and are doing everything possible to support Cheng during the hard times.Tensions continue to grow between Australia and its biggest trading partner with China boldly declaring there will only be one victor. Her detention comes more than a year after former Chinese diplomat turned Australian academic Dr Yang Hengjun was arrested and charged with espionage."[We are] doing everything we can as a family to supportCheng Lei", the statement said.She moved to China to work as a business analyst with a Sino-Australian joint venture in 2001, and was well-known within expat and business circles in Beijing.She has reported major Chinese events including Beijing's 2008 Olympics and Shanghai's 2010 World Expo. Australia has also criticized China for charging Chinese-Australian spy novelistYang Hengjun with espionage in March after he was detained since January a year ago.In June of this year, after being detained for seven years, Australian citizen Karm Gilespie was sentenced to death for transnational drug trafficking charges.Cheng Lei described herself on her Twitter account as a "passionate Chinese storyteller and host of CGTN financial programs".Load-Date: September 3, 2020End of Document

Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China, to leave next monthAssociated Press InternationalSeptember 15, 2020 Tuesday 1:02 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWS; POLITICAL NEWS; STATE AND REGIONALLength: 664 wordsByline: KEN MORITSUGU, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) — The U.S. ambassador to China will step down early next month, ending a three-year tenure marked by a trade war and increasingly bitter relations between the world's two largest economies.Terry Branstad, appointed by President Donald Trump in 2017, confirmed his decision in a phone call with Trump last week, the U.S. Embassy said in a statement Monday. It did not give a reason for his departure.“I am proudest of our work in getting the phase one trade deal and delivering tangible results for our communities back home," he was quoted as saying at an embassy staff meeting on Monday.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in an interview late Monday thanked Branstad for his service.“Over the past years, he’s done yeoman’s work helping us deliver on something that’s a complete change from what any administration has done with respect to the Chinese Communist Party,” Pompeo told Fox News.Word of Branstad's departure had leaked out earlier in the day when Pompeo thanked Branstad on Twitter for his service.“Ambassador Branstad has contributed to rebalancing U.S.-China relations so that it is results-oriented, reciprocal, and fair,” Pompeo wrote in a subsequent tweet.Branstad became embroiled in a recent controversy when China’s official People’s Daily newspaper rejected an opinion column that he had written.Pompeo tweeted last week that China's ruling Communist Party refused to run Branstad's op-ed while the Chinese ambassador to the United States “is free to publish in any U.S. media outlet.”Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian responded that Branstad's article was “full of loopholes, seriously inconsistent with facts and wantonly attacks and smears China.”The U.S. Embassy had contacted the People's Daily on Aug. 26 about the piece, asking that it be printed in full without any edits before Sept. 4, the People's Daily said in a statement posted online.Pompeo in the Fox News interview said the departure was not related to the op-ed and speculated the ambassador wanted to return to Iowa, his home state.Branstad, 73, was governor of the major farming state for 22 years over two spans, from 1983 to 1999 and 2011 to 2017.Early in his first gubernatorial term, he met Xi Jinping, now China's leader, when the then county-level Communist Party official visited Iowa on a 1985 trade trip.Trump appointed him ambassador after a vacancy of several months, during which the embassy's No. 2 official, David Rank, resigned after criticizing the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord.Soon after arriving in Beijing in June 2017, Branstad welcomed American beef back to the Chinese market after a 14-year ban, saying “I know it is a key priority of the president to reduce the trade deficit, and this is one of the ways we can do it.”But trade relations quickly soured, as the U.S. imposed tariffs on Chinese products and China retaliated in kind. Other disputes followed over technology, human rights and the response to the coronavirus pandemic.Branstad joined U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at trade talks with Chinese counterparts in Beijing in May 2019.The phase one deal reached the following January represented a truce but did not address the more fundamental complaints of the American side.The U.S. Embassy statement also noted Branstad's role in the effort to reduce the flow of fentanyl from China to the United States, including a 2018 pact in which China agreed to list the opioid as a controlled substance.Branstad also made a rare visit to Tibet in May 2019, where he expressed concerns about what the U.S. called Chinese government interference in the freedom of Tibetan Buddhists to organize and practice their religion.“He encouraged the Chinese government to engage in substantive dialogue with the Dalai Lama or his representatives, without preconditions, to seek a settlement that resolves differences,” an embassy statement at the time said.Load-Date: September 14, 2020End of Document

8 in alleged Chinese surveillance action in USCE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 28, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 420 wordsBodyWASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department has accused eight people of working on behalf of the Chinese government in a pressure campaign to coerce a man in New Jersey wanted by Beijing to return and face charges in China, authorities said.Five of the eight people were arrested Wednesday, accused of participating in a covert operation that, according to US authorities, relied on "very disturbing" intimidation, harassment and tactics to pressure Beijing's targets. The other three are believed to be in China.The defendants face charges of participating in a Chinese government operation known as "Fox Hunt" clearly created to help Beijing locate fugitives abroad for legitimate purposes, but which U.S. officials claim is used to pursue dissidents and political opponents."Without coordination with our government, China's repatriation squads enter the United States, monitor and place suspected fugitives, and resort to intimidation and other tactics to force them to return to China, where they would face some imprisonment or worse after legitimate trials," Justice Undersecretary John Demers said at a press conference at which he announced the charges.In this case, prosecutors said, defendants harassed the family of the man they did not identify and who was an official in a city in China before his arrival in 2010 in the United States. Authorities did not disclose why the man or his family were the target, but authorities said the campaign to bring him back to China included online surveillance and harassment against the man's adult daughter, as well as a threatening note left at the affected person's front door.The note, written in simplified Chinese characters, read: "If you are willing to return to mainland China and spend 10 years in prison, your wife and children will be fine. That's where this thing ends!"The Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond for the time being an email requesting statements on the matter.The arrests are contained in a series of recent actions that President Donald Trump's administration has taken against China, a country that the representative considers a major adversary.In July, for example, the Department of Justice accused hackers in the service of the Chinese government of attacking signatures that develop coronavirus vaccines and stealing hundreds of millions of dollars in intellectual property and business secrets from companies around the world."China is breaking laws and rules right-handed and sinister," FBI Director Chris Wray said Wednesday.Load-Date: October 29, 2020End of Document

HOOVER COPRESENTS CONFERENCE ON HOW CHINA USES TECHNOLOGY TO SUPPORT AUTHORITARIAN AMBITIONSStates News ServiceOctober 27, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1764 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: STANFORD, Calif. BodyThe following information was released by the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace:The Hoover Institution's project on China's Global Sharp Power, chaired by Senior Fellow Larry Diamond and managed by Research Fellow Glenn Tiffert, cohosted a virtual conference about how the People's Republic of China's advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are used to repress its population and support authoritarian modes of governance across the world.The four-day program, The Rise of Digital Authoritarianism: China, AI, and Human Rights, was hosted in partnership with the Digital Policy Incubator at the Freeman Spogli Institute, Stanford's Center for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI), and the Human Rights Foundation.Keynote remarks were given by Condoleezza Rice, Hoover Institution director; Eric Schmidt, former Google chairman and CEO; Michael Brown, director of the Defense Innovation Unit at the US Department of Defense; Audrey Tang, Taiwan's digital minister; and Fei-Fei Li, co-director of HAI.Condoleezza Rice Says AI Allows China to "Dream Big"In opening remarks at the conference on September 29, Condoleezza Rice argued that for authoritarian regimes like the Chinese Communist Party, the unrestrained application of AI and other emerging technologies has allowed them to "dream big." She maintained that Beijing has not only created an Orwellian state apparatus that has imposed mass surveillance on its citizens and ethnic minorities, but has also enabled the People's Liberation Army to strengthen its forces, as evident in its assertiveness in the South China Sea and the Strait of Taiwan.Rice cautioned against US leaders embracing technological innovation in order to capably compete with Beijing and abandoning institutional constraints that account for ethics, individual liberty, and concerns over personal privacy."We need to have a concerted effort on behalf of free peoples to make sure that the digital authoritarians don't win," Rice said. "They can't win the race for this technology, because whoever wins this race is going to have a leg up on shaping the international system."China's Use of Technology Is Not Just Authoritarian, It Is TotalitarianRice's remarks were followed by a panel discussion featuring Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian, China reporter for Axios; Paul Mozur, Asia technology correspondent for the New York Times; Glenn Tiffert, Hoover Institution research fellow; and Xiao Qiang, editor-in-chief of the China Digital Times.The participants explained how China deploys AI, machine learning, and facial recognition technology for large-scale analysis of data for mass surveillance and the implementation of a national social credit score system. They noted that the data to support these systems is aggregated from security cameras, internet and mobile phone activity, financial transactions, informants, and other sources.The panel also detailed the Chinese government's Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP), a software application that centralizes data about individual behavior and has been used to aid police in the arrest, repression, and incarceration of segments of the Uighur Muslim population in the Xinjiang autonomous region. They concluded that while IJOP and other methods of surveillance are imperfect and frequently crude in their implementation, they fulfill the party's aspirations for totalitarian rule by coercing ethnic minorities and other citizens into compliance.A Rivalry Partnership?On the second day of the virtual conference, October 1, Eric Schmidt told Eileen Donahoe, director of the Digital Policy Incubator, that US leaders should use a "scalpel" instead of a "sledgehammer" when developing and executing policies aimed at preventing China from overtaking US technological supremacy.Schmidt explained that while the US is superior to China in AI technology, this lead will diminish within two years. He cautioned against drastic decoupling of supply chains, export controls on semiconductors (an industry in which the US remains dominant), and excessive restrictions against US-Chinese research collaborations and Chinese students who want to study at American universities. He maintained, however, that US policy makers should remain vigilant against Chinese espionage activities and effectively enforce rules and regulations.Schmidt added that American innovation should be imbued with democratic values in cooperation with Chinese counterpartsa strategy he called a "rivalry partnership." This collaboration, Schmidt believes, would enable the United States to mitigate China's efforts in replicating American technology as well as curtail Beijing's ambitions to expand its global market share in 5G telecommunications platforms.Risking a SplinternetThe second day of programming also included a discussion about the ethics of doing business in China featuring Mary Hui, Hong Kongbased technology and business reporter of Quartz; Megha Rajagopolan, international correspondent of BuzzFeed News; and Alex Stamos, director of Stanford's Internet Observatory.The three explained how China has become globally dominant in software industries and a central node in key supply chains that are extremely difficult to shift to other countries or dismantle entirely without causing major global economic disruption.The participants also raised concerns over a splintering of global internet governance, especially in light of the Trump administration's recent attempts to ban the Chinese social media app TikTok. They explained that such use of presidential power may lead China to retaliate by expropriating US companies. The panel instead advocated for a US-led mode of internet governance that enforces human rights standards and secures privacy protections for users.Increasing Government Supported RandD Is Critical for US SecurityThe third day of the conference, October 6, featured a keynote discussion by Michael Brown, director of the Defense Innovation Unit at the US Department of Defense.Brown argued that in order for the United States to maintain its technological competitiveness with China, the federal government must increase funding for research and development in emerging technologies from the current 0.7 percent to 2 percent of GDP, a level not reached since the 1970s. Brown explained that government support is critical, because it provides industry with the proper incentives to focus on long-term national priorities reminiscent of the Manhattan Project, the space program, and the production of advanced weaponry during the Cold War rivalry with the Soviet Union.Brown also maintained that India is an important strategic ally for the United States, contending that the South Asian country's democratic principles, its younger demographics, and the value it places on education sets it on a path to surpass China technologically in less than a decade.A Competition of Value Systems, Not SuperpowersBrown's presentation was followed by a conversation about the geopolitical implications of China's emergence as an exporter of AI and mass-surveillance technologies. Discussants included Steven Feldstein, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace; Lindsey Gorman, fellow for emerging technologies at the German Marshall Fund; and Maya Wang, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.The panel agreed that it would be advantageous for American policy makers to respond to this challenge not as a contest between the United States and China but rather as a competition between democratic and authoritarian systems. The participants held that the latter approach would enable the United States to more persuasively attract the cooperation of trade and security partners whose shared devotion to core values of human rights and freedom could surmount the economic benefits of closer ties to Beijing.Taiwan's Response China's Emergence as a Tech LeaderThe final day of the conference, October 9, was opened by Audrey Tang, the digital minister of Taiwan. Tang described the actions Taipei is taking to defend the security of its telecommunications networks from Beijing's aggression. She explained that Beijing's mode of technological governance is a "rule by law" standard based on the dictates, biases, and interests of the Communist Party. She warned that Beijing was attempting to reshape international norms and subvert transparency and the rule of law in democracies across the world by exporting technologies that are capable of being used for mass surveillance and human rights abuses.She also explained that Taiwan was helping to lead a cooperative effort with several other countries to ensure that supply chains of hardware and software are untainted by Beijing's influence and that data privacy is safeguarded against encroachments by Chinese state-controlled technology providers.The Democratic Response to Digital AuthoritarianismThe final panel discussion of the conference covered what democracies can do to curb the expansion of authoritarianism through the application of AI and other emerging technologies.Participants included Christopher Balding, associate professor of Fulbright University, Vietnam; Anja Manuel, cofounder of Rice, Hadley, Gates, and Manuel; and Chris Meserole, deputy director of the Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technologies Initiative at the Brookings Institution.The panelists held that democratic countries should affirm their values by working together on the development of clear and transparent governance over the use of technology; collectively supporting open research while enforcing against such crimes as intellectual property theft; and maintaining an edge over China in the manufacturing of semiconductors.A Multistakeholder Approach to AIFei-Fei Li, the codirector of Stanford HAI concluded the conference by stressing ethical considerations in the development of AI technology.She explained that while AI has many positive applications in industries such as health care, education, and manufacturing, it can also be used for nefarious ends by authoritarian rulers including the promotion of self-serving political narratives and the amplification of racial and cultural biases.Li concluded that design of machines is an extension of the human condition. If a society respects human rights, values diversity in its population, and is committed to protecting the freedoms of all its citizens, then those principles will be embedded in the design and application of machines."In order to build a future in which AI supports democracy, the democracies of today must support AI," Li said.Load-Date: October 30, 2020End of Document

WECHAT OR WE DON'T CHAT? A TOTAL BAN ON WECHAT GOES TOO FARStates News ServiceSeptember 17, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1178 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Cato Institute:By Huan ZhuWeChat is an internet application owned by Chinese tech company Tencent. It may not sound familiar to most Americans, but it is a tool widely used in China and among Chinese communities world" wide. It is a one" stop" shop that combines payment services, social media, messaging platforms, and news outlets. This app is now facing a ban in the United States.Last month , President Trump issued an executive order related to WeChat, under which " any transaction that is related to WeChat by any person, or with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States " would be banned. The rationale was that WeChat " continues to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States ." The order itself lacks details on how exactly a ban would work, and the Department of Commerce is expected to issue implementing rules by September 20. The scope of the regulation could range from banning the app from smartphone app stores, to banning all U.S. firms, even ones located outside of the U.S., from dealing with WeChat. The ban would affect both individual users of the app and businesses who rely on it.WeChat does present some risks, but banning it nationwide is overkill. As I explain below, a more targeted approach, such as banning the app on work phones of defense department employees, like the Australian government did, or even for all government workers, is more reasonable.As noted, there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the executive order. With regard to individuals in particular, it is unclear what " transactions " would be covered. If the ban is intended to take the application off the various mobile marketplaces, it will seriously disrupt person" to" person communications that have been crucial for the 19 million active WeChat users who live in the United States. For some of these users, WeChat is their main channel of keeping in touch and a primary source of information; for others, the app is one of the tools they use to make money and earn a living.The inability to use WeChat in the United States could spook many potential Chinese students and visitors, resulting in a likely drop in school enrollment and tourism revenues. Chinese students contribute approximately $15 billion to the U.S. economy every year, and Chinese tourists contribute $36 billion. The number of Chinese students and tourists was already declining due to deteriorating U.S.-China relations and the COVID-19 pandemic. The WeChat ban, which makes the United States less attractive to Chinese visitors than other countries who allow the app, can only exacerbate this trend.In addition, the ban could go well beyond personal access to the app and extend to associated business activities. The President of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai has noted that all American companies, regardless of their location, could be barred from any transactions related to the WeChat application. Because WeChat is so deeply embedded in the Chinese people ' s daily life and has become a platform for a wide range of activities, a ban on transactions related to WeChat would include sales, promotions, payments and other business activities. For instance, Starbucks and McDonald's use the application as a marketing and sales platform. Filmmakers use WeChat to promote their movies and make ticket sales. Walmart and many other venders use the app to sell products. In fact, the app accounts for as much as 30% of all Walmart sales in China. A WeChat ban could cost corporate users significant revenues.A ban could also result in a 30% decline of iPhone sales. Many Chinese netizens have said that if they have to choose between iPhone and WeChat, they will ditch their iPhones in a heartbeat.According to a survey conducted by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, nine out of ten companies forecast that the ban would have a negative impact on their business in China, with nearly half of them predicting a loss of revenue because of the ban. Furthermore, a WeChat ban could add more fuel to the already tense relations between the United States and China, making it more difficult for businesses to operate. So far, 86% of companies have reported a negative impact on their business with China as a result of the growing tensions. The situation will only get worse with a WeChat ban.Clearly, the WeChat ban comes with huge costs, but are their offsetting benefits? How big a security risk is WeChat, and would a ban mitigate this risk? With an increasingly hostile geopolitical rivalry brewing, the U.S. government needs to look carefully at the cyber practices coming out of China. The Executive Order indicates that the ban will protect user data from the Chinese government and fight against China's "disinformation campaigns . " Will they do so?Despite a lack of direct evidence on this point, there have been concerns that WeChat would share data with the Chinese government. If the administration is concerned about this with average citizens (as opposed to military personnel or other government employees, where special considerations apply), instead of banning the app, it could simply warn consumers of such risks and let the them choose whether to use the application. Individuals should have the freedom to decide the level of risk they are willing to take with regard to their personal information. It's worth noting that the issues related to consumer data are much broader than WeChat. The Chinese government has other ways, such as through web tracking and datasets available on the Dark Web, to obtain users' information. A better way to protect consumer data, from not only the Chinese government but all governments, is to establish more general domestic and international rules on data protection and hold countries and companies accountable for violating these rules.The Executive Order also highlighted that a ban of the WeChat application will help to mitigate "disinformation campaigns." As with user data, if the administration is concerned about campaign meddling, it is a much larger problem than WeChat and is happening on other platforms such as Facebook and Twitter and through other means such as hacking. Focusing on only one application is insufficient and could distract from other campaigns coming from other countries.When foreign government try to collect data on American citizens and non" citizens living in America, for the purpose of manipulating them for political or other reasons, it is a serious issue. The U.S. government needs to get a handle on this problem immediately. In the case of WeChat, however, any national security benefits of a total ban are outweighed by the disruptions to people's personal lives and the potential economic losses for individuals and businesses that would likely materialize in the presence of a ban. There are real concerns related to WeChat, but more targeted actions like the Australians have taken make more sense. A total ban on WeChat simply goes too far.Load-Date: September 17, 2020End of Document

DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL ALEXANDER OKULIAR DELIVERS REMARKS BEFORE THE UNITED STATES COUNCIL FOR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSStates News ServiceOctober 28, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 6682 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Department of Justice:Washington, DCUnited States~Wednesday, October 28, 2020From Edison to 'New Madison': Division Activity at the Intersection of Innovation, Competition Law and TechnologyGood morning. It is a pleasure to speak with you today, thanks for the invitation. I will start with prepared remarks highlighting some of the Antitrust Division's work over the last year and then, time permitting, would be happy to take questions or discuss any issues.As most of you likely know, antitrust law is focused heavily on efficiency and consumer welfareand, in particular, static and dynamic efficiency in the economy. The Division's enforcement philosophy acknowledges the importance of innovation as a vital ingredient to promote those efficiencies and to enhance competition and consumer welfare, particularly through the introduction and refinement of technology. Therefore, my remarks today will focus most heavily on the Division's recent enforcement and advocacy activity to protect innovation in the technology sector.I'll begin with a quote from Thomas Edison, who said "I find out what the world needs. Then I go ahead and try to invent it."[1] There are over 1,000 patents in Edison's name, which he developed in the first RandD laboratory of its kind in Menlo Park, NJ. In his lab, among other innovations, Edison improved upon attempts to create an electric light bulb that consumers could use at home. Edison not only created an electric light that was safe and economical, but he also built the lighting system that formed the basis for the U.S. electric industry.[2] Edison developed similar ground-breaking inventions with the phonograph and system for motion pictures.[3] To be sure, Edison found ways to make innovation better and improve upon the ideas that came before.Similar innovation happens in standards development when industries collaborate to harness the best technical solutions that bring safer and more efficient products and services to consumers. Across technology areas, innovators today develop a vision of what the world needs, and like Edison, set out to invent it. Often, they work together to bring consumers new complementary products and services that interoperate. We see these sorts of collaborative developments happening now in the setting of standards for 5G technologies that promise connected products and services like autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and smart city applications.[4] For standards to be successful, it is critical that the process for their development be industry-led, competitive, and balanced.With this in mind, let me start with a brief discussion of our recent enforcement activity in the tech sector and then I will turn to our advocacy and business review work, as well as other developments we are keeping an eye on, with respect to patents, competition, and standard-setting.The Department's Enforcement Efforts on Technology and Digital MarketsThe Division has been hard at work tackling competitive issues in technology and digital markets to ensure innovation continues to flourish. Today, these markets cover a vast and ever-expanding array of underlying goods and services. Our recent enforcement efforts make this clear. Earlier this year, for instance, the Division required significant divestitures to resolve competitive harms in markets related to intelligence and communications technologies in the military, government, and commercial spaces. Our investigation of the merger between United Technologies Corporation (UTC) and Raytheon Company revealed that these were the only firms developing, manufacturing, and selling military airborne radiosdevices that allow secure voice, data, and video communications to and from aircraft, and which are installed on every airplane and helicopter the Department of Defense (DOD) currently uses. The investigation further revealed that UTC and Raytheon were a couple of the only competitors for military GPS systems for aviation, maritime, and ground applications; and that they were a couple of just a few firms capable of producing several components for space-based optical/infrared (EO/IR) reconnaissance satellites. These satellites provide the DOD and U.S. intelligence community customers with essential information like early warning missile launches. Our divestitures sought to remedy any potential harms to competition and innovation in these critical overlapping technology businesses.Similarly, the Division obtained a key divestiture to maintain competition for large geostationary satellite antennas in a transaction between General Dynamics and Communications and Power Industries LLC (CPI), a portfolio company of Odyssey Investment Partners Fund V, LP (Odyssey). These antennas are essential components of government, military, and commercial satellite communication networks. CPI and General Dynamics' subsidiary GD SATCOM were two of only a few firms designing, manufacturing, and selling these antennas. The divestitures the Division obtained in these cases preserve competition that leads to lower costs and increased innovation in critical military and defense products, benefiting Americans as citizens and as taxpayers.Turning now from the military, government, and intelligence space to commercial telecommunicationsjust last week the Division announced that it would require key divestitures to resolve competitive issues arising from Liberty Latin America Ltd.'s (Liberty) acquisition of ATandT Inc.'s wireline and wireless telecom operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Our investigation revealed that the transaction as originally contemplated would have eliminated competition for essential fiber-optic-based telecommunications services. Businesses in Puerto Rico rely on these fiber-optic services for everyday operations. By requiring the parties to divest Liberty's subsidiary, Liberty Communications of Puerto Rico, and certain ATandT fiber-based telecom assets and customer accounts in Puerto Rico, the settlement will preserve vigorous competition that benefits businesses across Puerto Rico.And of course, the Division has also been very busy in digital markets. As Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim announced last summer, we are undertaking a large-scale review of the diverse business practices of the world's largest digital markets companies, including various online platforms. Our review covers potentially anticompetitive business practices spanning many years, and examines numerous permutations of business models and competitive landscapes. We have been hiring digital markets fellows throughout the year and have a very large team dedicated to this project. This work is distinct from the Department's work on the qualified immunity for certain digital platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.Last week, in what is the first public matter to come out of the digital markets review, we filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of D.C. to stop Google from unlawfully maintaining monopolies in the search and search advertising markets. The Complaint alleges that Google has entered into a series of exclusionary agreements that work together to lock up the primary ways in which customers access search enginesand, through search engines, the internet. As the Complaint explains, Google generally has used its monopoly profits to buy preferential or exclusive treatment for its search engine on numerous devices, browsers, and other search access points, creating a continuous and self-reinforcing cycle of monopolization. These practices have harmed competition and consumers, hampered innovation, and prevented competitors from disciplining Google's anticompetitive conduct. As we take this matter to court, I am confident our efforts will lead to a more competitive search and search advertising ecosystem, protect innovation, and benefit consumers.Overview of the Antitrust Division's Work in the Area of Intellectual Property and Standards DevelopmentNow I would like to address the Antitrust Division's work in the area of intellectual property and standards development, which has been a key focus for the Division under AAG Delrahim. Under his "New Madison" approach, the Division has cautioned against the misapplication of antitrust theories to licensing disputes that involve a patent holder unilaterally exercising its exclusive rights conferred by the U.S. Constitution.[5] James Madison was a fierce advocate of strong patent protection, including exclusive rights for inventors, because he recognized it drives innovation. In The Federalist Papers, Madison argued that the "[t]he copyright of authors has been solemnly adjudged, in Great Britain, to be a right of common law," and that "[t]he right to useful inventions seems with equal reason to belong to the inventors."[6] His rationale was that "[t]he public good fully coincides in both cases with the claims of individuals."[7] Madison's advocacy resulted in the Patent and Copyright Clause in the U.S. Constitution.[8] The Division shares Madison's view that patent and copyright protection can drive individuals and firms large and small to continue to innovate and, therefore, it has sought a reasoned approach to antitrust enforcement when it comes to intellectual property.Some commentators and parties, however, have advocated for the use of antitrust law as a mechanism to enforce commitments made by patent holders to license standards implementers on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms. Their fear is that a patent holder can "hold-up" implementers at an above-FRAND rate and that antitrust liability can be used to prevent an injunction and reach a reasonable royalty. The Division has repeatedly cautioned against the misapplication of antitrust law to mere royalty disputes, where there has been no harm to the competitive process. Such harms are better remedied by contract and patent laws; antitrust is an ill (and potentially harmful) fit. Although competition may result in lower prices, U.S. antitrust law does not regulate royalties even if they are supra-FRAND.[9] Nor does it force individual firms to deal, except in rare circumstances. Moreover, the reliance on antitrust law as a FRAND bargaining tool increases the likelihood of "hold-out," where implementers may delay taking a license. This stalls payment for the use of a standard essential patent, which can have detrimental effects on innovation.[10] Standard essential patent holders must have some recourse free of antitrust liability. Consequently, the Department has recognized that "[i]njunctive relief is a critical enforcement mechanism and bargaining toolsubject to traditional principles of equitythat may allow a patent holder (including an essential patent holder) to obtain the appropriate value for its invention when a licensee is unwilling to negotiate reasonable terms."[11]As AAG Delrahim has pointed out, the New Madison approach has taken hold in the U.S. and abroad.[12] For example, the Department joined the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the National Institute of Standards and Technology in releasing an updated Policy Statement on Remedies for Standards-Essential Patents Subject to Voluntary F/RAND Commitments, which replaced a prior statement on patent remedies that was issued in 2013.[13] This Joint Statement restored balance to the debate over the availability of injunctions for infringement of SEPs by advocating that no special rules on remedies need apply, such as those limiting injunctions. This well-received policy change was the product of thoughtful work by staff and leadership at DOJ, PTO, and NISTall three Executive Branch agencies whose missions are relevant to standards development.We see the courts embracing the New Madison approach as well. As you may know, the Department has expanded its advocacy in federal district courts, filing statements of interest that called for the sound application of antitrust law to intellectual property disputes. For example, in FTC v. Qualcomm, the Ninth Circuit accepted the Department's view that a refusal to license its competitors a SEP and charging its customers what some perceived to be unreasonably high royalties do not alone violate the Sherman Act.[14] Similarly, in Continental v. Avanci, the district court accepted the Department's view that alleged breaches of FRAND obligations do not constitute exclusionary conduct giving rise to monopolization claims and recently granted a motion to dismiss in that case.[15] In Intel v. Fortress, the district court declined to accept a theory that the antitrust laws barred the defendants' efforts to acquire and monetize patent rights absent a cogent theory that the acquisitions eliminated competing patents, rejecting the plaintiffs' overbroad market definition.[16] The court dismissed the complaint without prejudice; Apple and Intel have now amended their complaint and we are watching this case with interest. Recent rulings by courts in the United Kingdom and Germany similarly recognize that standards essential patent holders must be able to enforce their patents and recoup investment on their contributions to standards development.[17]In Lenovo v. Interdigital, the Department filed a statement of interest advocating that a single firm's allegedly anticompetitive FRAND breach does not satisfy Section 1's concerted-action requirement. In addition, we argued that over-disclosing standard-essential patents during the standards development process, without more, generally does not violate Section 2.[18] In all of these cases, the Department's analysis focused on whether the alleged conduct could harm competition or the competitive process, rather than the price of the royalty.Some other general principles can be gleaned from this advocacy work and other related efforts of the Division. First, antitrust law is not a panacea for all disputes involving the licensing of standards-essential patentsit does not favor individual competitors or groups of competitors, but focuses on harm to competitive process. For example, in analyzing Avanci's licensing pool for SEPs for use in 5G-connected vehicles, pursuant to the business review process, the Department found that although the pool did not license to automotive suppliers, the pool's license to vehicle manufacturers had the potential to make licensing easier and much more efficient for automakers willing to license the technology necessary to make these vehicles.[19] The Department also the found the pool could help to ensure cellular technology innovators are compensated appropriately for the value that their technology brings to connected vehicles.Our review of the Avanci 5G pool focused on the potential harms to competition that might be created by the platform and determined that the potential benefits outweighed the potential harms. In doing so, the Division did not take sides in the "license to all" versus "access to all" debate over where in the manufacturing chain a SEP holder must license to avoid antitrust liability. We made clear that the Department is not in the business of choosing winners and losers.[20] Thus, we made no assessment of whether end-device licensing will be or should be successful in the automotive industry or whether it is the correct approach to licensing in these sectors. Rather, we focused on the pool's potential to aggregate a significant number of complementary cellular SEPs in the marketplace and streamline licensing, and found that it is unlikely to harm competition.[21] As the Department's letter explains, if Avanci successfully streamlines licensing for both automakers and SEP holders, this means that both groups may be able to focus resources elsewhere, such as on investment in further RandD in emerging 5G technologies and applicationswhich is likely to benefit consumers.[22]Second, balance is important to maintaining incentives to compete and contribute technology to standards.[23] Our business review response to the GSM Association emphasized the importance of balance in maintaining a competitive standards development process.[24] It made plain that an open and balanced standards process is central to preserving competition and enabling the emergence of new disruptive technologies.[25] Indeed, "maintaining a balance of interests in the standard-development process is a critical safeguard that helps to prevent competition concerns from arising in the standard-development process."[26]Third, antitrust law has a role to play in ensuring concerted action and special interests do not harm a competitive standards development process. The Department has engaged directly with standards development organizations (SDOs) on this issue. As an example, we recently submitted comments to the American National Standard Institute ("ANSI") on its revisions to the U.S. Standards Strategy.[27] Again, our comments emphasized the importance that balance brings to the standards development process. The Division's ANSI comments note in particular that competition among technologies to be included in global standards will not flourish if certain players are allowed to "bias [the] standards development processes in their favor."[28]The Division also stressed the importance of balanced policies and participation in recent advocacy to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ("IEEE"). The Department took the step of issuing an update to 2015 IEEE Business Review Letter after numerous concerns were raised by stakeholders and former government officials that the 2015 Letter was being misrepresented or misinterpreted as an endorsement of the IEEE's Patent Policy, which was not the point of the 2015 Letter (again, the Department does not pick winners and losers). In addition to addressing mischaracterizations of the 2015 Letter, as AAG Delrahim has explained, the supplemental letter "reiterates that SDO policies and procedures must balance the interests of SEP holders and implementers" as well as "afford parties the flexibility needed to arrive at license terms (like royalty rates) that encourage participation in the SDO process."[29] We also updated the 2015 Letter to reflect recent cases that more clearly articulate that FRAND disputes are better addressed under contract or patent law, rather than antitrust.Although the Department has been largely successful in its New Madison approach and in advocating these central principles, not everyone has accepted them, and there is still work to be done. For the remainder of my time, I would like to focus on some policies outside the United States, particularly in China, that could pose a threat to competition and innovation in standards development.China's Antimonopoly EnforcementAs noted by AAG Delrahim in a speech at a conference last month, the Division keeps a close eye on global developments relating to the intersection of IP and competition. Indeed, the issue of SEPs will be the basis of a discussion at the next meeting of the Competition Committee of the OECD.A jurisdiction that we follow particularly closely is China. While China's antitrust enforcement regime is fairly new and recently reorganized, China has ramped up enforcement of its Antimonopoly Law (AML) quickly. We have heard concerns over the years that China's enforcement of the AML targets foreign firms, and promotes industrial policies and national champions. We have been and will continue to be quite clearindustrial policy and national interest should play no role in competition enforcement, and the Department routinely engages with Chinese enforcers on application of the AML to advocate non-discriminatory enforcement. Indeed, procedural fairness in competition enforcement is an issue of particular importance to the Division. In 2018, the Department worked closely with competition enforcers and the International Competition Network (ICN) to develop the Framework on Competition Agency Procedures, or CAP. [30] Through this innovative arrangement over 70 competition agencies around the world have committed to fundamental due process protections in competition enforcement, and the signatories held their first meeting virtually last week. It is unfortunate that China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), which enforces the AML, has not yet signed the CAP. We hope that status changes as our dialogue with Chinese enforcers continues.The Antitrust Division also is interested in how the AML is applied to conduct involving intellectual property.[31] This summer, the State Council Anti-Monopoly Commission issued its long-awaited Guidelines on Intellectual Property Rights.[32] Some of the principles set forth in Guidelines are welcome and well-accepted. In fact, we apply them in the U.S. For example, similar to our IP Guidelines,[33] Article 2 of the Chinese guidelines provides that intellectual property should be analyzed in the same manner as other property rights and that enforcers will not presume that an intellectual property right (including a standards-essential patent, see Chinese guidelines, Article 27) creates market power. Moreover, Chinese enforcers are to analyze conduct for procompetitive benefits on a case-by-case basis.[34]Aspects of the Chinese guidelines apply specifically to standards development. For example, the Chinese guidelines recognize that standards development organizations should not become vehicles for concerted action by market participants to harm competition. We wholeheartedly agree. Under Article 11, Chinese enforcers will examine whether collective standards development excludes competitors, competing standards, or relevant proposals of particular companies without procompetitive justifications.While the Chinese adoption of these principles should be applauded, other aspects of the Chinese guidelines are more concerning. For example, an intellectual property holder with a dominant market position may violate the AML if it charges an excessive royalty (Article 15), refuses to license an essential intellectual property right or one that is subject to a licensing commitment (Article 16), or if it discriminates in licensing terms (Article 19). Indeed, for standards-essential patents, the Chinese guidelines state seeking an injunction or forcing a licensee to accept unreasonable licensing terms may restrict competition and violate the AML (Article 27).We have argued against these concepts over the past several years in many fora, because we believe they put companies at risk of violating the antitrust laws when they merely seek to enforce their patents. And this can chill innovation. For example, in our view, a competition agency that regulates royalties simply because it determines they are unfairly high risks severely reducing firms' incentives to innovate. Under U.S. antitrust law, lawful monopolists may set their prices as high as the market will bear. The potential for high reward encourages dynamic competition and drives the desire to create a better, more desirable product or service. The freedom to set prices relates to the freedom to license. We believe the unilateral choice to refuse to license confers greater benefits to the innovator than if it were forced to share with competitors. Having this choice creates incentives for the initial investment.[35] In the case of patent royalties, including those for standards-essential patents, prices are best set by agreement between licensors and licensees. If they can't agree, then arbitration or other similar methods may help to resolve the dispute. In contrast, intervention by competition enforcers regarding the price of licenses can undermine the benefits of the market and result in the misallocation of investments.We understand that not all competition enforcers agree with our perspective, but we think continued discussion of these issues is critical. If soundly applied, competition law can work in concert with intellectual property rights to enhance innovation and economic growth. In addition, transparent and procedurally fair enforcement procedures advance incentives for innovation by providing companies with confidence they are operating in a stable, predictable, and fair environment. We intend to monitor how China's IP Guidelines are applied and will continue to engage with the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) on these topics.China's Standards Development InitiativesAnother issue at the intersection of competition and standards we are watching with interest is China Standards 2035, which is a new industrial plan being developed by the Chinese government to advance China's position as a key contributor and influencer of global standards, including those that are critical to our infrastructure and national security such as 5G.[36] Although a draft of the plan has not been published, we understand that China Standards 2035 will be a complement to China's successful Made in China 2025 strategy, which has established China as a leader in global manufacturing in strategic industries such as communications technology.[37] China Standards 2035 seeks to internationalize Chinese standards and aggressively incorporate Chinese technologies into global standards.China's National Standardization Committee issued a report earlier this year confirming that China's strategy is to influence international standards development and have more Chinese technologies included in global standards, such as those related to information technology, biotechnology, and COVID-19 response.[38] China's reported goals reflect its recent efforts to gain prominence in standards development for emerging technologies.[39] In short, it appears that "Beijing intends to set the foundational rules that will define next-generation technologies, resources, and exchange writ large."[40]China Standards 2035 follows complaints we have heard about China's domestic standards development, which is State-run rather than industry-led. For example, companies have complained that they are unable to access Chinese standards, or that they experience roadblocks to participating in the domestic process even if they have a presence in China as well as the technical expertise. In addition, we have heard that companies may have their technology incorporated into a domestic standard without their participation or consent. In our engagement with Chinese regulators, we have emphasized that standards development should not exclude foreign stakeholders and that contribution of intellectual property to a standard must be voluntary.Engagement with China on China Standards 2035 will be important given the plan's potential implications for competition in the standards development process. While the antitrust laws support and encourage competition in standards development because it can result in better standards, any success of Chinese companies should be because their technologies are better on the merits, not because of China's use of industrial policies, including China Standards 2035, that further its goal of having Chinese companies and Chinese interests dominate the development process internationally.[41] Controlling the standards process in this way diminishes the benefits that collaboration brings to setting standards in a balanced, consensus-based manner. To be sure, China Standards 2035 has the potential to thwart the procedural protections and international norms that SDOs have in place to promote openness and balance in the standards development process.[42] International norms require, among other protections, impartiality and consensus, including the opportunity to "to contribute to the elaboration of an international standard so that the standard development process will not give privilege to, or [favor] the interests of, a particular supplier/s, country/ies or region/s."[43]As I mentioned, China Standards 2035 also has the potential to harm competition; for example, China's plan may have an effect similar to a concerted effort by a group of competitors to control the outcome of the standards development process.[44] Although "private standards can have significant procompetitive advantages," the Supreme Court has emphasized that SDOs must promulgate them "through procedures that prevent the standard-setting process from being biased by members with economic interests in stifling product competition."[45] International SDOs must be cognizant of this threat and respond as necessary. As the Department states in its GSMA letter, "without balancing interests of different members there is little value in a group having openness, due process, or an appeals process, as there would be no diversity of opinion that would leverage such principles into reaching consensus."[46] SDOs must ensure that special interests and the priorities of any one member or group of members do not dominate SDO processes and outcomes. We understand that organizations such as ANSI are engaging with China on this plan as well as China's other initiatives in the standards development area, and we hope these discussions are fruitful.The Administration's recent National Security Strategy for Critical and Emerging Technologies (CandED), issued last month, addresses similar threats to technology development, including from China. It encourages the US Government to "lead the development of worldwide technology norms, standards, and governance models that reflect democratic values and interests" and "engage with the private sector to benefit from its understanding of CandET as well as future strategic vulnerabilities related to [critical and emerging technologies]."[47] Indeed, such engagement will be important to ensuring that standards continue to promote interoperability and facilitate global commerce.[48] As I have explained previously, the entire process of developing standards should adhere to due process principles so as to ensure that standards development does not advantage a particular country, region, or interest group.[49] Ideally China will seek comment on a draft of China Standards 2035 so that stakeholders can share their experience with standards development, including in the United States. As you know, the United States Government favors an industry-led, consensus-based approachone that is embraced internationally.[50]In sum, I believe competition enforcers have an important, though arguably limited, role to play. We must continue our global engagement at the intersection of intellectual property, competition, and standards, including with China, as we have on these and other important issues.[51] All stakeholders in standards development must continue to favor open, balanced, and fiercely competitive standards development processes that result in the adoption of merits-based solutions. To paraphrase Thomas Edison, we know what the world needs. We just need to go ahead and make it.Thanks so much.

Many of these suspects have been accused of stealing research, tax fraud, and recruiting talent to benefit the Chinese government.  Song Guo Zheng from Ohio State University has been accused of using more than $4 million to support research benefitting the Chinese government https://t.co/FuVaYYZlLv - Chemistry World (@ChemistryWorld) July 19, 2020 .⁦@DOJPH⁩ announced that Chinese Ohio professor Qing Wang arrested as part of a joint operation conducted by the FBI and the Dep. of Health and Human Service for wire fraud related to more than $3.6 million in grant funding from the Cleveland Medical https://t.co/dureQddlUX - Adam Milstein (@AdamMilstein) May 20, 2020Most recently two researchers, both Chinese nationals working at the University of Virginia and the University of California, Los Angeles, respectively, were hit with federal charges including theft of trade secrets and obstructing an FBI investigation.

AUSTRALIAN JOURNALISTS FORCED TO LEAVE CHINAStates News ServiceSeptember 8, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 388 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:The Australian government helped two Australian journalists living in China leave the country yesterday after a five-day diplomatic standoff. Amid fears for their safety, Bill Birtles of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation sheltered in Australia's embassy in Beijing, while Michael Smith of the Australian Financial Review took refuge in the Shanghai consulate. Both left China only weeks after Chinese authorities detained another Australian journalist, Cheng Lei, a business news anchor for the Chinese state-backed media outlet China Global Television Network. Chinese authorities have given no reasons for her arrest.But for Chinese journalists and activists, there is no foreign embassy to come to their rescue. Journalists and bloggers in China take enormous risks to investigate and report on stories that the China government deems to be sensitive. In February, citizen journalists Chen Qiushi and Fang Bin were forcibly disappeared in Wuhan for reporting independently on the Covid-19 pandemic. They haven't been heard from since.Fewer foreign journalists in the country means less scrutiny of China's human rights record at a time when serious abuses are increasing. In June, an unprecedented 50 United Nations human rights experts issued a joint statement expressing concerns at the Chinese government's mass violations in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and Tibet, the suppression of Covid-19-related information, and the targeting of human rights defenders across the country. They called on the UN Human Rights Council to "act with a sense of urgency" to monitor China's human rights practices, including a council Special Session and the creation of an independent international mechanism.The Australian journalists' recent experiences make it clear why such scrutiny is necessary. The Human Rights Council's September session will be Australia's last during its current three-year term as a council member. It should make it count by working with other governments to call for a special session or urgent debate on China. Foreign Minister Marise Payne should also reconsider the government's recent decision to abolish the human rights post at the Australian embassy in Beijing. More monitoring of the Chinese government's human rights record is needed, not less.Load-Date: September 8, 2020End of Document

IN CHINA, THE 'GREAT FIREWALL' IS CHANGING A GENERATIONStates News ServiceSeptember 1, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 2560 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:In May, Wuhan Diary, the Chinese writer Fang Fang's account of the early days of the coronavirus outbreak, was released in English by HarperCollins.Fang is no radical. She's the former chairwoman of the Hubei Provincial Writers Association, a government-linked group. She did criticize the initial coverup of the virus by local officials in Wuhan, but didn't raise any questions about the response of the central government in Beijing, or about the authoritarian political system that encouraged the cover-up. Fang also generously praised low-level Communist Party cadres, front-line health workers and volunteers.The book, adapted from a series of posts on Chinese social media, was published at a time when many across China were enraged by the death of Li Wenliang, a young Wuhan doctor who was punished for circulating an early report of the virus and then died of Covid-19. So one would think that Fang's book would have been welcomea very moderate assessment of the crisis, at a moment when many in China were already reflecting on the political system's strengths and weaknesses in handling the virus.That's not what happened. Instead, Fang's decision to have her diary published internationally unleashed a backlash in Chinaand not from the Communist Party, but from Chinese citizens online. The critics, mostly young people, accused Fang of failing to highlight the Chinese government's success in containing the outbreak, and of being a tool for "anti-China forces."On the popular Chinese microblog Weibo, a user commented, "the West smears us and wants to get together to demand sky-high compensation. Fang Fang passes the sword hilt to them to attack the nation." Another user blamed Fang for racist attacks on ethnic Chinese in Canada. Some exposed Fang's personal information, including her home address, and alleged that she lived a luxurious lifestyle at the expense of taxpayers, which Fang refuted.This attack on Fang illustrates a striking change in China under President Xi Jinping, especially among the internet-savvy and globally connected young Chinese who have long been most open to different worldviews.For many years, the internet in China was seen as a channel for new thinking, or at least greater openness; Chinese citizens could go online to expose government corruption and criticize leaders. Online discussions were relatively free and open, and users, especially younger ones, had an eager appetite for learning and debating big ideas about political systems and how China should be governed.That has changed sharply in recent years as a crackdown on the internet and civil society has become more thorough and sophisticatedand the government's messaging has grown more nationalistic.While nationalistic sentiment among Chinese youth has always been strong in certain areas of national securityespecially when it concerns "sovereignty" or territorial issues, such as the Senkaku Islands, Taiwan and Tibetin recent years it has increasingly spread to discussions of culture, technology and even medicine. Now young online Chinese, once conduits for new ideas that challenge the power structure, are increasingly part of Beijing's defense operation.Widely popular movies, TV shows and books portraying the Chinese society in a critical light are attacked for being "unpatriotic." The 2001 comedy Big Shot's Funeral, critically acclaimed in China at the time, a stinging satire of China's fledgling capitalists, is now deemed "a smear on national entrepreneurs." Once a hero for making Chinese innovation global, TikTok's founder, Zhang Yiming, is denounced as a U.S. "lapdog" for negotiating to sell TikTok's U.S. operationsdespite the fact he didn't actually have a choice. Chinese scientists who question the scientific proof, clinical validation and effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine are labeled "Han traitors."For anyone concerned about U.S.-China relations, or China's with the rest of the world, it's hard to overstate the importance of this change. The past 10 years in China have seen a combination of communications crackdown, ramped-up propaganda and rapid expansion of surveillance efforts thatwhen paired with China's rising global ambitionshave changed the public conversation in China, even among educated and younger people. It will make it harder, even in a post-Trump world, for the world's great powers to avoid splitting further apart, perhaps dangerously.To anyone who believes global openness in the internet is a one-way street, the situation in China is a troubling rebuke. What happened?Ten years ago, it was possible to believe we were heading to a very different direction. Millions of peoplemany my ageused social media every day to discuss social and political issues and to pressure local officials to right wrongs, prompting the widely known slogan, "changing China through collective spectating." Despite the risks, tech-savvy young people made songs, cartoons and animations to condemn censorship and one-party rule, and photoshopped the country's top leaders to make fun of them.When I was in college in China in the late 2000s, while I still had to study and pass government-mandated ideological courses such as "Mao Zedong Thought" and "Deng Xiaoping Theory," vibrant exchanges with like-minded millennials on online platforms such as Twitter and the Chinese blogging site Bullog stoked my interest in the unofficial version of Chinese politics and history. Writings and activism by liberal intellectuals like Ai Weiwei, Xu Zhiyong and Liu Xiaobo played a critical role in shaping my views. International news websites such as the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal provided me with information about China unrestrained by domestic press censorship. All these served as antidotes to official teachings I got through China's education system.China's internet censorship system, colloquially known as the Great Firewall, has existed since 2000, when the Ministry of Public Security launched the Golden Shield Project, a giant mechanism of censorship and surveillance aimed at restricting content, identifying and locating individuals, and providing immediate access to personal records. Initially, the Firewall blocked only a handful of anti-Communist Party Chinese-language websites, and it was relatively easy to circumvent the blockage to access them. Gradually, more websites got blocked, and netizens became increasingly irritated.In May 2011, a student at Wuhan University in China's Hubei province threw eggs and shoes at Fang Binxing, the architect of the Great Firewall, when Fang was giving a speech at the university. Appropriately or not, numerous netizens cheered the student's action, and called Fang "a running dog for the government" and "the enemy of netizens." In January 2010, when Google was forced to pull out of China after it refused to comply with government demands to filter its search results, some netizens, risking police harassment, gathered to offer flowers in front of Google's Beijing office.Online ideas also turned into offline activism. Human rights activists, lawyers and journalists came together to investigate, publicize and litigate cases involving land seizures, forced evictions, environmental degradation and employment discrimination. In college, I volunteered at legal aid centers for migrant workers where I met human rights lawyers, children who lost most of their fingers while illegally operating printing machines, and American law students from universities like Harvard and Columbia. Everyone involved was determined to find justice and build a nation rooted in the rule of law, and foreigners were welcome to help out.In 2009, when I moved to Washington, D.C., to study and work, I came with a sense of optimism. I had grown up in a China that was getting better each day, both more prosperous and more open. I, the daughter of farmers from a small village, wanted to learn what I could in the West, and come back to help our country grow into not just an economic superpower, but a land of freedom and rights.However, the country that I had thought I would go back to was quickly disappearing.In February 2011, an online appeal calling for people in China to emulate the Arab Spring uprisings resulted in small gatherings of curious onlookers in Beijing and several other cities. The authorities took it as a threat, and reacted by rounding up over 100 of the country's most outspoken critics and forcibly "disappearing" many of them for months, without any legal procedure, subjecting them to forced sleep deprivation, abusive interrogations and threats.Beijing's disproportionate response to a nonexistent "revolution" indicated a fundamental fear of independent activism, and considerably chilled the vibrant and by then ever-expanding online political discourse.In late 2012, Xi Jinping became the paramount leader of China, assuming the position of secretary general of the Communist Party. Xi's rule has been marked by accelerated repression of the civil society and ideological control.In November 2013, the Communist Party issued Document No.9, an internal communique warning its members against "seven perils" that could undermine its rule, including "universal values," civil society and a free press. With the document setting the tone, what followed was a period of unrelenting crackdowns on the internet, media, civil society and education that largely blocked any meaningful channels through which young people could gain perspectives that are different from official narratives.Gradually, the experience of being online in China changed. The list of banned words and images grew. Articles and posts that managed to be published got removed quickly. The government got savvier, and more aggressive, about using its own technology: AI-powered censors could scan images to determine whether they contained certain sensitive words or phrases. An increasing number of foreign websites were blocked by the Great Firewall. Twitter has long been inaccessible, and so have the Times and the Journal. It is still possible to use VPNs and other circumvention tools to scale the Great Firewall, but it is getting increasingly dangerous to do so. Some people went to jail for selling VPNs, and others were fined for merely using them.The government also tightened its ideological grip over universities and schools. In 2019, Xi called for educators to fend off "false ideas and thoughts" when teaching ideologies and politics courses.University teachers who dare to deviate from textbooks get reported by student informants who keep tabs on their professors' ideological views. Some professors, including foreigners, were punished for making comments critical of the government.Perhaps the most devastating form of censorship is physical. Authorities have silenced numerous leading writers, rights lawyers and activists who served as the conscience of the nation: aforementioned Ai Weiwei is in exile, Xu Zhiyong has been forcibly disappeared, and Liu Xiaobo died three years ago in state custody. In July 2015, authorities rounded up and interrogated without counsel about 300 rights lawyers, legal assistants, and activists across the country, many of whom were subjected to torture and other ill treatment and a few are still in prison today. Mostly recently, law professor Xu Zhangrun was detained for six days on bogusand laughable"soliciting prostitutes" charges. Police jailed some Twitter users while forcing others to close their accounts.At the same time, against the backdrop of China's economic rise and growing influence around the world, the Communist Party has been ramping up its nationalistic propaganda, promoting the idea that a diminishing West, especially the United States, is determined to thwart China's rise. The Chinese government still invokes the idea that China suffered "a century of humiliation" in the hands of these "imperialist powers."When so few have alternative sources of information, government propaganda becomes more believable: The coronavirus was brought to China by the U.S. Army; protesters in Hong Kong are "violent and extreme" and instigated by U.S. intelligence; the election of pro-independence candidate Tsai Ing-wen to Taiwan's presidency was a result of American manipulation. Inside China, people are living in an information bubble that the government is getting better at controlling.In some cases, this is almost leading to a generational split. In my cohortthose who experienced a relatively free internet as young peoplemany strongly resent the Great Firewall. Among people who started college after Xi took power, however, there is a strong impulse to defend it.Having grown up never hearing of or using international platforms such as Twitter and Google, they believe the Firewall has protected them from false information and the country from social instability. They also think it has created the necessary conditions for the rise of China's own tech giants, of which they are understandably proud.The worldview they're exposed to is one in which foreign criticism of the Chinese government is often reflexively thought to be backed by the U.S. government. But while the U.S. is perceived to be omnipresent in activities to undermine China, it is at the same time chaotic and dysfunctional domestically. The way the state media depicts the U.S.ridden by gun violence and police violencehas my own family constantly worried that I might get shot on the street.Some examples of this new nationalism are absurd but largely harmless, like a storm of criticism that erupted around a famed infectious disease doctor for suggesting that Chinese children should have protein-rich eggs and milk for breakfast, rather than rice porridge. He was lambasted online for "worshiping things foreign" and "sucking up to Americans," though in this case the state media came to his defense, explaining that protein is good for boosting the immune system to fight the virus.But some nationalistic fervor has the potential for real-world harm. Recently, there have been renewed calls for the Chinese government to seize the opportunity created by the pandemic to take Taiwan by force. Videos and photos have also emerged of people, including children, warning or wishing for the deaths of Americans.Of course, not all youth are strident nationalists. Now and then, students in China or living abroad quietly reach out to me to express their objections to the Chinese government's human rights violations and political aggression. While rising nationalism in China is a reality and policymakers should take it seriously, they should also keep in mind that many in and from China live in silent fear, struggling with guilt for not speaking up.At minimum, countries around the world should keep their universities, institutions and open societies supportive of and welcoming to those who want to learn and debate. Governments and institutions should also invest in overseas independent Chinese-language mediamany young people inside the Great Firewall quietly find ways to jump over the wall to look for informationand technological tools that can be used to circumvent and even dismantle censorship. Finally, they need to keep supporting journalists, writers and activists inside the countrythe real agents of change.Load-Date: September 1, 2020End of Document

ONLINE EVENT: A CONVERSATION WITH REP. WILL HURD ON INFORMATION WARFARE: U.S. COMPETITION WITH CHINAStates News ServiceSeptember 17, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 5487 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS):Jude Blanchette: Well, hello and welcome. My name is Jude Blanchette. I am the Freeman Chair in China Studies here at CSIS.I'm really excited about today's conversation, where we'll be talking about U.S. competition with China. But instead of focusing on some of the more traditional domains of the growing rivalry, we're going to focus today on information, disinformation, and the role that these are playing increasingly in the bilateral rivalry.And I can really think of no one better to help us unpack this issue than our guest, Congressman Will Hurd, who since 2015 has been serving as the U.S. representative for Texas' 23rd Congressional District. Representative Hurd really brings a unique lens and background to this challenge, having served as a(n) operations officer in the CIA for the better part of a decade with tours in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India, but also brings a keen interest and background training in all issues technology-related, especially computer science, which was an early focus of his. In Congress, among other things he serves on as a ranking member for the Subcommittee on Intelligence, Modernization, and Readiness, which falls under the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. And I think very apposite for our discussion today, he's been a keen and outspoken voice on the challenge that China presents to the United States.Just in preparing for this, looking through some of his recent writings you see a focus on not looking at the competition in the rearview mirror, but really trying to think through the next iterations of this challenge and what the United States has to be doing in terms of short- and long-term investments to better position us to be competing and ultimately winning in this challenge, in this competition with China. I saw just recently that the congressman called China the greatest political threat the U.S. faces. And looking at his work with Representative Robin Kelly in attempting to develop a national strategy on artificial intelligence, I think both demonstrates a very deep commitment to finding bipartisan solutions to these challenges, but I think a really laser-like focus on what the United States needs to be doing to think through the full 21st century of competition.And so it's a great honor and pleasure to be joined by Representative Hurd to unpack this crucial topic of information competition between the U.S. and China. Congressman Hurd, thank you very much for joining us today.Rep. Will Hurd: It's a pleasure to be on. It's an important topic, and it's crazy. When I was you know, if I go back to 2008, late 2008 when I made the decision to run for Congress, I was in the Hindu Kush Mountains in Afghanistan, and I never would have thought that I'd be sitting talking about technology and disinformation in China. You know, most of my career was counterterrorism and chasing nuclear-weapons proliferators. I did you know, China was a was a target for everyone in trying to better understand, but I would think even in my time in the CIA we viewed China as kind of a regional superpower rather than a global superpower. And so, my understanding of what I call this new Cold War has evolved from my time in the agency, and they are obviously a global power. So it's great to be with you to chat about these topics.Jude Blanchette: Well, you've already hit upon a theme that will, I think, run throughout our discussion today, which is the last time the United States was engaged in a in a truly great-power competition was with the Soviet Union. And so it happens that you mention this as a as a new Cold War, and of course it's the new where all the interesting, challenging stuff is. Rather than this just being a repeat of the old Cold War, we're vexed with some issues of economic-technological-human capital integration, which make this such a thorny issue.Rep. Will Hurd: Well, it's even it's even more complicated because the U.S. and Russian cultures/economies were never anywhere as intertwined as the U.S. and China is. I think China is probably more of a frenemy, right? It's a it's a potential customer, right, to a lot of great U.S. businesses, but it's absolutely an adversary as well. And so that's a unique challenge that we didn't have in dealing with the USSR or Russia.Jude Blanchette: Yeah. Yeah, it's a crucial point.To sort of start at the 35,000-foot elevation here, as hopefully we descend down, the first thing I wanted to ask you about is, as a framework, a lot of the focus now not exclusively, but a lot of the focus especially in think tanks, but even in the U.S. government is focusing on some of the more traditional domains of great-power competition. So, obviously, over at the Pentagon they're doing a lot of work on military competition. You see an increasing focus on economic competition. You yourself have talked a lot about how do we make North America much more competitive economically with China out in out in global markets. We see a lot of focus on diplomatic competition with China. There seems to be a relative deemphasis or lack of emphasis on this information and ideological space. And so just as a framing question, I wanted to ask your topline thoughts on in those siloes or buckets of these various elements of the competition, what role do you see information, and as an adjunct ideology, playing today and looking forward into the future between the two countries?Rep. Will Hurd: Well, it's going to continue to be an increasing area that we have to deal with because it moves faster than all those other all those elements and in any other domain. And so we have to be prepared for that, and I don't think we are.I think COVID is a good example of how early on, you know, the Chinese government tried to claim that this was the United States, that it started at a military base in Italy. They also are going to our Western allies and say you can't trust the U.S. to help you with this, we're the ones. You know, even in some points the Chinese had gotten support from European countries on the ventilators and PPE, and then they tried to sell that back to those (laughs) to those countries. And so this is the kind of game that we have to be ready for.And it starts with what is their goal and this their desire to be a world leader THE world leader, not a world leader; THE world leader in advanced technology in about 11 areas by 2049, right? This is not this is not my hypothesis. This is not something I collected when I was in the CIA. This is them saying this about themselves, and it starts with that.And so why are they trying to do that? And ultimately, data plays a role in all these issues, right? High-powered compute plays a role in all this. Advanced engineering like algorithms plays a role in all this. And what is at the core of all this? Information. And so how do you collect it, how do you weaponize it?Let's go back to the OPM hack of 2015, 22.1 million Americans who have gone through a security clearance. Now, what the SF-86, Standard literally stands for "Standard Form 86" has information on family members that may be living overseas. So the Chinese now have access to any Chinese American that may have a family member living in China. How are they going to use and leverage that kind of information? So not only is it collecting information to move their operations, it's weaponizing it in a way in order to move the narrative.And information operations helps in all these other domains of general great-power competition. And so you can prepare the actual physical battlespace with information operations. This is what all of our military planners talk about. Why do we care about the fact that space is now a contested domain just like air, land, and sea? Because space decides and influences the way information flows terrestrially. And so all of these issues are connected.Why should we care about TikTok? I don't care about some fancy you know, some dance moves somebody has, but it's a lot of data that is tagged on shapes and styles of faces that the Chinese government can't get in the mainland. So all these things are connected.Jude Blanchette: I wanted to linger on something you mentioned at the top of your remarks, which was on China's sort of narrative war coming out of COVID-19 still to this day outright denying or at least obscuring or attempting to obscure where the origins of this were, speaking in the passive voice, leaving this kind of general, well, we don't know where this originated, hopefully someday we'll find out. And you've written a lot about this. But in thinking about the playbook that China has used on overt disinformation, whether that's claiming through government officials over Twitter that maybe this came in through the U.S. Army, I wanted to get your thoughts on what does this tell us or what does this tell you about China's shifting playbook on disinformation?As a as just a contextual remark, it was the case that up until very recently experts or analysts were saying, look, there's a different playbook between Russia and China. Russia is much more it's like the Pistons in the late '80s; it throws elbows, you know, it plays dirty. China sort of plays much more formal, much more elegant. It seems to me that that's shifting a bit with seeing the more sort of Bill Laimbeer approach that China has been using with COVID-19. I wanted to get your thoughts on are we seeing an evolution in China's aggressiveness in the disinformation space, and what does that mean to you?Rep. Will Hurd: So the short answer is yes, but it's not new tactics for them. It is new tactics used on a world stage. They use all of these tactics internally, right? They use this in order to force obedience in the homeland. We're seeing how they're evolving and using these tactics right now in Hong Kong. And so we should not be surprised that an authoritarian government is using these kind of tactics on the world stage.And I think you can go back even I think it was 2017 when the first Chinese military base outside of Asia, outside of East Asia, in Djibouti. I think that was a wakeup call for a lot of people because, again, I think the prevailing sentiment was that I mean, that China is a major player in East Asia and they only care about East Asia. No, that's that was an old-world thinking. We all laughed at Made in China, right, that you know, that's going to be some knockoff. That's not the case anymore, especially when it comes, you know, the fear about microchips and things of that nature.And so we're going to see they have a playbook that has been developed over a couple of decades, and we're going to see that being used in a broader way. And I do believe that COVID was an opportunity for them to supercharge their efforts, and that's why I think some of these information operations are becoming more aggressive. Oh, and by the way, is it being countered properly?Jude Blanchette: Yeah.Rep. Will Hurd: And negative I learned a few things when I was in the CIA: be nice with nice guys, tough with tough guys, and if there's no consequences to negative behavior that negative behavior will continue and escalate. And the only way that we're going to deal with this and we can't do this by ourselves. We have to be working with our allies. Let's start with the EU, let's start with NATO in making sure that we're pushing back. We've got to make sure that we're in lockstep with Australia and Japan and South Korea and Vietnam on some of these issues because we have to have a collective response to these to this behavior.Jude Blanchette: Yeah. And certainly, you know, your last comment there reminds me that it seems that the United States has forgotten the fact that I think we hold all the all the big major cards here, it's just that we're not deploying them. You know, China has a(n) unenviable number of allies North Korea whereas the United States is able to bring to bring to the table and leverage a pretty robust and thick network of allies and partners, which creates a sort of a size factor and a scale factor which certainly rivals China. But we're in a moment where we've lost our mojo, and certainly I think it's clear in looking at a lot of our responses or how we're sizing up the China challenge that we've forgotten all the substantial elements of national strength that we have, of which our allies are just one.Rep. Will Hurd: And I would say on that, too, we oftentimes forget about soft power. When you talk about, you know, these issues, we always talk about the DIME, you know, frame of mind diplomatic, intelligence, military, and economic. We oftentimes forget the economic piece. And with what the Chinese are doing with the One Belt, One Road Initiative, our response to that, a new redesigned OPIC, you know, is that doing enough?I was in El Salvador literally meeting with the president the day after they made the announcement of working with the Chinese on some port project which we know was a was a debt trap. And so are we doing that (inaudible)?And I would say we've made some mistakes in Eastern Europe when it comes to you know, I spent a lot of time in Eastern Europe in Congress, and a lot of them are like, why can't we get more old episodes of "Oprah" or "Seinfeld" or some of these kinds of things to see that American culture that we all love? And they were having a hard time. And what the Russians were doing, they were providing the programming and including Russian news.The Chinese are going to start doing something similar. And so if we don't start focusing on some of our that soft power, then we're going to we're going to have a hard time.Jude Blanchette: I've always said "Seinfeld" reruns are our most potent offensive soft-power weapon, so.So I just want to follow up, just one last question on the election piece here. We're moving towards our presidential election in November. We've had some pronounced warnings from senior law enforcement and intelligence officials about specifically about the concern of the threat from China. I want to get your assessment of how big of a concern this is. And crucially, what steps do you think we can be taking now to protect against November? But I think also forward looking, what should we be doing about modernizing our election system to be able to withstand some of these threats?Rep. Will Hurd: So I actually held the first hearings on election interference back in 2016 before the 2016 election was over, and one of the things that we have seen when it comes to hardening the vote-counting machines and the tabulation machines, states have done a pretty good job since 2016 making sure that you have the ability to have a(n) audit trail so that when a recount happens. And as somebody who has won an election by 900 votes, every vote definitely matters. And so we've seen that happen.The question becomes if you're trying to influence something somebody, how does that impact your ultimately, your vote? And one of the things that I would like to see, the social-media companies have gotten pretty good at trying to take down folks that are misusing and abusing those systems for a nation-state, you know, that is doing an information operation, right? We can monitor, and we they've understood the tactics, techniques, and procedures that these troll farms are using, and trying to figure out how to how to stop this. But the piece that's missing is if a user liked or shared something that some payload from a Russian troll farm, are they notified? And the answer is no. And so I would like to see a more sophisticated notification system that if we're going to change people's behavior and not propagating the payload of a(n) information attack, you got to be told, hey, you did this and you shared something from a Chinese troll farm or a Russian troll farm, and so maybe that changes individual people's behavior.So that is that is, obviously, separate from the vote tabulation and vote counting. But DHS is working with the secretaries of state, secretaries of state understand that, so I feel confident in this. But it's these nation-state actors that are trying to get people or to influence the outcome of potential future legislation. That's something that's a little bit harder to do.Jude Blanchette: Just a follow-up on that. I was in Taiwan for the election, the presidential election, in January and was you know, Taiwan has been dealing with this onslaught from China, a real aggressive sort of technological threat to hack the election system, but also a morale threat of trying to I think trying to diminish or deteriorate confidence in Taiwan's democracy.What struck me during that period, in looking at what Taiwan is doing to push back against this, is there feels like there's a tension between raising awareness about the threat to your election system and but as a corollary to that, delegitimizing the electoral system, right. The more I warn about the threats, the attacks, China, Russia, I can imagine the average voter going, well, how much do I really trust the system now?So I wanted to just get your thoughts on do you see that tension existing as we start to raise the alarm bells or ring the alarm bells about China and Russia? And what do we do to make sure that we're making sure voters are aware of the risks but still confident that when you go in and you punch the ballot, that your vote is still counted?Rep. Will Hurd: And I think the outcome matters, right. I think the increase in of people voting in 2018 over 2016, I think, is a good example. And even in this COVID environment, I think you're going to see unprecedented turnout. So I think as long as people are turning out, that's how you that's an indication that people feel comfortable.But we also have to remember the goal of the Russians and the Chinese is the same. It's to erode trust in our democratic institutions. And the way you erode trust may not be in changing a vote from A to B. The erosion of trust becomes making everybody do what exactly you just explained. Oh, you can't trust this, so should I even go out and do this, right? And I think the great thing about the American spirit is that people are going to say, you know, you're not going to prevent me from going out and do something.And so that tension, while we should be aware of it, I don't see it on the ground. I'm involved in a number of elections across the country. And ultimately it's the individual candidates whose job it is to make sure they're getting people and making sure people are going out to the polls. So the fact that you have thousands of people doing that and we have such a distributed system, I'm not as concerned as what we have seen in a place like some Eastern European countries or even our friends in Taiwan.Jude Blanchette: We've got about 14 or so minutes left, and I want to pivot to the sort of offensive, what can the United States be doing to invest in the future? Just one final question, I think, in this same cluster of issues, which is our U.S. educational system is still the world leader here. It is not only contributing to U.S. soft power but U.S. hard power through innovation, the talent that we are attracting from all over the world.At the same time, you know, we know that we do have a problem of a very small percentage of individuals coming from abroad who are abusing the system and/or engaged in espionage to pilfer and steal IP, which is then turned against the United States. We've seen raising awareness about some of the talent programs that China utilizes here, and again, highlighting that this is a very, very small proportion of individuals who are engaged in nefarious activity.As the United States has stepped up its defensive posture against some of these threats, there are concerns that we are overreaching, that we're turning away talent. And instead of the old Cold War where it was the United States or that was it, students can now go to Canada. They can go to New Zealand. They can go to Australia. They can go to the U.K.Again, thinking about these tensions, do you see one existing between protecting national security and maintaining an open, pluralistic, competitive education system? Or do you think this is a challenge that we can face and address in a pretty straightforward manner?Rep. Will Hurd: The challenge absolutely exists, and we must address it. The United States of America has benefited from the brain drain of every other country for the last couple of decades. We need to continue that. The reason our economy has been the most important economy in the world is because we have been a leader in advanced technology. And one of the reasons we have been able to do that is we attract the best and the brightest, and they want to come. They want to become Americans. They want to live in America and they want to contribute to our society, our economy, our way of life. We have to make sure that continues.If the Chinese government wants to steal our technology, let's steal their engineers, right. Let's steal you know, let's take let's go after their top 200 AI researchers and be like, we're going to make you a deal that you won't be able to say no and then you're going to contribute here; same with quantum. And I think that's the kind of perspective that we need to take.We can manage the risk of people coming. You know, having a young person come in through an undergraduate program, the kind of plan that takes years, and they're going to be able to be exposed to the freedoms and our way of life rather than have to go back to China and deal with some of the realities on the ground there.So, we should be prepared and I think we should be way more opening than what we are in order to deal with this. This is a generation-defining struggle between the United States of America and the Chinese government on who's going to be the leader in advanced technology. Whoever comes in second place is going to lose. And this means we have to attract talent.A scary stat. When it comes to venture capital, venture capital is kind of the pointy end of the spear when it comes to capital. In 2006, 80 percent of venture capital was invested in the U.S. companies; in 2018, 49 percent. And the increase in the gross increase in the amount of money was like a 10-fold increase. In 2006, the top 10 venture-capital deals, eight of them were American companies. Two were Chinese. In 2018 in 2019 in 2018, excuse me three were American companies, top 10 of venture-capital deals. Five were Chinese. One was Singaporean. The other was an Indonesian. That is a problem.And so, we have to make sure people are still wanting to come to the United States, because we have the best schools. We have to make sure that we're attracting that talent, because there are more honor students in China than there are all students in the United States of America four times the size of our population, and that means we've got to make sure we're attracting the best and the brightest.And when you look at Eric Schmidt is running the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, right, and looking at artificial intelligence as a national-security issue. And some of the recommendations they're coming out with have nothing to do with pure national security. It's saying we've got to have an educated workforce, right. And we do that by educating our own, but also by attracting the best and the brightest from around the world.And we have to pursue those two tracks and making sure that our education system is still the best in the world. Really, we've got to be focused on that, because there are some other places where you can be going and getting as good an education, if not better, outside the United States. And that should scare all of us.Jude Blanchette: Great points. And I wonder if I can pivot off that, now that you're talking about some of the investments the United States needs to be making, in a more offensive frame of mind. I wonder if I can pivot now to just use the remaining few minutes we have here to be thinking about returning to this information space and the Cold War.If you look back at the history of the Cold War, information warfare, information competition, investments in soft power, investments in open-source translation, the United States really felt all in on this and recognizing the importance of the information space in competing with the Soviet Union.It seems like that muscle has atrophied a bit with the United States. That makes sense. The nature of our competition and our rivalries changed; certainly a focus on an area you have deep experience in, the Middle East, where this maybe didn't play as much of a role. You know, the United States was invested in things like Radio Free Europe, the U.S. Information Agency.At a broad level, thinking back on how the United States was prosecuting the Cold War against the Soviet Union and that information approach, do you see any lessons that we can be learning today or what we can be borrowing from the toolkit we used for the Cold War that might be apposite or helpful as we think about competition with China?Rep. Will Hurd: I think all those elements you talked about are the we should be using those strategies, but make sure we're putting it into a 2020 or a 21st century context, right. And one of the areas that we're going to have to learn is how do we translate our concepts and ideas, you know, to make sure that it resonates in a very different culture.Look, I love movies. I watch so many movies. I watch bad movies. And I was watching a recent movie about Ip Man. He was theJude Blanchette: Donnie Yen.Rep. Will Hurd: Yeah, yeah. And it was a movie I think it was Chinese-made. And some of the concepts you know, the fight scenes were amazing and all that, but the concepts didn't resonate with me. It was like what point are they trying to make, right? And so, we have to be mindful that how are we going to articulate our message. So part of information operations is delivery of the message, right, but making sure that message is correct and hits its point.And so, yes, we should have this. We should you know, do we really understand, why does Hong Kong matter, right? Why and Hong Kong matters because what the Chinese do in Hong Kong is what the Chinese are going to do in Taiwan. Why does Taiwan matter? Because Taiwan produces more silicon wafers and certain kind of chips that powers literally everything that we use. And if we don't have that, right, how is this going to impact this generation-defining struggle?And so, we have to be paying attention to what they're already doing and listening to them. And so how can we make sure that we counter? When you have protesters in Hong Kong waving the American flag, singing the National Anthem, right, usually you know, the experiences I had in the Middle East is they were burning the flag and saying death to America. And so that is something that we have to be able to take advantage of.You need the resources to do that. You need the entities within government to do that. You also need public-private partnerships in order to make that happen, and so and that we have a framework that we should look at. And then the question is, how do we adapt those principles and techniques to where we are today?Jude Blanchette: You know, building on that, I mean, you talked about sort of understanding what's happening in China and understanding their messaging. The proximate reason that we're having this conversation today and the reason that my CSIS colleague Seth Jones and I are spending so much time on this information space is we originally came to this because we noticed that most of the interesting stuff that the Chinese government or the Communist Party is saying about military strategy, about its political strategy, is encrypted in Chinese language, right. It's not being translated; and this, in contradistinction to the Cold War, where we had, you know, the Foreign Broadcast Information Service, or FBIS, which then transformed into the open-source enterprise but which dwindled and atrophied.Seth and I really are trying to emphasize the role in open source in translation. And you mentioned China's a frenemy. We should be having every Xi Jinping speech translated into English within 24 hours. You notice that a few key documents, like the Made in China 2025 plan, which, you know, inshallah, was translated into English by the Chinese government, has done more to shift the awareness from foreign businesses and us here. The 19th Party Congress speech which Xi Jinping gave, where he articulated this big grand vision for rejuvenation by 2049 and a world-class military and comprehensive national power you know, thank the Lord that was all translated to English.So I wanted to ask you, do you see a gap as well in our investments in open source here? And what should we be doing to close this gap in terms of investments in and outside of government?Rep. Will Hurd: Look, you're absolutely right. And we shouldn't have this gap, especially where machine language and language programming is getting to be able to have some of the some of these translations happen quickly and somebody go through and edit it. This is you're absolutely right. And I think there was a shift. When you read them saying things themselves, that is what has changed the perspective of folks up here in Washington.I actually think there's only a handful of truly bipartisan or nonpartisan may be the right word and the threat of China, right, in cybersecurity, I think, are those two. And part of that is from learning and understanding what they're actually saying.So you're right. When we look at when we think about research dollars, not just research dollars in these advanced technologies that we're going to need to master in order to keep our economy the strongest economy in the world, but it's like what are those what are those technologies that are going to help us better understand our threat, right, and how are we going to better understand our adversary? And that starts with natural-language processing, and that's something that we should be doing more on and making sure that we are getting things translated.I tried to get a document thank God we have the Congressional Research Service that was it took me forever to say, OK, what does this actually say? Like, I want a better translation than what I had. But to your point, when we hear what they say, right, it makes it it's more impactful. But, yes, there are so many areas. But that means we've got to make tough decisions. And we need to be making sure that when federal dollars are being used for research that that research is being made available to other folks, right? And so even if it's a private institution that ultimately is getting those federal dollars for that research, that information should be made available to others so that we can capitalize on those federal dollars.Jude Blanchette: We said we'd only keep you for 30 minutes, and I notice we're at 30 minutes and 20 seconds. But I wonder if I can sneak in a final question here.Rep. Will Hurd: Sure.Jude Blanchette: You're granted, you know, one wish and this will help position the United States to compete and ultimately be victorious in this long-term competition with China. What's the thing you look at that you say, when we write the history of how we were successful, what will be the element that will explain it? And what would you like to see happen?Rep. Will Hurd: Every fourth grader is coding is introduced to every fourth grader. I think that is something that would change that would change our trajectory.Jude Blanchette: Well, as befits your reputation and personality, that is both an eminently practical yet blue-sky desire for the United States.Rep. Will Hurd: (Laughs)Jude Blanchette: But, you know, Congressman Hurd, I really want to thank you for taking time out today. I know you're moving on to different ways of serving the country in the future. But your bipartisanship, your pragmatism, your principled stance on these issues, will sorely be missed. But I'm sure you will be a prominent and important voice in these discussions, in these debates, moving forward.So again, I want to thank you for your service. Thank you for your time today.Rep. Will Hurd: I appreciate you. These kinds of back-and-forth conversations you gave me a lot of things to think about as well. And my goal is, you know, I'm finishing up Congress and trying to do this national strategy on artificial intelligence so this is one area the United States stays a leader in. But I plan on staying involved in that intersection of technology, national security, and foreign policy. So I really do appreciate the opportunity. And best of luck with the rest of the conversations.Jude Blanchette: Great. Thank you very much.(End)Load-Date: September 18, 2020End of Document

Chinese manufacturing relocated to countryCE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 12, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 565 wordsBody       China's transition to focusing on the development of specialized technologies is leading to the exit of less sophisticated manufacturing that is being installed in other countries, and one of them is Mexico. "Within manufacturing there are certain segments that (China) is transferring to other countries, because labor favors it. China is focusing on science and technology," said Enrique Dussel, coordinator of the Center for China-Mexico Studies (Cechimex). China will continue to invest in manufacturing for technological developments, such as the use of nanotechnology in fabrics, i.e. in creating inputs as such, bringing assembly manufacturing processes to other countries. The "Made in China 2025" proposal, launched by the Chinese government in October 2015, highlights that it wants to be a global leader in 10 relevant areas of science and technology. These areas include information technologies, robotics, surgery, electric vehicles, biotechnologies and artificial intelligence, cepal refers in the report "Chinese Dream: How China Looks To Itself and How We Westerners Are Wrong In Interpreting It." This trend, along with the tariff advantages offered by the Treaty between Mexico, the United States and Canada (T-MEC) to export to the US, and the trade war with Mexico are reasons that drive Asian investment to Mexico, he added. In addition, wages in Mexico are attractive for relocation, with 26 percent lower than in Chinese manufacturing, according to Bank of America. Some Chinese companies, which since 2018 have been exploring in the country, have already settled in some cities such as Tijuana and others are in the process of being explored, luis Aguirre, national president of Index, reported. In Nuevo León, for example, since mid-2019, came Skyish, electronics, which in the country manufactures mainly water pumps for domestic sources, according to the State Appliances Cluster (Clelac). ALSO KUKA Home, from the furniture sector, started operations this year in that entity. The interest in relocations is mainly in companies in the aerospace, electrical-electronic and medical devices sectors, the Secretariat of the Economy said. "Cities like Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen are taking out manufacturing companies (assembly) to relocate elsewhere in China or Latin America," explained Samuel Maldonado, Concanaco's Vice President for Asia Pacific. China can send companies to nearby countries, such as Bangladesh or Pakistan, but they do not have capacity for the development of other industries such as electronics or automotive, in which Mexico highlights, said Jorge Millán, director of the Mexico City office of the SBE consultancy. Dussel added that Mexico's potential to attract Chinese investment has not yet been fully exploited. "There is potential, but it has been wasted because Mexico's public and private sectors have not been able to explain in a concrete way what the benefits lie against other countries," Dussel concluded.  In the spotlight  Internationally, manufacturing companies that plan or are taking their production out of China have Mexico as one of the main options for relocation. RELOCATION OPTIONS (Percentage 2020)  United States 74%  Mexico 47  Canada 24  Vietnam 12  India 9  Brazil 9  Thailand 7%  Asia-Pacific (except India, Thailand and Vietnam) 5  Europe 3  South America (except Brazil) 2    Source: Foley  LLP         Load-Date: October 13, 2020End of Document

BTS fan assaulted in China for phone case, report saysUPIOctober 13, 2020 Tuesday 10:39 AM ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 356 wordsByline: ELIZABETH SHIMDateline: Oct. 13 BodyBTS fans are coming under physical attack in China following Chinese state media condemnations of the South Korean boy band, according to conversations on social media platforms.South Korean news service News 1 reported Tuesday people in China seen with BTS-themed phone cases are being assaulted, after Chinese state tabloid Global Times claimed on Twitter BTS "hurt the feelings" of the Chinese public with their message about shared U.S. and South Korean sacrifices during the Korean War.According to the South Korean press report, a social media user on Chinese platform Weibo came under attack on the streets for carrying a BTS phone accessory.The victim suffered a fractured leg and may have received facial scars and bruises during the alleged altercation. The social media user also said a visit to a hospital was required following the attack.The online post was followed by verbal censure, according to News 1. Some Chinese commenters said the victim "deserved" the injuries for supporting BTS.BTS was recently presented with the James A. Van Fleet Award from The Korea Society in New York, and band member RM had said in an online message the band "will always remember the history of pain that [the United States and Korea] shared together, and the sacrifices of countless men and women."RM made no mention of China. Chinese state media may have encouraged the view the band "ignored the sacrifices of the Chinese people," according to News 1. China at the time fought against South Korea and the U.S.-led United Nations Command during the war.The Chinese government could be censoring critical commentary of BTS amid the controversy. According to Yonhap, the Global Times' main Chinese-language site had deleted recent BTS-related articles. English-language Global Times continues to make the articles available online, however.A South Korean source in Beijing told Yonhap Chinese authorities could be trying to calm the public because Beijing does not want the issue to cloud China-South Korea relations.On Tuesday, BTS songs "Savage Love" and "Dynamite" landed the No. 1 and No. 2 positions on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.Load-Date: October 13, 2020End of Document

Speaking Veritas to PowerThe Harvard Crimson: Harvard UniversityOctober 15, 2020 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: EDITORIALS; Pg. 1Length: 850 wordsBodyInternational students Zooming into class from outside of the U.S. may find themselves studying material considered politically sensitive in their home countries. Anticipating this issue, Harvard's Information Technology Department published a web manual in late August for professors to support at-risk students whose country of residence "would be hostile to the discussion of certain topics."While the manual does not directly name the countries where class discussions might prove "socially, culturally, or legally problematic," given the prevailing U.S.-Chinese tensions and China's incessant interference with free speech - both domestically and internationally - it is natural for this topic to draw our eyes to Harvard's complicated relationship with China. These tensions have already bubbled up in the Zoom-era, when a U.S.-held virtual commemoration for the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre was shut down by Zoom at the request of the Chinese government this June.Concerns over rising Chinese aggression pervade academia and geopolitics. Indeed, for China, where universities are governed by the state, there seems to be little difference between the ascent of China the global power and China the academic powerhouse. As such, China's tense international relations with other nations have been felt at the university-level, as evidenced by Chinese meddling that has targeted, for political gain, Chinese university students in the U.S. and abroad.Despite U.S.-China hostility, both Harvard and China certainly benefit from their interactions. For Harvard - for us - it is clearly useful to build ties and familiarity with the most populous country on Earth; additionally, a strong working relationship can enable international research efforts. The work done by the Harvard-Yenching Institute, the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies, the Harvard Asia Center, and the Harvard China Fund to critically understand and engage China - politics, society, history and people - gives testament to the benefits of constructive engagement.However, when dealing with an autocratic regime with a history of human rights abuses and disregard for academic freedom, it's been difficult for Harvard to maintain its so-called "foreign policy [of] Veritas." Without a doubt, the Chinese academic system is strictly controlled by the state. There are seven topics that are banned on campuses in China, and professors have been wrongfully detained for their political views. How, then, should Harvard evaluate and maintain its relationship with China, such that it does not become complicit in China's attack on rights and freedoms?Previously, Harvard has attempted to avoid political controversies, claiming that the University's express goal will always be the advancement of research and other academic pursuits. But if the University compromises on academic freedom out of the desire to promote collaboration and avoid embarrassing its counterpart, it will no longer deserve the motto of Veritas. The Crimson reported a dangerous precedent earlier this year, when Teng Biao, a Chinese dissident and visiting scholar at Harvard, was asked by an administrator to postpone his talk for fear of offending China and "harm[ing] Harvard activity there".Academic freedom - the ability to, out of a desire for truth and knowledge, probe unwelcome topics and challenge prevailing narratives and governments - is a powerful ideal that, unfortunately, can be easily undermined. At Harvard (unlike some peer institutions around the world), academic freedom has not been publicly challenged by the Chinese government, but, as evident from the treatment of Teng's event, the chilling effect of self-censorship can be challenging enough in itself.As Harvard stands at the forefront of the international academic world, it must do its part and uphold academic freedom around the globe. Harvard cannot simply stand idly-by, cherry picking when to promote knowledge and when to allow suppression. To stand true to the principle of Veritas, it should ensure that, within its abilities, students and academics everywhere may learn, teach and research without duress and retribution, or the fear of it. This means substantively and symbolically standing up against all attacks on academic freedom, whether it be from foreign countries or domestic xenophobia and nationalism. There are good examples of this work, such as the Scholar-at-Risk program and the University's legal rebuke against the federal government's barring of international students; Harvard just has to steadfastly commit to its beautiful rhetoric.This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board. It is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings.

GROTHMAN NEWSLETTER- CHINA TASK FORCE | OCTOBER 24, 2020States News ServiceOctober 24, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1006 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of Wisconsin Rep. Glenn Grothman:Task ForceFrom 1947-1991, the United States was locked in a battle of wills with the Soviet Union. The Cold War defined a generation because Americans were united in our stance against communism. Though the Cold War technically ended in 1991 and the Soviet Union broke apart, the threat of communism still exists.In 2020, the United States faces a new communist threat: China. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was actually founded a year before the Soviet Union and their longevity is due largely to their isolationist foreign policy. But, China isn't sticking to that plan anymore under leader Xi Jinping. Xi has seen an opportunity to take the world's most populous country from a largely agrarian economy to an international force. For example, the U.S. imports vast amounts of pharmaceuticals manufactured in China, which poses a risk to national security. That is why I have cosponsored the Medical Supply Chain Security Act, to bring critical drug manufacturing back to America.Unfortunately, for the citizens of China and the rest of the world, the Xi Jinping regime and the Chinese government are communist, so they have expanded their reach through many of the same tactics employed in other totalitarian states. Communism does not create a prosperous nation, so in order to stay in power, communists have to force loyalty. Not only did China usurp Hong Kong's authority, leading to protests this year and last, but we have also uncovered that China is rounding up ethnic minorities, like Uighur Muslims, and sending them to concentration camps.China is also using modern technology to manipulate currency and steal intellectual property. On September 25, 2015, Xi met with President Obama in the White House Rose Garden, where our two countries agreed that neither would conduct or support theft of intellectual property. That promise was not kept, as it is estimated that the U.S. could be losing up to $600 billion every year due to Chinese hackers stealing trade secrets from the United States.The threat posed by China cannot go ignored any longer. That is why House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy organized the China Task Force, which has produced a policy report on ways China is cheating the system and what the U.S. can do to protect our people by holding China accountable. I will also note that while no House Democrats were interested in contributing to this report, most of the recommendations made are based on policies that already have bipartisan support. You can read the full report by clicking here.I am not giving you this information to alarm you, but you should be aware of news that the mainstream media does not cover. China has been a growing threat for years and will continue to act in bad faith unless China is reprimanded for its treachery. The China Task Force and the China Task Force Act, which is a bill that would enact policies from the report, are long overdue. One of the most important jobs of the federal government is to keep you safe and secure and it is time for Congress to correct the wrongs China is committing against the American economy.Good Governance and AccountabilityOne complaint I hear often from residents of the Sixth District is that Washington, DC is has too many unelected bureaucrats making decisions that impact Americans throughout the country. Many of these bureaucrats in federal agencies hold massive amounts of power, do not change with new Presidential administrations and are not held accountable because it is extremely difficult to remove them if they are bad at their job.Since President Trump was sworn into office in 2017, he has shown his willingness to improve the way Washington, DC works. This week, he reaffirmed his commitment by announcing an executive order that will make it easier to hold these bureaucrats accountable and remove them if they are underperforming. This is common sense, if someone is no longer able to do their job, they should not continue to underperform and collect paychecks, which for these bureaucrats is often well over $100,000 per year.I am accountable to you, the residents of Wisconsin's Sixth Congressional District. I keep your interests in mind and fight for them every day. We need to create the same drive within government agencies, and this executive order is a tremendous step in the right direction.Read more here.Weekly RoundupTuesday was Pro-Life Day of Silent Solidarity, where we stood with the unborn children that have had their voices stolen from them by staying silent. Unborn humans have rights, too. Let's acknowledge and protect them.Thank you to the Wisconsin Hemp Alliance for giving me a tour of J.A. Farm in Maribel. I was also honored to be recognized as "Hemp Hero" for my work to legalize industrial hemp in Wisconsin and nationwide.This week is National Forest Products Week. The forest industry has taken steps to preserve the health of our forests, like planting more trees than they use. Today, companies like Kimberly Clark Corp. in Neenah utilize these vital forest goods in their products, such as tissues and diapers.Thanks to the National Federation of Independent Business for presenting me the "Guardian of Small Business" award for my work in Congress to support small businesses and enable them to grow, including my votes for the Paycheck Protection Program, which has kept Wisconsin Working.Congratulations to Ian Sieniawski of Beaver Dam for earning the rank of Eagle Scout!Contact MeAs your Congressman, I'm here to serve you. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to reach out to my offices in Fond du Lac and Washington. If you enjoyed this newsletter be sure to forward it to your family and friends so they can stay informed on what I'm doing in Washington and the Sixth District.You can also stay up-to-the-minute by following me on Facebook (Congressman Glenn Grothman), Twitter (@RepGrothman) and Instagram (@RepGlennGrothman).Sincerely,Glenn GrothmanMember of CongressLoad-Date: October 24, 2020End of Document

China launches global veto data protection plan to 'apps' in US and IndiaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 8, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 445 wordsBodyChina will launch a global data security initiative, Asian foreign minister Wang Yi announced today, following the latest U.S. and Indian vetoes on Chinese mobile applications.In a speech given during a cybersecurity forum in Beijing, the Chinese chancellor promised that Beijing will not ask Chinese companies to provide them with data obtained abroad, something that would violate the laws of other countries.In recent weeks, the United States has announced vetoes to WeChat and TikTok, two of the most popular social networks that have developed in China, because of their suspicions that user data is shared with the Chinese government, something that would jeopardize national security.He had previously alluded to similar reasons to justify his veto on Chinese technology company Huawei, which he accuses of having ties to Chinese intelligence.For its part, India has gone further and banned almost 180 Chinese-origin 'apps' as part of the border tensions facing both Asian powers.Wang claimed, in reference to the US initiative to "clean up" its Chinese-influenced networks, that acts of "harassment" of countries that are "using security as a pretext to hunt down companies from other countries that have a competitive advantage" are rejected.According to the Chancellor, the Chinese plan will ask countries to join the initiative to oppose cyber activities that use data to undermine the national security and public interests of other countries.Opposition to "mass surveillance against other countries" and national companies will also be called upon not to store data generated and obtained abroad in their home nations.Under this initiative, the head of Chinese diplomacy assured, technology companies will not be able to install "backdoors" or services to illegally obtain user data or to control and manipulate their devices, or take advantage of citizens' dependence on their products.Finally, Wang called on countries to respect the "sovereignty, jurisdiction and governance of data from other countries."With regard to some of these issues, it should be recalled that Beijing rejects complaints by the U.S. or India and has always argued that Chinese companies operating in other countries respect local laws, while veto-affected companies, such as TikTok or Huawei, have repeatedly denied that they share data with the Chinese government.Indeed, when China has been accused of orchestrating cyberattacks against the United States, its response has been precisely to assert that Washington is the one behind such offensives and that it is the U.S. that launches surveillance campaigns against governments, businesses, or individuals from other countries.Load-Date: September 9, 2020End of Document

US warned Nevada not to use Chinese COVID tests from UAEAssociated Press State & LocalOctober 15, 2020 Thursday 6:10 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWS; STATE AND REGIONALLength: 1963 wordsByline: JON GAMBRELL and MICHELLE L. PRICE, Associated PressDateline: DUBAI, United Arab Emirates BodyDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — U.S. diplomats and security officials privately warned the state of Nevada not to use Chinese-made coronavirus test kits donated by the United Arab Emirates over concerns about patient privacy, test accuracy and Chinese government involvement, documents obtained by The Associated Press show.The documents illustrate how the U.S. government actively — if quietly — tried to keep the state out of a project involving the Chinese firm BGI Group, which is the world’s largest genetic sequencing company and which has expanded its reach during the coronavirus pandemic.U.S. intelligence agencies have warned that foreign powers like China could exploit samples to discover the medical history, illnesses or genetic traits of test takers, though they have not offered any public evidence. Internal emails and documents obtained by the AP from the Nevada governor’s office through a public records request show U.S. authorities expressing such concerns specifically about BGI.“I hope the Nevada COVID-19 task force leadership is aware of this so they can make an educated decision and know some of the U.S. Government’s concerns,” William Puff, a Homeland Security regional attaché at the U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi, wrote in an email forwarded to Nevada officials.The warnings from the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department led the office of Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak in April to direct a Nevada hospital not to use any of the donated 250,000 test kits as officials turned down an offered laboratory deal.Geopolitics could play a role in the U.S. warning. President Donald Trump and his administration have been locked in a trade war with China and also have actively lobbied its allies not to use telecommunication equipment from Chinese firm Huawei, for instance, citing security concerns.The donation offer to Nevada also involved a shadowy Emirati company called Group 42, which partnered with Shenzhen-based BGI to create a rapid-testing system in the United Arab Emirates. G42 and government officials in the UAE did not respond to multiple requests for comment.In response to queries from the AP, BGI said in an email that G42 made the donation to Nevada on its own without BGI’s knowledge and that BGI never had direct contact with the state. BGI’s COVID-19 tests have approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use on an emergency basis and are used in some labs in the United States — but “BGI has no access to either patient samples or patient data,” it said.“BGI Group takes all aspects of patient data protection, privacy and ethics extremely seriously, and is committed to full compliance with all applicable regulations in the countries in which it operates,” the company said.___In April, the UAE announced its interest in donating an estimated $20 million worth of coronavirus testing kits to Nevada.The unusual offer came at a time when Nevada, like other states, were in a mad scramble amid mounting COVID-19 cases and a shortage of test kits. Nevada had shut down the Las Vegas casinos that power the state’s economy as it rushed to set up temporary hospitals, stockpile ventilators and assemble test kits.The UAE’s oil-fueled sovereign wealth funds and state-owned enterprises long have eyed Las Vegas as an investment opportunity. In its biggest investment, a state-owned Dubai firm partnered with MGM Resorts to build Las Vegas’ $9.2 billion multi-resort CityCenter development.Former MGM chairman Jim Murren heads Nevada’s COVID-19 Response, Relief and Recovery Task Force, appointed by Sisolak as part of a public-private partnership to seek funding and aid for the state.In late March, Murren forwarded to the governor’s office an email from Peng Xiao, the CEO of G42, pitching his company’s help. Murren wrote that the Emiratis were making the offer “both as a public service and because they see this as a future investment opportunity for them.”“They have unlimited capital and would be incredibly flexible on terms- I will handle that part,” he wrote.Murren told the AP that the initial G42 proposal was to set up a “turnkey” high-capacity lab processing COVID-19 tests.G42 and BGI partnered to create a similar lab in Abu Dhabi in March, part of a mass testing campaign in the Emirates that has conducted over 11 million tests in a nation of 9 million people.Along with its sale of tests, BGI has expanded into multiple countries by offering such turnkey labs, which it says can analyze 10,000 to 50,000 tests a day. It has set up such labs in multiple Chinese cities and in countries like Angola, Australia, Brunei, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, Serbia and Togo. Those labs use BGI equipment, which the U.S. government fears could be a means of spying by the Chinese government.The proposed lab in Nevada would rapidly process samples from polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, tests. Those genetic tests, using long cotton swabs that collect samples from deep inside a person’s nose and throat, detect an active case of the coronavirus.Days after G42 announced its aid to Nevada, the U.S. government broached its concerns with the state.In an email sent to Nevada officials on April 20, Puff, the Homeland Security attaché, alleged without offering evidence that G42\u2032s tests were “closer to 60% accurate” rather than the 90% claimed by the firm. BGI long has maintained its PCR tests have high accuracy, though factors like “the sampling process, storage and transportation of samples” can affect results.Puff also raised concerns about the potential risks of Americans sharing medical samples with BGI.“The embassy has concerns with G42’s relationship with the Chinese government and BGI, and patient privacy concerns,” Puff wrote. “The guidance we received from the U.S. Department of State is we should decline testing from G42.”Asked for comment by the AP, Puff said: “I think it’s probably best I don’t.”The same day, the Nevada governor’s chief of staff, Michelle White, emailed the University Medical Center, which received the G42 supplies.“Based on the information communicated to me by Homeland Security, we highly recommend that you discontinue these tests and any usage of testing equipment immediately,” she wrote.Sisolak’s office did not respond to phone and email messages from the AP seeking comment. Murren said state health officials ultimately decided they wanted to build their own high-capacity lab.The University Medical Center used 20,000 specimen collection kits offered by G42, which are comprised of nasal swabs and tubes to store samples, spokesman Scott Kerbs said. UMC did not use the donated 250,000 analysis kits because they were “not compliant with UMC’s laboratory technology,” he said.Kerbs said the collection kits “helped us to support local testing at a time when specimen collection materials were scarce in our community.” He did not respond to questions from AP about the warnings. “UMC always appreciates the generosity of donors,” he said.Since then, the casinos, along with much of Nevada’s shuttered economy, have reopened. Coronavirus testing now is widely available. Nevada has now performed more than 1.1 million tests for COVID-19 and has reported more than 85,000 cases and 1,600 deaths.Notably, even as U.S. authorities warned Nevada, they did not alert the 75,000 Americans living in the United Arab Emirates about any concerns over the BGI tests used by the Emirati firm, even though the same tests are used widely in the country. The UAE insists all genetic data is kept private and is not shared with BGI.The State Department told the AP that it shares information to Americans abroad “regarding safety and security threats that might affect them. ... In this case, the Department did not deem the use of BGI COVID-19 tests to be a threat to safety.”___The push to convince Nevada not to use the BGI tests comes amid the increasingly antagonistic relationship between the U.S. and China under the Trump administration that has witnessed an ongoing trade war and the expulsions of diplomats and journalists.U.S. intelligence agencies worry China’s genetic research could provide it a way to spy on or leverage American sources.In May, the U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center issued a warning to state health officials about “potential threats posed by foreign powers in connection with COVID tests.” It did not specify BGI, though it did link to a news report on Israel’s largest health care plan declining to work with BGI.In June, The Washington Post reported that California’s health department decided to steer clear of offers by BGI and G42 to provide testing and test lab facilities. The report said the decision was taken on the advice of the state’s coronavirus test task force advisers, in part because of concerns over China gaining access to private patient information.The U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi quietly declined an offer by the Emirati government to conduct free coronavirus testing of its diplomats because of concerns about Chinese involvement. It did not publicize that decision. The UAE also is home to some 5,000 American troops and Dubai’s Jebel Ali port, the U.S. Navy’s busiest port of call outside of the U.S.Efforts by the United Arab Emirates — a hereditarily ruled country where political parties and unions remain illegal — to fight the pandemic have renewed concerns about its mass surveillance programs.Officials at G42 have refused to identify who owns the company, though many suspect it links back to Abu Dhabi’s ruling family.G42’s CEO, Peng Xiao, previously ran Abu Dhabi-based firm DarkMatter’s “big data” application, which could pool hours of surveillance video to track anyone. DarkMatter’s hiring of former CIA and National Security Agency analysts has raised concerns, especially as the UAE has harassed and imprisoned human rights activists.According to the Nevada emails, among G42’s marketing and communications staff is Giacomo Ziani, who told the AP in January he was the co-creator of a video and voice calling app suspected of being a spying tool of the UAE — though he denied the accusation. Ziani did not answer requests for comment.BGI formed in 1999 as a state-backed lab to work on the Human Genome Project. It later became a private company and has found itself as a foremost force among companies worldwide in coronavirus testing.China's ruling Communist Party hopes companies like BGI and Huawei will boost the country into becoming a global technology leader.In its email to the AP, BGI said it is not owned or funded by the Chinese government and “has no government capital.” A U.S. Trade Office report in 2018 said the company has “evident links to the government” as its leadership includes individuals who previously held positions in the Chinese government and Communist Party.Two BGI subsidiaries have been sanctioned by the U.S. Commerce Department for allegedly “conducting genetic analyses used to further the repression of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities” in China. BGI said one subsidiary had done no business while the other was not involved in work that “includes personally identifiable information or violations of privacy or human rights.”When asked about the perceived danger from China’s influence in the Nevada testing kit offer, the State Department referenced a February speech given by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.“What China does in Topeka and Sacramento reverberates in Washington, in Beijing and far beyond,” Pompeo said then. “Competition with China is happening. It’s happening in your state.”___Price reported from Las Vegas. Associated Press writer Dake Kang in Beijing contributed to this report.___Follow Jon Gambrell and Michelle L.

DISNEY'S MULAN CREDITS THANKING XINJIANG SLAMMED AS CORPORATE 'KOWTOWING' TO CHINAStates News ServiceSeptember 8, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1126 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Disney's decision to thank entities associated with the persecution of Uyghurs in northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) in the credits of its new film "Mulan" is an "unforgivable" example of corporate "kowtowing" to the Chinese state, critics said Tuesday.Disney released its live-action version of the popular 1998 animated film about a young woman who pretends to be a man so that she can join the military on behalf of her sick father on its streaming platform Disney+ over the weekend.In the credits of the long-awaited remake, the company thanks several entities known to have contributed to Beijing's repressive rule in the XUAR, where authorities are believed to have held up to 1.8 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in a vast network of internment camps since April 2017.Among those thanked in the credits are the Chinese Communist Party's propaganda commission in the XUAR, which has sought to justify the camps as voluntary "vocational centers," despite reporting by RFA's Uyghur Service which has found that detainees are mostly held against their will in poor conditions, where they are forced to endure inhumane treatment and political indoctrination.Disney also thanked the Turpan branch of the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau, which in July was sanctioned by the Trump administration for its role in abuses in the region.Turpan, where the film was shot in part, is a prefecture-level city in eastern Xinjiang whose population of around 650,000 people is some 75 percent Uyghur. The ancient Silk Road city is known as being one of the earliest to have rolled out a campaign of "transformation through education" of Muslims, beginning in August 2013.Mulan had already courted controversy after its star, Liu Yifei, made comments in August last year supporting Hong Kong's police amid criticism of their use of force against pro-democracy demonstrators, prompting calls for a boycott.Social media users, including some U.S. lawmakers, were quick to condemn Disney on Monday for shooting the film in the XUAR, furthering calls to avoid it through a campaign using the hashtag #boycottMulan.German researcher Adrian Zenz, who authored a June 29 report about a dramatic increase in recent years in the number of forced sterilizations and abortions targeting Uyghurs that he believes may amount to a government-led campaign of genocide under United Nations definitions, called Disney's actions "a complete kowtowing of Western capitalism before the Chinese state.""This is a really big deal because Disney is publicly thanking a Xinjiang security agency and their propaganda department and that's just absolutely incredible given everyone's public knowledge of the situation in Xinjiang," he told RFA."A company who is so large and has a dedicated publicity department would absolutely have been aware of developments reported by mainstream international media."'Normalization of genocide'Dolkun Isa, head of the Munich-based World Uyghur Congress exile group, called Disney's decision to thank the entities in Turpan "unforgivable," noting that the area is home to Dabanchenone of the XUAR's largest internment camps with an estimated 114,000 detaineesas well as several other camps."We demand that Disney immediately correct its erroneous actions and apologize to the Uyghur people and the international community, and vow that it will never repeat such mistakes again," he told RFA.The Washington-based Campaign for Uyghurs (CFU) exile group issued a statement Tuesday saying it was "appalled by the latest revelation of a Western corporation that not only ignores China's genocide, but rather directly profits off of it.""A Disney movie being filmed in the same location where millions of Uyghurs are imprisoned, tortured, and killed based on their ethnic identity, is deeply disturbing," said CFU executive director Rushan Abbas."This is normalization of genocide, and Disney must end the practice of profiting off of this murderous Chinese regime."Writer Ma Jian told RFA that Disney's collaboration with the Xinjiang authorities took place after the camps had been widely exposed and there were many camps near filming locations."The concentration camps had already been built, and the camera team passed by and thanked them," Ma said. "This is indeed a disgusting thing.""While you are watching this movie, there are still many people who've lost their freedom and are in concentration camps," he added.Disney has yet to issue a statement over its decision to film in Xinjiang.'Sway' over HollywoodThe company angered Beijing over its support for the 1997 film Kundun, which is seen as sympathetic with Tibet's exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, leading to a delay in the release of the original animated Mulan film in China the following year.Chinese officials only greenlit the release in February 1999 after a series of concessions by Disney, including an announcement later that year that it would be building a theme park in Hong Kong.China has long restricted access to films and other content that has portrayed Beijing's rule in a critical light.Last month, PEN America said in a report that Hollywood studios that once spotlighted the Tibetan cause now censor their movies to appease the Chinese government."The Chinese Communist Party, in fact, holds major sway over whether a Hollywood movie will be profitable or notand studio executives know it," the organization said."The result is a system in which Beijing bureaucrats can demand changes to Hollywood moviesor expect Hollywood insiders to anticipate and make these changes, unpromptedwithout any significant hue or cry over such censorship."The revelations about Disney's work in the XUAR come less than a month after American sports broadcaster ESPN published an in-depth investigative report on the NBA's business dealings in region.The report focused in particular on a training academy opened by the NBA in the XUAR capital Urumqi in 2016, shortly before the buildout of the internment camp network, raising difficult questions about the league's knowledge of the local human rights situation and, in turn, the ethics of their operations there.Zenz said that the timing of reports about Disney's dealings in the XUAR "couldn't be more not only unfortunate, but inappropriate.""My message to Disney and Hollywood and other corporations is that the Western public does not accept profiteering in the shadow of concentration camps," he said. "It is unacceptable and will lead to a major reputational loss."Reported by Adile Ablet and Alim Seytoff for RFA's Uyghur Service, and by Ng Yik-tung for the Cantonese Service.

Conversations about TikTok agreements are entangled by the fate of the application's algorithmsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 2, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 877 wordsBodyTalks about agreements for TikTok's U.S. operations have run into an inconvenience on the question of whether the central algorithms of the application can be included as part of them, according to people familiar with the matter.The algorithms, which determine the videos that serve users and are considered TikTok's secret sauce, were considered part of the agreement negotiations until Friday, when the Chinese government issued new export restrictions on artificial intelligence technology, according to people familiar with the matter.Now, both sides are trying to find out if the order means the algorithms need the Chinese government's approval for transfer and, if so, whether Beijing would approve it. The complexity involved has reduced the chances of a deal being completed soon.TikTok's parent company, ByteDance Ltd., has said it would comply with the Chinese government's order and is seeking clarity from Beijing on how to proceed with a sale if the new restrictions apply to its algorithms, some of the people said.For bidders, the idea of buying TikTok without the algorithms completely changes the perspective of what companies are asking for, explained other people familiar with the situation. They believe that a large part of TikTok's value is in the suggestion algorithms that keep users glued to the app.A person close to the conversations compared TikTok without his algorithms to an elegant car with a cheap engine. A different person close to the bidders stated that not getting the algorithms would be a surprise and was skeptical that the agreement would take place without them.Other people have suggested that one of the suitors could still buy TikTok for their users and develop new algorithms for the app.The topic highlights how participants in the high-profile talks of the agreement are in the midst of a global tug-of-war between two superpowers that have issued strict demands.Two major groups now compete to buy part of TikTok: Microsoft Corp. has partnered with Walmart Inc., and Oracle Corp. has partnered with some of ByteDance's investors, including Sequoia Capital, General Atlantic and Coatue Management LLC.ByteDance is asking for $30 billion for TikTok's U.S. operations, The Wall Street Journal reported, although valuation talks were smooth and continued until the end of last week.The Trump administration ordered the Chinese company to remove U.S. operations from the platform in mid-September or to shut down the U.S. market altogether. The administration has cited concerns about censorship and data security as reasons to force the sale.Chinese commentators have described the Trump administration's demand as an attempt by the U.S. government to appropriate Chinese technology in a forced sale. Beijing retaliated on Friday, when the Chinese government added content recommendation technology to its list of export restrictions.The addition was specifically to address TikTok's possible sale of its core technology to an American company, people familiar with government thinking noted.TikTok has soared in popularity in the U.S. in recent years, and recently reached 100 million usersfrom about $11 million in early 2018, the company said. Industry analysts attribute some of the application's growth to a powerful central algorithm that is designed to quickly recommend different types of content to people according to their preferences.Eugene Wei, a San Francisco-based startup investor and former technology executive, said TikTok's success is a direct result of ByteDance's mastery of artificial intelligence. Through a process known as deep learning, ByteDance has trained its algorithms to deliver highly personalized content.The platform serves users new videos one by one, measures how they interact with videos and then sends that data to the algorithm. This allows the system to deliver videos that each user is likely to find attractive."When you look at TikTok, TikTok looks at you," said Wei, who has worked at Oculus of Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. "To see it simply as a novel meme video app for kids is to lose what its much greater disruptive potential is."One of those familiar with Beijing's thinking stated that the goal of the new restrictions is to delay the agreement to allow the Chinese government to have a voice, as well as to subject it to a level of scrutiny by the Chinese government similar to that imposed by the U.S. Foreign Investment Committee. The U.S. Treasury Department panel has forced a number of Chinese acquisitions to be undone for national security reasons and has examined TikTok.China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian answered a question about a possible sale of TikTok at a regular press conference monday accusing the United States of using "political manipulation and economic intimidation tactics against non-U.S. companies."Retaining the central algorithm would not necessarily mean the end of TikTok's U.S. operations, as software engineers could still rebuild it using TikTok user data as a current training dataset, according to Wei. But that process could take time and could lead to the app losing users to its rivals, he said.Instagram by Facebook Inc. recently introduced a service called Reels that copies many of TikTok's core features.Load-Date: September 3, 2020End of Document

Philippine Army minimizes risks of Chinese espionageCE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 13, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 314 wordsBodyMANILA, Philippines (AP) — The head of the Philippine military said Tuesday that there is virtually no risk that towers and equipment that a Chinese government-backed telecommunications company will set up in Philippine military camps can be used for espionage.Critics and some lawmakers have expressed concern that China may spy on the Philippines through the communications team of Dito Telecommunity Corp.—a Filipino company in which China Telecom in Beijing has a 40% financial stake—that will settle in military camps, given the territorial disputes of both Asian neighbors in the South China Sea.General Gilbert Gapay said installing Dito's towers and equipment in the camps would allow the military to better monitor their operations.Dito Telecommunity Corp. was accepted by the Philippine government as the third leading player in the local telecommunications industry. The company is controlled by Filipino businessman Dennis Uy, a supporter of President Rodrigo Duterte, who has long complained about poor internet connections and cellular services in the country.The Philippines is an ally of the United States through treaties. U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has urged allied governments to exclude Chinese companies such as telecom giant Huawei Technologies Ltd., which Washington sees as a security risk, at a time when many countries are updating their cell phone technologies to the so-called Fifth Generation or 5G.Chinese officials have accused Washington of discrediting and oppressing Chinese companies without presenting any evidence.Dito is negotiating the installation of communication towers and equipment at 22 sites in a proposal that the army will closely examine, Gapay said. The other two large Philippine telecommunications companies have installed towers and equipment in military areas after passing the same military overha review, he added.Load-Date: October 14, 2020End of Document

China Calls Claims Of Forced Uighur Sterilizations 'Fabrication'The Daily CallerOctober 3, 2020 Saturday 12:28 AM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc.

China is firmly opposed to such practice,” the statement said.The unnamed spokesperson denied allegations that China sterilizes its Uighur Muslim population against their will, according to the statement.“Today, a handful of US politicians told more lies. The so-called 'forced sterilization to Uygurs' is a shear fabrication [sic],” the statement said.The spokesperson claimed the Uighur Muslim population in Xinjiang grew betwee  2010 to 2018 in comparison to the Xinjiang's “average population growth” and the Han people's population growth. .@CHN_UN_NY responds to @BetsyDeVosED and @SecPompeo remarks on 25th anniversary of landmark statement on women and gender equality, accuses them of “fabricating lies against #China and creating political confrontation.”#UNGA #GenerationEquality pic.twitter.com/rwlpepGzwi - Michelle Nichols (@michellenichols) October 2, 2020“In the US, however, sexual and racial discrimination makes the situation extremely difficult for women of ethnic minorities. 40% of African-American women and 46% of Hispanic-American women work in low-wage jobs.

Giri: China's pursuit of global domination is larger and faster than we really thinkThe Observer: Case Western Reserve UniversitySeptember 25, 2020 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 820 wordsBodyThe last century or so has seen the United States dominate world proceedings and earn the title of the most powerful country on Earth. It has the largest economy, it involves itself in all sorts of conflicts and its elections are watched by millions around the world. Just this year, Black Lives Matter, which began as a domestic movement, caused the whole world to turn its head towards the U.S. But could this be about to change? China has been gaining ground on the U.S. in economic areas, but what about in global influence? Unfortunately for the U.S., Chinese global domination could be closer and stronger than we think.The U.S.'s path to global prominence can be largely attributed to its participation in a few key wars at the turn of the 19th century. Beginning with the Spanish-American War and extending into World War I, the United States established itself as a military power. It also began exercising that power more frequently, taking over islands scattered across the globe that had once been dominated by Spain.World War II only added to the U.S. stature as a global power, as it not only helped turn the tide against the Axis powers, but were also primary actors in the establishment of numerous new organizations and treaties, including the United Nations.  Now when we compare this to today's China, one could conclude that it provides no threat as no wars or annexes of this sort have taken place. However, their approach has been more subtle. A few years ago, a Chinese company leased an Australian port for 99 years, one that lies right next to a port containing U.S. Navy ships. China also controls ports, airfields and military bases ranging from the shores of Myanmar to Sri Lanka and Kenya. Even further out, China has also been eying the Panama Canal, which sits right on the doorsteps of America. Even the Oceanian island of Kiribati switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China after China built a fish processing plant on the island. This sort of pocketbook diplomacy has gradually allowed China to surround its major rivals in India and the U.S. This power becomes especially concerning when we consider the fact that these geo-political moves are not as publicized in the media as they should be.Although subtle, physical footprints like this can be easily traced and measured by rivals. Far more concerning are the advances in soft power the Chinese government has deployed in the last decade or so. The software and application industry, once dominated by U.S. firms, is slowly being taken over by their Chinese counterparts. Most recently, we saw the TikTok controversy, where the U.S. government looked to ban the Chinese-made app on the basis of data privacy concerns. Although one can question the timing of this announcement as it was suspiciously close to the election, there is some truth to the matter. The Chinese government adopted the National Intelligence Law in 2017, which mandates that citizens and companies assist with espionage efforts if they are requested by the government to do so. It must be noted that TikTok has vowed that it would not give up user data to the Chinese government under any circumstance. But what is to say they would refuse to cooperate if significant pressure was applied by the Chinese. Along with Tiktok, applications like Zoom, used by CEOs of the biggest companies of the world, are also built by China-based companies. Information from these platforms, if in the wrong hands, could spell devastation.It might be exaggerated to equate some Chinese entrepreneurs trying to make money to its government trying to take over the world; however, it would be naïve to suggest that the Chinese government does not have a grander scheme in mind. In 2012, when President Xi Jinping was first appointed president of the Chinese ruling party, he talked about his "Chinese Dream" where he wished for the "rejuvenation of the great Chinese state."So why should we care? Would it be so bad if global power was wrestled from America, a country who has had its fair share of power mishandlings? It is not really who the power is getting taken from, but rather who it is going to: The Communist Party of China, known notoriously for their control on the Chinese population through censorship of the internet and the keeping of a "social credit"-a metric that measures social conformity. Although the impacts on the U.S. may not be as severe as this, we can already see subtle examples of Chinese control seeping into the U.S. mainstream when athletes like Lebron James, who is sponsored by a Chinese firm, spoke against the Hong Kong protests or when Hollywood censors and curates its movies to satisfy strict Chinese censorship regulations. But not all is gloom, as the U.S. government is slowly waking up to this. Tiktok is being sold to Oracle, and hopefully this spells the beginning of some measures to counter China's plan for global upheaval.Load-Date: September 25, 2020End of Document

Trump is playing up China's threat to the 2020 election. But the evidence shows Russia is the real dangerCNN.comOctober 21, 2020 Wednesday 9:17 PM ESTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 2244 wordsByline: By Selina Wang, CNNBodyFor months, the Trump administration has been warning of the dangers of political interference by China in the US election.In April, President Trump said Beijing wanted him out of the White House. Attorney General William Barr and Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said Beijing was a bigger threat than Russia. And Bill Evanina, Director of the United States National Counterintelligence and Security Center, listed the ways that China had been "expanding its influence efforts."Yet, this week, China didn't feature in the latest warning about election interference.On Thursday, US national security officials accused Russian state-sponsored hackers of targeting state and local governments and of successfully stealing data in at least two instances. The allegations came shortly after officials accused Russia and Iran of using US voter registration information to undermine Trump's campaign.By contrast, very little evidence of China's alleged meddling has emerged, weeks before the vote. The China-backed foreign misinformation efforts that have been made public had a minuscule reach compared Russia's efforts before the 2016 US presidential vote."China studied what the Russians did in 2016 very closely," said cybersecurity expert James Lewis, a former foreign service officer at the Departments of State and Commerce. "They'd like to be able to do what the Russians do, but they aren't that good at it."However, experts predict that China's influence operations will become more formidable in the coming decades. They warn China will own more parts of the global telecommunications networks and export its system of censorship and propaganda to other governments.According to Clint Watts, a former FBI special agent and information warfare expert who testified before Congress about Russian interference in the 2016 US elections, Chinese influence operations "will be more prolific over time and successful over time because they can control the entire information environment, which is different from the Russians."In August, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman said China had never interfered in a US election and "had no interest to do that in the future."Russia's playbookRussia's use of disinformation dates back far before the last presidential election. The Soviet Union used the art of "dezinformatsiya" to forge documents, plant fake stories in the media to benefit Russian interests, and infiltrate activist groups during the Cold War. Those strategies came from the Tsarist era, when the secret police would fake materials to discredit enemies.The difference now, of course, is that those tactics have moved online.In 2014, the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a secretive technology company with close ties to the Kremlin, began using fake social media accounts and group pages to target US audiences around divisive issues in the lead up to the 2016 election, according to the Mueller report.The IRA bought troves of Facebook ads and flooded Twitter with posts that boosted Trump and denigrated Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, the report said. In mid-2014, employees from the IRA even traveled to the US to get information and photographs to use in their social media posts.Some IRA employees, posing as Americans, communicated with the Trump campaign to try to coordinate political activities, including political rallies. More than 1,000 employees reportedly worked from an office block in St. Petersburg to run the influence campaign -- with the goal of getting Trump elected to benefit Russian interests.Those tactics are still being used, but better disguised, now that the playbook has been publicized. A CNN investigation earlier this year found a network of social media accounts targeting the US that came from people in Ghana and Nigeria, working on behalf of Russia. This September, Facebook and Twitter announced the IRA created a fake progressive website called Peace Data that engaged with real Americans and even hired some Americans to write articles, which were then shared on different social media platforms.Using domestic tactics overseasFor a long time, China's online influence operations focused inward, using censorship and propaganda to control what information its citizens can see at home. A 2017 Harvard study estimated that the Chinese government produces 488 million fake social media posts a year to cheerlead the authorities and distract public attention from discussions critical of the regime. The study concluded that the Chinese government uses an enormous workforce of mostly government employees, contributing part time, to fabricate the posts.But as China's economic and political ambitions have grown, the country has increasingly applied domestic propaganda tactics to target global audiences -- ironically, using platforms it blocks at home, such as Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter.So far, this has been with limited success. Right now, China's disinformation efforts are "sloppy and get caught very easily," said Watts.While China has set up a vast censorship and propaganda apparatus at home, the country does not have as much practice manipulating foreign social media platforms. "They're used to playing on a field where they control the terrain," says Nimmo, of Graphika. "It's a steep learning curve."The pro-democracy protests that swept Hong Kong last year, however, appeared to have accelerated China's focus on global influence operations. As international news organizations reported on demonstrations in the city and protesters' demands for more civil liberties, Beijing launched a state-backed disinformation campaign about the protests on Western platforms.In August 2019, Facebook and Twitter removed accounts from China that sowed political discord and amplified messages to undermine the legitimacy of the protest movement, portraying demonstrators as violent, extreme and dangerous.One of the posts had an image of Hong Kong protesters next to ISIS fighters, with the text: "Even though the weapons are different, the outcome is the same!" The operation's use of automated accounts to spread disinformation and amplify divisive topics resembles Russia's tactics, according to Nick Monaco, an online disinformation expert and research director at the Institute of the Future.Some of Russia's strategies were also on display in the first public disclosures of Chinese influence operations pushing content about global issues that matter to China, such as the South China Sea, but also the 2020 US election.Facebook recently shut down more than 150 accounts from China that used fake profiles to pose as locals in countries they targeted. The accounts boosted their own content, managed Facebook pages, and liked and commented on other people's posts. Facebook said only a small amount of the overall activity was focused on the US, where the operation gained almost no following.According to Graphika, which worked with Facebook to analyze the misinformation, the group first became active in late 2016 by posting about Taiwan from a pro-Mainland position. In 2018, the operation began posting about the Philippines and Chinese influence in the region, as well as defending China's actions in the South China Sea.Activity around US politics only began in April 2019, when the operation started making Facebook profiles to pass as actual Americans on both sides of the aisle. For instance, "Kate Selina" was one of the fake profiles that posed as a conservative American, and shared posts criticizing Medicare-for-all and gun control policies. A liberal account posted that President Barack Obama "is my best president ever," while also sharing a meme of Trump with the words "nobody likes me" right next to his face.The network also created Facebook pages for various US presidential candidates, including one supporting former Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg. The page only had two members. The operation also created a Biden-Harris group that had around 1,400 members. The Trump group only attracted three followers. In contrast, leading up to the 2016 US Presidential election, some pages run by Russia's IRA attracted hundreds of thousands of followers each.According to Ben Nimmo, director of investigations at Graphika, which worked with Facebook to analyze the accounts, the US-focused part of the operation from China appeared "to be in the audience-building stage." The network did not push for one candidate over another. The purpose could have been to draw attention and build an audience in order to push pro-Beijing content to the groups in the future.Graphika estimated that the overall activity of the operation was limited, producing just 1.6 million interactions -- of which just a tiny fraction were related to the US -- between September 2016 and September 2020. In contrast, ahead of the 2016 Presidential elections, IRA-controlled Facebook accounts reached 126 million people, and the agency's Twitter accounts had tens of thousands of followers each, including high-profile political figures who retweeted its content, according to the report by special counsel Robert Mueller, released by the Department of Justice last year.China also faces another challenge: it is starting its influence operations in the West when social media platforms, law enforcement and independent researchers have increased efforts to detect fake activity. "China is coming to the game later, when defenses are a lot stronger," Nimmo said.Russia cares moreIf China's threat is less severe than Russia's, that's partly because in the past, it simply hasn't cared as much about US elections. The next president won't change Washington's bipartisan consensus to be tough on China.Russia's geopolitical ambitions, however, stand to benefit far more from a Trump reelection. Trump has helped advance the Kremlin's objectives: eroding solidarity with European allies, denying Russia's 2016 election interference, withdrawing from Syria, and bolstering Russia's position in Crimea and Ukraine.That sentiment is reflected in state media, with Russian outlets publishing significantly more English-language content about the presidential election than Chinese ones, according to analysis by the Foreign Policy Research Institute.Russia's narrative is also more divisive. It's been pushing predictions of widespread election rigging and fraud via mail-in-balloting, according to Watts, the former FBI special agent."Russia has a clear bridge to America. They have consistently communicated and connected with Americans to influence them and support policies and candidates favorable to them," Watts said. "China has no such aims. There's no presidential candidate -- not Biden or Trump -- especially post Covid, that's going to improve relations with China."Long-term threatsIn the long-term, what makes China a potentially greater threat than Russia is its involvement in the global communications infrastructure, and the software that sits atop of it. Over the past decade, Chinese state-owned or affiliated companies have built internet, television and phone networks for scores of foreign governments, especially in developing countries.Experts have cautioned that China could leave backdoors in those networks -- accusations the Chinese government has vehemently denied. "With the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) they will have surveillance, and with surveillance they can implement censorship," said Watts.More simply, as Beijing provides televisions with its state media channels across Africa and beyond, Chinese mobile phone companies put handsets in people's pockets, and the country's apps are installed on those phones, China has ever-greater access to people in the global south.China aims to reframe global opinion of the country, and according to Watts, China has more compelling global narrative to tell than Russia's approach of "degrading democracy worldwide and breaking up alliances" without offering a substitute. "China is going around and saying, 'Why democracy? Let's talk about meritocracy. Human rights? America isn't handling Covid, and it can't help its low-income people.'"Professor Titus Chen of the National Sun Yat-sen University in Taiwan expects that in the developing world, China's message will eventually become as accepted as information from established media.But in the West, Beijing's persuasion will be limited, he says."This is not a regime type or government that people in the world -- or at least the Western world -- want," Chen said. "So how do you spin it? It's quite a daunting task for a propaganda system."For both Russia and China, the job of fanning fake information and creating divisions in society has been made easy, by a sitting President who frequently tweets and says misleading things.The recent presidential debate between Biden and Trump, who pushed an avalanche of misinformation during a raging performance, helped bolster China's critique of US democracy. Afterwards, the editor of the Beijing-backed tabloid Global Times, wrote that: "Such a chaos at the top of US political reflects division, anxiety of US society and the accelerating loss of advantages of the US political division."For Watts, the biggest threats on election day will be domestic, not foreign."What could Russia or China do at this point that America is not already doing to itself?" Watts wrote in a 2020 report. "For Putin and Xi, it's easier to ride the American tide of democratic destruction than make the wave."Load-Date: October 23, 2020End of Document

U.N. General Assembly: Trump blames China, WHO for COVID-19 crisisUPISeptember 22, 2020 Tuesday 6:43 AM ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 782 wordsByline: DANIEL URIA&DON JACOBSON&DANIELLE HAYNESDateline: Sept. 22 BodyIn a recorded address Tuesday at the 75th U.N. General Assembly, U.S. President Donald Trump slammed China for its response to COVID-19 in the early weeks of the pandemic.Trump's taped remarks were broadcast on the first day of the assembly's General Debate, along with recorded addresses from other global leaders."The Chinese government and the World Health Organization, which is virtually controlled by China, falsely declared that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission," Trump said. "The United Nations must hold China accountable for their actions."China's U.N. ambassador, Zhang Jun, said his country's leadership "resolutely rejects the baseless accusations against China. Zhang introduced Chinese President Xi Jinping's pre-recorded statement to the U.N. General Assembly."The world is at a crossroads. At this moment, the world needs more solidarity and cooperation, but not confrontation," Zhang said.Again calling it the "China virus," Trump declared that the world's nations will "defeat" the pandemic and touted his administration's record in fighting the virus on a day when the U.S. death toll topped 200,000.The General Assembly is the first since Trump decided earlier this year to withdraw from WHO, the chief U.N. health agency.Xi called for global cooperation to defeat the pandemic and appeared to offer a less divisive tone than Trump."We will continue to narrow differences and resolve disputes with others through dialogue and negotiation," Xi said. "We will not seek to develop only ourselves or engage in zero sum game.This year's debate, like many other high-profile events in the COVID-19 era, will largely be held remotely.Preceding Trump's address, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the worsening relations between the United States and China hold the potential for a "new cold war.""We are moving in a very dangerous direction," he said. "Our world cannot afford a future where the two largest economies split the globe in a great fracture -- each with its own trade and financial rules and Internet and artificial intelligence capacities."Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan each delivered taped addresses immediately following Trump.Bolsonaro defended his government's record in protecting the Amazon rainforest, claiming his administration is the victim of "a brutal disinformation campaign."The Brazilian leader said the true goal of environmentalists is to "harm the government and Brazil itself."The remarks came as a record number of fires burned through the Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetlands.Erdogan called for "comprehensive and meaningful reforms" at the United Nations, including a restructuring to expand the Security Council beyond the five permanent, veto-holding members -- the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia.The COVID-19 pandemic has shown "how ineffective" the Security Council is set up, he said."Thus, we have once again seen the rightfulness of the 'the world is bigger than five' thesis, which I have been advocating for years from this rostrum."Russian President Vladimir Putin, in his address, called for stronger cooperation with WHO and promised his country's newly developed COVID-19 vaccine was safe and effective."We are proposing to hold an online high-level conference shortly for countries interested in cooperation in the development of anti-coronavirus vaccines," he said."We are ready to share experience and continue cooperating with all states and international entities, including in supplying the Russian vaccine, which has proved reliable, safe and effective, to other countries."Iranian President Hassan Rouhani focused much of his speech on his country's nuclear ambitions, rebuking the United States' decision to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions on Iran."Iran is not a bargaining chip in U.S. elections and domestic policy," Rouhani said. "Any U.S. administration after the upcoming elections will have no choice but to surrender to the resilience of the Iranian nation.Others scheduled to give remarks in Tuesday's early session were South Korean President Moon Jae-in and French President Emmanuel Macron.In all, 170 heads of state and government leaders will take part in the General Debate this week -- the most ever for the event. However, most will not travel to the U.N. headquarters in New York City amid 14-day quarantine regulations due to the pandemic.U.N. spokesman Stephan Dujarric estimated that about 200 people will be present in the hall during the speeches -- diplomats from all member states who will introduce the pre-recorded speeches.Load-Date: September 22, 2020End of Document

Q&A: What does banning TikTok and WeChat mean for users?Associated Press Financial WireSeptember 20, 2020 Sunday 12:18 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWSLength: 1155 wordsByline: MATT O'BRIEN and TALI ARBEL, AP Technology WritersBodyThe U.S. government is cracking down on the Chinese apps TikTok and WeChat, starting by barring them from app stores on Sunday.President Donald Trump has cited concerns about Chinese government snooping as his administration prepares to follow through on executive orders that could make it increasingly difficult, if not impossible, for Americans to use the apps.Trump has also floated a potential way out, at least for TikTok, which on Friday he called an “amazing company” that is “very, very popular.”Here are some questions and answers about the deal.WHEN DO THE BANS TAKE EFFECT?The order disallowing TikTok and WeChat from smartphone app stores takes effect Sunday, as do additional restrictions on the use of WeChat.A broader ban on the use of TikTok will follow on Nov. 12 unless its Chinese parent company ByteDance is able to persuade U.S. officials that it can resolve national security concerns. On Saturday, Trump said he has approved “in concept” a deal that would see the popular video-sharing app partner with Oracle and Walmart to become a U.S. company. Trump said the new company “will have nothing to do with China.” But the deal still needs to be finalized.WHAT ARE TIKTOK AND WECHAT?TikTok is a smartphone app for making and watching short videos that's popular with teens and young adults, with typical posts centered around lip syncing, dancing or making people laugh. TikTok says it has 100 million U.S. users and hundreds of millions globally. It has its own influencer culture, enabling people to make a living by posting videos on the service, and hosts ads from major U.S. companies.WeChat is a messaging-focused app that in the U.S. serves as a lifeline to friends, family, customers and business contacts in China. Its owner, Chinese tech giant Tencent, says it has more than a billion users, mostly in China, where it's an all-purpose app used for everything from texting to social media, cab-hailing and payments.WHAT DOES THE BAN MEAN FOR USERS?For WeChat users, the order won't prohibit individual users from sending texts or making payments. But it could throw a wrench into WeChat's operations and make it hard for the app to keeping running in the U.S. by blocking critical technical services provided by other companies.For TikTok users who've already downloaded the app, it should still work normally for now. Users, however, might be blocked from getting important app software updates that fix bugs and security vulnerabilities. Further restrictions echoing those targeting WeChat are set for Nov. 12.ARE THERE WORKAROUNDS?Maybe, though none are very good. It's possible to bypass the TikTok app to view the service on a web home screen, but users wouldn't be able to make videos — which could eventually mean fewer new American-made videos to watch.App users can try to use virtual private networks, or VPNs, to disguise their location and pretend they're in another country. But that raises additional security concerns, especially for users who go with a free or cheap VPN provider they haven't carefully vetted.Users can also use tricks to sidestep the Apple and Android app store process, but these also pose security risks.“If there's a software update, well, WeChat might stop working,” said Nicholas Weaver, a computer science lecturer at UC Berkeley. “If you don’t update your phone, it's a security risk. It puts users in an impossible position.”HAS THE U.S. BANNED PHONE APPS BEFORE?Not in this way, though such censorship is common in China, said Paul Bischoff, a consumer privacy expert.Bischoff said it's especially troubling because he has found no evidence that the Chinese government is actually using TikTok as a spying tool, though the advertising-fueled app sucks up personal data much like other social media platforms.“This is the first time we’ve ever banned an app through an executive order,” he said. “I wonder what sort of precedent that sets for other apps that the current administration sees as a threat or just doesn’t like."WHAT DO TIKTOK USERS THINK ABOUT IT?The way that TikTok personalizes what videos it shows to each user makes it hard to gauge what the userbase as a whole thinks of the U.S. government actions.But those who spoke with The Associated Press about the actions shared a mix of skepticism and annoyance.Carrie Berk, a 17-year-old college freshman in New York, said she’s not sure it will really happen.“I feel like I’ve done this a few times now," she said. "There’s been so many fake-outs where you see in the news it’s getting banned tomorrow” – though the official deadline has always been Sunday. She posted a video in early July about changing a phone’s settings to Canada so that TikTok could still work, and it’s gotten over 5 million views.WHY THE DELAYED TIKTOK BAN?Scheduling a total TikTok ban for Nov. 12 delays its effects on millions of American users until after the Nov. 3 presidential election, but it also leaves more time for ByteDance to finalize an arrangement that satisfies government officials.Trump said this summer he wants the app sold to a U.S. company that can protect U.S. users from Chinese government spying and censorship. ByteDance proposed an arrangement that lets the California database-software company Oracle manage the data of U.S. users and oversee the app's technology. But Saturday Trump said he has given his “blessing” to a proposed deal between TikTok, Oracle and WalMart that would leave TikTok under the control of the U.S. companies. But the deal still needs to be finalized.Elsa Kania, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security who focuses on technology and U.S.-China relations, said the administration's shifting rationales and haphazard approach set a bad precedent and criticized the immediate WeChat ban “given its importance as a means of communication and interpersonal engagement with China.”WHAT ARE TIKTOK AND WECHAT DOING ABOUT IT?TikTok and some of its employees have sued to stop the ban, saying it's unconstitutional. But the company has remained open to some kind of merger that would resolve U.S. government concerns about spying and censorship, even as it denies that it's a security threat.TikTok's interim U.S. leader, Vanessa Pappas, publicly sought help from rival Facebook on Friday, responding to a tweet from Adam Mosseri, the head of Facebook-owned Instagram, after he criticized a TikTok ban as bad for everyone.“This is a moment to put aside our competition and focus on core principles like freedom of expression and due process of law,” Pappas wrote.A group of WeChat users have also sued to stop the ban. A federal judge in California appeared sympathetic to WeChat users in a hearing Saturday but did not immediately issue a ruling on their request for an injunction against the government. The Justice Department said in a filing in that case that they would not target WeChat users with criminal or civil penalties for using the app for messaging.Load-Date: September 19, 2020End of Document

SINGAPOREAN NATIONAL SENTENCED TO 14 MONTHS IN PRISON FOR ACTING IN THE UNITED STATES AS AN ILLEGAL AGENT OF CHINESE INTELLIGENCEStates News ServiceOctober 9, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1070 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Department of Justice:Jun Wei Yeo, also known as Dickson Yeo, was sentenced today in federal court to 14 months in prison. Yeo pled guilty on July 24, 2020 to acting within the United States as an illegal agent of a foreign power without first notifying the Attorney General, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 951. The announcement was made by John G. Demers, Assistant Attorney General; Michael R. Sherwin, Acting United States Attorney for the District of Columbia; James A. Dawson, Acting Assistant Director in Charge of FBI Washington Field Office; Alan E. Kohler, Jr., Assistant Director of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division; and Deputy Assistant Secretary Ricardo Coln, Domestic OperationsDeputy Assistant Secretary Ricardo Coln, Domestic Operations.Yeo was sentenced by The Honorable Tanya S. Chutkan of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia."At the direction of the Government of the People's Republic of China, Yeo recruited Americans to provide information that he would pass back to his PRC handlers," said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers. "Yeo concealed his PRC affiliation from his recruits and, contrary to law, from the United States Government. This criminal conduct is part of the PRC's efforts to exploit the openness of American society by using agents who may appear innocuous, but who act upon taskings from a foreign government to obtain access and information.""This case serves as a reminder that China is using professional networking social media sites to target U.S. citizens with government security clearances, and to try to gain non-public and classified information. The threat is real, and we will prosecute foreign agents who exploit those platforms," said Michael R. Sherwin, Acting United States Attorney for the District of Columbia."Today we are reminded yet again of the Chinese government's aggressive attempts to gain knowledge and information about U.S. policy and government," said James A. Dawson, Acting Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI's Washington Field Office. "The FBI's warning is not new, but the message warrants repeating: the Chinese communist government is working to gain information and access by all means, including recruiting US-based individuals to provide classified and/or sensitive information. There is no doubt that if you are a former clearance holder, you are an ideal and vulnerable target because of your knowledge and access. If you believe you have been the target of a recruitment scheme, the FBI is here to help. We remain committed to rebuffing the Chinese government's attempts, and to protecting the American people, our ideas, and our national and economic security interests.""Jun Wei Yeo admittedly acted as an illegal agent of a foreign power by using various social media sites, such as a professional networking website and other social networking applications, to recruit Americans with access to sensitive government information. He identified their vulnerabilities, like dissatisfaction with work or financial difficulties, and offered money in exchange for information and written reports," said Alan E. Kohler Jr., Assistant Director of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division. "This is a sobering reminder that the U.S. needs to be clear-eyed about the scope of the Chinese government's ambition to manipulate Americans for their own nation's advancement; and, confronting this threat remains the FBI's top counterintelligence priority.""The close working relationship between the U.S. Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service, the FBI, and the U.S. Attorney's Office resulted in today's sentencing of Mr.Yeo before he could potentially harm the security of our country," said Deputy Assistant Secretary Ricardo Coln, Domestic Operations, U.S. Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service. "This was a great success by all of the agencies involved."As outlined in the Statement of Offense, Yeo began working with Chinese intelligence officers as early as 2015, initially targeting other Asian countries, but then focusing on the United States. In response to taskings from his Chinese intelligence contacts, Yeo worked to spot and assess Americans with access to valuable non-public information, including U.S. military and government employees with high-level security clearances. After Yeo identified American targets, he solicited them for non-public information and paid them to write reports. Yeo told these American targets that the reports were for clients in Asia, without revealing that they were in fact destined for the Chinese government.Yeo made use of various social media sites to carry out the taskings given to him by Chinese intelligence operatives. In 2018, Yeo created a fake consulting company that used the same name as a prominent U.S. consulting firm that conducts public and government relations, and Yeo posted job advertisements under that company name. Ninety percent of the resumes Yeo received in response were from U.S. military and government personnel with security clearances, and he passed resumes of interest to one of the Chinese intelligence operatives.Yeo also used a professional networking website that is focused on career and employment information to carry out the taskings he received from Chinese intelligence officials. Yeo used the professional networking website to find individuals with resumes and job descriptions suggesting that they would have access to valuable information. After he identified individuals worth targeting, Yeo followed guidance he received from Chinese intelligence operatives regarding how to recruit potential targets, including identifying their vulnerabilities, such as dissatisfaction with work or financial difficulties.The investigation into this matter was conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Washington Field Office and the U.S. Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Thomas N. Saunders and Erik M. Kenerson of the National Security Section of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, along with David Aaron of the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section of the National Security Division of the Department of Justice. If you suspect you have been the target of a recruitment scheme, contact your local FBI Field Office.Load-Date: October 10, 2020End of Document

MICHIGAN LAWMAKERS ADVANCE PLAN HOLDING CHINA FINANCIALLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR COVID-19 PANDEMICStates News ServiceSeptember 15, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 369 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: LANSING, MI BodyThe following information was released by the Michigan House of Representatives, the Republicans:The Michigan House Military, Veterans and Homeland Security Committee today approved a bipartisan plan authored by state Rep. Beau LaFave, of Iron Mountain, which would hold the communist Chinese government financially responsible for the pandemic they knowingly unleashed upon the state of Michigan, United States and world. The legislation passed mostly on a party-line vote, with only one Democrat voting in favor.House Bill 6025 would create the Coronavirus Responsibility Reimbursement Act and direct the Michigan Department of Treasury to determine the fiscal impact of the pandemic and send an invoice to the communist government of China. LaFave said the total fiscal impact would be calculated by adding Michigan's increase in unanticipated expenditures and decrease in anticipated revenue."The communist Chinese government needs to be held accountable for the global spread of COVID-19 period," LaFave said. "While there are still many unknowns surrounding COVID-19, what we do know is that China intentionally withheld critical information and facts about a novel infectious disease that was emerging within Wuhan Providence; that Chinese officials silenced those who were seeking to sound the alarms; that China downplayed the transmissibility and lethality of the virus; and that they allowed their own people to continue traveling around the world uninhibited. All of these decisions have led to the deaths of nearly 7,000 Michiganders whose lives could have been spared if China cared more about human life than its own worldwide image. It's also cost Michigan billions in taxpayer dollars and counting. There's no way to quantify the loss of human life no money would ever be enough. But we can add up our direct and indirect costs incurred because of their maleficence and demand them to foot the bill."The plan now heads to the House Appropriations Committee for further consideration.State Rep. Beau LaFave testifies Tuesday before the House Military, Veterans and Homeland Security Committee, which he chairs, in support of his plan holding China financially accountable for the COVID-19 pandemic.Load-Date: September 16, 2020End of Document

ByteDance applies for export licence in China in full negotiation by TikTokCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 24, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 426 wordsBodyBy Brenda GohSHANGHI, 24 Sep (Reuters) - ByteDance has applied for a technology export license in China while finalizing an agreement with Oracle Corp and Walmart Inc with which it hopes to avoid executing U.S. government plans to ban its application of TikTok video in the country for security reasons.The Beijing-based company submitted the application to the city's municipal trade office and is awaiting a decision, as reported Thursday in a statement on its online news platform Toutiao, in which it did not refer to the ongoing negotiations on its US operations.The application was filed one month after China first revised its list of technologies subject to export prohibitions or restrictions in 12 years, a measure that experts say gives the Chinese Government the opportunity to rule on any agreement around TikTok.ByteDance has said that its agreement with Oracle and Walmart will lead to the creation of an independent U.S. company and does not involve any technology transfer, although Oracle will be able to monitor TikTok's source code in the United States.He has also said that the agreement needs the approval of both China and the United States.However, the companies involved in the negotiation have made conflicting statements on the terms of the agreement reached with the White House, hesitating on their ultimate success.ByteDance said it will establish a US subsidiary called TikTok Global, which will control 80%.Oracle and WalMart, however, said majority ownership of TikTok Global would be in American hands, complying with an August 14 executive order from US President Donald Trump for which ByteDance should relinquish TikTok's property within 90 days.Chinese state media China Daily and Global Times said this week that they see no reason for China to approve the deal Oracle and Walmart said they have reached with ByteDance, saying it was based on "intimidation and extortion."TikTok's experience is "an example of a book of modern piracy and technological harassment in the United States," Chinese state news agency Xinhua said in an English commentary published Thursday, adding that Washington's fears about national security about TikTok are "nothing more than a cover.""It's time for other countries to see through TikTok's outrageous theatrical farce, know what's really at stake, and join hands to oppose these blatant thefts and maintain a fair global business environment," he said.(Information by Brenda Goh; edited by Himani Sarkar and Christopher Cushing; translated by Dario Fernandez in the writing of Gdansk)Load-Date: September 25, 2020End of Document

How Trump's WeChat ban could devastate the Chinese American communityThe Butler Collegian: Butler UniversitySeptember 30, 2020 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 1790 wordsBodyHow Trump's WeChat ban could devastate the Chinese American community• Opinion47 mins agoPopular app WeChat is one of the only platforms connecting those who live in mainland China to friends and family overseas. Photo courtesy of Mae-Mae Han.MAE-MAE HAN | STAFF REPORTER | mhan@butler.eduIn early August, Donald Trump signed an executive order that bans TikTok and WeChat, two mobile apps owned by different Chinese tech companies, which was to take effect on Sept. 20, 2020. The Trump administration cited concerns over national security, but for me - an Indianapolis-born Chinese American - it felt like Donny "Chinese virus" Trump was once again targeting the Chinese American community. While most of my peers have been worried about TikTok and what the nebulous guidelines of the executive order would entail for their memes, I have been worried about WeChat and whether the very infrastructure of the Chinese American community could collapse.WeChat is a social media app owned by Chinese company Tencent. It is arguably the most popular social media platform in mainland China, and its use is ubiquitous in the country, be it communicating with friends, group chats, paying for groceries, video calling family, logging into public WiFi or staying in touch with old classmates.My parents use WeChat daily to communicate with their family. Not only can they text, call and send voice messages, but they can also share photos and videos from their daily lives, like whatever we ate for dinner, my high school graduation or the birds that were outside our house.My mom's side of the family even had a group chat that I was in. Because of the Great Firewall, this app is the only means of communication I have with any of my family in China: in other words, it's the only way I can interact with any of my relatives beyond my parents and siblings, short of actually traveling to China. WeChat even allows me to stay engaged with my family when I am visiting them in China; in those circumstances that I do not have cell phone service, WeChat is the way I can make sure my aunt picks me up from the airport or otherwise avoid getting lost in a foreign country.The Trump administration may bring up concerns over national security and privacy from entities in mainland China, but Su-Mei Ooi, an associate professor of political science and peace and conflict studies, said she believes that one should be wary of Trump's rhetoric."It just feeds, I think, into this kind of image of China as threatening," Ooi said, warning against the Trump administration's xenophobia. "You can really fit [Trump's executive order] into this overall overarching narrative of China as a 'national security threat.'"Since a WeChat ban would so specifically harm Chinese Americans, Ooi also said she believes Trump is adhering to the conventional American belief of Asians as "perpetual foreigners"  - the stereotype that people of Asian descent are never truly American, like the pervasive Asian American experience of constantly being asked, "But where are you really from?" This xenophobic and racist belief incites an undue hysteria that Chinese immigrants or people with family in China are a "fifth column," or a group of people working for a foreign enemy. Ooi referenced President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066, an example of American anti-Asian xenophobia leading to Japanese Americans being forced into concentration camps."I think this may come from an insidious 'othering' of Chinese Americans in the questioning of their loyalty to the United States," she said.Along with its popularity in mainland China, WeChat is also essentially the only connection between people in mainland China and the outside world. This is a cold fact that is particularly poignant for Chinese Americans when the Chinese government's infamous "Great Firewall" prevents access to Google, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, Reddit, Discord, Whatsapp, Twitch, YouTube, Gmail and much, much more from inside mainland China.Thus, conventional means of communication and social media we would use in the United States are generally obsolete for interacting with people in China. Traditional phone calls are difficult to do since international calls can become expensive and require navigating a 12-hour time difference. Calling also does not match the level of communication that WeChat offers by being able to host group chats, to have instant messaging, to do video calls and to send photos and videos. Ooi said that the general trend from governments all over the world has been increased restrictions over internet freedom. It seems ironic that with this executive order, Trump emulates the very government he views as his rival. Meanwhile, it is ordinary people that must bear the weight of the repercussions.While WeChat has over a billion users total, it has a staggering number of active users in the United States alone - 19 million - including both Chinese nationals and U.S. nationals. That is approximately the entire population of Indiana and Illinois combined. A ban on WeChat could impact a large portion of those residing in the United States. Immigrant families can easily experience isolation, but WeChat offers an avenue for Chinese Americans to stay connected with their relatives in their mother country.In addition to family, Xiaoqing Liu, an associate professor of Chinese who immigrated from China about 20 years ago, also relies on WeChat to connect with old friends in China. "My old classmates began to include me in their [WeChat] groups," Liu said. "So it's good to find suddenly your old classmates 10, 20 years ago, and even in primary school students. So it really makes you feel like it's easier to get connected to these old friends, right?"Xiangyu Wang, a second-year pre-pharmacy major, is an international student from China, and he also uses WeChat to communicate with his parents and friends at home. He estimates that about 90% of international students from China use WeChat. This is significant, considering that there are about 370,000 international students from China studying in the US.Beyond talking with friends and family living in China, the app is tightly woven into the daily lives of Chinese Americans. Because it is so pervasive in China, a vast majority of Chinese Americans, specifically Chinese immigrants, have adopted it as their primary form of social media, even when communicating with others in the United States. While I spend much of my free time on Instagram and Snapchat, my parents spend much of their free time on WeChat.People in my generation - children of mainland Chinese immigrants - joke about how our parents have countless contacts on WeChat to network with within the Chinese American community. For example, the community in WeChat groups are what keeps my mother passionate about running, and it is how she was able to train to run marathons. One of my friends has gotten numerous tutoring gigs through his dad's WeChat connections. My sibling found their current job via my mom's connections on WeChat.The importance of access to one's ethnic community truly cannot be understated, especially in a pandemic that limits in-person communication, and particularly in a pandemic that has given rise to anti-Chinese rhetoric - including from Trump himself - and hate crimes. This past spring, my mother used WeChat to mobilize the Indy Chinese American community to organize face mask and food donations for local hospitals. Concurrently, the Chinese American community in my hometown created a system to help anyone who experienced any anti-Asian violence - of course, also using WeChat.As a college professor, Liu also expressed concerns over her career. In addition to video calling her mother almost daily using WeChat, she also uses the app to aid her academic career. She is in many groups for non-English language instructors and for Chinese-language research professors, which have been particularly helpful in navigating the unfamiliar landscape of online classes."I feel [WeChat is] such a good thing," Liu said. "It's not only just personal, right? It's also beneficial to my work ... [a WeChat ban] will cause, as a teacher, as a researcher, you know -  I will feel some kind of a loss of resources, you know, connections I will get lost."Because WeChat is absolutely integral for the Chinese American community, we were incredibly alarmed by the news of the Trump administration's executive order."When the news [came] saying that it will be banned, I think I shared the panic feeling with a lot of people," Liu said. "... And even I, you know, warned my mom, saying 'Oh, we probably cannot chat on WeChat.' And she said, 'What can we do?'"On Saturday, Sept. 19, the day before the WeChat ban was set to take place, my parents and siblings scrambled to find a replacement for our family group chat; others in the Chinese American community did the same for their respective WeChat groups. Liu said her groups considered transitioning to Telegram or Facebook. However, this still poses an issue for people of older generations, particularly those with limited English skills, who would struggle to adapt to new platforms. Regardless, both of these platforms are blocked in China because of the Great Firewall.The morning of Sunday, Sept. 20, I woke up to a message from my sister in our family WeChat group chat: "WeChat ban blocked by federal judge." The US WeChat Users Alliance, a non-profit group of Americans formed in response to the executive order, had successfully sued the Trump administration for violating free speech and due process. Though I was initially elated, I learned shortly after that this is only a hiatus. The Department of Commerce and the Justice Department both plan on challenging this order.Wang said he views this whole situation as entirely ridiculous."I just want to say that this kind of reaction of trying to interfere with people's daily lives," Wang said. "Especially American Chinese as a population - this action of trying to stop them from communicating with each other ... It's really just not something a president wants to do ... Like the Constitution says, everybody has equal rights, right? And Chinese American population ... we came here for whatever reasons: work, study, immigration, whatever. So, I just think - just let us be."For now, the fate of WeChat remains uncertain while the fate of my community hangs in the balance.As of the time of this article's writing, the US WeChat Users Alliance currently is not requiring further donations for legal fees, but this may change as the situation evolves.Share this:• Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)• Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)RelatedLoad-Date: September 30, 2020End of Document

US delays measures against China TikTok after dealCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 20, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 594 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, USA -- The U.S. government announced this Saturday that it will delay for a week the implementation of measures against China's social network TikTok, which were to come into force on Sunday, after President Donald Trump gave his "blessing" to a preliminary agreement so that he can operate in the country."In light of recent positive developments, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, under President Trump's leadership, will delay the ban on transactions identified in Executive Order 13942, related to the TikTok mobile app, which would have entered into force on Sunday, September 20, 2020, until September 27, 2020, at 11:59 p.m." , Commerce noted in a statement.Trump announced hours earlier that he had given "his blessing" to an agreement with TikTok that the social network would partner with U.S. companies Oracle and Walmart to operate in the U.S., though he noted that negotiations were still going on."I've given my blessing to the agreement, if they do it would be great and otherwise it would be fine too, but it's a great deal for the U.S.," said the president, who soon after added that he approved the "as a matter of concept" agreement.Trump stressed that Oracle and Walmart would partner with TikTok, "security would be 100%, they will be employing separate clouds and very powerful security, and will be making a $5 billion contribution in education.""We'll see if it happens or not, but conceptually I think it's a big deal for america," the president opined, who said that if a pact were reached, 25,000 jobs will be created, mostly in Texas and that it will be a new company, although it will keep TikTok's name.On Friday, Commerce announced that it would block downloads of TikTok and the WeChat messaging network (the Chinese Whatsapp) on U.S. app purchase sites starting Sunday, September 20, and that the country's authorities would veta their full use in the U.S. starting November 12, citing national security concerns.In the case of WeChat you also vetoed from this Sunday any transfer of funds or payments in the USA through this application.Neither the Department of Commerce nor Trump referred this Saturday to WeChat, so bans on this social network come into force on September 20.Trump has repeatedly assured that TikTok poses a "threat" to national security and intends to force its sale to an American company.According to the U.S. Government, TikTok and WeChat "store vast amounts of user data, including network activity, location, and search and browsing history."These companies, according to the Department of Commerce, are active participants in the combination of civilian and military activities in China and are subject to mandatory cooperation with the intelligence services of the Chinese Communist Party.China said Friday that it will act against foreign companies and individuals that "endanger" their sovereignty and security, and issued new rules related to its list of "unreliable entities," announced more than 15 months ago and not yet published, which could sanction U.S. firms and individuals in response to Trump Administration measures.China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs opposes the forced sale of TikTok, an operation that it believes violates the principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO).Chinese government sees intention to sell TikTok as one more chapter of the Beijing-Washington trade war, which seeks to contain the giant's growing technological mightAsian, which has already seen telecoms firm Huawei face restrictions, as well as WeChat, owned by digital conglomerate Tencent.

Sep 30 How NYC Students Are Fighting for Uyghur MuslimsThe Campus: City College of New YorkSeptember 30, 2020 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLES; Pg. 1Length: 948 wordsBodyWords by Fabliha Hussain Graphic by Aspasia Celia TsampasIt is not uncommon to see posts on Instagram and other social media platforms concerning the Uyghur Muslims, but many still do not know a lot about them. The Uyghur Muslims, alternatively spelled as the Uighurs, are an ethnic group from East Turkestan who largely reside in the Xinjiang region, an autonomous area of China. About eleven million Uyghurs live in Xinjiang. Although one may think that this region allows the Uyghurs to have autonomy, it is actually similar to Tibet, another "autonomous" region that is under the strict control and governance of China.The Chinese government has gone as far as persecuting Muslim minorities like the Uyghurs. Starting about six years ago, Uyghurs have been arrested and sent to re-education camps. The government has claimed that they display terrorist behaviors, which include praying outside of mosques, having long beards, and having many children. In 2014, the Uyghurs were banned from fasting during the holy month of Ramadan. In 2017, President Xi Jinping announced that religions in China must adhere to Chinese orientations, essentially condemning Islam, which the Uyghurs follow. In 2018, the United Nations found an inside source that reported at least one million Uyghurs were being held in camps and denied release until they show "altered thinking." The true number of people in these camps, however, is unknown, but leaked documents mention "crowded facilities." Reports from those who have escaped from the camps say that they were forced to denounce Islam, sing praises for communism, and learn Mandarin. They have also reported being subjected to torture and sleep deprivation and claim that many women often experience sexual abuse.In response to the plight that the Uyghurs are facing and a lack of awareness about what is going, Zalal, a freshman at The CUNY Macaulay Honors College, and Lamia, a senior at Stuyvesant High School, established an organization called NYC Students for Uyghur Justice this past July. Starting with only two people, Zalal and Lamia reached out to their friends and the community; their organization has since grown to over thirty people. NYCSUJ seeks to find the truth behind outrageous claims on social media and communicate that truth to a wider audience. When asked why they began the organization, they said, "Being Muslim ourselves, it was very difficult to sit still while terrible things were happening to our brothers and sisters. We wanted to help in any way possible." Raising awareness about their cause and getting the truth out there are some of the goals of NYCSUJ, but their overarching goal is to get the attention of the United Nations. Zalal and Lamia aim to try to make international change by using outreach to gain the support of government representatives who have shown sympathy to Uyghur Muslims.To continue to strive towards their goal, they have divided broken their organization into different teams, with each team concentrating on a specific task. These tasks include, but are not limited to, making informational posts and videos, emailing and calling government representatives, collaborating with other organizations, finding helpful petitions to support, and dissecting popular articles and videos. Most of the people who are supporting NYCSUJ are young activists who want to make the world a better place, but their demographic also provides a barrier in reaching those who are older. The founders, however, hope to continue to gain traction so that they can spread their message to people of all ages and backgrounds throughout the world. They are also making plans to expand to other platforms in the upcoming months.Considering that one of the primary reasons Zalal and Lamia established NYCSUJ was to find the truth behind misinformation on social media, the founders have advised that sources are extremely important to establish whether a post is credible or not. False information discredits the movement that they are attempting to start and makes it increasingly difficult to garner real change because the United Nations will not take organizations with false information seriously. Often, false information is hidden in outrageous claims that catch people's attention and spreads rapidly. Recently, a post comparing the Uyghur situation to the Holocaust has been circulating on Instagram, and it has made other claims such as China moving towards a "Final Solution... with plans to kill one-third, lockup one-third and convert one-third of the Uyghur population," a claim that was originally made by Dr. Erkin Sidick, an Uyghur American who is the President of the Uyghur Projects Foundation. NYCSUJ, fortunately, checked sources and debunked this post on their Instagram. Some of these posts are simply written by controversial figures or have zero evidence for their claims.Zalal and Lamia suggest making sure to do a couple of Google searches on any information found on social media before sharing stories. They are eager to show that NYCSUJ is a trustworthy organization and to do that, sources are always included on their posts or their Instagram page. By using trustworthy sources and making it clear to their audience where they got their information from, NYCSUJ can begin to spread the right information to those who are interested in finding out the truth.To get involved with NYCSUJ, message them on their Instagram (@nyc_suj) or email them at uighurmuslimsawareness@gmail.com To show support for them, drop a like and/or a comment on their posts or share their posts. Anything helps to spread the name of this organization and start a movement to help fight for Uyghur justice.Load-Date: October 1, 2020End of Document

China State Media Quotes Lincoln at Trump Admin: 'You Cannot Fool All the People All the Time'Newsweek.comOctober 14, 2020 Wednesday 6:37 AM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 969 wordsByline: John FengHighlight: The opinion piece in the government newspaper People's Daily singled out the Secretary of State and used this week's TIME magazine cover to ridicule the Trump administration's COVID-19 response.BodyA Chinese government newspaper sought to shame President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday by quoting Abraham Lincoln.In a piece published in English in state-owned outlet People's Daily, the newspaper invoked a line widely attributed to President Lincoln, who is believed to have said during an 1858 debate: "You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time."The opinion column, which warns America risks its reputation by "promoting lies," comes as top U.S. diplomats such as the secretary of state have sought to censure China on the international stage.During his recent visit to East Asia, where he met with leaders from Japan, India and Australia, Pompeo called for closer cooperation amid the Chinese Community Party's "exploitation, corruption and coercion" in the region.Following that came criticism for Beijing at the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly Third Committee, where a statement by German Ambassador Christoph Heusgen on behalf of the U.S., U.K. and other mostly Western countries cited "grave concerns" about the treatment of ethnic Uigurs in Xinjiang as well as the Hong Kong security law.Beijing's ruling Chinese Community Party—either through state media or government officials—dismissed both Pompeo's comments and the U.N. joint statement as "smears" and "lies."The conscience of U.S. politicians is being tested"People's Daily describes the accusations of human rights violations as "groundless," with the paper further attempting to shame the Trump administration by citing proof of a poor pandemic response in Time and The Washington Post.The column stated: "The Time magazine cover depicting virus particles coming out of the White House chimneys, hovering like a cloud of poisonous smoke, and with 210,000 American COVID-19 deaths, the conscience of U.S. politicians is being tested."The U.S. has become the worst-performing country in the world in terms of pandemic response, not caused by the allegation that China covered up pandemic information, but by the White House's consistent lies to Americans and its ignorance of the clear information from China."China has informed the U.S. about the pneumonia outbreak and prevention and control measures since Jan. 3. However, the White House played down the virus while knowing the severity of the disease and lost 70 days in the battle against COVID-19, said an article published by The Washington Post on April 4."Strangling TikTokThe state newspaper then takes a swipe at Washington's recent interventions against Chinese short-video platform TikTok, which it claims the U.S. is "strangling.""Pompeo and his colleagues often fabricate rumors under the cloak of national security and human rights," the author stated. "The U.S.' groundless accusations about national security risks are strangling the popular Chinese app TikTok."Similarly, the country has repeatedly oppressed Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE, as well as other Chinese apps including WeChat, under the pretext of national security."America's 'national security' is so important that it needs to be safeguarded by oppressing a Chinese short video company."Xinjiang "fabrications"The government newspaper goes on to call human rights issues in Xinjiang "fabricated," claiming no violent terror-related incidents have been reported in Xinjiang for 40 months, while the Uighur population in the autonomous region rose by more than a quarter from 10.17 million to 12.71 million between 2010 and 2018.Failing to detail Beijing's exact policy exploits in the distant border region, the author added: "China's measures to fight extremism in Xinjiang have effectively safeguarded the rights to life and development of people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region." The piece then cites an influx of tourists during last week's National Day holiday as evidence."Will they feel ashamed of themselves?"The opinion piece, the like of which has become a regular occurrence during the trade war and even more so since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, sought to draw historical comparisons between the allegations in Xinjiang and the U.S. "massacres" of "American Indians", concluding with the killings of Martin Luther King and George Floyd, as well as America's COVID-19 death toll.The People's Daily opinion blames the "politicization of the pandemic" for the more than 210,000 coronavirus deaths in America, saying: "The U.S. will be nailed to the pillar of shame in history in terms of human rights."Recalling President Lincoln's quote, the author asked: "When Pompeo and his colleagues visit the Lincoln Memorial, will they feel ashamed of themselves?""They don't think very highly of the Trump administration or me"However, despite several critical pieces against America's top diplomat, Pompeo appears impervious to the tactic.After an editor at China Daily—another paper owned by the Chinese government—accused him of being America's "Worst Secretary of State," Pompeo quickly shrugged it off during an interview with Greg Kelly on Newsmax TV."I've got some good news and bad news. We'll start with the bad news," Kelly said. "A major media organization has called you the worst secretary of state ever. But the good news is that's coming from the China state-affiliated media. (Laughter.) Which I think is possibly the greatest endorsement a U.S. secretary of state could get. Were you aware of that report?"Pompeo answered: "I've seen what the Chinese media has said about me. It's state media, it's directed by General Xi Jinping and his fellow comrades. They don't think very highly of the Trump administration or me for the actions that we've taken to constrain their malign activities all across the world."Link to ImageGraphic china qingdao covid-19 testingSTR/AFP via Getty ImagesA health worker (L) takes a swab from a resident to be tested for COVID-19 as part of a mass testing program following a new outbreak in Qingdao, Shandong, China, on October 14, 2020.

President Trump giving an upbeat outlook on when we can expect the coronavirus vaccine.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: As soon as the FDA approves the vaccine and as you know we are very close to that, we will be able to distribute at least 100 million vaccine doses by the end of 2020. We are on track to deliver and distribute the vaccine in a very, very safe and effective manner. We think we can start some time in October.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The announcement, a contrast from CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield, who testified on Capitol Hill that a vaccine won't be ready for the public until next summer. President Trump clarified those statements during yesterday's briefing. He is really sad.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I think he made a mistake when he said that. It's just incorrect information and I called him and he didn't tell me that and I think he got the message, maybe confused, maybe it was stated incorrectly. No, we are ready to go immediately as the vaccine is announced.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, Joe Biden is weighing in after he and other Democrats made comments about whether they would get a vaccine approved by the Trump administration.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I trust vaccines, I trust the scientists, but I don't trust Donald Trump. I've been calling for an effective distribution plan to be laid out for months. They haven't put one in place for real yet.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, President Trump heads to Wisconsin today to hold a great American comeback rally, while Joe Biden visits his childhood home in Scranton, Pennsylvania with Kamala Harris before taking part in a town hall meeting.In California, meanwhile, new evacuation orders are in place this morning for the out of control Bobcat Fire. These flames burning Northeast of Los Angeles. Firefighters have been working around the clock for the last 11 days. Rising temperatures helping fuel the flames, which are coming dangerously close to the historical Mount Wilson Observatory. 3.2 million acres have burned across California so far this year.One of two Los Angeles deputies shot during the ambush in Compton Saturday night back home this morning. The 24-year-old male officer was released from the hospital yesterday, his partner who helped save his life remains hospitalized. Her condition is unclear. Los Angeles Sheriff Alex Villanueva says, detectives are narrowing in on a possible suspect in that brazen attack.And Sally turns deadly, the slow-moving storm devastating the Gulf Coast with catastrophic flooding.Ray Bogan joins us now from Pensacola, Florida, where more than 2 feet of rain has already fallen. Ray, good morning to you.RAY BOGAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Maria, good morning to you. What a difference 24 hours make. Yesterday Pensacola was completely flooded and now about all you will see this parking lot with a jeep in the middle of it. There was about 3 feet of water in sections of downtown Pensacola yesterday. So as slowly as this storm moved, this water came in very quickly and it went back out very quickly.Now there are curfews from dawn to dusk here in - dusk to dawn in Escambia County. Tonight and for the next two nights because of the concerns for looting and there was a very visible police presence. They rescued at least 377 people here yesterday and there were times when there were so many people who were stuck in flooded homes that officials were putting out warnings that the 911 system was overloaded and they were asking people who were only in life-threatening situations to call.Now, one of the big things they've tried to do is clear some of this debris, specifically on i10, that does two things. It allows truckers to start working their way east to west again, but it also allows the line crews to come in and get the electricity on. There are nearly 300,000 people (inaudible) and 242,000 people in Florida who were without power, but this is going to be a big resource sharing operation.For instance, Entergy before the storm hit said, they had resources that were willing to come in from at least 25 states to help get the power turned back on. And one of the local county commissioners said, when he spoke with Senator Scott yesterday and Governor DeSantis, the big priority he put on is getting line workers in here to get the power turned back on.Maria, so far there has been one death from this storm. Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Ray. Thanks very much. Condolences to you and all in Pensacola. We'll be watching that.Taking a look at markets this morning. We are looking at a selloff underway. Futures indicating a triple-digit decline at the start of trading this morning. As you see the Dow Industrials now down 245 points; NASDAQ is down 103; and the S&P lower by 34.The Dow ending yesterday in the green for a fourth trading session. The S&P and NASDAQ closed near the lows of the day and the Dow gave up much of an earlier rally after the Federal Reserve indicated it expects to keep interest rates near zero for 3 more years.Joining me now is Mahoney Asset Management's CEO, Ken Mahoney; also joining the conversation all morning this morning Fox Business' Dagen McDowell; and Cornerstone Macro's Co-Founder and Chief Economist, Nancy Lazar.Great to see everybody this morning. Thank you so much for being here. Good morning to you.Ken, let me kick it off with you. What do you make of this market selling off on the Fed yesterday, meanwhile we knew that rates would be near zero for the next 3 years, what do you think investors are reacting to?KEN MAHONEY, CEO, MAHONEY ASSET MANAGEMENT: Well, this morning is definitely a little hangover, because I think we have to understand why they are doing this. Because the economy is not doing maybe the V-shape recovery like we were thinking to do and it's more of an L-shape stock markets pushed in the V-shape recovery. They didn't say much about asset purchase, maybe there's little bit disappointment there, but keeping a punch bowl out there for few years does favor risk assets, i.e., equities, which is overall positive.But you could have this kind of selling news and also if you think about kind of where we are, the Fed is kind of doing their work by themselves, right, on the fiscal side of things. They can't get it together, we can't get stimulus out, we can't get another PPP program out there. So I think the Fed is actually kind of doubling down, or quadrupling down on their efforts knowing the fiscal side of things that can't get anything done.BARTIROMO: I see. Nancy Lazar, how do you see it, because I know you've been writing about a recovery in the second half, regardless of who is in the White House, you think that we're going to see jobs come back to America with the outsourcing coming back as well as a V-shape recovery?NANCY LAZAR, CO-FOUNDER & CHIEF ECONOMIST, CORNERSTONE MACRO: We have had a V-shape recovery. There's no question, they are not just in the market, but also employment, retail sales, industrial production going forward now that we're back to more normal levels, particularly say on retail sales. Things won't be quite as robust. They were downplaying the retail sales report yesterday, it only increased 0.6 percent.Wait a second, that's out of 7 percent plus annual rate, that's a very, very healthy economy. So yes, I'm pretty optimistic on the outlook (inaudible).BARTIROMO: And I want to talk to you about productivity during. Yes, go ahead, sorry.LAZAR: I was just going to say that I think this is one of the healthiest economies we have seen, because jobs are coming back to the United States, this whole onshoring theme that we've been embracing now for several years. And then I think we are in a sustained healthy expansion.BARTIROMO: And as I was saying, I want to talk to you about productivity during the show this morning. I know that's been a really major issue that you're watching, so we will get back to that. But Ken, in terms of markets in particular, you're looking at Big Tech. We saw a pretty good selloff the other day and it feels like it was a 2 week thing, and if you blinked you missed it. You're watching Apple real closely, tell me why.MAHONEY: I just kind of feel like as Apple goes, so does the market. A couple of years ago, when the China trade came up, it really impacted Apple and then the summer, they announced a 4-1stock split. And I think in the month of August, I think they will have 4 down days and Apple led that charge.So again, of course, it's weighted heavily in the NASDAQ weighted heavily in the S&P, not so weighted in the Dow Jones, now somewhere mid-tier because its price weighted. But as Apple goes, so does the market.Now you saw though, since that split, (inaudible) did see 100 shares, now you have 400 shares. They may have taken 100 shares, 200 shares of the table, I think that's what has happened to Apple right now. Long-term prospects of rate, I kind of like where they are for the products, the cycle upgrade to 12, the iPhone 12 because of 5G coming out.Wearables, we saw yesterday or a couple of days ago in their announcement. There are a lot of things great things going for, but in the short amount I think there is some supply there, also some money is taken out, FANG names lately even chasing down Snowflake and some of these other IPO.So you're seeing a rotation little bit out of FANG names into now Snowflake's and some of the kind mid-tier or the technology companies.BARTIROMO: $820 million in the first day of trading, Ken Mahoney. Let's talk Snowflake for a moment. What kind of euphoria we saw yesterday in that IPO? What's behind all of this money moving into Snowflake?MAHONEY: Yes. Well, I guess we're Warren Buffet owning a piece of Berkshire Hathaway, I think that gives people confidence as well. They will try to go head to head with Amazon. See, Amazon printing about 40 points lower this morning as well, because they have raised this money to pretty much go after Amazon's cloud business, go right after that.And then again, I know these IPOs are exciting for a lot of investors jumping in. Again, we don't like that like to see more stabilization of a chart, kind of see some history around it. But it shows that the equity markets are very strong, where you can't have IPOs like this with a weak market and a very weak economy.You have this type of mixture because of where we are in the cycle, because of what's happening. So even with the election uncertainty, everything is on just a lot of speculation.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, what a day yesterday for Snowflake. Incredible.All right, Ken. We will be watching that today to see what happens on day 2 of trading in Snowflake.Great to see you this morning. Ken, thank you. Have a great day.MAHONEY: You too.BARTIROMO: We are just getting started this morning.Coming up, deal or no deal, what the Trump administration wants out of any agreement for TikTok.Then at 7:00 a.m. Eastern, the word on Wall Street, what investors are watching this morning.Plus Georgia Congressman Doug Collins is here on the latest on the investigation of the Russia probe, now that Lindsey Graham has announced and confirmed. Former FBI Director Jim Comey will be testifying.Plus Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan weighs in on the stimulus stalemate.In the 8:00 a.m. hour, we have Senator Rand Paul here on protests and riots hitting across the country. National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow, is here on the economic recovery as well. We will get his take on all of the above.You are watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Crunch time for TikTok. President Trump will review the deal to transfer U.S. operations of the popular social media app TikTok from China's ByteDance to Oracle. U.S. officials are reportedly unsatisfied with the current proposal allowing ByteDance to retain the majority ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations.Oracle will be able to review the app source code to ensure that there are no back doors to the Chinese Communist Party.Joining me right now is the Atlas Organization Founder and author of China's Vision Of Victory, Jonathan Ward. Jonathan, it's always great to talk with you about China for sure. You have worked so much and studied so much on China.Let me ask you about this TikTok situation. I was really struck by the idea that that ByteDance would retain a majority ownership of the U.S. operations should Oracle become the partner. Do you think this flies with U.S. regulators?JONATHAN WARD, FOUNDER, ATLAS ORGANIZATION: I don't think that makes too much sense, Maria, and here is why. There is another thing this where the Communist Party released a new policy directive about the private economy and they said that their goal was build up a backbone of private business people that could be useful in key situations. They said this was directed in all private companies and that the private companies have to participate in China's major national strategy, basically carry out the Chinese national interest and strengthen their ideological loyalty to the party.So essentially, you have the increasing connection between the party and the private economy, so the idea that ByteDance, for example, is independent of any of that, doesn't make any sense. So at the end of the day, to really protect this thing, you're going to have to have American control. That makes more sense for sure.BARTIROMO: Sure. You wonder how that's going to happen. I mean we know about civil military fusion, you talked about this with me 3 years ago. And that of course says, that any innovation that comes into China must first go to the military.There's this article that you and I have spoken about from The Journal, Chinese companies in Pentagon spotlight hire global banks to sell dollar bonds. Tell me about that and the impact and the significance of it rather?WARD: Absolutely. I mean this is the problem with the intertwining of our two economies. At this point, you have major American investment banks essentially underwriting adversaries military industrial base, if one puts all the pieces together. You have the tech companies, I mean speaking of Microsoft and Oracle, Microsoft opened a new AI center in Beijing, rather in Shanghai with the Shanghai government to, as they say, accelerate breakthroughs in AI in China. I mean AI is one of the most important areas of military research for China.And just last week you have the official Chinese defense ministry spokesperson saying that the United States is the greatest threat to world peace. You have another Chinese op-ed coming out saying China must be morally and militarily prepared for war.So we are intertwined, we're building this place and this place seeks to supplant us, it's in conflict with all its neighbors from India to Japan to the South China Sea. And we really have to start pulling apart this strategic aspects of the economy. We can't have our bankers over there building their economy, we can't have our tech companies over there increasing their capacity. And ultimately, we are going to have to win the competition on innovation on military technology, on strategic industries, and on cheer size of GDP. We can't let China surpass this. Right now our companies are over there participating in that, so I think one of the key things--BARTIROMO: And you've said many times that this economic soft war, if you will, that's going on between the U.S. and China is going to play out in the corporate board room, in the corporation. So have companies gotten the memo, they want to sell to 1.4 billion people, many of them are not necessarily acknowledging or recognizing the national security threats and the threat of the Chinese military to turn on the United States at some point.WARD: Well, look, Maria, I think it's time to hold America's companies accountable on U.S. national security. I think what we really need is a bigger public discussion from America's CEOs.BARTIROMO: Yes.WARD: Where they can come out, talk to us about what their big ideas are for U.S. national security, for major power competition.BARTIROMO: Yes.WARD: How are they going to do this, how exposed to the China problem? We can't let them hide from.BARTIROMO: And Jonathan, real quick, all of this in the face of these companies getting hacked. Chinese hackers are being brought to justice as we speak, prosecutors on sealed charges against 5 Chinese citizens, accusing them of hacking more than 100 companies, including social media firms, universities and telecom providers. The indictments do not say that the hackers work directly for the Chinese government, but of course, evidence including targeting pro-democracy officials in Hong Kong suggests state espionage, is that what this is about that it's all coming from the CCP and it's directing hackers as well? Real quick, Jonathan. We have to jump?WARD: Well, sure. I mean, the CCP is the box stops here in China. I mean it's all kind of linked back to them. So our companies are in trouble. I mean they are being targeted, they know this, they need to start talking publicly.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Jonathan, it's great to see you. Always a pleasure talking about this important topic with you. Jonathan Ward, joining us this morning. Thank you, Jonathan.Stay with us. We will be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. More now on closing the income gap, new data from the census department shows that median household income grew nearly 7 percent last year, the largest annual increase on record.The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board highlighting the data this morning in a new op-ed, titled "the higher wages of growth".Dagen, this is an issue you and I have spoken about quite a bit. Incomes arising, the poverty rate falling last year, we were actually seeing an impact to the income inequality situation before COVID-19 showed up. Really good news.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Really good news and that's why I've said over and over again, I will talk policy all day long, but I will not talk about personality because it doesn't get us anywhere. But the policy changes brought in under the Trump administration have done just what you hit.The median household income last year grew at the largest annual increase on record. And lower and middle-income folks, this is in the Wall Street Journal Editorial, we are finally sharing more of this country's wealth.Listen to these numbers. Incomes increase more for Hispanics, blacks, Asians, foreign-born workers versus white Americans and native born Americans. And it's because people there was more opportunity, more jobs, wages for the lowest-skilled workers in this country were increasing at the fastest rate in 20 years.And I will also highlight this that decline not only in the poverty rate to the lowest level in 60 years, but the decline in childhood poverty last year was nearly twice as much as during the entire presidency of Barack Obama.We must highlight and Nancy can talk about what caused the sluggish growth and the lack of equality for during the Obama presidency and what changed under the Trump administration.BARTIROMO: Well, that's right, because Nancy, the president really focused on cutting taxes, lowering regulations and all of that boosted wages. This is why I keep repeating this over and over on this program the last several months to make the point that this whole narrative of this tax cut plan helping the rich is just a political talking point and it's inaccurate, Nancy. Your views.LAZAR: Those policies really encourage companies to reinvest in this country and its investments that create jobs by the private sector. And so these trends have been unfolding and you saw it in the unemployment rate, that 3.5 percent last year. This was not a sugar-high boost economic activity. It was companies reinvesting and creating jobs. When companies invest, there's a multiplier of positive job growth. Other industries hire if you expand your business, you make your business healthier, there are other businesses that need to support you. And so that's what we started to see.You really have seen an increase in what we call the employment diffusion effects, and so it was really, really cool that you've been able to heal the economy. We went into this crisis at a pretty amazing level of record- low poverty in this country.MCDOWELL: Maria, can I just add one really quick thing?BARTIROMO: Please.MCDOWELL: What the Obama administration did, not only was it hyper- regulation, which was a burden on businesses, it was higher taxes. And then the easy money policies, the administration leaning so hard on the Federal Reserve, well, that gave rise to greater wealth for the rich. And the biggest thing was government transfer payments after the recession in 2008- 2009, where people could go on unemployment for 99 weeks. And then many people wound up on disability after that. And again, we have an economic basis that not only encourages businesses to hire and people to go out and work, but provides opportunity in terms of income growth in this country.BARTIROMO: Yes. And it's a big deal.All right. We will keep talking about this. We will take a break.When we come back, the timetable for coronavirus vaccine now gets political. We are going to take a closer look when we come back.And then this puppy love. The new website helping your pet find new friends.You're watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business.MARIA BARTIROMO, ANCHOR, MORNINGS WITH MARIA: Welcome back, good Thursday morning everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, September 17th. Let's take a look at markets this morning, 6:31 a.m. on the East Coast, we're looking at a selloff this morning, futures indicating a decline, up 240 points right out of the gate on the Dow Industrials. The Nasdaq futures are down 103 and the S&P futures lower by 33. The Federal Reserve causing markets to reverse course yesterday after saying it will leave interest rates near zero for at least 3 more years. What does that say about the slow-moving economic recovery?Dow Industrials yesterday given up much of an earlier rally, finishing up just 36 points. The Nasdaq was lower, it completely reversed course to turn down 140 points by the close, and the S&P was down 15. Global markets this morning also under pressure, European Indices, take a look, down across the board. The FTSE 100 down 44, CAC Quarante down 27 and the Dax Index lower by 57. The Bank of England out with its rate decision in about half an hour. Investors will be watching for any news of any added stimulus and an assessment of the economy in the Eurozone. In Asia overnight, right across the board there as well, Bank of Japan left its interest rates unchanged, saying though that the economy has began to pick up. Nonetheless, the Nikkei Average was down two-thirds of a percent and the worst performer was Hong Kong, Hang Seng down 1.5 percent. The Trump administration says it is pushing forward with U.S. sanctions on Iran. Jackie DeAngelis with the details now, Jackie.JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS: Good morning to you, Maria, that's right. The State Department saying it plans to impose sanctions on those who violate the United Nations arms embargo with Iran which will now stay in place instead of expiring next month as part of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. You'll remember that President Trump quit the Obama-era deal in which Tehran agreed to limit its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. U.S. security officials say that Iran is still working on developing nuclear arms which Tehran denies. The U.N. Security Council has not confirmed whether or not it's on board with U.S.-enforced sanctions.Meantime, Deutsche Bank breaking from its competitors, telling employees they don't have to return to the office until next Summer. Last week, of course, JPMorgan told some sales staff in New York to start returning to the office, and Bank of America is planning to have some of its staff return next month. And the Big Ten Conference changing course, saying there will be a college football season this year after all. The Big Ten is going to kick off its season the weekend of October 24th, and the NCAA, men and women's basketball will also be making a return. The season set to open before Thanksgiving Day. So, something to look forward to, Maria.BARTIROMO: All right, sure is, Jackie, thank you so much. The fight against COVID-19, President Trump speaking at the White House on his outlook for the rollout of a coronavirus vaccine.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The FDA approves the vaccine and as you know, we're very close to that. We would be able to distribute at least 100 million vaccine doses by the end of 2020. And we're on track to deliver and distribute the vaccine in a very safe and effective manner. We think we can start sometime in October.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: But CDC Director Robert Redfield says a vaccine won't be rolled out that quickly, prompting President Trump to respond this way.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROBERT REDFIELD, DIRECTOR, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL & PREVENTION: When is it going to be generally available to the American public so we can begin to take advantage of vaccine to get back to our regular life? I think we are probably looking at third -- late second quarter, third quarter, 2021.TRUMP: I think he made a mistake when he said that. It's just incorrect information. And I called him and he didn't tell me that, and I think he got the message, maybe confused, maybe it was stated incorrectly. No, we're ready to go immediately as the vaccine is announced.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden also speaking out, saying that he will trust the advice of scientists, but he won't trust President Trump. Joining me right now is Trump 2020 presidential campaign senior adviser Jason Miller. Jason, great to see you, what do you make of this back-and-forth? The president and now Redfield saying, no, not so soon on a vaccine.JASON MILLER, SENIOR ADVISER, TRUMP 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: Maria, good morning and thank you for having me on. I think President Trump is exactly right that we're going to have a vaccine this year and we're going to return life back to normal in 2021. And these are two really key points because as I'm looking down in the corner of the screen here and we see where the market is, it would not be as high as it is right now if people didn't have confidence in President Trump to deliver us this vaccine, and to make sure we get life back to normal.That's a key differential with the president and with Joe Biden who wants you to stay hidden in the basement the entire time. But I think it's also to point out there shouldn't be any politics in this. This should be about helping the American people getting the vaccine, returning life to normal. I was really disturbed by Joe Biden's recent anti-vaxxer rhetoric, it's always easy to say no, let's just wear masks for the rest of our lives, let's stay in the basement. That's not what Americans want, Maria. You have CEOs on this show every single day in the restaurant industry, the tourism industry, those do not get back to normal until life gets back to normal. That's critical.BARTIROMO: Yes, and you're right. Dagen, jump in.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: Jason, I don't know why you would pivot from the vaccine to talking about the stock market because front and center is just the simple issue that you have a vaccine -- and we hear this from Pfizer that they should have the data ready potentially on their phase re- trials which was expanded to 44,000 people here in the United States by the end of October. And that the FDA said it's ready to ship the COVID-19 vaccine 24 hours after authorization. Those are the facts, but then to pivot to the markets which is fickle, which is full of people who could bail out at any moment. Why connect the two? What's the use of that?MILLER: Well, because they're inextricably linked, Dagen, and the fact of the matter is the economy, we have to get life back to normal, and that starts with getting people back to work, getting life back to normal. It's all tied in. You're exactly right, we have eight different vaccines that are in development, you're exactly right, there looks like Pfizer is on track for October, we've heard that from the CEO. All of the drug companies have come together and said there will be no politics in this process. It's going to be developed. The scientists will get it rolled out and it's going to be this year.This is in stark contrast of what we've heard from some of the naysayers, as we then get the vaccine and that starts being distributed this year, then we can have life return to normal. That's what Americans want right now. It's all tied together and we have to -- we have to keep the economy open, and we have to get folks back to work.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, I do agree that the markets would not be where they are if markets and investors thought that we were going to see a change in policy, that we were going to see President Trump lose the election. I do believe that the market has a certain message, and the message of the market today is that we will likely see a second term, the race for the White House plays out every day. The president is headed to the battleground state of Wisconsin today, Jason, as you know, this coming as a new "Washington Post" and "ABC News" poll shows President Trump 6 points behind Joe Biden in the state. But this was a key state for President Trump back in 2016, he beat Hillary Clinton there by a tight margin. Jason, what's the message to voters there, and what do you make of these polls that continually show President Trump trailing Biden in these major news polls?MILLER: Well, let me go and take in a little bit of reverse order, and that with the national polls that we're seeing, keep in mind all the -- almost all the national polls show this trailing Secretary Clinton back in 2016. And President Trump, when you look at actual battlegrounds, the electoral college, that's -- he ended up winning and doing much better than what the public polls were saying because they weren't picking up Trump voters. We see a lot of that here actually, we see the key battlegrounds like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona, much better shape in our internal polling and even some of the public polling that we do in most of what's in the headlines.One other key thing about the national polls, keep in mind, the third way which is a leftist center democratic group did an analysis of 2016, said Democrats have about a 17 percent wasted vote, Republicans have about a 13 percent wasted vote from running out the score in either blue states or red states. So, when you see a national poll right off the top, know that President Trump is doing about 4 points or 5 points better just in the battle grounds.BARTIROMO: All right, we'll look at that. I like that one question in one of the polls recently that said what do you think your neighbor will do? Will you -- yes, 39 percent said my neighbor will vote for President Trump. That's like I'm asking for a friend. Jason miller, it's good to see you this morning, thank you so much sir, we will keep watching, obviously --MILLER: I thank you, Maria --BARTIROMO: An exciting moment for you and the campaign. Coming up, harsh penalties for rioters, how Attorney General William Barr reportedly wants prosecutors to handle the unrests across the country. Then Saturday Night Live casting its Joe Biden figure, find out who will be playing the former vice president this Fall, you won't believe this one. You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Sedition on the docket. The "Wall Street Journal" this morning reporting that Attorney General William Barr is pushing federal prosecutors to consider charging violent rioters with sedition, including potentially prosecuting individuals with plotting to overthrow the U.S. government. Joining me right now is former federal prosecutor and Fox News contributor Andrew McCarthy, and Andy, it's good to see you this morning. First, explain the law itself and give us your reaction.ANDREW MCCARTHY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning, Maria. Yes, the unfortunate thing about the sedition statute which I used against terrorists who bombed the World Trade Center back in the 1990s is that the word "sedition" is in the title. Sedition is a word that gets people's tackles up because it's got association with the late 18th century Alien and Sedition Act. It's something of a vague term in terms of what it means whether it's necessarily violent or not violent.The important thing, Maria, is that the word "sedition" does not actually appear in the charging language of the statute which makes it a crime to make war against the United States or use force against the government. It's almost -- you almost wished the statute was called, you know, war against the United States, force against the government because that's what's it's about, and that's why it's a perfect charge for this kind of situation.BARTIROMO: So, you do think it's a perfect charge for the situation. I mean, they are going there rioting, wanting to take buildings down. That is their goal --MCCARTHY: Right --BARTIROMO: Make sure to destroy federal --MCCARTHY: Yes --BARTIROMO: Property.MCCARTHY: Right, what we had in the 1990s, Maria, was something that was very similar. We had terrorists who were operating domestically even though they were tied to foreign organizations. They were in the United States, they were targeting federal installations and big American targets like financial targets, like the World Trade Center, for example, their rhetoric made it clear, they considered themselves to be at war with the United States and they were targeting the government --BARTIROMO: Yes --MCCARTHY: As a government. In other words, they weren't just randomly trying to pick people up, they were talking about federal buildings, police buildings, political officials and the like, it's not a hard case to prove.BARTIROMO: I see, Andy. Let me switch gears and ask you about your take on the investigation into the origins of the Russia probe. We've got new numbers, show that Robert Mueller's staff turned in 27 government smartphones that were wiped off all of their data, 27 phones, Andy. I mean, if this is not obstruction of justice, I don't know what is. How is it possible that they can get away with wiping all their phones cleaned during the Mueller investigation?MCCARTHY: Yes, this is -- this is one of the most peculiar angles of this story that we've heard, Maria. And what I think is really disturbing is that, we had to find out about this from judicial watch. So in other words, these prosecutors handed their phones over to the Inspector General of the Justice Department who is conducting an investigation, you would have thought it would be part of the Inspector General's report, you know, if it's -- if there's a reason why they did this. You would think that he would explain it to us because there was a big to do -- remember over the phones of Strzok and Page, yet, we find out about this only because judicial watch litigated it.And I think, you know, people need to answer some questions about why this happened because it's simply not a plausible explanation that 25 or 27 different phones all had the same problem, and it's hard to wipe a phone clean. You know, the -- to the extent that they talk for example about Andrew Weissmann's two phones which were wiped clean because he kept putting the pass code in wrong, and you have to put it in like 10 times wrong in order to wipe a phone --BARTIROMO: That's right --MCCARTHY: He did it twice. It's very hard to do.BARTIROMO: Yes, it takes an hour or more to do that, so that clearly shows --MCCARTHY: Oh, yes --BARTIROMO: Intent. You want to clean your phone. And they did it after the text came public of Peter Strzok and Lisa Page which, of course, showed us a whole world of what was going on behind the scenes. Andy, we're waiting on John Durham, are you expecting indictments on all of this? I mean, we already have the first plea, guilty, from Kevin Clinesmith, and now we know that Jim Comey will be testifying in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee according to Lindsay Graham on September 30th.MCCARTHY: Yes, well, as I've said before, Maria, I think when people testify in Congress, they have obviously a pretty good idea that the prosecutor doesn't have any interest in them as a criminal suspect, because otherwise you wouldn't go out and testify publicly. I expect there will be a report from Durham that describes a lot of abuse of power and misconduct that may not rise to the level of criminal violations, and there may be some more crimes indictments, but Attorney General Barr has said what he's looking for is meat and potatoes-type crimes like I lied to a court or I tampered with a document. He is not going to have any big, extravagant crimes very similar to what the Mueller investigation did to try to bring people into the net. I don't think that's going to happen.BARTIROMO: All right, we'll see. I know there were a handful of lies and leaks, so we will wait to see John Durham's solutions and conclusions. Andrew McCarthy, great to see you this morning, thanks so much, we will keep following that --MCCARTHY: Thanks, Maria --BARTIROMO: Coming up, puppy love, a new dating app just for pets -- you're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business, stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, time for the Morning Buzz. First up, a familiar face coming to late night Saturday Night Live, actor Jim Carrey to play Joe Biden in the show's 46th season, premiering next month. Alec Baldwin is set to return as President Trump. All this should be good, Dagen, what do you think?MCDOWELL: Well, Jim Carrey has been kind of in this nonstop rolling, Trump-induced psychotic episode which is front and center on Twitter, he even tweeted in August, image of Abraham Lincoln committing suicide in response to the Republican National Convention. Alec Baldwin is left, but he looks right of Gerald Ford compared to Jim Carrey. Let's see how honest and actually funny this portrayal would be.BARTIROMO: Yes, I'm so glad you brought that up, you're right. I mean, it's real Trump derangement syndrome when you look at Jim Carrey's Twitter account. How about this? Puppy love for modern age, a new dating site Pinder, hitting the market, connecting lonely pets for a shot at love, Nancy, what do you think?NANCY LAZAR, CO-FOUNDER & CHIEF ECONOMIST, CORNERSTONE MACRO: I'm out of my league when it comes to social media, but this is just so cute. You know, the good news is -- one piece of good news during this COVID crisis is that I'm home, I'm home all day long and my little puppy, Rosy, loves the fact that I'm home. Unfortunately, I'm working all day long. So, I love this country, how creative we are and innovation has made this country quite frankly, why it's so healthy going into the crisis, and this is just another cute example. So my husband has always --BARTIROMO: Yes --LAZAR: Said, you know, our little puppy is a chick magnet, and so this is a very creative way of bringing people who love pets together.BARTIROMO: There's Dusty on the screen and I can -- I can assure you and confirm she too loves quarantine, Dusty does. Finally, are you looking to lose some extra lockdown pounds? An Indiana fitness company is offering $13,000 to any candidate who tests new diet routines and loses weight in 3 months, Dagen, 13 grand. What do you think?MCDOWELL: Yes, so I did the math on this, if you do -- so it's roughly 90 days and dieting is 24 hours a day, that works out -- if you do the 13 grand, which by the way, that includes a $5,000 bonus. That works out to be $6 an hour. I say that is not really good pay. And by the way, if you take -- if you remove the bonus, so you -- the salary is $8,000 excluding the bonus, that's $3.70 an hour. That is not a fair wage. Dieting is hard --BARTIROMO: OK --MCDOWELL: And then, frankly, your relative --BARTIROMO: Yes --MCDOWELL: Should be compensated because you are going to be the most irritable individual on planet earth, and so you need to pay like your spouse, your kids because you're going to be insufferable. I'll leave it at that.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: I love it. Dagen, crunching the numbers on that. All right, still ahead, Georgia Congressman Doug Collins is here on the upcoming testimony from former FBI Director Jim Comey and Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan will join us on Washington's stimulus stalemates, all coming up next hour right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live on Fox Business.Load-Date: September 17, 2020End of Document

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIESStates News ServiceSeptember 28, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 590 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:The U.S. and other governments should make decisions about Chinese tech companies based on human rights considerations, including the companies' impact on the rights of people around the worldnot just their own citizens.The Chinese companies Tencent, owner of WeChat, and ByteDance, which owns TikTok, play a significant role in facilitating and entrenching the Chinese government's censorship, surveillance, and propaganda regime inside China. There is emerging evidence that they also have a debilitating influence on rights outside the country.ByteDance's products catering to Chinese usersincluding news aggregator Jinri Toutiao, search engine Toutiao Search, and Douyin, the domestic version of TikTokall censor what the Chinese government considers "politically sensitive" content. Articles that mention the names of top People's Republic of China (PRC) leaders, for example, or videos uploaded by Uighurs to draw attention to their missing family members are quickly removed. The company also censored content it considered critical of the PRC government on its news aggregator app in Indonesia from 2018 to mid-2020.Through Douyin, ByteDance worked closely with the PRC police to disseminate state propaganda whitewashing Beijing's abuses in Xinjiang. ByteDance also signed an agreement with the Ministry of Public Security to promote "the influence and credibility" of police departments nationwide.Similarly, WeChat censors and surveils users on the PRC government's behalf and hands over user data to authorities when "sensitive" information is discovered. There have been numerous reports about people getting harassed, detained, or imprisoned for their private messages on WeChat. A man in Shandong province was sentenced to 10 months in prison for sending a single video clip referencing an anti-government campaign to a U.S.-based friend. Uighurs and Tibetans have been imprisoned for using WeChat to share religious materials. A study by Citizen Lab in Canada showed that WeChat also surveils its users outside the PRC to build up the database it uses to censor PRC-registered accounts.ByteDance and Tencent may have enriched many people's lives by facilitating expression, but their very success became possible at least in part because they actively assist the PRC government's suppression of speech.Last year, the U.S. government sanctioned dozens of Chinese tech companies for their role in human rights violations in China. All governments grappling with Beijing's increasingly global tech-enabled censorship and surveillance need to develop legitimate, necessary, and transparent responses that take into account how the human rights of all usersnot just their own citizensare impacted.Ensuring that Chinese tech companies are held accountable for facilitating human rights violations while not creating a race to the bottom and not endangering the future of an open, interoperable global Internet is a delicate matter. But there are solutions with fewer potential negative effects: The U.S. and other governments should provide alternate channels of communication and invest in open-source technologies that enable people in the PRC to more easily circumvent censorship so that they do not get trapped in the black hole of Chinese companies' censorship and surveillance. Domestically, those governments need to strengthen their own data protection laws so the privacy of users can be protected from the abusive practices of all companies, Chinese or others.Load-Date: September 29, 2020End of Document

U.S. charges Chinese hackers with attacking companies, pro-democracy groupsUPISeptember 17, 2020 Thursday 1:34 AM ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 749 wordsByline: DARRYL COOTEDateline: Sept. 17 BodyThe Justice Department said it has charged a group of hackers linked to the Chinese government with targeting more than 100 companies, pro-democracy organizations and universities worldwide to steal proprietary information and digital currency, inflicting millions of dollars in losses.The Justice Department announced the unsealing of three indictments Wednesday during a press conference charging five fugitive Chinese nationals of the hacking group Advanced Persistent Threat 41 and two Malaysian nationals who conspired with them to profit from their attacks.During the press conference, Jeffrey A. Rosen, deputy attorney general, announced that the Malaysian defendants -- Wong Ong Hua, 46, and Ling Yang Ching, 32 -- were arrested Sunday evening by Malaysian authorities and now face extradition proceedings while chastising China for not only enabling the attacks by turning a blind eye to the Chinese hackers but from benefiting from their actions."The Chinese government has made a deliberate choice to allow its citizens to commit computer intrusions and attacks around the world because these actors will also help the PRC," he said, referring to the Asian nation by the initials of its official name, the People's Republic of China.Michael Sherwin, acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said that some of those charged are associated with the PRC, which provides them with "free license" to hack and steal across the globe while barring them from attacking domestic targets.He told reporters that the indictments don't include accusations of state-sponsored cyberattacks but that when parsed they show that not all the attacks were for personal gains, such as those targeting universities and prodemocracy think tanks, groups, politicians and activist, some of which are in Hong Kong."This is a breadcrumb that shows that these individuals were working for profit-personal gain, yes, but were also proxies -- that's a conclusion you could draw -- for the Chinese government," he said.In one of the indictments, a Chinese suspect is reported to have boasted about being "very close" to China's Ministry of State Security, which would provide him protection "unless something big happens.""We know the Chinese authorities to be at least as able as the law enforcement authorities here and in like-minded states to enforce laws against intrusions," Rosen said, "But they choose not to."The indictments charge Chinese nationals Zhang Haoran, 35; Tan Dailin, 35; Jiang Lizhi, 35; Qian Chuan, 39; and Fu Qiang, 37; with dozens of crimes.The charges continue a Justice Department push to hold Chinese hackers accountable and came two months after prosecutors charged two Chinese nationals with hacking pharmaceutical companies developing coronavirus vaccines on behalf of the Chinese government as well as stealing data from dissidents worldwide.Prosecutors said Wednesday that the crimes committed by the seven defendants fall under two categories: those targeting companies and those targeting victims involved in the video game industry.Rosen said the attacks targeting companies were "turbo-charged" by a sophisticated technique called a supply chain attack where the Chinese hackers infiltrated international software providers and altered the codes of their programs to install backdoors that enabled further hacks of the customers who bought their products.The second method saw the hackers compromise the networks of video game companies to defraud them and users of in-game resources that, with the help of the two Malaysian defendants, they would sell on the black market.Sherwin called the attack "unprecedented.""This is again troubling because we see this as unfortunately a new area in which hackers are exploiting, and it's a billion-dollar industry, and I'm sure that this isn't the end," he said. "We're going to see much more of this criminal conduct, unfortunately."Along with the charges, the Justice Department with the FBI announced they have been working with Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Verizon and other companies to "neutralize" the computer infrastructure the hacking group APT-41 uses, such as malware and malicious domains, to conduct its attacks.Prosecutors also announced the seizure of hundreds of accounts, servers, domain names and so-called dead drop web pages used by the defendants to conduct their computer attacks"The bottom line is that we have used every tool at the department's disposal to disrupt these APT-41 activities," Rosen said.Load-Date: September 17, 2020End of Document

China decries India mobile app ban amid renewed tensionsUPISeptember 3, 2020 Thursday 1:55 PM ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 321 wordsByline: ELIZABETH SHIMDateline: Sept. 3 BodyChina is protesting a recent Indian decision to ban more than 100 Chinese mobile apps amid recent reports of renewed Chinese aggression.Chinese commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng said Thursday the Indian government is attacking Chinese investment interests. New Delhi should reverse course, Gao said."India's behavior undermines the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese investors and service providers," Gao said, according to state news services. "It does not benefit the rights of Indian consumers and India's open economic and investment environment."The Chinese spokesman said Beijing expresses "serious concern" and called on India to "correct its mistakes."On Wednesday, India had said it would ban 118 Chinese apps, claiming popular video games like PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, Baidu and Alipay posed a threat to cybersecurity, Taiwan News reported.New Delhi did not say the decision was tied to ongoing tensions at the China-India border, but analysts say the move is retaliation.In June, a clash along the disputed Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers in Galway Valley. China has declined to disclose its casualty numbers.India had warned about the mobile app ban following the conflict and banned 60 Chinese apps, including TikTok, WeChat and Cam Scanner, in June.On Thursday, Gao did not address the tensions, saying instead economic cooperation between the two countries is "mutually beneficial." Gao also said India should "protect hard-to-obtain cooperative development" with China.Chinese troops continue to engage in provocative action, New Delhi Television reported Thursday.The actions came on Saturday night and on Monday, but Indian troops were able to "prevent these attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo," India's foreign ministry said.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday he hoped for a peaceful resolution to the tensions.Load-Date: September 3, 2020End of Document

CHINA: MONGOLIAN MOTHER-TONGUE CLASSES CURTAILEDStates News ServiceSeptember 4, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 900 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:The Chinese government should reverse its new policy of increasingly replacing Mongolian with Mandarin Chinese as the language of instruction in Inner Mongolia schools, Human Rights Watch said today. Chinese authorities should also stop harassing those who have peacefully protested in support of Mongolian language education.The US-based Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center reported on August 20, 2020, that education authorities had informed teachers that all elementary and middle schools in Inner Mongolia had to use Mandarin Chinese as the language of instruction for three subjects starting this new school year. Inner Mongolia is a region in northern China with 17 percent ethnic minority Mongols, who speak Mongolian as their mother tongue."As in Xinjiang and Tibet, the Chinese authorities appear to be putting political imperatives ahead of educational ones," said Sophie Richardson, China director. "While Mongolian students are being told they'll still have some classes in Mongolian, their concerns about it being phased out are entirely warranted."Students in Mongolian-medium schools had previously been taught in their mother tongue, alongside a daily hour of Chinese language instruction starting from the third grade. Starting this September, the education authorities will expect schools to teach three subjects in Mandarin Chinese: language and literature, "morality and law (politics)," and history. Authorities may be giving priority to these three subjects because they reflect the government's emphasis on political and ideological education. Other classes, namely mathematics, sciences, art, music, and physical education, as well as Mongolian language, will still be taught in Mongolian.In an August 31 statement, authorities in Mongolia said that the changes, following similar steps in Xinjiang in 2017 and Tibet 2018, also apply to ethnic minority schools in Gansu, Sichuan, and six other provinces and regions. The statement said that "Textbooks reflect the will of the [Chinese Communist] Party and the state ... [and] directly concern the implementation of the Party's educational guiding principle and the realization of educational goals."Authorities did not initially communicate the changes publicly perhaps anticipating objections. During closed-door meetings, officials only showed teachers the headings of the central government policy, and required teachers to sign documents promising not to discuss the order.After the policy was leaked, international media reported widespread school boycotts and various protests breaking out throughout Inner Mongolia. Videos show students shouting slogans and walking out of schools. Authorities swiftly responded with a crackdown, detaining Mongolian activists and beating protesters.On August 23, authorities shut down Bainu, the only Mongolian-language social media site in China. Many Mongolian speakers earlier had posted complaints on Bainu about the policy change. Many posts on popular Chinese social media platforms such as Weibo and WeChat about "bilingual education" were censored. Authorities also allegedly harassed and detained some Mongolians who voiced their displeasure on these platforms.China's constitution guarantees minority language rights, and minority-medium education began to be introduced in schools in the relatively liberal 1980s. But in recent years, the Chinese government has rolled back minority language education rights across the country, particularly in Xinjiang and Tibet. The Chinese government calls these new efforts in a confusing euphemism "bilingual education."While many Tibetan parents support the idea of children learning in both languages, some are distressed at the near-total removal of Tibetan-language medium education, replacing it with classes conducted in Chinese. The developments reflect an assimilationist, Han-centric chauvinism that has gained momentum under President Xi Jinping's leadership. The authorities now consider even local initiatives for the promotion of minority language activities in Tibet as "separatist," punishable under the criminal code.Authorities in the past have harassed and arbitrarily detained activists who criticized ethnic minority language policies and campaigned for mother-tongue education. In 2018, Tibetan language rights activist Tashi Wangchuk was sentenced to five years in prison for "inciting separatism."China's assimilationist education policy contravenes international human rights law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which China ratified in 1992, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which China has signed but not ratified. Both treaties guarantee that children have the right to education in their own language and culture. China has also supported the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which both endorses rights to Indigenous language education and the right of Indigenous people to control their educational systems and institutions."Chinese authorities should be focused on providing genuine bilingual education, not undermining it and persecuting its proponents," Richardson said. "Reducing mother tongue education flies in the face of China's constitution, international standards, and expert consensus, and erodes Mongolians' distinct identity."Load-Date: September 4, 2020End of Document

Big Trouble In Little Hollywood: Buy Streaming Stocks As China Ruins The MoviesBenzinga.comOctober 13, 2020 Tuesday 4:44 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Accretive Capital LLC d/b/a Benzinga All Rights ReservedLength: 2014 wordsByline: Gregory Bergman - CapitalWatchBodyThe following originally appeared on CapitalWatchThe above is just a working title. I was also thinking  Red Fawn: How Hollywood Sold Its Soul to China.  Or what about  Big Like Xi ? Or the equally self-serving:  Watch Obamaland Free on Prime as You Buy Amazon Stock.  No, this:  Buy Roku as Hollywood Sells Out to China. Titles aside, ultimately the consumer, not the creator, theoretically controls the market. Hollywood makes films people want to see. And people apparently want to see good guys donning capes saving the world from bad guys donning capes.The tastemakers of the world have lost their taste for good art, at least in theaters. With a small movie screen in nearly every American home, the silver screen has been largely reserved for big comic-book spawned inane blockbusters over the last few years.But you know what is worse than American audiences determining what movies we see? Chinese audiences filtered through an image-obsessed totalitarian government. As the world s largest movie market as of this year, China has become the world s tastemaker for film. That means you can kiss that long-awaited sequel to Kundun goodbye. Too bad, Kundun: Part Deux has such a good ring to it.(Regarding the 1997 Scorsese masterpiece, then Disney CEO Michael Eisner later apologized to Beijing.  We made a stupid mistake in releasing Kundun,  he told Premier Zhu Rongji.   and in the future we should prevent this sort of thing, which insults our friends, from happening.  The Dalai Lama may be a great guy, but Tibetans aren t exactly flush with cash. Remember all those  Free Tibet  concerts celebrities used to sponsor? I do.)Even post-Eisner, Walt Disney Co(NYSE: DIS) has stayed true to its word, recently offering up a live-action remake of Mulan, complete with thanks in the closing credits to a bureau of public security in Xinjiang, the province where it is believed that over a million Uighurs toil in camps. Despite, or, rather, because of Disney s lack of integrity, I am long on Disney s stock. Between its Disney+, its ownership in Hulu, and its willingness to bow to Beijing, Disney is a buy even as its parks and its soul remain barren.Red Rambo And The Sino-Sychophantic BlockbusterAs a child of the 80s, I am no stranger to movies fetishizing American power and so-called exceptionalism. Rambo, Top Gun, Rocky IV these flag-flaunting-themed movies were a Reaganian wet dream. However, these were popular because they reflected and to some extent helped create the zeitgeist of their time.Reagan may have liked War Games but he didn t write it. Nor did he sit in consequential judgement as to which movies played in theaters and which not. (Interestingly, after screening War Games at Camp David, a nervous President Reagan brought it up with his national security team, eventually leading to anti-hacking laws and a total revamping of cyber-security at the Defense Department).Now if we can only get Trump to stop re-watching Idiocracy.But in China, the zeitgeist doesn t have the final say on which movies play the government does. And Hollywood has been bending over backwards to serve their new authoritarian tastemakers. The only  thumbs-up  review that matters now is one that comes from the hand of Secretary Xi.To wit, Hollywood s shameful placation of the PRC has long been on full display. Mostly, it comes in the form of forced cuts like the removal of the Japanese and Taiwanese flags on Tom Cruise s flight jacket in Top Gun: Maverick or an omitted scene shot in Shanghai for Mission Impossible: III because, get this: Images of clothes hanging from clotheslines painted too poor a picture of the city.Then, there are movies that are more actively pro-PRC like Transformers: Age of Extinction in which director Michael Bay spares no expense to Beijing s bidding the American government is the bad guy, the Communist Chinese government is the good guy. A Reaganian wet dream truly transformed into a Reaganian nightmare.One of the most popular franchises in China, the Transformers movies, have consistently topped the viewing charts on iQiyi Inc(NASDAQ: IQ), a video streaming platform known as the  Netflix of China.  American movies are big hits on the platform, and the company just released its first original film Let Life Be Beautiful.The stock was in the green this week after releasing another denial of fraud allegations levied at the company courtesy of Wolfpack Research back in April. Citing in-person surveys of more than 1,500 people and Chinese credit reports of iQiyi s VIEs and WFOEs, the short seller claimed that the Chinese entertainment platform overstated its user numbers and inflated its revenues in SEC filings by as much as 261.7% pre-IPO. Further, in 2019, Wolfpack estimated that iQiyi inflated revenue by 27% to 44%. Are they anotherLuckin Coffee (Pink: LKNCY)? Maybe. But like Luckin, iQiyi can be both a liar and long-term winner. The SEC launched a probe into iQiyi and its parent company, Baidu Inc(NASDAQ: BIDU).Now back to beating up on Beijing and more stock picks.The Hard and Fast Loss of American Soft PowerThe consumer may rule the movie market, but the consumer is also influenced by the options he or she is presented. Film has the power to influence, not just reflect, the zeitgeist. Movies and shows like Roots, Dances With Wolves, The Joy Luck Club, Transparent, The Cider House Rules to name only a few have influenced people s views about a number of social issues and historical events. While America may have shipped nonsense like Baywatch across the seas, it also shipped Brokeback Mountain, the Ang Lee-directed masterpiece that was summarily banned in China.More than military might, the use of American soft power from foreign aid to film has been integral to spreading American ideals and influence around the world. Yes, Hollywood has exported jingoistic action-packed garbage to the world, but for every Rambo there s a Platoon.Blockbuster films have already suffered a critical creative blow due to a combination of home electronics ingenuity and Hollywood laziness. To be beholden to profits is bad enough, but to also be beholden to Beijing is to add a layer of spinelessness to otherwise silly films. Soft power aside, this is just more incentive to make unchallenging films; films that deprive both American and Chinese audiences alike. Ask yourself: Don t Chinese audiences deserve their country s version of All the President s MenFar from hyperbole, it s actually worse than you think. A report by PEN, a non-profit organization that campaigns on free speech and sponsors the Pinter Prize for literature, claimed that American movie studios even invited Chinese government regulators to film sets as advisors on how to avoid censorship in China, which may explain why craft services now include pangolin. Our biggest concern is that Hollywood is increasingly normalizing pre-emptive self-censorship in anticipation of what the Beijing censor is looking for,  said the author of the report¸ James Tager, as cited in a BBC.com piece.More than willing to speak truth to political power to Washington D.C., Hollywood s golden PRC-placed handcuffs prevent it from doing likewise to Beijing. China would have no problem playing my politically-minded satirical comedy Obamaland (again, free on Amazon Prime), but would never consider exhibiting a film that pokes fun of China s political culture. (Unlike Barack Obama, Xi already is President-for-Life, which would negate the humor of the premise).With movie houses outside of China being all but empty until a vaccine, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) is another buy. And so is Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX). I am aware that Netflix trades at about 10 times forward sales ad has a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) ratio of 112, but if you plan to hold for a long time, none of that matters; the stock could be worth double in less than five years. Also, unlike the tech companies covered in the streaming platform s stunning documentary The Social Dilemma, as a subscription-based platform Netflix is comparatively insulated from any market worries over a break-up, however unlikely, of big tech monopolies.AVOD Is a BuyNot the Turkey-trading A.V.O.D. Kurutulmus Gida for all you Robinhood traders who do not read the articles but skim for symbols. I am talking about Advertising-based Video on Demand (AVOD), which is beginning to bite in to the video streaming services market. The longer Covid-19 lasts and until Hollywood gives the Middle Kingdom the middle finger, AVOD market players like Tubi, PlutoTV, Peacock, and, of course, Roku have begun to chip away at the audiences relegated to Subscription Video on Demand (SVOD) services like Netflix and its peers.While the data don t suggest Tubi and the like will take over the space, AVOD usage is growing exponentially. To wit, Fox Corp. acquired Tubi back in April when it had around 25 million monthly users. Fast forward to the end of August, it had 10 million more. Around the same time, the streaming Vudu was sold by Walmart(NYSE: WMT) to the privately-held movie-ticketing company, Fandango. Fox Corp.(NASDAQ: FOXA) is a buy for the patient investor, having not fully recovered from its pre-virus lows.Avoid AT&T (NYSE: T), owner of WarnerMedia (which owns HBO and DirecTV) for now. While its decision to offload DirecTV will clear debt off its books, the loss signals the company has thrown in the towel on content. In 2014, AT&T spent $67.1 billion in total, including absorbing DirecTV's net debt load in the acquisition. It hasn t panned out, and the company is now looking to sell the DirecTV for around $15 billion to private equity investors, an embarrassing loss in a booming video streaming marketplace. AT&T-owned HBO Max currently has 36 million subscribers, while rival Disney+ boasts 60 million.The Show Must Go On... in ChinaMovie theaters are not dead in America; they are resting. Soon enough, the curtains will go up and there will be plenty of caped superheroes fighting for truth, justice, and the Communist Chinese Way. As for movie theater stocks, British-owned Cineworld Group(OTC: CNNWF) is trading so low after suspending U.S. and U.K. operations it might be worth betting a tiny part of your portfolio on. But beware; this cinema stock is one of the most shorted stocks in the market for a reason. Saddled with debt, there is no guarantee this company will make it.AMC Entertainment Holdings(NYSE: AMC) is a safer bet but is still a mess. AMC is owned, in part, by Chinese multinational Dalian Wanda Group, which also owns Wanda Film Holding Co. Ltd (SSE: 002739), another movie stock I wouldn t jump on quite yet, despite China s coronavirus-free movie theaters beginning to boom.Texas-based Cinemark Holdings (NYSE: CNK), the third-largest movie chain in America is yet another mess. However, trading at under a third of what it was pre-virus, upside here could be bigger than AMC if the movie house survives.IMAX Is the Movie Stock BUYWhile the company has received recent analyst downgrades on furloughs and ugly forecasts, IMAX (NYSE: IMAX) is the kind of company created to thrive in a theater business devoted to spectacle over substance. As good as your flat screen is, it s no IMAX. Also, the company s growing presence in China will help. IMAX grossed $53.2 million at the box office in China since theaters began to reopen in late July. Last week, the company collected a record-breaking $13 million during the first two days of the National Day Golden Week holiday in China with the release of Jiang Ziya: Legend of Deification. Earning $11.5 million, it was the biggest weekend box office for an animated film in China.If you are not yet sold on the movie or the stock consider this: I think the hero Jiang Ziya wears some sort of cape.And so these are the new tastemakers of the world, are they? I say we fire the Chinese and the Americans, both. I say give the job to the more sophisitcated British, instead. After Brexit and Covid-19, they will need the work.© 2020 Benzinga.com.

The text is based on information gathered through the testimony of several senior intelligence officials.   "In the absence of significant reordering of resources, the U.S. Government will not achieve the results needed to address China on the global stage," the report says.   Thus, it states that the Government must "strengthen its capacity to categorize, disrupt, and deter all of China's U.S. operations."   In addition, the commission places China as an "emerging power in a global security landscape" and calls Beijing a "postmodern authoritarian state" that monitors and monitors its population all the time through new technologies.   Finally, it notes that Chinese government-backed cyberoperators will continue to be a danger to the United States and that the Intelligence community "will have to make use of artificial intelligence and other technologies to protect national security."   While the report has been drafted by the Democrats, who are a majority in the committee the document has been approved by both political parties. Load-Date: October 1, 2020End of Document

CHINA STATE MEDIA VIDEO EXTOLLING CROSS-BORDER MARRIAGE GETS TOUGH REVIEWS IN MYANMARStates News ServiceOctober 5, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1470 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A glowing video by China's state news agency on the happy life of a Myanmar woman who married a rural Chinese man has stumbled over sensitivities about bride trafficking in the Southeast Asian country, where hundreds of women have vanished across the border with its giant neighbor.The three-minute video released on the Burmese-language Facebook page of China's Xinhua news agency, "Myanmar Woman's Rural Life in China," drew nearly 2 million views within a few days of its posting on Sept. 21.But before long, Xinhua's story of a Myanmar woman named Shao Yue, who credits her good her life to her marriage to a Chinese man and government anti-poverty programs in China, was being panned by anti-trafficking NGOs and actual trafficking victims for painting a misleading picture."When I arrived in his village, the streets were made of dirt, my husband's house had doors and windows made of wood, and the floor was made of concrete," Shao Yue says in the video."Many houses were not good then, but it began to change 10 years ago," she says. "Now most of the houses have been renovated."The regional government's poverty reduction program helped Shao Yue and her husband renovate their rural home, she said. It also provides about U.S. $74 to each of their children during the academic year and reimbursed Shao Yue's medical expenses when she needed surgery."At that time, my husband was unemployed, so the government gave him a job as a forest guard," she says. "The government helped with a lot of things."As of Oct. 3, the video, which does not say how Shao Yue met her husband, had 39,000 reactions and 963 comments from viewers, many of whom dismissed it as spin from China."This is mere propaganda," a viewer identified as Yee Mon commented. "It is not possible to be OK [in China]. Anyway, do not believe it. Don't dream about it, fellow Myanmar women and ethnic women."A viewed who goes by the name Sapphire T T Sapphire said: "This video should not be shown. If innocent girls and women see it and go to China, human trafficking cases will increase."A viewer named Yuki Singh wrote: "You are lucky because you met a good man. I am happy for you."But the commenter chastised the news agency, saying "Please don't distribute propaganda. Is this the news? Why don't you write about human traffickers crowded at the border? There are many victims whose lives have been ruined by it there, too."Cashing in on the gender gapAccording to Myanmar government figures, nearly 200 Myanmar citizens were trafficked to China in 2019. That same year, authorities rescued more than 200 people taken captive up until then, and arrested more than 500 for their involvement in trafficking.But a March 2019 report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) focusing on trafficking in women from conflict-ridden Kachin state said traffickers were cashing in on a huge gender gap in rural China, where a preference for boys, exacerbated by the "one-child policy" in place from 1979 to 2015, has created a shortage of brides."It is difficult to estimate the total number of women and girls being trafficked from Myanmar to China for sale as brides," said New York-based HRW."No reliable statistics on the total number exist on either side of the border," the group said.Gathering accurate statistics would be difficult, as many cases of missing women are never reported, many trafficked women and girls are never found, and many women and girls who escape may keep their experience secret due to stigma," it added.Inside Myanmar, the Xinhua video sparked criticism from media and NGO leaders, who linked it to the country's trafficking problem, and from a trafficking victim.One 30-year-old Myanmar woman from Yangon region who had been trafficked twice and escaped from Longyuan township in Fujian province, said the life she had in China was a far cry from the wedded bliss portrayed in the Xinhua video."Life was pretty difficult, [and] because I was away from my family and friends in Myanmar, I never felt good," she said.In 2016, agents lured her with a promise of a restaurant job in the Chinese border town of Ruili, across the Shweli River from the Myanmar trading hub Muse in Shan state, the woman said.But instead they transported her China and sold her to a Chinese man she was forced to marry. The man confined her to their apartment and physically abused her, she said.The woman escaped, but was caught and returned to her husband. His family, however, decided to sell her to another man, who was kind to her and let her return to Myanmar."It is not possible for women who marry Chinese citizens to have convenient lives and get assistance from the government," said the woman, who requested anonymity for safety reasons.Myint Kyaw, a member of Myanmar Press Council, told RFA that "Xinhua is the Chinese government's mouthpiece, so they are broadcasting the government's opinion.""Maybe this woman in the video is one of a kind, but she could be the exception," he said. "Many Myanmar women have been sold repeatedly. This propaganda video is an insult to all the victims of human trafficking in China."Kyaw Thaung, director the Myanmar Association in Thailand (MAT), a humanitarian group that assists Myanmar migrant workers in Thailand and helps return trafficked woman, blasted Xinhua for producing the video."As a major news media organization, it should not broadcast such a misleading video because Myanmar is one of the counties severely affected by human trafficking," he told RFA. "It is also racially degrading.""The idea that a Myanmar woman will have a good life by marrying a Chinese man is misleading," he said.Agents persuade young women from poor families to pay them a 2 million or 3 million kyat (U.S. $1,500-2,260) service fee to arrange their marriage to a Chinese man, telling them it is a quick way to escape poverty, Kyaw Thaung said."It could exacerbate existing problems," he said, estimating that as many as 99 percent of Myanmar women trafficked to China are sold to Chinese men as sex slaves or brides.It is a challenge for MAT to help all trafficking victims who contact the organization because of a lack of coordination between government ministries or human trafficking police in Myanmar and China, he said.Hla Hla Yee, director of the Legal Clinic Myanmar (LCM), which provides free consultations and legal aid to those who cannot afford them, said the video was unacceptable."This is shameless propaganda and inappropriate," she said. "This video shines a spotlight on the good life of one woman and ignores all the women who were forced into trafficking and prostitution."The situation of Myanmar women being trafficked to China is at its worst, Hla Hla Yee said, adding that the cases that LCM handles are "pretty horrible.""In most cases, Myanmar women are sold as brides and forced into prostitution," she said. "Some women die of disease after they return home to Myanmar."Stable, happy lifeIn a response to the controversy, reported by RFA's Myanmar Service in Burmese, Xinhua defended its depiction of China's "fight against poverty from the perspective of a Burmese woman" and denied that Shao Yue was trafficked from Myanmar.Although no allegation that Shao Yue was trafficked was reported, Xinhua said in a statement posted online that "some media outlets and some misrepresentations of such media coverage damaged the woman's reputation, and Xinhua is deeply saddened.""China has never denied the existence of the problem of human trafficking, but its presence does not mean that a Burmese woman, Ma [honorific] Shao Yue, was trafficked to China," Xinhua said.Shao Yue met her husband, Gao Pao Hong, who worked on the China-Myanmar border, in 2007, and she accompanied him to Chiyuan, his hometown in Fujian province, and registered her marriage, the news agency said.Her current life is stable and happy, it said.RFA contacted the head of public relations at the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar for comment but received no response.Both Myanmar and China are listed in the Tier 3 category in the U.S. government's 2020 "Trafficking in Persons Report" (TIP), which ranks 188 countries and territories around the world as Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 2 Watch List, or Tier 3, in descending order based on whether they meet the minimum standards to combat trafficking set by U.S. law.During the reporting period, police identified 335 victims of trafficking, including both men and women, in addition to 216 women and three men who may have experienced some form of exploitation in China, the report noted."Many of these cases involved forced marriage that included corollary forced labor or sex trafficking, the report said.Reported by Thant Zin Oo for RFA's Myanmar Service.

US charges 5 Chinese citizens in global hacking campaignAssociated Press Financial WireSeptember 16, 2020 Wednesday 9:04 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; WASHINGTON DATELINELength: 732 wordsByline: ERIC TUCKER, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department has charged five Chinese citizens with hacks targeting more than 100 companies and institutions in the United States and abroad, including social media and video game companies as well as universities and telecommunications providers, officials said Wednesday.The five defendants remain fugitives, but prosecutors say two Malaysian businessmen charged with conspiring with the alleged hackers to profit off the attacks on the billion-dollar video game industry were arrested in Malaysia this week and now face extradition proceedings.The indictments are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to call out cybercrimes by China. In July, prosecutors accused hackers of working with the Chinese government to target companies developing vaccines for the coronavirus and of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of intellectual property and trade secrets from companies across the world.Though those allegations were tailored to the pandemic, the charges announced Wednesday — and the range of victims identified — were significantly broader and involved attacks done both for monetary gain but also more conventional espionage purposes.In unsealing three related indictments, officials laid out a wide-ranging hacking scheme targeting a variety of business sectors and academia and carried out by a China-based group known as APT41. That group has been tracked by the cybersecurity firm Mandiant Threat Intelligence, which described the hackers as prolific and successful at blending criminal and espionage operations.The hackers relied on a series of tactics, including attacks in which they managed to compromise the networks of software providers, modify the source code and conduct further attacks on the companies' customers.The Justice Department did not directly link the hackers to the Chinese government. But officials said the hackers were probably serving as proxies for Beijing because some of the targets, including pro-democracy activists and students at a Taiwan university, were in line with government interests and didn't appear to be about scoring a profit.“A hacker for profit is not going to hack a pro-democracy group,” said acting U.S. Attorney Michael Sherwin of the District of Columbia, where the cases were filed. Those targets, including some that bear the “hallmark” of conventional espionage, point to the conclusion that the hackers had at least an indirect connection with the government, Sherwin said.In addition, one of the five defendants told a colleague that he was very close to the Chinese Ministry of State Security and would be protected “unless something very big happens,” and also agreed not to go after domestic targets in China, said Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen.But some of the conduct was clearly profit driven, officials said. Two of the Chinese defendants, for instance, were charged with breaking into video game companies and obtaining digital currency that was then sold for profit on the black market, officials said.Rosen, the Justice Department's No. 2 official, criticized the Chinese government for what he said was a failure to disrupt hacking crimes and to hold hackers accountable.“Ideally, I would be thanking Chinese law enforcement authorities for their cooperation in the matter and the five Chinese hackers would now be in custody awaiting trial,” Rosen said. “Unfortunately, the record of recent years tells us that the Chinese Communist Party has a demonstrated history of choosing a different path, that of making China safe for their own cyber criminals, so long as they help with its goals of stealing intellectual property and stifling freedom.”There was no immediate response Wednesday to an email seeking comment from the Chinese Embassy in Washington.The Justice Department also announced that it had seized hundreds of accounts, servers and domain names used by the defendants and that it had worked with Microsoft and other private sector companies to deny the hackers continued access to tools, accounts and hacking infrastructure.Also Wednesday, the department announced charges against two Iranian nationals accused of stealing hundreds of terabytes of data in a hacking campaign targeting institutions — and perceived enemies of Iran — in the U.S., Europe and the Middle East.____Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAPLoad-Date: September 16, 2020End of Document

Messner's law firm represented state-run Chinese insurerAssociated Press State & LocalOctober 6, 2020 Tuesday 10:00 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICAL NEWSLength: 548 wordsByline: HOLLY RAMER, Associated PressDateline: CONCORD, N.H. BodyCONCORD, N.H. (AP) — Republican Senate candidate Corky Messner takes a hard line against China in his campaign, but his law firm once represented an insurance company run by the Chinese government that sued a U.S. manufacturer.Messner, who hopes to unseat Democratic U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen next month, is a founding partner of Messner Reeves, a Denver-based law firm with offices in five states. On the campaign trail, he is a frequent critic of China, blaming it for the coronavirus pandemic and calling it a rogue country that has damaged U.S. manufacturing.“We need to bring back the economy so our families can preserve the American dream,” he says in a recent ad touting his economic plan. “In my USA Plan, we can provide incentives to American business to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States from China – and create manufacturing jobs here in New Hampshire.”In 2016, Messner Reeves attorneys represented China Export and Credit Insurance Corp. when it sued The Carlstar Group, a Tennessee-based maker of specialty tires, and several of its partner companies.China Export and Credit was seeking $1 million it claimed was owed to a Chinese exporter, while The Carlstar Group said its payments were diverted after hackers breached the exporter’s data network. The suit was dismissed in 2017 after the two sides reached a settlement, and Messner Reeves no longer represents the Chinese insurer.Asked about the lawsuit, Messner’s senior campaign adviser, Mike Biundo, said Monday it is impossible for Messner to know the inner workings of each case, given that he built a national law firm with thousands of clients.“Further, it would not be appropriate for his business to make political decisions about what clients the firm engages with. Our republic is built on the premise that everyone is entitled to a lawyer,” he said in an email.Biundo also took a swipe at Shaheen, via her husband, attorney Billy Shaheen, whose law firm has represented clients accused of sexual assault, stalking and other crimes.“If the Shaheen campaign would like to discuss the questionable clients Shaheen & Gordon has served, we’d welcome that discussion,” Biundo said.Josh Marcus-Blank, spokesperson for Shaheen’s campaign, said the senator is not involved in her husband’s law firm. And he sought to contrast Shaheen’s record of standing up for New Hampshire small businesses with what he called “Messner’s willingness to cash in with the communist Chinese government against an American business.”“Messner is conflating an American’s right to legal representation with shaking down an American company on behalf of a foreign government,” he said.In addition to bringing back jobs from China, Messner’s USA, or “Unleashing the Strength of America," plan also calls for legislation to ensure that government pension funds divest from companies controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.In May, the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board said it would halt its decision to invest billions from the retirement assets of federal government employees in what Shaheen and others called “opaque Chinese firms engaged in human rights abuses.”She and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, also sponsored bipartisan legislation to permanently prevent the steering of federal retirement savings to China.Load-Date: October 6, 2020End of Document

Opinion: ASU shouldn't let the new Cold War hinder its relationship with ChinaThe State Press: Arizona State UniversitySeptember 1, 2020 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 733 wordsByline: Sebastian MiscenichBodyBy Sebastian Miscenich |09/01/2020 7:07pmIn light of increased U.S. aggression against China, some students have called for ASU to distance itself from its Chinese counterparts in academia.However, reducing cooperation only hurts students. It narrows their experiences and worldview and hinders the possibility for increased understanding between China and the U.S. at such a critical juncture.While the latest push to demonize Chinese scholarship stems from worsening relations amid the COVID-19 pandemic, this effort is not new.Last year, ASU closed its Confucius Institute, a Chinese government mission that provided language and cultural competency lessons to ASU students. The closure was coerced by the federal government, which threatened to withhold funding if the Institute remained open.ASU students seriously wishing to study Mandarin now have no choice but to turn to the U.S. Department of Defense-funded Chinese Language Flagship Program. One cannot simultaneously maintain that Chinese government funding ensures bias in the Confucius Institute and that U.S. military funding does not tinge the academic experience of students in the Flagship program.However, the campaign against Chinese people in academia doesn't only affect ASU and American students.It is unfortunate that some US politicians are suffering from "anti-China syndrome". They reflexively strike at everything that has anything to do with China and crack down on China unconditionally out of fear of China's development. - Hua Chunying ??? (@SpokespersonCHN) August 24, 2020The U.S. Department of Justice has begun an increased effort to target Chinese researchers in the country under pretenses of protecting American intellectual property.Chinese international students across the country have also reported heightened racism stemming from President Donald Trump blaming China for COVID-19. The Trump administration has also been considering placing "restrictions" on Chinese scholars, according to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.Ching Yin Luk, who goes by Kelvin, is a senior at ASU studying industrial design. A member and a former president of the Coalition of International Students, Luk said in a Facebook Messenger conversation that he initially chose ASU because of the school's reputation for welcoming international students and having "a very diverse culture."He also said that although ASU has lived up to that reputation in his experience, Chinese international students are recently facing increased Sinophobia, sentiment against Chinese people or its culture, across the country."Over 370,000 Chinese International student(s) are currently in USA and most of them can't go back because most international flight(s) were suspended," Luk said. "They are also facing tremendous health risk because the overflow of (the) American medical system, which have been in maximum capacity in the last few month(s)."Luk said that cooperation between Chinese and American universities is now more important than ever to confront humanity's common enemies, like COVID-19."As far as I know China have been taking effective action toward the virus which leads to a relatively good result of containing the virus compare(d) to the world," Luk said.Luk believes if the American people and its universities asked for help from Chinese universities and its research organizations, the collaboration would "drastically speed up the process of containing the pandemic and secure the precious lives of the American people."And I completely agree. One of the many truths the pandemic has revealed is that all people in this world are inextricably connected. Despite what American politicians may say, there is no destiny for the people of the U.S. separate from that of the people of China.ASU and all American universities should strive toward greater cooperation and refuse to be pressured into the U.S.'s aggressive posturing against the Chinese people.Reach the columnist at smisceni@asu.edu or follow @IMiscenich on Twitter.Editor's note: The opinions presented in this column are the author's and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.Want to join the conversation?

Op-ed: Disney attempts to capture Chinese historyThe Clause: Azusa Pacific UniversitySeptember 20, 2020 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: LIFESTYLE; Pg. 1Length: 509 wordsBodyThe views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author alone and do not necessarily represent the position of ZU Media or APU.But falls short, yet againOn Sept. 4, Disney released the new live-action movie "Mulan" on their streaming platform. It gained over $35 million on opening weekend. But just as reviews began pouring in, many were disgusted over a certain part of the credits. Which part? The part that mentioned a location in China known to have Muslim detention camps was used for filming.In the credits, viewers saw Disney thank the government in the province of Xinjiang, where a part of the movie was shot. But, it was in this region that the Chinese Government put over a million Muslims in concentration camps since 2014. Viewers have since ridiculed Disney. Because of this, the movie didn't do well in box offices, both in the United States and China. This doesn't surprise me at all. Disney had a chance to state that they don't agree with what the Chinese Government was doing, but they didn't. The controversy surrounding "Mulan" was already surfacing before its release on Disney+. Last year, the star actor of the film, Liu Yifei, publicly supported the Chinese Police even though the law enforcement in China used brutal force against the pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.The plotline had issues as well. While the movie was rated as average, many complained over the movie's storytelling. The biggest issue I had was it had too many identical scenes with minimal differences. The film also introduced the new character of the witch, but the character was considered "wasted potential." The witch needed further background and purpose to give the character more substance.Even though it contained amazing fight scenes with katanas, vivid imagery and brought back characters from the original film - except for Mushu - it wasn't really liked by China itself.Box offices in China showed the movie only got $23 million in opening weekend. The reviews from China stated the movie was an insult to the Chinese culture and history. Some even went so far to say the movie is a disgrace to the original film. This primarily stems from the movie portrayal. While the actors themselves were ethnically Chinese, the scriptwriters were white and would not have had the same experience or understanding of Chinese culture. Because of this, the acting looked like it was based on stereotypes and not authentic information. Not only that, but the culture shown in the movie related more to Western, specifically American, ideals. One viewer said, "It's full of Western stereotypes and conjectures about China, and particularly ancient China." While blunt, I believe Disney used what was most easily accessible to them, which was stereotypical views of Chinese culture."Mulan" is a novel story. Taking place in China, a place that is full of history, it's saddening that a movie trying to be accurate only became more of the opposite. In the end, Disney failed to recreate a story that could have been credible to Chinese culture.Load-Date: September 26, 2020End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 36 of 388CHINA'S INFLUENCE ON THE GLOBAL HUMAN RIGHTS SYSTEM  Page 49 of 388Congressional Research Service Report: 'Intellectual Property Violations & China - Legal Remedies'  Page 53 of 388The coercive diplomacy of the Chinese Communist Party and its impact on the world  Page 60 of 388Senate Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Committee Issues Testimony From FBI Director Wray  Page 68 of 388U.S.-China Business Council Issues Public Comment on Office of Trade Representative Notice  Page 70 of 388DR.
