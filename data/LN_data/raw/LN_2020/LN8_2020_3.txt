All Rights ReservedLength: 4521 wordsBody-- Stock market closes at session highs in tight-ranged session-- Reports indicated coronavirus relief bill negotiations remained deadlocked-- Longer-dated Treasuries continued to advanceStocks rise concurrently with longer-dated Treasuries - Aug 04 - 16:20 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 gained 0.4% on Tuesday to close at session highs in a tight-ranged session, even as negotiations surrounding the next coronavirus relief bill remained deadlocked. The Nasdaq Composite (+0.4%) kept pace with the benchmark index to close at a record high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.6%) and Russell 2000 (+0.7%) outperformed.  According to media reports, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said negotiators are no closer to a deal than a week ago while Senator Perdue (R-GA) estimated that stimulus talks could last an additional two weeks. While discouraging, the broad market was not deterred by the news, as nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors closed higher. The energy sector rose 2.5% amid higher oil prices ($41.68/bbl, +0.66, +1.6%), followed by gains in the real estate (+1.4%), utilities (+1.4%), and materials (+1.3%) sectors. The health care (-0.5%) and financials (-0.4%) sectors were the lone holdouts.Financial stocks were pressured by some curve-flattening activity in the Treasury market, which reflected some growth-related angst given that lawmakers remained divided over stimulus talks. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.12%, while the 10-yr yield fell five basis points to 0.52%. Within the tech space, Microsoft (MSFT 213.29, -3.25, -1.5%) cooled off from yesterday's TikTok-driven rally, while Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 85.04, +7.37) surged 9.5% to fresh record highs. AMD shot higher after Jefferies raised its price target on the stock to $95 from $86 on a view that it will capitalize on Intel's (INTC 49.13, +0.83, +1.7%) production issues.Gold futures ($2020.80/ozt, +$33.80, +1.7%) also rallied to new highs above $2000/ozt. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 93.27 after trading higher in the morning. Tuesday's economic data was limited to the Factory Orders report for June, which increased 6.2% m/m (Briefing.com consensus 5.2%) following a downwardly revised 7.7% increase (from 8.0%) in May.• The key takeaway from the report is the affirmation that business spending picked up in June as economies reopened, evidenced by a 3.4% increase in new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft that was up slightly from the 3.3% increase noted in the Advance Durable Goods Orders report.Looking ahead, investors will receive the ADP Employment Change Report for July, the Trade Balance report for June, and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.• Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTD• S&P 500 +2.3% YTD• Dow Jones Industrial Average -6.0% YTD• Russell 2000 -9.1% YTDNASDAQ - 1938 - 1288 - 3.9 blnNYSE - 1902 - 1057 - 863.3 mlnDJ30 - +164.07 - 26828.47NASDAQ - +38.37 - 10941.24SP500 - +11.90 - 3306.51Energy stocks follow oil prices higher - Aug 04 - 15:25 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.1%, while the Russell 2000 outperforms with a 0.5% gain. One last look at the S&P 500 sectors shows energy (+2.4%), materials (+1.7%), utilities (+1.7%), and real estate (+1.3%) in the leadership positions, while the financials (-0.6%), health care (-0.7%), and information technology (-0.2%) sectors still trade lower. WTI crude futures settled higher by 1.6% (+$0.66) to $41.68/bbl.NASDAQ - 1820 - 1406 - 3.2 blnNYSE - 1808 - 1142 - 490.0 mlnDJ30 - +110.91 - 26775.31NASDAQ - +1.19 - 10904.06SP500 - +4.61 - 3299.22Coronavirus relief talks yield little progress - Aug 04 - 14:55 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading back in negative territory just below its flat line. The market dipped lower on news that coronavirus relief talks remain at a standstill. According to reports, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin told GOP lawmakers that negotiators are no closer to a deal than a week ago while Senator Perdue (R-GA) estimated that stimulus talks could last an additional two weeks. That's not the kind of news that the market wanted to hear considering that the expired benefits were a large factor in the market's rally since March. Looking ahead, Walt Disney (DIS 117.43, +1.08, +1.0%), Activision Blizzard (ATVI 85.63, +0.79, +1.0%), and Beyond Meat (BYND 139.69, +5.37, +4.0%) are some notable companies that will report earnings after the close. NASDAQ - 1725 - 1514 - 3.1 blnNYSE - 1741 - 1218 - 458.6 mlnDJ30 - +59.70 - 26724.1NASDAQ - -24.61 - 10878.26SP500 - -1.11 - 3293.5Earnings Movers Dominate S&P 500; Nasdaq Returns To Negative Territory - Aug 04 - 14:30 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (-0.08%) slipped back into the red in recent action, while its counterparts shaved a bit off their gains.S&P 500 constituents Mosaic (MOS 15.70, +2.02, +14.77%), Vornado Realty Trust (VNO 36.31, +2.29, +6.73%), and Williams Companies (WMB 20.98, +1.26, +6.39%) pepper the top of the standings following their quarterly earnings reports.Conversely, Evergy (EVRG 55.71, -6.97, -11.12%) sits at the bottom of the index following reports that the company could scrap its plans to explore a sale and instead remain independent in conjunction with tomorrow's quarterly results.NASDAQ - 1783 - 1462 - 2.84 blnNYSE - 1781 - 1162 - 425.0 mlnDJ30 - +91.49 - 26755.89NASDAQ - -8.54 - 10894.33SP500 - +1.63 - 3296.24Gold Settles Above $2000/oz For First Time Ever - Aug 04 - 14:00 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages haven't moved much in the last half hour; the DJIA (+0.40%) still holds the lead.Gold futures settled $34.70 higher (+1.7%) to $2,021.00/oz, helped by declining yields and a weaker greenback.The U.S. Dollar Index slips about 0.2% to 93.37.NASDAQ - 1817 - 1420 - 2.69 blnNYSE - 1792 - 1130 - 404.0 mlnDJ30 - +105.90 - 26770.3NASDAQ - +18.21 - 10921.08SP500 - +5.82 - 3300.43Nasdaq Composite, S&P 500 Move Back Into Positive Territory - Aug 04 - 13:30 ET[BRIEFING.COM] A modest move higher in the major averages in the last half hour has both the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 back in positive territory.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that Dow (DOW 41.50, +1.41, +3.52%), Exxon Mobil (XOM 43.30, +1.05, +2.49%), and McDonald's (MCD 198.59, +4.19, +2.16%) are outperforming.Conversely, athletic apparel manufacturer Nike (NKE 97.14, -1.19, -1.21%) sits near the bottom of the index despite a dearth of corporate news.The DJIA has now added 377 points, or 1.43%, over the last calendar week.NASDAQ - 1740 - 1493 - 2.49 blnNYSE - 1766 - 1159 - 376.0 mlnDJ30 - +92.08 - 26756.48NASDAQ - +5.84 - 10908.71SP500 - +4.93 - 3299.54Mixed day on Wall Street, while Treasuries gain - Aug 04 - 12:55 ET[BRIEFING.COM]  The major indices are trading mixed in midday action, while U.S. Treasuries continue to gain. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) currently has the advantage with a 0.4% gain, while the S&P 500 (+0.1%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.1%), and Russell 2000 (+0.2%) trade closer to their flat lines.  Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are trading in positive territory, though, led by the energy (+2.3%), materials (+1.2%), real estate (+1.2%), and utilities (+1.0%) sectors. The financials (-0.6%), health care (-0.4%), and information technology (-0.1%) sectors are the lone holdouts.Within the tech sector, Apple (AAPL 439.60, +3.81, +0.9%) and Adv. Micro Devices (AMD 85.30, +7.63, +9.8%) continue to advance. AMD is getting a boost after Jefferies raised its price target on the stock to $95 from $86 on a view that it will continue to gain at the expense of Intel's (INTC 48.60, +0.30, +0.6%) production issues. Conversely, mega-caps Microsoft (MSFT 212.05, -4.48, -2.1%), Facebook (FB 249.22, -2.73, -1.1%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1461.77, -12.68, -0.9%) are having an influential drag on the market. Recall, MSFT shares surged 5.6% yesterday on TikTok-acquisition optimism. Elsewhere, the moves in the Treasury market have been noteworthy. The 10-yr yield has dropped five basis points to 0.51%, nearing its all-time closing low of 0.50%, as investors presumably remain concerned about economic growth and coronavirus relief bill negotiations. The lower yields have hurt sentiment in the financials space. On the earnings front, Take-Two Interactive (TTWO 176.30, +8.16, +5.2%) stands out after providing upbeat results and guidance. Apple supplier CirrusLogic (CRUS 67.66, -6.83, -9.2%) has dropped 9% following its report. Today's economic data was limited to the Factory Orders report for June, which increased 6.2% m/m (Briefing.com consensus 5.2%) following a downwardly revised 7.7% increase (from 8.0%) in May.• The key takeaway from the report is the affirmation that business spending picked up in June as economies reopened, evidenced by a 3.4% increase in new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft that was up slightly from the 3.3% increase noted in the Advance Durable Goods Orders report.NASDAQ - 1631 - 1601 - 2.3 blnNYSE - 1712 - 1202 - 347.0 mlnDJ30 - +102.30 - 26766.7NASDAQ - -11.32 - 10891.55SP500 - +2.83 - 3297.44FAANG stocks trade mixed - Aug 04 - 12:25 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.1%, the Dow is up 0.4%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.2%. The action remains mixed and tight-ranged from an index perspective. Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results. Apple (AAPL 438.70, +2.93, +0.7%) and Netflix (NFLX 504.36, +5.74, +1.2%) trade higher, while Alphabet (GOOG 1460.54, -13.91, -0.9%), Facebook (FB 248.65, -3.30, -1.3%), and Amazon (AMZN 3107.07, -1.75, -0.1%) trade lower. In corporate news, Ford Motor (F 6.76, +0.07, +1.1%) announced CEO Jim Hackett will be retiring and will be replaced by COO Jim Farley on Oct. 1. NASDAQ - 1586 - 1624 - 2.1 blnNYSE - 1696 - 1197 - 324.0 mlnDJ30 - +101.37 - 26765.77NASDAQ - -17.36 - 10885.51SP500 - +2.70 - 3297.31Microsoft pulls back - Aug 04 - 11:55 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade sideways with a 0.2% gain. The Nasdaq is flat. Microsoft (MSFT 210.96, -5.58, -2.6%) has been a heavy drag on the market after climbing nearly 6% yesterday on TikTok-acquisition hype.

It was another record close for the Nasdaq, while the Russell 2000 outperformed with a 1.8% gain.Microsoft rallied on news that it was continuing talks to acquire TikTok while Apple remained hot following its 10.5% earnings-driven gain from Friday. Essentially, today was a growth-oriented trade that also saw the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rise 1.9% and the iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology ETF (IBB 138.57, +4.20) rise 3.1%. Consequently, the information technology (+2.5%) and health care (+1.1%) sectors finished atop the sector standings, while the defensive-oriented real estate (-1.5%) and utilities (-1.1%) sectors closed lower by more than 1.0%.Within the health care space, Goldman Sachs upgraded Merck (MRK 82.56, +2.32, +2.9%) to Buy from Neutral, Eli Lilly (LLY 152.84, +2.55, +1.7%) started a Phase 3 trial for the prevention of COVID-19 at long-term care facilities, and VarianMedical (VAR 174.11, +31.39, +22.0%) agreed to be acquired by Siemens Healthineers for $16.4 billion, or $177.50/share, in cash. In other deal-making news, Marathon Petroleum (MPC 38.57, +0.37, +1.0%) agreed to sell its Speedway business to 7-Eleven for $21 billion in cash.

To be sure, manufacturing conditions were better in July than they were in prior months, but it is still a stretch to say that manufacturing activity is robust since uncertainty about the demand outlook remains high.• Total construction spending declined 0.7% m/m in June (Briefing.com consensus +1.3%) on the heels of an upwardly revised 1.7% decline (from -2.1%) in May. Total private construction spending was down 0.7% and total public construction spending was also down 0.7%.The key takeaway from the report is that total construction spending was up 0.1% yr/yr despite the adverse effects of the pandemic, bolstered by the strength of nonresidential public construction spending (+5.7% yr/yr).Looking ahead, investors will receive Factory Orders for June on Tuesday.• Nasdaq Composite +21.5% YTD• S&P 500 +2.0% YTD• Dow Jones Industrial Average -6.6% YTD • Russell 2000 -9.7% YTDNASDAQ - 2314 - 925 - 4.1 blnNYSE - 1868 - 1080 - 871.5 blnDJ30 - +236.08 - 26664.4NASDAQ - +157.52 - 10902.87SP500 - +23.49 - 3294.61Load-Date: August 4, 2020End of Document

Microsoft confirms talks seeking to buy US arm of TikTokAssociated Press Financial WireAugust 3, 2020 Monday 1:05 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWSLength: 783 wordsByline: CATHY BUSSEWITZ, AP Business WriterDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) — Microsoft confirmed Sunday it is in talks with Chinese company ByteDance to acquire the U.S. arm of its popular video app TikTok and has discussed with President Donald Trump his concerns about security and censorship surrounding such an acquisition.In a statement, Microsoft said Microsoft and ByteDance have provided notice of their intent to explore a deal resulting in Microsoft owning and operating the TikTok service in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The company said it expects those talks to conclude by Sept. 15.Trump said on Friday that he would soon ban TikTok in the United States. Trump and CEO Satya Nadella have spoken, the company said, and Microsoft was prepared to continue exploring the purchase of TikTok's U.S. operations after their conversation.“Microsoft fully appreciates the importance of addressing the President’s concerns. It is committed to acquiring TikTok subject to a complete security review and providing proper economic benefits to the United States, including the United States Treasury,” the Microsoft statement said.The White House did not immediately comment on the Microsoft statement.Previously, there were reports that Microsoft was in advanced talks to buy the U.S. operations of TikTok, which has been a source of national security and censorship concerns for the Trump administration. Earlier Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo again raised the administration's warnings about social media platform.“These Chinese software companies doing business in the United States, whether it’s TikTok or WeChat — there are countless more ... are feeding data directly to the Chinese Communist Party, their national security apparatus,” Pompeo said on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.”“Could be their facial recognition patterns. It could be information about their residence, their phone numbers, their friends, who they’re connected to. Those — those are the issues that President Trump has made clear we’re going to take care of," Pompeo said.In its statement, Microsoft said it may invite other American investors to participate on a minority basis in the purchase of TikTok. Financial terms were undisclosed.TikTok’s U.S. user data is stored in the U.S., with strict controls on employee access, and its biggest investors come from the U.S., the company said earlier Sunday. “We are committed to protecting our users’ privacy and safety as we continue working to bring joy to families and meaningful careers to those who create on our platform,” a TikTok spokesperson said.A federal committee has been reviewing whether Trump could ban TikTok in the U.S. Its members agree that TikTok cannot remain in the U.S. in its current form because it "risks sending back information on 100 million Americans,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.“We all agree there has to be a change ... everybody agrees it can’t exist as it does," Mnuchin said Sunday on ABC's “This Week.”As speculation grew over a ban or sale of the social media platform's U.S. business, TikTok posted a video on Saturday saying, “We’re not planning on going anywhere.”TikTok's catchy videos and ease of use has made it popular, and it says it has tens of millions of users in the U.S. and hundreds of millions globally. Its parent company, Bytedance Ltd., launched TikTok in 2017. It bought Musical.ly, a video service popular with teens in the U.S. and Europe, and combined the two. It has a similar service, Douyin, for users in China.But TikTok's Chinese ownership has raised concern about the potential for sharing user data with Chinese officials as well as censorship of videos critical of the Chinese government. TikTok says it does not censor videos and it would not give the Chinese government access to U.S. user data.“The President, when he makes his decision, will make sure that everything we have done drives us as close to zero risk for the American people,” Pompeo said. “That’s the mission set that he laid out for all of us when we get — we began to evaluate this now several months back. We’re closing in on a solution. And I think you will see the president’s announcement shortly.”The debate over TikTok parallels a broader U.S. security crackdown on Chinese companies, including telecom providers Huawei and ZTE. The Trump administration has ordered that the U.S. stop buying equipment from those providers to be used in U.S. networks. Trump has also tried to steer allies away from Huawei over concerns that the Chinese government has access to its data, which Huawei denies.___Follow Cathy Bussewitz on Twitter at www.twitter.com/cbussewitz___AP Business Writers Anne D'Innocenzio and Tali Arbel contributed to this report.Load-Date: August 2, 2020End of Document

CRITICAL TEST OF ACADEMIC FREEDOM FOR AUSTRALIAN UNIVERSITIESStates News ServiceAugust 4, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 768 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:The University of New South Wales (UNSW) boldly urges students to "bring your difference."Unfortunately, my recent experience suggests that the university might be more interested in damage control than an open marketplace of ideas. But this is a test of academic freedom that UNSW can't afford to fail.I am the Australia director of Human Rights Watch and an adjunct law lecturer at UNSW. Last week, the university's media department interviewed me about the human rights implications of Hong Kong's new national security law. I expressed concern and urged governments to call on the United Nations Secretary-General to appoint a special envoy on Hong Kong.UNSW published the article on its website and posted a tweet quoting me and linking to the article from the @UNSW account.Some students and others from China were so enraged by criticism of the Chinese government that they quickly organised an aggressive campaign targeting UNSW's social media channels, calling the article hurtful and saying it should be removed from the UNSW website. Some social media users threatened to boycott UNSW, others said that I should recant my statements or the university should sack me.UNSW briefly removed the article from its website twice, and then reinstated it, shifting it from the university's main news page to the UNSW Law page. UNSW also deleted the tweet quoting me saying it decided "to remove the posts on our social channels as they were not in line with our policies and the views of an academic were being misconstrued as representing the university." But other tweets quoting UNSW academics that could "also be misconstrued as representing the university" have not been removed, suggesting at best an arbitrarily enforced policy.Human Rights Watch has been tracking Chinese government threats to academic freedom in Australia and other countries since 2015, including detailing episodes like this involving other scholars. The pro-Chinese Communist Party (CCP) students certainly don't have to agree with my remarks. But I was still somewhat shocked at the ferocity of their response, and disappointed at the university's feeble reaction. I worry that other academics and students from China or who write about China may be afraid to raise their voices.A 23-year-old UNSW law student from China recently told Human Rights Watch: "I wanted to study abroad to have a way of life so I'm not afraid to share my opinion. In our law department there are a lot of students who share the same opinion as me but they are too afraid to speak out, they are afraid of retaliation ... If you protest against the CCP abroad they will find people you love and hurt them to make you pay."This fear is real. Human Rights Watch has documented that families in China have been harassed and questioned because of activities of their relatives in Australia. Students from China are watching to see how UNSW responds to the pro-CCP students' threats.What if my experience makes students or other academics think twice before speaking in class on topics like Xinjiang, Hong Kong or Tibet? What if academics think twice about taking a media call on Hong Kong because of the potential backlash? Universities need to protect the academic freedom of all students and scholars, not cave to pressure from those with little apparent regard for academic freedom's importance.Human Rights Watch's work shows this problem isn't unique to UNSW or to universities in Australia. In fact, we believe it is so serious that we published a 12-point code of conduct setting out explicitly what universities around the world should do to address those threats.So far, some Australian universities have taken up recommendations from a government taskforce on monitoring interactions between universities and Chinese government institutions and companies. But most still tiptoe around core issues of academic freedom. UNSW says that it "protects academic freedom and freedom of speech, respecting the right of academics and others to express their views within the law." But if it is going to uphold these standards it has to confront the reality that some students are comfortable publicly demanding university censorship.UNSW should demonstrate that it is serious about academic freedom by promptly convening a public discussion around this episode, clarifying the scope of permissible conduct. I appreciate UNSW's apologies to me, but it's far more important for this episode to teach all members of the UNSW community that "bring[ing] your difference" is a non-negotiable standard.Load-Date: August 4, 2020End of Document

Trump signs executive order to ban social media app TikTokThe Seahawk: University of North Carolina WilmingtonAugust 11, 2020 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 693 wordsByline: Jacob Sawyer, Staff WriterBodyPresident Donald Trump issued an executive order Aug. 6 banning two Chinese apps, including TikTok, starting Sept. 20.The short video platform, owned by Chinese developer ByteDance, has billions of downloads worldwide, including roughly 100 million in the U.S. teens and young adults comprise the largest age cohorts, with six-in-ten American users between the ages of 10 and 29. Despite the very high numbers, which have surged during the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, governments and experts across the globe are warning that the app is mired with security flaws and risks. To add insult to injury, ByteDance is subject to the regulations of the Chinese Communist Party, including a national intelligence law that requires the company to divulge information, including private user data, to the government upon request.These ties to the Chinese regime have been under U.S. scrutiny for months. Around New Year's, soldiers in the military were ordered to stop using TikTok. Less than two months later, the ban was extended to TSA employees. In March, the GOP-controlled Senate introduced a bill to bar all federal employees from the platform; the legislation cleared both Houses of Congress on Aug. 6.Last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced he was "looking at" a nationwide ban on the app for all Americans. Then on July 31, President Trump ratcheted up the threats by saying that he would decree a ban as soon as the next day. That ultimately did not happen, but he declared a national emergency and issued an executive order Aug. 6 mandating that ByteDance has 45 days to sell its U.S. operations or be forced to cease all transactions and downloads in the country. The commander-in-chief signed a separate order that Chinese messaging app WeChat also be forbidden after the month-and-a-half-long grace period.TikTok said in an Aug. 7 statement amid Trump's order that "[they] have made clear that TikTok has never shared user data with the Chinese government, nor censored content at its request." The legitimacy of that promise, however, cannot be confirmed due to China's intelligence law, which TikTok never mentioned. The platform also expressed fears that a ban would "set a dangerous precedent for the concept of free expression and open market." However, the ban will be canceled if an American company buys Americans' data and secures it from the Chinese government. Microsoft is already in talks with ByteDance to execute this deal; if all goes well, the technology behemoth would submit plans to the White House by Sept. 15. Such an acquisition, though, would likely face several technical hurdles, but it could still happen. On the bright side, Twitter has also announced that it will make a strong effort to buy TikTok's operations in the U.S. by the deadline.American reception of Trump's actions has been mixed. Many argue that a sudden ban of an extremely popular social-media app would constitute an unprecedented infringement of the First Amendment. The ACLU slammed the orders as an "abuse of emergency powers under the guise of national security." Some people have even argued that the president is simply banning the app because anti-Trump activists used it to save seats at his June 20 Tulsa rally and then never showed up, although the accuracy of this theory has not been determined at this time.Others, however, support the executive actions against TikTok. Their arguments include punishing China for hostility towards Hong Kong and the Uighur Muslims as well as a long rap sheet of cyberattacks against the U.S. That list also grows on a regular basis, with a severe slew of attacks being added this summer. FBI Director Christopher Wray condemned them as "one of the largest transfers of wealth in human history." The danger is not just restricted to the States; the effects of the Chinese regime's online misconduct have prompted the attention of experts and authorities around the world. A long list of countries from Australia to Pakistan have either proposed legal action against TikTok usage in their jurisdictions or issued strong warnings against the app. It has already been outlawed in India.Load-Date: August 11, 2020End of Document

Pompeo Hits HSBC Anew on Bowing to China Pressure in Hong KongMT Newswires Live Briefs PROAugust 27, 2020 Thursday 4:12 AM ESTCopyright 2020 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 383 wordsBody US Secretary Mike Pompeo has again blasted HSBC Holdings (HKG:0005) over allegedly siding with China after Beijing imposed the controversial national security law in the former British colony.Pompeo accused the British bank of preventing Next Digital (HKG:0282) executives from accessing their credit cards and personal bank accounts, which he described in a Wednesday note as a "coercive bullying tactic" by China against the UK.The offices of media company Next Digital in Hong Kong were recently raided by authorities shortly after the arrest of some executives, including its founder and chairman, Jimmy Lai, a staunch democracy advocate since China regained control of Hong Kong in 1997. "The bank is thus maintaining accounts for individuals who have been sanctioned for denying freedom for Hong Kongers, while shutting accounts for those seeking freedom," Pompeo said.The US Secretary's latest statement came nearly three months after he accused Beijing of threatening to punish HSBC after the lender's Asia-Pacific Chief Executive Peter Wong was pictured signing a petition to support the national security law before it was enforced. In June, the bank took to its WeChat social media platform to publicly throw its support behind the controversial bill, saying "we respect and support laws and regulations that will enable Hong Kong to recover and rebuild the economy." Standard Chartered (HKG:2888) also publicly expressed its backing prior to the law's passage.Tom Kirchmaier, a visiting senior fellow at the London School of Economics, told Bloomberg News at the time that the banks "have to protect their business, which doesn't make it right," adding that the UK is "very weak" on the global stage. "I doubt China will be concerned about any serious repercussions," Kirchmaier said in June.Pompeo's statement is the latest in what China described as interference in Hong Kong affairs. "Hong Kong affairs are China's internal affairs. Hong Kong's economic and financial activities are under the jurisdiction of the [Chinese] government, and any foreign government has no right to intervene," Beijing's banking regulator said over the weekend.HSBC's Hong Kong-listed shares were down nearly 2% in late afternoon trading Thursday.Price (HKD): $33.30, Change: $-0.65, Percent Change: -1.91%Load-Date: August 27, 2020End of Document

GRAVES SECURES A DOZEN CYBERSECURITY PRIORITIES IN FUNDING BILLSStates News ServiceAugust 4, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1748 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of Georgia Rep. Tom Graves:The U.S. House of Representatives last week passed a number of annual government funding bills that included priorities drafted and championed by Rep. Tom Graves (R-GA-14) to boost our nation's telecommunications and cybersecurity. Over the last month, Rep. Graves worked to include a dozen cybersecurity related priorities in more than half of the 12 must-pass funding bills. Before the end of year, the U.S. Senate will plan to pass their version of each funding bill, then the two chambers will negotiate a final spending package."Especially as so much of our day-to-day lives have moved online in the last few months, the need for robust cybersecurity has never been more important. Just recently we learned of yet another attack by Chinese hackers, who have been actively working to steal COVID-19 research and American data. America needs to lead the way when it comes to improving the way the world responds to cyberattacks," said Rep. Graves.The following priorities passed by the House last week - were part of Rep. Graves' work this appropriations cycle to ensure Congress is prioritizing cybersecurity policies, especially as so much of the U.S. workforce is operating remotely. To learn more about Rep. Graves cybersecurity work, please visit tomgraves.house.gov/cyber.Reporting on NATO standards and protocols for countering cybersecurity incidentsReport language: The Committee notes that in July of 2016 the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) recognized cyberspace as a domain of operations in which NATO must defend itself as it does in other operational domains. The Committee directs the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, to report to the Committee on Appropriations not later than 180 days after the enactment of the Act on common NATO standards and protocols for countering cybersecurity incidents.Keeping China out of our networks and appsReport language: Chinese-government affiliated companies.The Committee is concerned with companies operating within the United States that are known to have substantial ties to the Chinese government, including full or partial ownership by the Chinese government, and that are required by Chinese law to assist in espionage activities, including collection of personally identifiable information of American citizens. Such companies may pose cybersecurity risks, such as vulnerabilities in their equipment, and some are the subject of ongoing Congressional and Executive Branch investigations involving their business practices. The Committee directs DOJ to enforce applicable laws and prevent the operation of known foreign entities who participate in the theft of American intellectual property, the harvesting of personal identifiable information on behalf of a foreign government, and the unlawful surveillance of American citizens by adversarial state-owned enterprises.Directing the Department of State to maintain an accurate list of Information Technology (IT) assetsReport language: The Committee has concerns that the Department of State continues to be at risk and a top target for foreign government hackers. In order to prevent potential cyber intrusions by unauthorized devices connected to agency networks and to protect the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of State employees, the Committee directs the Department of State to maintain an accurate list of Information Technology (IT) assets. The Committee recognizes the importance of maintaining accurate IT lists and the implementation of basic cybersecurity standards, so that sensitive data is not compromised.Boosting telehealth capabilities and access for U.S. veteransReport text: The Committee provides $1,329,566,000 for VA telehealth services noting that the VA used $250,000,000 of the funds allocated to it by the CARES Act for telehealth expansion. Committee notes that telehealth increases access to VA services for underserved veterans and twice mentions veterans living in rural areas. Committee directs the VA to make a plan to increase awareness, access consumer satisfaction, effectiveness, and use of telehealth and report to Congress on the plan within 60 days of enactment. Committee directs the VA to make maternal fetal medicine a high priority of their telehealth program and to report to Congress on the development of MFM telehealth services.Providing pro-bono legal services to U.S. veteransBill text: The Committee recognizes an unmet need for holistic programs that offer pro-bono legal services to Veterans and their dependents. The Committee acknowledges existing VA initiatives that guide Veterans during benefit-related interactions with administrative agencies and believes that public land-grant university law schools are suited to complement existing agency efforts in underserved areas.Implementation of strong, national 5G strategyReport language: 5G Security.The Committee supports the development of secure 5G networks that are accessible nationwide, including rural communities, and that are developed using technology and equipment that is verified to be secure from foreign surveillance or influence, and. The Committee recognizes that it is in the best interest of the national and economic security of the United States to implement a strong national 5G strategy as outlined in Public Law 116-129.Protecting our communications supply chain and nationwide networksReport language: Supply Chain Security.The Committee supports recent actions taken by the FCC to designate Huawei Technology Company and ZTE Corporation as covered entities for purposes of the agency's November 2019 ban on the use of universal service support to purchase equipment or services from companies posing a national security threat. The Committee encourages the FCC to continue working to ban the use of such funds to purchase, obtain, or maintain any equipment or services produced or provided by companies posing a national security threat to the integrity of communications networks or the communications supply chain within the United States. Furthermore, the Committee continues to support agency wide efforts to prevent and expel communications and technology companies from operating within the United States that are known to have substantial ties to foreign state-owned enterprises that conduct surveillance on and collect the data of American citizens on behalf of a foreign government, participate in the theft of American intellectual property, assist in espionage activities for foreign governments, have cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities in their equipment, or face ongoing Congressional and Executive Branch concerns about their business models and practices.Preventing international cybercriminals from accessing the U.S. financial marketReport language: The Committee encourages the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to continue preventing known foreign sponsored actors of cybercrime from accessing the United States financial markets. The Committee is concerned that many cyber criminals, state sponsored or otherwise, are still gaining access to payments through financial markets and their activities pose a substantial national and economic threat to the United States.Securing the Internet of ThingsReport language: Internet of Things.The Committee recognizes that the total number of Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices in use will reach 55 billion globally by 2025. The Committee further recognizes that the incorporation of IoT connected devices in both our personal and professional lives expands the cyber threat landscape into new domains, posing possible physical safety risks in addition to more traditional cybersecurity risks to data and information. The Committee directs the FTC to aggressively enforce any unfair and deceptive trade practices related to IoT devices and to issue appropriate guidelines that promote the use of reliable and secure IoT software and hardware components from all suppliers, domestic and foreign.Empowering federal agencies to use cloud technologyReport language: The Committee continues to support efforts by the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) to empower federal agencies to use modern cloud technologies, with emphasis on the security and protection of federal information, and to help accelerate the adoption of secure cloud solutions. The Committee recognizes that these efforts must be prioritized government-wide in order to ensure the effective security of federal information impacting millions of civil servants and taxpayers nation-wide, particularly in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has intensified the cyber vulnerability of the federal cloud services network.Supporting coding in schoolsReport language: The Committee recognizes that, as the American cybersecurity workforce shortage continues to grow, our nation becomes increasingly vulnerable to cyber attacks. The Committee believes it is critical to invest in cyber training for America's youth across a broad field of computer science curricula, including computer coding. Because computer coding plays an essential role in every industry, the Committee supports efforts by the Department of Education to encourage learning institutions from K-12, to higher education and career and technical schools to invest in computer science education, including computer coding instruction.Modernizing and securing systems at the Department of Housing and DevelopmentReport language : IT investment.In its top management challenges report, the HUD OIG identified IT as a significant risk to the Department's ability to accomplish its mission. The Department's IT systems are outdated and incompatible with current technology, making them susceptible to failure and breach. The depth and breadth of these issues requires a multiyear investment and strategy. To address these issues, the Committee provides $35,400,000 above the request for migrating and retiring the remaining 15 COBOL-based legacy systems; streamlining, modernizing, and consolidating grant management systems, including the disaster grant system; and developing and deploying the Office of Native American Programs Loan Origination System. In addition, the Committee urges the Department of Housing and Urban Development to maintain an accurate inventory of Information Technology assets, especially to protect Personally Identifiable Information of Americans.Load-Date: August 4, 2020End of Document

U.S.- China will not accept US "theft" of its technology companies, according to Chinese state pressCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 4, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 460 wordsBodyBEIJING, 4 (EUROPA PRESS)The ultimatum launched by U.S. President Donald Trump to Chinese company ByteDance, saying he will ban the application of TikTok microvideos from September 15 if he fails to divest himself from his U.S. operations, has led the Communist Party-controlled 'China Daily' newspaper to warn that China will not allow the "theft" of its tech companies."China will in no way accept the theft of a Chinese technology company and have many ways to respond if the Administration goes ahead with its assault plans and crushing," the newspaper says in an editorial, recalling that the White House has already employed intimidating tactics during trade negotiations with China.In this sense, the rotative argues that, as TikTok's experience shows, no matter how unfounded the accusations against him, as long as they remain Chinese companies, they will be presented as a 'red threat' and regardless of the outcome, the message increases the concerns of companies in the Asian country.Thus, it considers that the US government's harassment of Chinese telecos stems from data being Washington's new source of wealth and a "zero sum" vision, which offers only the choice between full submission or deathmatch in the field of technology. "There are no carrots to promote cooperation, only sticks," he says."Washington is well aware that Beijing will be careful to retaliate similarly, as it values foreign investment in China, and america's considerable investment in the country is more important to the Chinese economy than Chinese investment for the U.S. economy," the rotative points notes.For its part, The Chinese agency Xinhua states that the forced sale of TikTok reveals the US's intentions to control technology and goes against the principles of the free market, as well as violating the principles of transparency, openness and non-discrimination of the World Trade Organization.In this regard, the Chinese national agency recalls that since the US authorities investigated the purchase of the application Musical.ly by ByteDance, which was renamed TikTok in 2018, no evidence of any illegal action by the Chinese company has been found.Donald Trump said Monday that his government will ban TikTok from September 15 if it fails to reach a sales agreement on its U.S. operations before that date and positively valued Microsoft's interest in taking over the U.S. business of the Chinese app.In addition, Trump noted that he expects the U.S. Treasury to receive a portion of the amount of the TikTok purchase, although he has not gone into detail about what this would be done."[TikTok] will close on September 15 unless Microsoft or another company is able to buy it and get a proper deal so that the U.S. Treasury makes a lot of money," he said.Load-Date: August 5, 2020End of Document

Smartphone Production Registers Largest YoY Drop on Record with 16.7% Decline in 2Q20, Although Rebound in 2H20 Appears Likely, Says TrendForceBusiness WireAugust 25, 2020 Tuesday 10:00 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 1237 wordsDateline: TAIPEI, Taiwan BodyThe COVID-19 pandemic has compelled governments worldwide to impose border closures and regional lockdowns, which led to significant declines in various countries' GDPs this year. As economic and social activities around the world have stagnated, the performance of the smartphone industry was severely damaged in 2Q20. According to TrendForce 's latest investigations, total smartphone production reached 286 million units in 2Q20, a slight QoQ rebound of 2.2%, but a 16.7% decrease YoY, which is the largest quarterly YoY drop in history.TrendForce indicates that governments in many countries have started to ease some of the restrictive measures for containing COVID-19 and launched economic stimulus policies to generate consumer demand. These developments will be beneficial for the smartphone market's potential rebound going into the second half of the year. Total smartphone production for 3Q20 is expected to reach 335 million units, a 10.1% decrease YoY. Although this figure falls short compared with the same period last year, it still represents a 17.2% increase QoQ.Samsung was the only manufacturer among the top six to see its market share decline in 2Q20, while Huawei's market share in China may be cannibalized by its competitorsIn the course of the COVID-19 pandemic since March, the situation has gotten worse for most countries. Europe, the US, and India are the major markets for Samsung smartphones when looking at sales by region. Their outbreaks were very severe during 2Q20, and this affected Samsung more than the other brands in the top six. Although Samsung led the industry in terms of smartphone production with 55 million units in 2Q20, it is also the only brand among the top six that posted a QoQ decline, which approached 16%. Moving to 3Q20, as China-U.S. tensions intensify due to the latter's sanctions against Huawei, and China-India relations continue to destabilize, Samsung has been building up its inventories as it targets the entry-level and mid-range segments in order to compensate for its poor performances in the previous quarter. Samsung's production volume is likely to increase in 3Q20.Placing second in the production ranking, Huawei, which continues to heavily rely on the Chinese market, raised its smartphone production by 13% QoQ to around 52 million units for 2Q20. Competition in this market is expected to intensify in 3Q20 as smartphone brands release their new flagship models in 2H20. Huawei's smartphone sales in overseas markets have been falling sharply since the end of 2019 as the effect of the trade actions by the US government began to take their toll. These measures will make the R&D of in-house mobile processors and sourcing of components much more difficult for this Chinese smartphone brand. Given that Huawei depends on China for smartphone sales, other Chinese brands, including Xiaomi, OPPO, and Vivo, are expected to cut into Huawei's market share.Apple's iPhone production in 2Q20 rose by 8% QoQ to 41 million units thanks to above-expected sales of the iPhone SE and the iPhone 11. This performance also gives the brand third place in the ranking. Moving to 3Q20, the demand for the iPhone SE and iPhone 11 is expected to remain strong. At the same time, Apple will begin mass producing the four new models in the (tentatively named) iPhone 12 series, which are equipped with 5G capabilities, thereby raising its quarterly smartphone production. The BOM costs of the iPhone 12 models are significantly higher compared with the models in the previous series because of the 5G support. To cut costs and stabilize retail pricing, Apple has decided to sell the upcoming iPhones without accessories such as wired earphones, power adapter, etc. This move is expected to help with sales performance. However, recent orders by the Trump administration barring U.S. businesses from carrying out transactions with TikTok, WeChat, and their respective parent companies ByteDance and Tencent may have an impact on Apple's sales performances in the Chinese market going forward.Xiaomi is fourth in the production ranking for 2Q20 with 29.5 million units, OPPO (including OPPO, OnePlus, and realme) is fifth with 27.5 million, and Vivo is sixth with 26.5 million. The three Chinese brands benefitted from the recent recovery of their home market. Furthermore, they also took advantage of the precautionary inventory building in the overseas retail channels during the first half of the year. Retailers stocked up aggressively during that time in fear of pandemic-related disruptions. As a result, they all posted an increase of more than 10% QoQ for 2Q20. Recent border tensions between India and China have placed considerable pressure on the three brands' sales efforts since they all count on India as one of their major foreign markets. On the other hand, they have been cultivating their presence in the country for a long time. This, combined with their products' price competitiveness, may be enough to get them through this difficult period with their market shares relatively intact. Nevertheless, Chinese smartphone brands will be very constrained in terms of growth if the relationship between their home country and India remains tense. Xiaomi, OPPO, and Vivo will continue to prioritize the entry-level and mid-range segments in their overseas expansion strategies, which include regions such as Europe, India, Southeast Asia, and Russia, over the long term. In China, the three brands will capitalize on the Chinese government's push to commercialize 5G services by being more proactive in the development and pricing of 5G smartphones.Smartphone market will likely see a rebound in production and a sharp rise in 5G penetration in 2021TrendForce forecasts a yearly smartphone production volume of 1.24 billion units for 2020, an 11.3% decrease YoY. Assuming the pandemic can be brought under control in 2021, total smartphone production is likely to make a rebound next year. As well, smartphone brands are pushing out 5G models this year to maintain their market shares in the face of the recent demand slump. Since mobile SoC suppliers such as Qualcomm and MediaTek are also starting to provide 5G solutions for mid-range and high-end smartphones, the share of 5G models in the annual total smartphone production is projected to grow rapidly to 19.2% for 2020. This penetration rate is equivalent to around 238 million units.For further details of this press release, along with tables showing the rankings of the top six brands and projected details on the upcoming iPhone 12 models, please visit: https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20200825-10454.htmlAbout TrendForce ( www.trendforce.com )TrendForce is a global provider of market intelligence on the technology industries.

REMARKS ON USAID ADVANCING RELIGIOUS LIBERTY FROM USAID ACTING ADMINISTRATOR JOHN BARSA ON A VIRTUAL ROUND TABLE WITH THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM INSTITUTEStates News ServiceAugust 19, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 9192 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID):Wednesday, August 19, 2020MR. BARKER: Hello. I'm Jermy Barker, director of the Religious Freedom Institute's Middle East Action Team. And it's my privilege to welcome you to today's online event. We're looking forward to a great conversation on the United States Agency for International Development's role in advancing religious liberty. For those who are not familiar with the Religious Freedom Institute, RFI is committed to achieving broad acceptance of religious liberty as a fundamental human right, a source of individual and social flourishing, a cornerstone of a successful society, a driver of national and international security. In short, RFI's work is to secure religious freedom for everyone everywhere.Today's event will be a conversation lead by Kent Hill, RFI co-founder and senior fellow for Eurasia, the Middle East, and Islam. Leading the conversation with USAID's acting administrator John Barsa and the agency's chief advisor for International Religious Freedom, Samah Norquist. Time permitting, we will have time at the end for -- of the conversation for some questions. We've had a number submitted in advance. You can also submit questions through the chat feature below this video on YouTube or Facebook. Please feel free to post questions there throughout the event. And as we have time, we'll try to get to a few of those questions at the end. So, now it's my privilege to hand over the rest of the event to my colleague, Kent Hill.MR. HILL: Thanks very much, Jeremy. And welcome everybody and particularly to acting administrator Barsa and Samah Norquist who's the point person for USAID on religious freedom. And I should mention at the outset, we've had a terrific RSVP for this event, well over 100 people from all over the world, as a matter of fact. And so, we welcome all of you to this. And I think that bespeaks the fact that there is a sense that religious freedom is important and not just for the religious individuals involved but for societies and for human flourishing and for -- we're going to talk about this a little bit later, national security stability and things like that. But as it turns out, we've actually had an event the last couple of weeks that's extremely troubling. Everybody knows about the terrible explosion and the aftermath of chaos that has occurred in Lebanon.And what's particularly troubling about this is that Lebanon was one of the few places in the Middle East where a variety of religions had gotten along reasonably well, had been a democracy. There were major economic and corruption problems as we all know, but at least it was a place that many pointed to as a poster child for religious groups being able to get along together. And one of the big questions that is now right in front of us, staring us all right in the face, is whether the violence and the protest, much of it legitimate to the corruption, will lead to chaos and sectarianism which in other parts of the Middle East and the world has really spelled the end of religious freedom and the rising of extremists.And as it turns out, the acting administrator of USAID, John Barsa, has just gone briefly to Lebanon to take a look at the situation, to talk to religious and political and other leaders. He even gave blood. That was on Twitter, I guess, that he managed to take time out to give blood while he was there. But I think we might start today by just asking John Barsa, if you could just give us a few reflections on what you saw there and particularly maybe this question, the religious leaders he talked to there and others, do you believe that they have a major role to play in calming things down and producing a more stable situation?ACTING ADMINISTRATOR BARSA: Over to me?MR. HILL: Over to you.ACTING ADMINISTRATOR BARSA: Well, thank you, Ken. Thank you so much to you, to the Religious Freedom Institute for this invitation and for coordinating the event. There's so much to talk about in terms of not just what I saw in Lebanon, but I'm going to say this works for international, you know, protecting religious freedom. So, I'm happy to take any questions as well as prepared comments and try to cover some of what we do but happy to engage in a conversation to the extent that time allows. We're certainly grateful for our collaboration with RFI. We certainly look forward to building on this important partnership.As Kent mentioned, I just got back from Beirut yesterday. I was there on a short visit, mostly to observe the damage from the explosion and oversee USAID's response. But what I saw on the ground shook me to the core. It's -- the level of destruction and loss of life is unimaginable. Throughout my career, I've traveled to many disaster sites and nothing I have ever experienced comes close to what I saw in Beirut. On behalf of the USAID and the United States government and the people of the United States, I offer my sincerest condolences to all of those affected by the catastrophic explosions last week. Three hundred thousand people have lost their homes, and many are still waiting to hear from missing family and friends. We are praying for the survivors and their families and stand with the people of Lebanon. This disaster could not have come at a worse time for the Lebanese people. They are already suffering from an ailing economy, and their generosity is being pushed to the limit hosting nearly 900,000 Syrian refugees. And when you consider the growing number of COVID-19 cases, the agony and despair on the ground becomes so much more worse.The U.S. will continue to stand with Lebanese people as they grieve and cry for transparency and accountability from their government. I can't get this quote from Lebanese American writer Kahlil Gibran out of my head. It goes, "Out of the suffering have emerged the strongest souls. The most massive characters are seared with scars." It certainly reminds me of the Lebanese people as the most resilient people in the world. I met with some of those people who are part of the faith-based community in Lebanon. I was able to really understand and see their needs and challenges that they face in responding effectively to the disaster. USAID's proud to be collaborating with these organizations. They're immensely important to Lebanon as the country works to rebuild.Support for faith-based organizations has long been one of USAID's policy priorities, not only in the Middle East region but around the world. Working with these types of organizations with extensive on-the-ground contacts and expertise is part of a new strategy that USAID is undertaking.In 2019, we launched our new partnership initiative, what we call NPI, in Northern Iraq. It was the first time USAID has worked directly with local groups in nearly 20 years. We were looking for ways to expand similar programming and grow our partnerships with civil society groups and faith-based organizations across the region, including Lebanon.As a Cuban American, I know firsthand how discrimination on the basis of faith can sow chaos, destroy lives, and uproot society, and divide families. My mother, a devout Catholic, was forced to flee Cuba as the nightmare of Fidel Castro's communist revolution began to cascade throughout the country. She risked her life and well-being by immigrating to the United States in search of better opportunities, but more importantly, to enjoy life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. My mother was one of the lucky ones. Christians who were unable to escape faced harassments, beating, imprisonment, and even death. To this day, the totalitarian Castro regime has continued to surveil, control, and harass church leaders and worshippers. That is why combating religious persecution means so much to me. It is deeply ingrained in my personal upbringing, and it pains me to see an intense persecution in my mother's homeland which is why, like President Trump and so many other Americans, I'm deeply concerned with the decline of religious freedom across the globe. Believers of nearly all faiths, including Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, Muslims, and Jews have been increasingly persecuted over the past decade.For Americans, religious freedom is grounded in our founding documents and has always been a bipartisan issue. Under President Clinton, the International Religious Freedom Act was signed. And under President Obama, the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act was enacted. More recently, President Trump signed the bipartisan Iraq and Syria Genocide Relief and Accountability Act, which authorizes assistance to victims of genocide and crimes against humanity committed by ISIS. He also signed the Nicaragua Human Rights and Anti-corruption Act, which imposes sanctions against violators of civil rights in Nicaragua.In June, the president signed the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act. This legislation allows the U.S. to take decisive measures against the Chinese government in response to its heinous treatment of the Uyghurs and other minority communities and Xinjiang.Finally, this past June, the president followed up on these unprecedented statements of principle by releasing the executive order on advancing International Religious Freedom. This executive order makes clear that advancing religious freedom is a major U.S. foreign policy and national security priority, one that USAID is proud to play a key role in implementing.Our mission at USAID is to help countries continue along their journey to self-reliance. We empower countries to become more free, more prosperous, and more accountable to their citizens. When governments suppress freedom of religion, they prevent entire segments of society from making meaningful contributions to their country's political and economic development. This is antithetical to USAID's goal of fostering inclusive societies. Embracing pluralism is fundamental to ensuring stability and prosperity. USAID is committed to addressing the needs of vulnerable communities, including those of religious and ethnic minorities. Our programs aim to respond to and prevent mass atrocities including genocide.There are a couple of areas where we're really seeing religious persecution. Most recently in northern Iraq and Syria, our efforts to focus on helping communities recover from the genocidal campaign by the so-called Islamic State. In Nigeria, we are working to protect Christian communities and other vulnerable groups from attacks and destabilization by Boko Haram, Islamic State in West Africa and other jihadists. For decades, the Rohingya have been driven out of Burma, periodically forced to flee to other surrounding countries in Muslim majority nations such as Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Indonesia. USAID, in partnership with the State Department, has provided more than $950 million in humanitarian aid for IDPs in Burma and refugees in host communities in Bangladesh.Lastly, we remain steadfast in our support for persecuted minority groups in Xinjiang, China. USAID will not stand idly by this communist -- Chinese Communist Party that carries out abuses, targeting people who simply want to practice their customs and faith. As you can see, USAID has an unwavering commitment to International Religious Freedom around the world. President Trump's executive order on International Religious Freedom cements the important role our agency plays in carrying out this U.S. foreign policy priority.Here's how the order does that. First, the United States will budget at least $50 million per year on programs that advance International Religious Freedom. USAID is working closely with the State Department to realize this and ensure that protecting religious freedom is a central tenet of our foreign assistance strategy. Our programs will focus on preventing attacks on religious minority communities and preserving pluralistic cultural heritage. We'll ensure our assistance addresses the political, social, and economic constraints that religious and ethnic communities face on a daily basis.Second, the State Department and USAID now mandate that foreign service officers undergo training on how to promote International Religious Freedom. We've already gotten a head start on this. In January 2020, USAID mandated all its foreign service officers to take training on upholding religious liberty.Third, the order states that the U.S. government will expand the availability of economic tools to support allies of religious freedom and confront bad actors. This aspect of the order will likely be carried out by either increasing our support to religious freedom programming, by realigning foreign aid to better reflect the country's circumstances or restricting the issue of visas and deploying Global Magnitsky's sanctions where appropriate.The Executive Order recognizes that healthy societies protect religious freedom, just as they protect property rights, legal rights, and human civil rights of all kind. USAID is proud to play such a key role in one of the president's top priorities. And you'll hear from Samah Norquist soon who serves as our new chief religious freedom advisor and is leading the implementation effort.In closing, it's truly an honor to be with you here today. RFI, its staff, and the many advocates listening in play just as important the role of advancing this cause as the U.S. government. It doesn't fall on deaf ears to say that religious freedom is under siege worldwide. USAID recognizes this troubling trend and is committed to further strengthening our efforts to advance religious liberty, and make sure that countries recognize it as a prerequisite for inclusive stability and prosperity. Thank you, again, for helping to amplify this important issue. I look forward to engaging further discussion, taking questions, and having a conversation with you. Thank you so very much.MR. HILL: Thanks very much for that. Two or three things that you said that caught my attention. The first was the expanse of the problem. And one of the things that should have been obvious is that religious persecution affects all. It affects Muslims and China and Myanmar. It affects Yazidis and Christians and places like Iraq, but virtually every religion some place is under siege.Number two, there is the note about the recent decision of the administration to issue an executive order on religious freedom. And yet, this has been a theme consistent with prior administrations, both Democrat and Republican. And I don't think we can emphasize enough in this time of great polarization the importance of viewing religious freedom, not just as a national security matter but as a bipartisan commitment of the American people.And then third, you said a little bit about what we're going to talk about some more, about the actual requirements of the executive order. But I want to ask Samah Norquist a question that we start here. Samah, I remember when I was at USAID for about eight years that there was an attitude sometimes you encounter with the public, and sometimes even in government that saw USAID and DFID and other international development organizations as a vehicle to bring humanitarian assistance and systems and disasters, you know, food and shelter and medical care, and, for sure, that's a big part of what we do. But people's eyes kind of glazed over when you talked about something like democracy or even more glazed over when you talk about religious freedom. It was -- it was sort of as if, well, you know, that's kind of nice if you can pull it off, but that's not mainly your work. And that raises this question. The title of this webinar, Samah, had to do with religious freedom as one of the priorities, a major priority for U.S. government and USAID. And I want to ask you, because I know you've thought a lot about this, and now you're on point on it. How do you answer those people who really don't get it, don't understand the connection between succeeding and the promotion of religious freedom and actually doing the work that helps societies flourish? What's your answer to why it really matters that much?MS. NORQUIST: Thank you, Kent, and thank you for having us. It's delightful to be with you all. You're absolutely right. One of my civil servant colleagues have been sort of mentoring me on how we do this kind of work and integrate it into the DNA of USAID programming. And one of the things that he brought to my attention was inclusive to the concept of inclusive development. This is how I started talking the aid language. He taught me that the North Star of advancing religious freedom is inclusive development.The way that we're doing business right now, as you said and as our acting administrator mentioned, every religious group is under threat, whether by state actors or nongovernment actors, whether they're minority or they're majority. And there's so many places in the world that are that way. And when USAID does its work, it sometimes forgets about some of those marginalized population because we worry about some of the concepts that you mentioned. However, when you look at the work that we were able to do in Iraq -- in northern Iraq, for example, those communities were targeted because of their faith or ethnicity, whether they were Christians, whether they were Shia, whether they were Yazidis. And what the U.S. government responded, one by the H.R. 390 that you guys were very helpful in getting to the final step in providing assistance to those communities that were targeted and were victims of genocide. What the U.S. government has done is looked at some of the assistance that we do in order to make sure that we don't forget about those communities.So, with the concept of inclusive development, it's looking at both minorities on how we bring them and give them the equal access to government assistance and assistance programs. What happened with us is that we were -- that allowed us to be within those communities and talk to local leaders and faith-based organizations that are better equipped to tell us what their needs are and to partner with us. So, a lot of that work came around. I started speaking aid, and we're looking forward to working with a lot of people in the building, civil servants, foreign service officers. I've been very fortunate to work many of them previously in the Middle East Bureau, and we were able to move the needle and looking forward to working and doing more under Administrator John Barsa's leadership.MR. HILL: No, I appreciate that very much. I think that's very helpful. It reminds me of something that I learned over about 15 years between USAID and World Vision where I read a lot of international development books on the cause of poverty. And, you know, the first quick response to that often is scarcity; scarcity of water, scarcity of food, scarcity of resources, and you go down the list. And then you look a little closer, and you discover that the biggest single problem is not scarcity; or to put it another way, there's a cause of the scarcity. And the scarcity is almost always exacerbated and made immeasurably worse by conflict. So, addressing conflict, addressing anything that gets in the way of stability is what will get at the problem of scarcity better than anything else.And when you put 95 percent of your money as many international and bilateral organizations tend to do and actually the band-aid approach -- providing what is missing. It makes sense, of course, to do that. But if you don't also invest in the cause of what resulted in the injury you're putting the band aid on, you can't get at it. You just can't get at it. Administrator Barsa, I know you preside over a budget of, I don't know, 40 billion plus dollars and you're looking at problems throughout the world that deal with everything. You have -- well, I have to be very crisp here because we're going to run out of time pretty quickly. But as you survey the landscape route right now, in terms of the religious freedom part of it, the -- I think Samah mentioned it, it's the problem of pluralism as well. The challenge to pluralism, what do you see? Is that situation getting worse? And how does USAID intend to get at where the problems are getting worse at the present time?ACTING ADMINISTRATOR BARSA: Unfortunately, I do see the problems getting worse, part of it is -- even before the pandemic, religious freedom is being challenged all over the world by, you know, certainly the Chinese. And we're hearing already the Chinese even want to have a role in picking the next Dalai Lama. So, we're seeing challenges all over the -- all over the place. So, let me take a step back and kind of dovetail with some of what Samah are saying. Let me give you some of my personal views.So, my personal view is that every human being is a child of God, and it's been bestowed on a rich capacity and human potential. So, for a society to basically take human beings and put them aside and persecute them, I mean, any member of any persecuted religious ethnic minority can contribute so much to society from building a better light bulb, to curing cancer, developing a way to get to the planets better on. I mean, every individual has his God-given human potential. So, to have economic development fulfillments, you have to be inclusive and bring everyone on board to select and segregate groups because of the way they have their relationship with God or their deity, is crippling to a society's possibility and potential for economic political development. You deny yourself the stability and what you need to reach a -- for a country to reach their own economic and political potential.So, our programming -- so what this executive order has done -- it has focused things. It has put a floor of $50 million. But we've been doing this for decades, so the work we're doing in terms of inclusive programming for persecuted religious groups has been taking place and will continue to take place. This executive order has elevated it and as you said, Kent, on the outset, this is a bipartisan issue.MR. HILL: Right.ACTING ADMINISTRATOR BARSA: We, as Americans, know what right looks like, and we're proud to be doing this work. And it is a challenging environment. And we're seeing increased challenges, but if we're up to the task.MR. HILL: Yeah. You know, well, hearing you talk reminds me of something that I used to give as a lecture point in my first career as a European history professor in Seattle, Washington. And it has to do with I think of 17th century France, and there was something called the Edict of Nantes, which was an edict to toleration between Catholics and Protestants which unleashed tremendous economic power for France. And then it was revoked. The famous revocation of the Edict of Nantes which resulted in the Protestant Huguenots, being forced out of the country. These were the most economically entrepreneurial and gifted -- some of the most gifted in France. They took those skills to other countries that hurt France and helped everybody else.But the empirical connection between the good of religion, if allowed to exist and believers were allowed to exist in practice or faith, is not just a sort of a theological, theoretical assumption or assertion. It's a fact. And, Samah, the other thing I wanted to -- I wanted to pursue with you and I apologize, this wasn't in the sort of the broad questions that we gave you in advance, but I think it's one you'll be able to handle easily. When you're asked the question, why religious freedom matters? We at the RFI often say religious freedom matters because religion matters. Now, why do we say that? There's something about religion, if it's practiced in a humane way, that is respectful of other people, that provides something that is often missing. Now, if it's true, then many of the problems in the world are caused by conflict, bitter conflict, where everybody that either side has a long scorecard of bad things that have happened to them and the desire for revenge is very, very strong. It is very difficult. If you -- if a family member has been killed or you've been the victim of a really bad thing, it's really difficult to come to reconciliation.One of the few things in the world that can sometimes compel or empower a person to move beyond such abuse is religious -- is religious teaching. I got to learn to turn off my phone before I have these discussions. And my thought is, if conflict is so severe in the Middle East and elsewhere and you have to get -- or South Africa and you have to get to reconciliation, do you agree with the proposition that one of the reasons you want religion free is so that those people who say the future has to be reconciliation and vengeance, that perspective is going to be particularly and powerfully represented and found within religious communitiesMS. NORQUIST: Thank you, Ken. As you know, I am a daughter of an immigrant. I came to this country when I was 16 years old from the Middle East. And while I am not a victim of oppression or religious persecution, I grew up and I've seen communities that were victims of that. And threats to religious freedom don't come just in a persecution. It comes in discrimination, it comes in social behavior, it comes into human rights violations, even some bullying in schools. When we -- when my family moved to this country, it was incredible for me as a young person to look around and become part of this incredible country that its first amendment was the protection of religious freedom. And for many, many years, this country was safe from any of the religious conflicts that other nations -- and we've never had that. But that's not because we didn't want to talk about religion, it was because we respected religion and the freedom of our citizens to either believe or not believe.And what we're hoping to do through this executive order is actually fortify that concept. How does -- how does USAID do it? USAID does it by looking at strategies on how we mainstream some of the needs of those rejected communities and bring them back to the mainstream. How do we do that? We -- as an agency and with our programs and engagements with governments, is we use that convening power in order to bring our partners to talk about issues. We're not going to be there defending one religion over the other because we have programs all over the world, and the administrator and the president and the vice president have been very, very clear that this is not for one group versus the other. It's across the board. The president of the United States last June just passed through and signed the Uyghurs Act, which protects against the human rights violations of the Uyghurs. So, you can argue all that you want.The United States and USAID is part of the three D's as you remember, defense, diplomacy, and development. And that's what our acting administration pushes us every day. And that's where role --- our role is. And if we don't address those issues on the ground with different religious communities, we're just talking to ourselves. And you might -- you better lay it all on the table in order to bring these communities back together.MR. HILL: Yeah, just a quick follow up on that. Samah, can you say a word about how USAID actually programs in an area where there's been great conflict? How do you actually unleash through a program funded by U.S. government taxpayers? How do you actually unleash something that might make a difference?MS. NORQUIST: So, we've been -- one of the things that we've been tackling is actually working with faith-based organizations. It's not something new that USAID just we started. This is in our long history. And when you were at USAID, I was a little munchkin also at USAID, but you were a system administrator, so you were a big deal. I do remember learning about the programs that we did in Africa, particularly when it came to countering AIDS. And it wasn't working with big NGOs. It was working with the imams in Africa. And as a Muslim American, to me that was an eye-opening experience. Because to me I thought AIDS is an issue that you can't talk about. And to my incredible ignorance, I found out that we actually -- it was through the faith-based organizations and imam leaders that we were able to implement some of the most important programs that saved lives.So, how do we do it? There are so many options. And we're looking at all the options. NPI, that the administrator mentioned in his remark, the New Partner Initiative, it opens a big door for us to utilize -- underutilize and diversify our partnership to particularly go towards those local communities that know what the needs are. It doesn't mean that we don't do the others. But it doesn't mean that that's the only way of doing business.MR. HILL: Right. Administrator Barsa, when you think about implementing the executive order actually using the $50 million in a way that will make a difference, one of the components there has to do with training. And it has to do with the training of personnel. And I guess -- the assumption is that you might not know right off the bat what the connection is between religious freedom and stability, or you might not even know the diversity of the religious communities in a given setting. How important do you think the training component of the executive order is for achieving the objectives of the executive order?ACTING ADMINISTRATOR BARSA: I think training is essential, because what we're doing with the training, it's not -- we're planting the seeds for long -- our long-term ability to address this. So, we're -- so, we have a Foreign Service officer at the beginning part of their career. What we're doing with the training, we are highlighting the importance of this. We could talk about inclusion in the broad sense of the term, but we're emphasizing that religious -- you know, religious and ethnic minorities, this inclusion is particularly important. It's particularly onerous. So, they say history doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes. So, as Foreign Service officers go from country to country, the particular manifestation of persecution may differ in the specifics, but it's the broad generalities that we want people to be looking at. So, part of the training is like, "Hey, Foreign Service officer, wherever you're deployed, you need to be on the lookout for this. This is key for whatever you're facing in terms of development, you know, prosperity, civil society, democracy. You've got to get this right." So, the training is an investment for Foreign Service officers who are going to be around for decades.MR. HILL: Yeah. The -- I remember something during the PEPFAR years in terms of the importance of -- and it's not -- it wasn't just PEPFAR. I was in charge of Global Health. We were about to stamp out polio, and we had done so in much of the world. But we had a few places where we could not get trust by the community to take the polio vaccine. And Samah, it was the Muslim imams who broke the issue wide open. Because once they said to their people, "This is a public health matter. We -- this is not -- this vaccination is not going to hurt you," that was when we got the breakthrough. Have we not had the cooperation of the religious community there, because the religious leaders have the credibility, we couldn't have achieved our polio objective.MS. NORQUIST: Right. And if I may add, Kent. When we look at this issue, we look at -- across the board. This is not just we're trying to help one group as opposed to the other. This is how do we include these communities and marginalized communities that we forgot about before, whether they were persecuted or whether because they're discriminated against in everything we do, addressing government constraints, addressing economic constraints, educational constraints, and helping persecuted communities. So, from my own personal perspective, when it comes -- when we -- what we did in the Middle East, it actually preserved the mosaic of the Middle East.MR. HILL: Right.MS. NORQUIST: That Middle East does not exist without these Christian communities. And when people are trying to exterminate communities like that, that's a dangerous game that they're playing that will jeopardize the history and -- the rich history and culture of the Middle East.MR. HILL: Yeah. Administrator Barsa, one of the things I noticed from externally looking at the -- sort of the mosaic of countries is there seems to be a connection between when a society or a country becomes more monochrome in terms of its ethnic and religious majority and the way there will or will not be protection for the minorities. And the countries that have had policies which segregate, exclude, expel, and the worst-case scenario, genocide, those societies become more intolerant overtime. Those societies, and I think this is one of the great strengths of the United States, they always use the image of the melting pot, doesn't mean there wasn't discrimination, doesn't mean that people didn't have a hard time sometimes when they came in from another part of the world. But in fairly short order, within a few years, they were usually assimilated, became part of the American tapestry. And it was that diversity which in some places tears the place apart. But in places where there's really democracy and respect and human rights and religious freedom, it actually makes it immeasurably stronger. So, getting that message out that there's a connection between protecting minorities, treasuring minorities, giving them their rights even though the majority might be Christian or Buddhist or Muslim, is key. How do you find a way to persuade people that this is an empirical fact that impacts the flourishing of societies? I mean, what can we do better to get that message out there?ACTING ADMINISTRATOR BARSA: So, let me go from the broader point. And the -- your comments about the United States as a melting pot reminds me of something my mother said. As I mentioned in my comments, my mother fled Communist Cuba when she was a young lady. And so, she -- you know, the United States welcomed her with open arms. She was really able to start her life over again. So, having been through that firsthand herself, she'd like to use -- instead of melting pot, she likes to say the United States to her was a salad, where you have a cohesive whole but individual parts that have -- that retain their own essence and their own flavor. But coming together, you have this rich, wonderful dish. So, my mom always called it a salad.So, I guess what we do is -- again, history doesn't repeat itself, but it's -- but it rhymes. So, the particular case of what is going on in China, in Burma, and Iraq, the specifics may be different, but we come with this whole, in this knowledge, even that history has shown it, your mention of trading Nazis in the experiences of France. We have shown -- I mean, history has shown time and time again the most successful economies and cultures, the ones that are a rich tapestry that have found to work in a cohesive whole with people who have different views.So, at one point, you know, we need to ensure that our Foreign Service officers going out into the field understand the history and the importance of religious freedom. But it all has to be particular to the country at hand, which is why I'm so excited about our New Partnerships Initiative. Generally speaking, our New Partnerships Initiative is great for business that USAID, I believe, writ large working, you know, with new partners instead of the traditional organizations. I always believe the best solution is the ones crafted closest to the problems. So, I'm always going to be leaning towards those groups that are based in the localities where we're trying to meet a particular challenge. And specifically, with the New Partnerships Initiative, what we're doing is we are working with those religious organizations on the ground who understand a particular culture and who can help tailor our message of inclusivity to the language and particular culture that -- you know, where we're working. So --MR. HILL: Yeah. I think it was -- I can't remember exactly -- I think it was the 1950s when the great Jesuit philosopher and thinker John Courtney Murray said that 95 percent of disagreement is misunderstanding.ACTING ADMINISTRATOR BARSA: Yeah.MR. HILL: Now, why do I mention that? We talked about training, about religious freedom as critically important. Let me throw on the table one of the critical misunderstandings that I encountered a great deal. I mean, I know people who are working for the U.S. government encountered this as well. In fact, I encountered it one time in a State Department meeting. We were talking about providing assistance to a faith-based organization and the person across the table says, "We can't do that. That's a violation of church-state relations. We don't -- we can't -- as the U.S. government, we cannot support or have a program with a religious entity because that's supporting that religious entity." And it struck me then. I obviously disagree. But we have to be able to give a reason. We have to explain why that is not a violation of the founding principles of this country. In fact, it's actually in direct contradiction to the positive role the founders believe religion could play. Now, I have an answer that I sometimes give, and I might share it in a minute.But Samah, do you have any recommendations on how best to address that misconception that if USAID funds go to a religious organization that's inherently problematic? And that would go to the heart of what you said, John, because it would make the New Partners Initiative really on the wrong track because some of those partners, many of them are faith-based.MS. NORQUIST: So, the churches and mosques and any houses of worship are the closest to these communities, those small communities. They are the trusted centers for them. They're the refuge to them. And it will be really missing opportunity for us if we don't explore options to work with them. We're not providing Bibles or Quran or preaching. We're providing programs to build their capacity in order to be able to deliver to their local communities.I'll give you an example that we did in Jordan. So, a few years -- a couple of years ago, I visited a church downtown Amman. It's the St. Joseph's Church.MR. HILL: Right.MS. NORQUIST: There is a wonderful priest, Priest Mario, who opened the church for Iraqi Christians that fled ISIS in 2015, provided refuge and rooms and places for these refugees to sleep. And then he brought an Italian chef from Italy that trained those Iraqi refugees on how to make pizza.So, the courtyard in the church, when you go there, they -- the -- you-- it's -- you can go and order pizza and beer and hookah and play cards and -- whether it's Ramadan or it's not -- or during non-Ramadan days. And the servants and the cooks are all Iraqi refugees. It was one of the most incredible scenes I've seen. Here's a church providing hope, job training, and refuge to these people that escaped genocide. What USAID did, what our mission in Jordan was able to do is actually partner with a local Jordanian organization that makes cheese.So, we created a program in another city, Karak, which is in southwest of Jordan, 85 miles from the capital, has the -- one of the most famous Crusaders castles, and has one of the most vibrant Christian communities in Jordan. We've partnered with that or a local organization to teach group of women on how to make cheese. And then we break that cheese. And then we -- they deliver it to the church to which those refugees use that cheese and make the pizza for people that goes in.So, there are a lot -- it's one of the most incredible success stories that USAID was able to do. And we're not doing religious teaching. We're supporting and partnering with local groups. We provide job opportunities. We're empowering women. And we're connecting host community with their refugee population. So, USAID can do magic. Just people, give us the tools, and the money, and we'll do it.ACTING ADMINISTRATOR BARSA: Kent, I got to give you like a more recent example.MR. HILL: All right.ACTING ADMINISTRATOR BARSA: I was just in Beirut. I was with many implementing partners we're working for a long time. Many of them, religious faith organizations. I'm not going to name the organizations who I saw on the street. But when I was walking down the streets in the devastated sectors of Beirut, I saw many of these organizations cleaning up rubble and glass. It wasn't Shia rubble and glass. It wasn't Druze rubble and glass. Or Sunni rubble and glass. Or Christian rubble and glass. It was rubble and glass. So, without need, these religious groups were going in, cleaning in, pitching help, making sure the entire communities were there. And that was one of the proudest moments, seeing these groups, these religious groups helping the entire community.MR. HILL: Right. You know, that's great. And Samah, I've been to Father Mario's pizza place. And if the proof is in the tasting, it's some of the best pizza I've had. It was great.MS. NORQUIST: It is.MR. HILL: But that you're hearing that the U.S. government capitalized on the generosity of a religious group that was willing to take a hand in helping people in desperate need. And as you know, the refugees in Jordan, and this was true in Lebanon and Turkey as well, are often missed by the U.N. system.They just don't get help. And if we don't help them in this way, they don't get help. And we don't unleash what they can do to help. I'll give you one example from my experience in government. It was during the PEPFAR years when we gave a lot of money to every kind of religious organization you can think of so long as their message supported the public health message that needed to go out to stop the spread of HIV. Now, we gave money to secular organizations. We gave money to religious organizations. There was no question of a violation of church-state.What would have been a violation is, we're only going to help the Muslims. So, we're only going to help the Christians. We're only going to help the Buddhists. If you're willing to help anybody of goodwill and not discriminate against them because they happened to be religious, that's not only right, that's prudent. And it makes a lot of sense to do that. Samah?MS. NORQUIST: And one thing I will add to that, Kent, and that's what under Acting Administrator Barsa's leadership, it's not -- the ultimate goal is not just the systems and the hand down, right?It's lifting those communities and remind them that they are citizens of that country. So, we're not reminding them they're Christians, Muslims, Bahai, or Buddhists. But they are Lebanese. They are, you know, Nigerian. They are Nicaraguan. They are part of that society. And they cannot be discriminated against. And we cannot discriminate against our assistance toward those communities.MR. HILL: Right. And just one final point on this. Beyond the ability of a faith-based group or a religious group to provide a public service that is legitimate for us to fund, it's the deeper -- and maybe this is the far more important point. If there's chaos, like in Lebanon now, and the hatred and the violence is right there on the threshold of everything, if you can get three or four religious communities and leaders together from different communities who, say, call on their own communities to play a role in rebuilding it, and they do it together, it sends such a powerful message. And then sometimes they can accomplish that which cannot be accomplished in any other way. And to turn your back on that healing of society just because they happened to be religious would be just countered through our foreign policy interests.I think it would be better to -- we're running out of time here. And Jeremy, I'm going to ask you if you can perhaps put up on the screen a couple of questions. Maybe let's start with one, and let Samah and Acting Administrator Barsa respond to that. "What lessons can be learnt --" this may be somebody from Great Britain -- "by other countries' donor agencies? In other words, if USAID looks at DFID or other international bilateral organizations who are working in the space of trying to promote pluralism and religious freedom, are there some specific things that we can learn or ways that we can partner with them? I guess that would be -- okay. So, I'll let you start, Administrator Barsa. And then Samah, if you could give your thoughts on that.ACTING ADMINISTRATOR BARSA: Well, certainly, you know, we've talked a lot about, you know, the theory of what we're doing and why religious and ethnic minorities are critical for our development work. I'll actually turn to Samah to talk to the -- at the tactical level in terms of what other countries may be doing and how we're interacting with them. I'll turn it to Samah.MS. NORQUIST: So, thanks, boss. The -- so, as you know, Kent, the United States hosted two ministerials.MR. HILL: Yeah.MS. NORQUIST: One on religious freedom, one in '18 and one in '19. And that really brought the -- emphasized the seriousness of this priority to our country and to the Trump administration as a priority of the -- of carrying out foreign policy. And when we started our -- I'll speak from my experience in Iraq. When we started the work in Iraq, there were some countries that are doing some work. As you know, the government of Hungary was very, very active on the ground. But when the United States stepped in and elevated this issue and the world's attention into it, in a bipartisan manner, the world took notice. And we started seeing countries like Germany, France stepping in, whether it's with direct assistance on the ground, whether finding different solutions to address those needs that -- of those communities. So, in -- I'm very biased towards the United States. I think we have the magic wand every time -- with our leadership. It is incredible how we're able to galvanize the world and bring them on a -- in a united front to do more good on this issue.MR. HILL: Right. I might say that I've been aware and actually involved in a major initiative of the British government. DFID has been critical that -- they're equivalent to our USAID.In the last couple of years, they have been doing some remarkable work connecting the plight of religious minorities to the question of whether the international and national aid agencies, sometimes, if they're missed in the cracks. They don't get helped in the way they should. They're doing major studies on this. Jeremy, who introduced our session today, has been very, very involved with this. But I've been impressed with that. I've also been impressed that quite a number of countries now have followed the U.S. lead and have an ambassador for religious freedom. And that's a -- that's an encouraging sign. Because what it says to their own country into their own diplomatic core into the world is this matters. This makes a difference. This isn't a -- sort of a niche issue for religious minorities. This matters to us all. We have working with us now former ambassador of Canada Andrew Bennett, and, you know, his perspective that he brings from Canada on this and working on this. So, the U.S. is not isolated here. And I think you're right, Samah, the two ministerials which were the two biggest in history bringing Secretary of State level are very close in one place to talk about religious freedom issues. That's a first. And I -- my hope and prayer is it doesn't matter who wins the election. That that's important enough that it will continue because it is a bipartisan issue or ought to be on this --MS. NORQUIST: And it's an American issue too.MR. HILL: It's an American -- it is. It's an American issue too. Jeremy, another question. "How can we help with the action plan for the executive order regarding religious freedom? This is somebody who's interested in actually seeing the executive order implemented. And I think the implication seems to be maybe from the standpoint, we maybe perhaps being the private sector or NGOs. I mean, you mentioned that I think earlier, Samah or John, I can't remember which, that USAID partners, that's the key to defending the taxpayer dollars. So, if they partner with contractors and with NGOs. So -- and you trying to get your job done on the executive order, Samah, how can other NGOs and others in American civil society be of assistance to you and the agency and helping the chief successor?MS. NORQUIST: Thank you for the question. So, one of the things that we are trying to be more active and is actually when we talk to new and underutilized partners, is work with them and showing them how they can become partners with us. How do -- I'm sorry?MR. HILL:The New Partnerships Initiative, for example?MS. NORQUIST: Yeah. The -- so, many of those local, little groups don't know how to apply for grants, don't know what their regulations are, what the requirements are. So, one of the things that -- for example, we -- when we were -- when we initiated the Iraq NPI is we actually might -- one of my team members and I went to Erbil and met -- and did a demonstration for what -- how to apply for sense number and all the wonderful bureaucratic things that I still don't understand. But it also allowed them to see why we have so many requirements and regulations.MR. HILL: Right.MS. NORQUIST: Some of them are good, and some of them are not. But it's to protect our -- some of them are mandated internally, and some of them are mandated by Congress. So, because of our responsibility towards the taxpayers, we always have to be transparent. We always have to be by the books, which is how we do it. But how can people come and talk to us? Tell us how we can help. There's a lot that we need to learn. And as I mentioned, that working with our colleagues, of civil servants, and Foreign Service officer, and even contractors is how we talk about this issue. This is not for one group versus the other. This is not for one political party in the U.S. versus the other. This is an American value. And this is how -- when Americans want to see how goodness they do, that is one of the ways that Foreign Assistance can provide to communities that don't have the opportunities that we have in the U.S.MR. HILL: Right. You know, that certainly makes sense. I remember in the 1990s I was in charge of the Balkans not long after the Balkan War. And we put out a $10 million program, which was a little different than other programs. We told folks, "Now, tell us how you're going to, you know, work on this particular project. We actually -- obviously, in the wake of communism and the inter-religious conflict, you've got tremendous conflict here. We will entertain proposals from anybody, secular or religious, as to what might restore the spiritual, moral capital of your society." And at first, there was this complete silence. That's a much harder question than "How are you going to dig a well in this town?" This required a lot of thinking. And one group came up with an interesting idea. They said, "What if we had a national program in Albania that would highlight each week or each month a citizen who has done something selfless or generous or promoting reconciliation?" And so, we funded this television program. It became the number one watch program in Albania. People were so hungry for the good news that citizens are not just special interest groups who are only at each other's throats. They are sometimes individuals who care about other people, people outside their tribe, their religious group, as citizens. And it sort of started something going that was worth -- and I think sometimes we have to do more thinking about, what do we actually do to cultivate those values that can matter?There was a former USAID mission director, and I'm trying -- Lawrence Harrison was his name in the 1990s. He was way before our time, Samah and John, but he had five different missions in Latin America. And when he got out of government, he asked himself the question, "What did I learn from my year -- USAID years? And you know what is -- he wrote a book entitled Culture Matters. And what he meant was underdevelopment and scarcity and poverty are connected to values. If you don't find a way to access sources of community spirit and values, sometimes religious communities are the places that spawn this, we know they can also spawn hatred, but they can spawn the values and virtues that can help. If you don't find a way to address cultural issues, the poverty issues will be with you forever. And I think USAID has shown more courage over a number of administrations and most places in the world to ask those deeper questions about how to achieve development by a promotion of values.MS. NORQUIST: And inclusion.MR. HILL: And inclusion -- well, of course, that is a value, isn't it? The whole value of inclusion and pluralism and religious freedom, it's all based on what you talked about earlier, Samah, is the American experience at its best and figuring out a way to, you know, modestly but to firmly talk about that. Any last comments before we draw this to a close?ACTING ADMINISTRATOR BARSA: Well, certainly from my end, I can't emphasize enough the value and the appreciation we have for our relationship with you, Kent and RFI. This is -- these are challenges that are going to be with us for a while. But we're -- we can make a positive difference. We can change the world working together. I'm very proud to have people like Samah and so many talented professionals here on the team at USAID in the field making a difference. I am truly blessed to be in this fight along with you. So, thank you so much for all that you do.MR. HILL: Thanks, sir. Samah, any last words?MS. NORQUIST: For me, first of all, thank you for having us. It's always a pleasure to work and learn more from groups -- advocacy groups like yourself. I am very humbled to be in where I am, from a daughter of an immigrant to be part in serving the American people and the president of the United States. And I'm very fortunate to be working with John Barsa, because he truly believes in this issue and continues to empower us to do that kind of work.MR. HILL: Well, thank you very much. And this has been a great conversation. A lot of issues that I think are very important have come up. And I think what we all must work and particularly labor for is that the truth of the importance of pluralism and religious freedom is it's got to be seen in this country that is so polarized as a bipartisan issue, something that doesn't depend on who's president, something that USAID and the State Department and others promote no matter what, because it's part of our national security strategy. And it's not just the moral thing to do, it is the right thing to do. So, thank you both for participating. And thanks to the many people who have signed up and watched this on the webinar. So, thank you.Load-Date: August 19, 2020End of Document

Below is a column arguing that the U.S. should take an aggressive stand against TikTok because of the national security risks posed by the Chinese-owned company. You can find a counterpoint here, where Will Rinehart, a senior research fellow at the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University, argues that the U.S. should not make a decisive move against TikTok until definitive proof of wrongdoing can be found. Why is the Trump administration going after TikTok, a popular video-sharing social networking service owned by a Chinese-based internet technology company? It's not that the White House is fed up with the endless videos of stupid dog tricks or adolescent synchronized dance moves. The administration issued its sell-or-get-out ultimatum for a very good reason: As long as TikTok remains in Chinese hands, it poses a serious economic and national security threat to all Americans.Trump doesn't have it in for every Chinese company operating here. For example, when Anbang, the Chinese insurance giant, bought the landmark Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City, it didn't trigger late night meetings in the West Wing.But the White House is quite rightly concerned about a handful of Chinese global technology companies whose products and services can give them broad access to information on most everything our private citizens, businesses and government officials plan, say and do.The regime in Beijing knows that knowledge is power and has been long committed to making China “the” global information super power. Its goal is to be able to collect information from around the world and weaponize it, wielding information the way other countries use money or military might to achieve their objectives.With a tremendous boost from the theft of intellectual property from American and other foreign corporations and universities, China is now a world leader in two key areas of R&D: artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Beijing is now on the cusp of an almost unimaginable capability to decrypt, sift through, analyze and exploit massive amounts of data. What they seek now is the virtually unlimited capacity to hoover up American information. With that in the bank, the weaponization can begin.But, some may object, TikTok isn't the Chinese government. Let's be clear: every company in China works for the Chinese Communist Party. They are required, by law, to turn over any information they can access, whenever the Party asks for it. It's not just a matter of cooperating with the regime or being friendly to it. They must take and obey all orders from the regime, and that includes handing over any American data they touch, regardless of privacy commitments, legal concerns or respect for intellectual property.The administration is rightly concerned about any company that can deliver the keys to the information kingdom to Beijing. That's what motivated the White House campaigns against letting the Chinese telecom giants Huawei and ZTE build out the 5G telecom infrastructure for our nation and our allies.TikTok is another of those companies that raises legitimate concerns. More than 14 million Americans are already on the platform, and that number is growing by leaps and bounds. Those Americans are happily dumping all kinds of information into the service, most of them blithely unaware that all that data winds up in China and can be used and abused for all kinds of purposes. Clearly, this poses an information security threat.If TikTok wants to operate in the U.S., its operations should not be controlled by Beijing. The administration has, in principle, accepted a proposal that the company divest itself of its U.S. operations and sell them to an American partner, such as Microsoft. The government didn't invent this solution. It arose from the private sector, which came forward and said, “We could make this work.”Beijing, of course, is not wild about the idea. It brazenly claimed the U.S. was trying to “steal” TikTok. Nonsense! Whoever buys TikTok's U.S. operations would pay a fair market value.While the buy-out may leave Beijing sulking, it would be good for American consumers. The U.S. social networking landscape could use more diversity and competition. The current security concerns could be reasonably addressed, making TikTok at least as safe as other U.S, based platforms. The deal would also bring with it more U.S. jobs, more U.S. profit and more U.S. tax revenues.This would be a win-win for everybody, except the Chinese Communist Party and its grand imperial designs.It's always good to see Washington focus on the big issues - like how to succeed in the great power competition. It's even better when our leaders come up with responsible, credible solutions that protect our security, increase our prosperity, and safeguard our freedoms.That's what the administration has done here. In doing so, it is also sending the right message to Beijing: “We are not going to stand by and let the world be run by Beijing rules. Rather, we are pressing for a world where China respects other nations and their citizens and treats them fairly.A Heritage Foundation vice president, James Jay Carafano directs the think tank's research in matters of national security and foreign relations.Graphic This photo taken on November 21, 2019, shows the logo of the social media video sharing app Tiktok displayed on a tablet screen in Paris.

'Why We Are Suing the Administration': Read TikTok's Explanation for Taking on TrumpNewsweek.comAugust 24, 2020 Monday 12:31 PM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1776 wordsByline: Marina WattsHighlight: "Now is the time for us to act. We do not take suing the government lightly, however we feel we have no choice but to take action to protect our rights, and the rights of our community and employees," the statement notes.BodyTikTok is taking on President Donald Trump. On Monday, the social media app announced that they are suing the Administration, which will ban TikTok starting next month."This data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information—potentially allowing China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage," Trump wrote in an executive order on August 6.Now, the app has taken action and filed a lawsuit against the United States, in order to protect their rights, the rights of the TikTok community, and their employees. They shared a complete explanation on their website, referring to the executive order and explaining several impacts of the app's ban."Today we are filing a complaint in federal court challenging the Administration's efforts to ban TikTok in the US," the app's statement began. "As a company we have always focused on transparency, so we want to explain why we are taking this step.""Over the past few years, people of all backgrounds have embraced the TikTok community. Today, 100 million Americans turn to TikTok for entertainment, inspiration, and connection; countless creators rely on our platform to express their creativity, reach broad audiences, and generate income; our more than 1,500 employees across the US pour their hearts into building this platform every day, with 10,000 more jobs planned in California, Texas, New York, Tennessee, Florida, Michigan, Illinois, and Washington State; and many of the country's leading brands are on TikTok to connect with consumers more authentically and directly than they can elsewhere."Put simply, we have a thriving community and we are grateful – and responsible – to them."The Executive Order issued by the Administration on August 6, 2020 has the potential to strip the rights of that community without any evidence to justify such an extreme action, and without any due process. We strongly disagree with the Administration's position that TikTok is a national security threat and we have articulated these objections previously."Now is the time for us to act. We do not take suing the government lightly, however we feel we have no choice but to take action to protect our rights, and the rights of our community and employees."In our complaint we make clear that we believe the Administration ignored our extensive efforts to address its concerns, which we conducted fully and in good faith even as we disagreed with the concerns themselves:"The executive order seeks to ban TikTok purportedly because of the speculative possibility that the application could be manipulated by the Chinese government. But, as the U.S. government is well aware, Plaintiffs have taken extraordinary measures to protect the privacy and security of TikTok's U.S. user data, including by having TikTok store such data outside of China (in the United States and Singapore) and by erecting software barriers that help ensure that TikTok stores its U.S. user data separately from the user data of other ByteDance products. These actions were made known to the U.S. government during a recent U.S. national security review of ByteDance's 2017 acquisition of a China-based company, Musical.ly. As part of that review, Plaintiffs provided voluminous documentation to the U.S. government documenting TikTok's security practices and made commitments that were more than sufficient to address any conceivable U.S. government privacy or national security concerns...""The Administration ignored the great lengths that TikTok has gone to in order to demonstrate our commitment to serving the US market:"The key personnel responsible for TikTok, including its CEO, Global Chief Security Officer, and General Counsel, are all Americans based in the United States—and therefore are not subject to Chinese law. U.S. content moderation is likewise led by a U.S.-based team and operates independently from China, and, as noted above, the TikTok application stores U.S. user data on servers located in the United States and Singapore.""Further, as we note in our complaint, not only does the Executive Order ignore due process, it also authorizes the prohibition of activities that have not been found to be "an unusual and extraordinary threat," as required by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), under which the Administration is purportedly acting:"By banning TikTok with no notice or opportunity to be heard (whether before or after the fact), the executive order violates the due process protections of the Fifth Amendment."The order is ultra vires because it is not based on a bona fide national emergency and authorizes the prohibition of activities that have not been found to pose 'an unusual and extraordinary threat.'""In the complaint we also point to the fact that the August 6 Executive Order is a misuse of IEEPA:"...the actions directed in the August 6 executive order are not supported by the emergency declared a year earlier in Executive Order 13873."That previous executive order was designed to address asserted U.S. national security concerns about certain telecommunications companies' ability to abuse access to 'information and communications technology and services' that 'store and communicate vast amounts of sensitive information, facilitate the digital economy, and support critical infrastructure and vital emergency services, in order to commit malicious cyber-enabled actions, including economic and industrial espionage against the United States and its people.'"TikTok Inc. is not a telecommunications provider and it does not provide the types of technology and services contemplated by the 2019 executive order. Specifically, TikTok Inc. does not provide the hardware backbone to 'facilitate the digital economy,' and TikTok Inc. has no role in providing 'critical infrastructure and vital emergency services.'""In the complaint we also go into significant detail about the nearly year-long effort we made in good faith to provide the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ("CFIUS") the voluminous information requested – was disregarded – and the numerous steps we offered to take in our commitment to transparency and cooperation:'In 2019, CFIUS contacted ByteDance to consider whether to review its acquisition of Musical.ly, a China-based video-sharing platform—even though Musical.ly was based in China and had very limited assets in the United States. This review was highly unusual in that ByteDance had acquired Musical.ly two years earlier in 2017, Musical.ly was previously Chinese-owned and based in China, and ByteDance had predominantly abandoned Musical.ly's limited U.S. assets by the time of CFIUS's outreach in 2019.'During this period, and through the course of the CFIUS review, ByteDance provided voluminous documentation and information in response to CFIUS's questions. Among other evidence, ByteDance submitted detailed documentation to CFIUS demonstrating TikTok's security measures to help ensure U.S. user data is safeguarded in storage and in transit and cannot be accessed by unauthorized persons—including any government—outside the United States.'CFIUS never articulated any reason why TikTok's security measures were inadequate to address any national security concerns, and effectively terminated formal communications with Plaintiffs well before the conclusion of the initial statutory review period. Notwithstanding the U.S. government's failure to identify any security risk, in an effort to address any conceivable concerns that the U.S. government may have and to assure continuity for the U.S. users who had come to value and cherish the platform that TikTok provides, Plaintiffs took the extraordinary step of offering to restructure their U.S. business...'Despite these repeated efforts and concrete proposals to alleviate any national security concerns, the agency record reflects that CFIUS repeatedly refused to engage with ByteDance and its counsel about CFIUS's concerns.'"Finally, despite all of these efforts, without the standard communication appropriate in a CFIUS case, and with little regard to the mitigation proposals that TikTok had made, CFIUS rushed out its decision within five minutes of its deadline:"At 11:55 p.m. on July 30, 2020—the final day of the statutory CFIUS review period—the Committee issued a letter stating that 'CFIUS has identified national security risks arising from the Transaction and that it has not identified mitigation measures that would address those risks.'"The CFIUS letter was principally based on outdated news articles, failed to address the voluminous documentation that Plaintiffs had provided demonstrating the security of TikTok user data, and was flawed in numerous other respects.""Likewise, in the August 6 Executive Order issued under IEEPA, the Administration failed to follow due process and act in good faith, neither providing evidence that TikTok was an actual threat, nor justification for its punitive actions. We believe the Administration's decisions were heavily politicized, and industry experts have said the same. As the complaint explains:"The executive order is not rooted in bona fide national security concerns. Independent national security and information security experts have criticized the political nature of this executive order, and expressed doubt as to whether its stated national security objective is genuine..."The President's demands for payments have no relationship to any conceivable national security concern and serve only to underscore that Defendants failed to provide Plaintiffs with the due process required by law.""To be clear, we far prefer constructive dialogue over litigation. But with the Executive Order threatening to bring a ban on our US operations – eliminating the creation of 10,000 American jobs and irreparably harming the millions of Americans who turn to this app for entertainment, connection, and legitimate livelihoods that are vital especially during the pandemic – we simply have no choice."We will continue the work we have long been undertaking to earn the trust of our full US community. For example, our Transparency and Accountability Center is central among those ongoing efforts as an industry-leading step to build trust and understanding of our moderation policies, source code, and data practices. Our legal challenge is a protection to ensure that these efforts can take place without the threat of an unwarranted ban hovering like a dark cloud over the joy and creativity of our community."Link to ImageGraphic TikTokOLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty ImagesIn this photo illustration, the social media application logo, TikTok is displayed on the screen of an iPhone on an American flag background on August 3, 2020 in Arlington, Virginia.Load-Date: August 24, 2020End of Document

TIKTOK CEO RESIGNS AS TENSIONS MOUNT WITH WHITE HOUSEStates News ServiceAugust 27, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 372 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):The head of TikTok resigned Wednesday as tensions mount between the Chinese-owned video platform and the White House, which contends TikTok is a security risk in the U.S.Chief Executive Officer Kevin Mayer announced his resignation days after the company filed a lawsuit challenging a U.S. government crackdown on the company over claims the social media app can be a tool to spy on U.S. citizens.Mayer, a former Disney executive who joined the company in May, said in letter to employees his decision to quit came after the "political environment has sharply changed" in recent weeks."I understand that the role that I signed up for, including running TikTok globally, will look very different as a result of the U.S. administration's action to push for a sell-off of the U.S. business."U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on August 6 banning TikTok unless its parent company, ByteDance, sells its U.S. operations to an American company within 90 days.FILE - The logo of the TikTok application is seen on a screen in this picture illustration taken Feb. 21, 2019.Computer software firm Microsoft, headquartered in the northwestern U.S. city of Redmond, Washington, has confirmed it is negotiating to purchase TikTok's operations in the U.S., Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Bloomberg News has reported that technology business Oracle Corp., based in the western U.S. city of Redwood City, California, is also entertaining a bid for the company.TikTok argues in its lawsuit that Trump's executive order was an abuse of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act because it is not "an unusual and extraordinary threat."The company provides a platform on which short videos are shared. Since its launch in 2017, TikTok has become very popular, with hundreds of millions of users worldwide, many of them teens.U.S. officials are concerned that TikTok may pose a security threat, fearing that the company might share its user data with China's government. However, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, has said it does not share user data with the Chinese government and maintains that it only stores U.S. user data in the U.S. and Singapore.Load-Date: August 27, 2020End of Document

Donald Trump wants to ban TikTok in U.S.CE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 1, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 695 wordsBodyU.S. President Donald Trump said Saturday will take steps to ban TikTok, a popular Chinese-owned video app that has raised national security and censorship concerns.Trump's statements came after reports were published that the government would be planning to order the Chinese company ByteDance to sell TikTok. On Friday it was also said that the Microsoft software giant is in negotiations to acquire the app.TikTok to retire in the coming days of Hong Kong and USA considers banning Chinese social network"As far as TikTok is concerned, we are banning it in the United States," Trump told reporters Friday aboard Air Force One on a flight back from Florida.Trump noted that he could use emergency economic powers or an executive order to implement the measure, and insisted that "I have the authority." "It will be signed tomorrow," he added.Information published by Bloomberg News and Wall Street Journal pointed out, citing anonymous sources, that the government could soon announce its decision to order ByteDance to divest into TikTok.Microsoft would be interested in buying Chinese video giant TikTokThere have also been reports from tech giants and U.S. financial firms interested in buying or investing in TikTok as the White House turns its attention to the app. The New York Times and Fox Business, citing an unidentified source, said Friday that Microsoft was in talks to acquire the platform. Microsoft declined to comment.In a statement Friday, TikTok said: "While we don't comment on rumors or speculation, we rely on TikTok's long-term success."ByteDance launched TikTok in 2017. He then bought Musical.ly, a popular video service among teenagers in the United States and Europe, and merged them. Chinese users have an identical service, Douyin.TikTok's funny videos and ease of use have made it immensely popular, and American tech giants like Facebook and Snapchat see it as a competitive threat. The platform said it has tens of millions of users in the United States and hundreds of millions worldwide.Censorship and data securityBut its Chinese capital has raised concerns about the censorship of the videos, including critics with the Beijing government, and the possibility of it sharing user data with Chinese authorities.TikTok maintains that it does not censor videos on matters sensitive to China and that the Beijing executive would not have access to the data of its users in the United States even if it requested it. The firm has hired an American chief executive, an exalted Disney charge, in an attempt to distance itself from the issue of his property.U.S. Homeland Security officials have been reviewing the acquisition of Musical.ly in recent months, while the military has banned their employees from installing the app on government cell phones. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said earlier this month that Washington was considering banning TikTok.These national security concerns resemble a broader U.S. offensive to rein in Chinese companies, including telecom providers Huawei and ZTE. The Trump administration has ordered the country to stop employing these suppliers' equipment on U.S. networks. Washington has also tried to convince its allies to turn away from Huawei in the face of concerns that the Chinese government has access to its data, something the group has denied.HistoryThe Trump administration is alreadyintervened in the past to block or dissolve agreements for national security issues, including preventing a $117 billion offer from Singapore's Broadcom for $117 billion by chipmaker Qualcomm in 2018, in an effort to help retain the country's leadership in the telecommunications space. In addition, he asked China's Beijing Kunlun Tech Co. to get rid of Grindr, a gay dating app, which he bought in 2016.Other nations have also taken action against TikTok.

ASBMB JOINS AMICUS BRIEFStates News ServiceAugust 26, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1213 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: ROCKVILLE, MD BodyThe following information was released by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB):Society and other nonprofits raise concerns about racial profiling by federal investigators and prosecutors' attempts to criminalize administrative errorsBy Sarina NeoteAugust 26, 2020The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology has joined an amicus brief filed Aug. 20 in federal court by the nonprofit Asian Americans Advancing Justice and its affiliate Asian Law Caucus.The brief, submitted into the record in the case of the United States v. Feng Tao, provides evidence of racial profiling by federal investigators of Asian American scientists and raises concerns about federal prosecutors attempts to criminalize what have been considered in the past administrative errors.Tao, a tenured associate professor at the University of Kansas since 2014, was originally indicted in August 2019 on one count of wire fraud and three counts of program fraud. A superseding indictment on Jan. 15 charged Tao with two counts of wire fraud and one count of program fraud. Federal prosecutors allege that he failed to disclose to KU his affiliation with a university in China. Tao has denied wrongdoing.Taos case is just one of hundreds brought in recent years by the U.S. Department of Justice against American citizens of Chinese heritage. The amicus brief points to both prosecution and sentencing disparities and attributes them, in part, to politicized Anti-Asian rhetoric and scapegoating that has ultimately influenced decision-making, structures, and training at federal agencies.The case against TaoTao, a chemical engineer, conducted research at KUs Center for Environmentally Beneficial Catalysis, which has contracts with the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation.In the indictment, the government alleges that Tao signed a five-year contract in 2018 with a talent program sponsored by the Chinese government and failed to disclose the agreement to his university, allowing him to maintain his existing position, to continue receiving a salary partly covered by federal funds, and to continue conducting research funded by the DOE and NSF.Tao has denied signing a contract appointing him to a professorship at Fuzhou University and has denied defrauding KU or federal funding agencies.John C. Yang, president and executive director of AAJC, told ASBMB Today that even when such disclosure violations do occur, these have been administrative violations requiring retroactive disclosures and sometimes institutional disciplinary action.Taos defenseTaos defense lawyers argue that the DOJ is trying to criminalize what would in the past have been considered administrative errors so that it can show that its China Initiative is having results without having to produce evidence of intellectual property theft or export control violations.The DOJs China Initiative is intended to counter Chinese national security threats by identifying and prosecuting people engaged in trade secret theft, hacking and economic espionage. The agencys website states that one goal is to (d)evelop an enforcement strategy concerning non-traditional collectors (e.g. researchers in labs, universities and the defense industrial base) that are being coopted into transferring technology contrary to U.S. interests.Yang said the initiative puts pressure on prosecutors to look for cases to charge individuals with, and, as a result, you end up with charges which are not typically considered criminal economic espionage cases but ... administrates cases (that) escalate so that (the DOJ) can claim that they are fulfilling the mission.The amicus briefThe amicus brief was filed just days after Taos lawyers filed a motion asking the court to throw out the charges. Twenty-seven organizations and individuals, including the ASBMB, joined the brief.It warns that unwarranted and racially motivated investigations and prosecutions of Asian American scientists and researchers will result in irreparable harm to these professionals reputations, careers, and livelihoods, and foment prejudice against Asian Americans more broadly.It also characterizes the China Initiative as having a reach that has become overbroad. It states: While determining real security threats is necessary, the FBI and other government agencies should rely on real evidence rather than racial profiling and gross generalizations to create suspicion about an entire race or ethnicity.The brief documents how the DOJ has increased pressure on universities and academic institutions to investigate Asian American scientists and has sought to criminalize conflicts of interest and disclosure violations.Yang said the briefs co-signers are trying to bring in some of the broader perspectives about what is happening nationwide with respect to the China Initiative (and) what is happening nationwide to Chinese American scientists.Its important to make sure that the court understands that this is part of what we perceive as a potential pattern and practice by the government. And its not limited to this one individual case.Funding agenciesThe DOJ is not the only federal agency scrutinizing researchers ties to China.The National Institutes of Health has been investigating scientists with undisclosed ties to foreign governments since 2018. According to Michael Lauer, deputy director for extramural research, 93% of the 189 cases the NIH is investigating have ties to China. The vast majority of scientists under investigation are Asian or Asian American men in their 50s.The National Science Foundation also has been investigating scientists suspected of violating the science funding agencys rules regarding foreign influence. The Office of Inspector General has reassigned, suspended or terminated funding for 16 to 20 scientists. All but two cases have ties to China.Scientists wrongly accusedProsecutors have abandoned several recent cases against American citizens for lack of evidence.Sherry Chen, Xiaoxing Xi, Guoqing Cao and Wei Su all saw charges against them dropped after it became clear that prosecutors had insufficient evidence of wrongdoing. However, their careers still suffered.Xi, the Laura H. Carnell professor of physics at Temple University, spoke to ASBMB Today about his experience. At that time, I had absolutely no idea (the FBI was) targeting me until they showed up in the early morning at my house (and) arrested me in front of my family and then charged me for having made a device for Chinese collaborators, which I never did.Xi urges the scientific community to protect Asian American scientists from being wrongly targeted.You dont have to do anything wrong to become a target as long as you have collaboration with colleagues in China. And now ... if you have a relative or a friend you talk to in China, you could become a target. And thats very, very scary, he said.Yang said the targeting of scientists with ties to China is likely to have lasting effects.There are scientists who have come to this country because they believe in the freedoms the United States has to offer, he said, and yet, they are looking at the environment theyre in now and wondering if this environment is that much better than (those of) the countries they came from.Load-Date: August 26, 2020End of Document

With what they did to this country and the world, I don't want to talk to China right now," Trump said at a press conference in Yuma, southwest Arizona, one of the stops during a series of trips that will take him through different states in the coming days."They should have stopped him," insisted the US president, who has always accused the Beijing government of not doing enough to slow the progress of the pandemic from the outset. "So it's right, I've canceled the talks with China," he confirmed.Trump's statements came a day after he praised China's purchase of U.S. agricultural products, within the agreements that reached last January, but that Beijing will no longer be able to deliver because of the economic crisis caused by the pandemic.Relations between Washington and Beijing have been marked by tensions since Trump settled in the White House in January 2017.Most of the run-ins have been related to commercial and intellectual property disputes, until they reached their peak as the new coronavirus pandemic worsened.commentsforum0WhatsApp  Facebook  Twitter  Linkedin       Load-Date: August 20, 2020End of Document

Trump’s TikTok War Pits Free Speech Against National SecurityBillboardAugust 11, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Prometheus Global Media, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; TAGLength: 1730 wordsByline: Ashley Cullins,Natalie JarveyHighlight: The President is invoking national emergency powers in response to concerns about data privacy on TikTok because of its Chinese parent company, but experts say his actions flout the First Amendment.BodyAfter the novel coronavirus pandemic prompted stay-at-home orders across the globe, millions of people turned to social video app TikTok to cure their cabin fever.Not everyone, though, is pleased with the app’s growing popularity - especially amid data privacy concerns connected to Beijing-based parent company ByteDance, which is currently worth upwards of $100 billion. President Donald Trump is among the detractors and on Aug. 6 issued an executive order that would bar “any transaction by any person” with ByteDance or any of its subsidiaries.According to the order, TikTok “captures vast swaths of information from its users,” which could allow the Chinese government “to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.” Trump’s order also said that TikTok “reportedly censors” content and “may also be used for disinformation campaigns.”TikTok on Aug. 7 issued a statement saying that it was shocked by the order and it would take the matter to court if necessary.“The text of the decision makes it plain that there has been a reliance on unnamed ‘reports’ with no citations, fears that the app ‘may be’ used for misinformation campaigns with no substantiation of such fears, and concerns about the collection of data that is industry standard for thousands of mobile apps around the world,” reads the statement. “We have made clear that TikTok has never shared user data with the Chinese government, nor censored content at its request.”The company - which operates its U.S. headquarters out of Los Angeles and hired Disney veteran Kevin Mayer as its CEO this spring - said it has been working with the government for nearly a year to find solutions to the concerns, including expressing a willingness to sell its U.S. operations to an American company.“What we encountered instead was that the Administration paid no attention to facts, dictated terms of an agreement without going through standard legal processes, and tried to insert itself into negotiations between private businesses,” TikTok said. “We will pursue all remedies available to us in order to ensure that the rule of law is not discarded and that our company and our users are treated fairly - if not by the Administration, then by the US courts.”TikTok previously said that it stores the data of its American users on servers in the U.S. and Singapore. It also promised to open a transparency center in Los Angeles where it would provide more context on how it moderates the content that appears on its app. Though many users use TikTok to dance, tell jokes and cook, some use it as a political platform. It also served as a communication tool during the Black Lives Matters protests that spread through the country in June following George Floyd’s death.“There is serious reason to believe that the executive orders concerning TikTok and WeChat are motivated at least in part by a desire to censor and not simply to preserve national security,” says entertainment and media litigator John-Paul Jassy. “TikTok is used by an estimated 100 million Americans for all sorts of expression, including mocking the President and coordinating an effort to tank his Tulsa comeback rally.”He continues, “Given the President’s prior stances antagonistic to social media platforms, as well as his demand that the U.S. government get a percentage of any sale of TikTok, and his 45-day delay in actually implementing an order that is supposedly a national emergency, there is plenty of reason to doubt the motivations behind these orders.”Trump’s order points to perceived national security threats and cites the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act as providing his authority to take this action.In order to invoke the IEEPA, he’d have to declare a national emergency. Back in May 2019, through an executive order on securing the information and communications technology and services supply chain, Trump declared an emergency on the basis that unrestricted use of technology owned, manufactured or controlled by “foreign adversaries” gives those foes the ability to “create and exploit vulnerabilities” in those services that threaten national security, foreign policy and the economy.Once a national emergency has been declared, and amid “an unusual and extraordinary threat,” the IEEPA gives Trump the authority to investigate, regulate or prohibit certain business transactions between those subject to U.S. jurisdiction (companies and citizens) and foreign-owned entities.There are limits, though. There’s a carve out that specifically says the powers do not include the authority to regulate or prohibit, directly or indirectly, “any postal, telegraphic, telephonic, or other personal communication, which does not involve a transfer of anything of value” or to block “the importation from any country, or the exportation to any country, whether commercial or otherwise, regardless of format or medium of transmission, of any information or informational materials, including but not limited to, publications, films, posters, phonograph records, photographs, microfilms, microfiche, tapes, compact disks, CD ROMs, artworks, and news wire feeds.” There could be debate over whether TikTok streams that generate revenue from paid partnerships are, in fact, transferring something of value and therefore aren’t merely sending personal communication in 15-second installments - but it’s harder to argue that they aren’t transmitting information.Jassy is dubious that the NEA and IEEPA apply here.“The International Emergency Economic Powers Act applies to ‘unusual and extraordinary threats,'” says Jassy. “If the threat were so unusual and extraordinary, why did it take this long to issue an Executive Order, and why is it on hold for 45 days? A similar question arises under invocation of the National Emergencies Act.”While the exact ramifications of the order remain unclear, Electronic Frontier Foundation Civil Liberties Director David Greene says it’s difficult to imagine a version that wouldn’t be problematic with regard to free speech.“If the effect of it is to make it illegal for U.S. persons to use TikTok that raises serious First Amendment concerns,” he says. “When people use TikTok they're speaking. It's also a serious First Amendment issue if it would make it illegal for the app stores to distribute TikTok. The app stores themselves have a First Amendment right to distribute speech and the apps themselves are speech.”Julie Shapiro, director of Loyola Law School’s Entertainment and Media Institute, agrees that it’s too soon to know for sure that the effect of Trump’s order would be an outright ban - but, if it is, the effects could be widespread.“If TikTok is banned, then the App will be removed from the Apple and Google stores, or disabled entirely for U.S. users,” she says. “Social influencers will move to competitors (Instagram, Triller); commercial brands and professional sports teams will move their marketing money to competitors. There will be no music royalties generated for publishers and artists. If U.S. personal data collected by Chinese companies poses a security risk, banning TikTok is not the answer. A broader and more global consensus is necessary.”First launched as Douyin in China in 2016, TikTok soon began to spread to other countries under a different name. It came to the U.S. in 2018 after ByteDance acquired a similar app called Musical.ly for as much as $1 billion. The app, which was recently banned in India, has been downloaded more than 2 billion times around the world, according to third-party analytics firm Sensor Tower.TikTok has taken off with young Americans who find its interface easy to navigate, lowering the barrier to making entertaining content. Its powerful algorithm can also turn a little-known TikToker into an overnight viral sensation by promoting them via the personalized “For You” feed that users see when they first open the app. That’s how Charli D’Amelio, the 16-year-old dancer from Connecticut, became the most-followed creator on the app with nearly 80 million followers.While ByteDance is fighting Trump’s TikTok ban, the company has also been fielding acquisition offers for the app’s U.S. business. Microsoft was first to emerge as a contender for the business. Satya Nadella, CEO of the Redmond, Washington, based company, spoke with Trump after he said he was considering banning the app. In a statement, the company said it “fully appreciates the importance of addressing the President’s concerns” regarding TikTok and that it would seek to close a deal before his 45 day cut-off. Notes Shapiro, “If the transaction happens, then the national security concerns promulgated by Trump would be reduced.”Twitter has also reportedly held talks about acquiring the business. Though Trump uses Twitter frequently, the platform recently began labeling tweets of his that contain misinformation. The company is also considerably smaller and has shallower pockets than Microsoft. The deal talks come three years after Twitter shuttered a similar product, Vine.While Greene says he does believe there are legitimate security concerns surrounding TikTok, he doesn’t believe “that security concern justifies a total ban on the application.”He also warns that Trump’s parallel executive order targeting WeChat should put the entertainment industry on alert. WeChat is owned by Chinese media conglomerate Tencent, one of the largest companies in the world. The White House reportedly later clarified that order was only intended to affect WeChat, but so far there has been no further explanation.“Tencent owns fully or in part several video game companies with popular games in the U.S.,” says Greene. “It will be interesting to see if there will be similar pressure on Tencent to sell off its U.S. pieces.”Tencent currently owns stakes not only in Riot Games (League of Legends) and Epic Games (Fortnite) but also companies like Spotify and Universal Music Group - and it has distribution deals with major Hollywood players (its credits include A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, Wonder Woman and the upcoming Top Gun: Maverick) and a $1.5 billion five-year deal with the NBA to stream pro basketball games in China.This article was originally published by The Hollywood Reporter. Link to ImageLoad-Date: September 16, 2020End of Document

Microsoft negotiates TikTok business purchase in USCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 1, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 729 wordsBodyNEW YORK (AP) — Microsoft is in advanced negotiations to purchase U.S. operations from TikTok, the popular Chinese-owned video application that has been a cause for concern about national security and censorship, according to a person familiar with the discussions.The person spoke on condition that he remained anonymous given the delicacy of the negotiations.The potential agreement would be an achievement for both companies, making Microsoft Corp. a strong participant in the social media scene and providing relief to TikTok and its parent company ByteDance, a goal of President Donald Trump.Trump said Friday that he would take action as soon as Saturday to ban TikTok in the United States. The statements Trump gave Friday aboard Air Force One came after reports were published that the U.S. government would be planning to order the Chinese company ByteDance to sell TikTok."As far as TikTok is concerned, we are banning it in the United States," Trump told reporters Friday aboard Air Force One on his return from Florida.Trump noted that he could use emergency economic powers or an executive order to implement the measure, and insisted that "I have the authority.""It will be signed tomorrow," he added.Microsoft declined to comment.Reports from Bloomberg News and Wall Street Journal noted, citing anonymous sources, that the government could soon announce its decision to order ByteDance to divest into TikTok.There have also been reports from tech giants and U.S. financial firms interested in buying or investing in TikTok as the White House turns its attention to the app. The New York Times and Fox Business, citing an unidentified source, were the first to publish Friday that Microsoft was in talks to acquire the platform."While we don't comment on rumors or speculation, we rely on TikTok's long-term success," the company said in a statement Friday.On Saturday, TikTok released a short video in which her general manager in the United States, Vanessa Pappas, stresses that "we don't plan on going anywhere."ByteDance launched TikTok in 2017. He then bought Musical.ly, a popular video service among teenagers in the United States and Europe, and merged them. Chinese users have an identical service, Douyin.TikTok's funny videos and ease of use have made it immensely popular, and American tech giants like Facebook and Snapchat see it as a competitive threat. The platform said it has tens of millions of users in the United States and hundreds of millions worldwide.But its Chinese capital has raised concerns about the censorship of the videos, including critics with the Beijing government, and the possibility of it sharing user data with Chinese authorities.TikTok maintains that it does not censor videos on matters sensitive to China and that the Beijing executive would not have access to the data of its users in the United States even if it requested it. The firm has hired an American chief executive, an exalted Disney charge, in an attempt to distance itself from the issue of his property.U.S. Homeland Security officials have been reviewing the acquisition of Musical.ly in recent months, while the military has banned their employees from installing the app on government cell phones. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said earlier this month that Washington was considering banning TikTok.These national security concerns resemble a broader U.S. offensive to rein in Chinese companies, includingHuawei and ZTE. The Trump administration has ordered the country to stop employing these suppliers' equipment on U.S. networks. Washington has also tried to convince its allies to turn away from Huawei in the face of concerns that the Chinese government has access to its data, something the group has denied.The Trump administration has already intervened in the past to block or dissolve agreements for national security issues, including preventing a $117 billion offer from Singapore's Broadcom,s. In addition, he asked China's Beijing Kunlun Tech Co. to get rid of Grindr, a gay dating app, which he bought in 2016.Other nations have also taken action against TikTok. This month, India banned dozens of Chinese apps, including TikTok, citing privacy concerns at a time of high tension between New Delhi and Beijing.___The Associated Press reporters Kevin Freking, aboard Air Force One, and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this firm.Load-Date: August 2, 2020End of Document

Why does the US want to ban TikTok?CE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 7, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 719 wordsBodyMEXICO CITY.- You probably only know it as a social network through which you can watch and share short videos, adding music and effects. However, TikTok has been accused in several countries of being a risk to national security and, by a decree signed yesterday, could be banned in the United States, but where does all the conflict come from?TikTok is a free application that allows you to publish videos up to a minute long, most of them are comedy, although users address a wide variety of topics.Creators who have more than a thousand followers can live stream to their fans and receive digital gifts that can then be redeemed for money.The social network has attracted attention around the world due to its unprecedented success. Available in 150 countries and 75 languages, since early 2019, as the BBC reports, the app has regularly appeared very close to the top of the download lists. Most of its users are between 16 and 24 years old, 90% visit the social network more than once a day, until an average of 52 minutes is completed or, which is equivalent to a billion videos being viewed every day.In addition, due to the health emergency by the Covid-19 coronavirus, millions of people had to stay at home and look for options to entertain themselves, which proved to be a major boost for TikTok which in 2020 recorded nearly 2 billion downloads worldwide, raising its number of active users to 800 million people and their revenue by 521%.The origin of TikTok  TikTok, as we know it today was formed from various applications. The first was an app called Musical.ly which was released in 2014 and allowed users to create short videos by synchronizing their lips to pretend to sing or say dialogues of other content. Two years later, Chinese tech giant Bytedance launched a similar service in China dubbed Douyin.ByteDance later decided to expand to the rest of the world under a different name: TikTok. And in 2018, Bytedance bought Musical.ly and included it in TikTok's operations.However, Douyin did not disappear, it continues to operate within China as it is designed to comply with the policy of censorship imposed by the Communist Party. TikTok instead is the version available to the rest of the world. The link between the two apps is the reason for many of the concerns, both related to the security of user data and their respect for freedom of expression. Knowing that his origin could cause him trouble, ByteDance tried to distance himself from China, appointing Kevin Mayer, former Director of Strategy at Disney, as CEO of TikTok.Despite this, the first to ban the use of the app was the U.S. Army. Its affiliates cannot have an account in TikTok as, they claim, poses a threat to national security as it could be forced to "support and cooperate with intelligence operations controlled by the Chinese Communist party as Chinese companies have no legal means to reject government demands."To the technology company ByteDance responded with a statement that servers are located in the countries where the app is available.Also, Theo Bertram, TikTok's head of public policy for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, told the BBC: "The suggestion that we are somehow under the control of the Chinese government is completely false." He added that "definitely" they would say no "to any data request" from the Chinese government.Another reason why the platformhas been questioned is the amount of data it collects from its users as the videos viewed and commented; geographical location; your phone model and operating system uses and even everything that is copied and pasted, though, it can be said that several do. One more concern is that last year, the British newspaper The Guardian reported that TikTok's staff and automated systems had enforced moderation rules that censored all material considered politically sensitive.Images of the protests in Tiananmen Square in Beijing and claims of Tibet independence were contained within this allegedly prohibited or restricted material. However, ByteDance said these guidelines had been phased out.That's why the app is still in the eye of the hurricane and its operations in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand could be acquired by Microsoft in the coming weeks, otherwise it could disappear from app stores on September 20.Load-Date: August 8, 2020End of Document

This is what it's like when a country actually bans TikTokCNN WireAugust 13, 2020 Thursday 10:02 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1141 wordsDateline: SAN FRANCISCO (CNN Business) BodySAN FRANCISCO (CNN Business) --  Jaya Lall first joined TikTok in early March to make a slideshow set to music for her friend's birthday. But the short-form video app took on new significance to her three weeks later when India went into a coronavirus lockdown, forcing her to close the preschool she runs in the country's capital, New Delhi. Soon enough, she was posting as many as nine videos a day of herself dancing or lip-syncing to Hindi songs. She racked up nearly 8,000 followers in a matter of months. "I never thought that I could sing, or dance, or make all these faces," Lall told CNN Business.Then, on June 29, India suddenly banned TikTok. The app, which is owned by a Chinese company, was one of dozens banned in the country days after a violent border clash between India and China left at least 20 Indian soldiers dead. Several of China's most popular services, including messaging platform WeChat and social media site Weibo, were also banned.TikTok's app no longer appears on app stores in the country, and those who already have it see an error message that says it is "complying with the Government of India's directive." The app went off app stores and users began to see the message the day after the ban was announced. Lall said the ban took away a source of immense positivity in her life. It's a sentiment shared by others in India who spoke with CNN Business. Almost overnight, hundreds of millions in India suddenly needed to learn to live without an app once described as "the last sunny corner of the internet." And their experience could prove to be a harbinger for what's to come in the United States."You lose track of time. Hours go by, you don't realize. It's very nice," Lall said. "We are still hoping that TikTok will come back."President Donald Trump is now considering a similar course of action as he escalates his long-running battle with China over technology and security, signing an executive order last week that would ban TikTok in 45 days if it doesn't find a US buyer. While India's ban was triggered by a military conflict and followed nationalistic public appeals for a boycott of Chinese products, Trump's order --- citing security threats that experts say are largely theoretical or indirect --- has not had the same groundswell of support from Americans.News of a potential ban sent American TikTokers into a frenzy (or "going cray cray," as one creator put it) trying to figure out how they could port over their following to other apps such as Instagram or YouTube. (Trump has targeted at least one other app that India has already banned, WeChat, raising concerns among Chinese Americans who use it to communicate with family abroad.) While US TikTok users may worry about this worst case scenario, those in India are already living it. India's 200 million TikTok users --- twice as many as the app has in the United States --- have spent nearly two months in a largely fruitless search for alternatives. Facebook-owned Instagram immediately cashed in by launching its TikTok copycat, Instagram Reels, in India within a week of the ban. Instagram also made Reels available in the United Sates after Trump's proposed action. But self-professed TikTok addicts say it just isn't the same.Like in the United States, the announcement of the ban in India led to a flurry of influencers hurriedly posting videos asking their TikTok audience to follow them on Instagram, YouTube or other platforms."Currently for sure, there is no one that can come close to TikTok," said Abhay Jani. Jani, 24, downloaded TikTok a couple of years ago and said he would spend up to two hours a day watching videos on the app, usually overshooting the screen time restrictions he had set for himself. He enjoyed going down "rabbit holes" of the Indian internet such as farm TikTok, where he says farmers around the country would post videos of various agricultural techniques and activities. "I mean I was addicted to it," he said. Jani has since tried out some of the homegrown Indian alternatives such as Chingari, Mitron and Moj, but says their user interface and recommendation algorithms aren't up to TikTok's standards yet. He only visits them a couple of times a week.Lall has also tried a variety of different apps, including an Indian one called Roposo, American video platform Triller, and of course, Instagram Reels. Her latest discovery is a karaoke app called StarMaker."All of them are useless, they're really bad," she said, citing several issues including a relative lack of viewership and a poorer selection of filters. "TikTok was TikTok."Losing India is a huge blow to TikTok. The country's 700 million internet users make it the world's second-largest market after China, one that tech firms around the world have poured billions of dollars into for a foothold. TikTok was installed 26.4 million times --- an average of 660,000 installs a day --- and made about $317,000 in gross revenue from in-app purchases in India in the six weeks leading up to the ban, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower.This isn't the first time TikTok has been banned in India. It was blocked from app stores in the country last year after a court ruled it could expose children to inappropriate content, but was reinstated less than two weeks later after TikTok successfully appealed the decision. ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, has around 2,000 employees in the country. "Our employees are our biggest strength, and their well-being is our topmost priority," TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer said in a blog post following the ban. "We will do everything in our power to restore the positive experiences and opportunities that they can be proud of," he added. TikTok is working with the Indian government to address its concerns and remains committed to complying with local laws, the company's India head, Nikhil Gandhi, said in another post late last month."We have not shared any information of our users in India with any foreign governments, nor have we used such data in any manner that would compromise the integrity of India," he said. "Further, even if we are requested to in the future, we would not do so." TikTok has pushed back on the Trump administration's claims that it is a security threat, calling them "unfounded." To underscore its independence from China, TikTok has cited its recently hired American CEO, and said it has "never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked."Despite the pain of losing TikTok and the lack of viable alternatives, Lall agrees with the Indian government's decision to ban the app. "What they [China] are doing is wrong," she said. "We are happy that ... the ban happened but still we have a hope that [TikTok] will come back, we are waiting for it." TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Walmart is joining Microsoft in the pursuit of TikTokCNN WireAugust 27, 2020 Thursday 4:57 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1131 wordsDateline: NEW YORK/HONG KONG/WASHINGTON (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK/HONG KONG/WASHINGTON (CNN Business) --  Walmart is partnering with Microsoft in an attempt to buy TikTok, as the popular yet embattled short-form video app seeks a US buyer amid intense political scrutiny.The retail giant told CNN Business Thursday it is participating in the negotiations with Microsoft over a potential deal. CNBC was first to report the effort by the two companies.Walmart said its interest in TikTok stems from the way the app has "integrated e-commerce and advertising capabilities in other markets" and could bolster its access to consumers. "We believe a potential relationship with TikTok US in partnership with Microsoft could add this key functionality and provide Walmart with an important way for us to reach and serve omnichannel customers as well as grow our third-party marketplace and advertising businesses," Walmart said in a statement. "We are confident that a Walmart and Microsoft partnership would meet both the expectations of US TikTok users while satisfying the concerns of US government regulators," The announcement comes hours after TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer quit his job as the the video-sharing app faces criticism from President Donald Trump over its ownership by a Chinese company, Bytedance. "In recent weeks, as the political environment has sharply changed, I have done significant reflection on what the corporate structural changes will require, and what it means for the global role I signed up for," Mayer said in a memo to employees that was obtained by CNN Business. "It is with a heavy heart that I wanted to let you all know that I have decided to leave the company."In his letter, Mayer said to expect "a resolution very soon" --- a phrase indicating that a deal could be reached within the next week, according to a person familiar with the talks.TikTok hired Mayer, a former top Disney executive, less than four months ago to run the app, which is the first owned by a Chinese company to gain significant traction in western countries. In addition to his CEO responsibilities, Mayer became chief operating officer of ByteDance, TikTok's parent company. Since then, though, TikTok has come under fire from the US government, and Trump has threatened to ban the app if it isn't sold by ByteDance."We appreciate that the political dynamics of the last few months have significantly changed what the scope of Kevin's role would be going forward, and fully respect his decision," a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement. In his own memo to employees, ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming said he understood "that the political circumstances we are operating within could have significant impact on [Mayer's] job in any scenario."Zhang said Mayer spoke to him before quitting and that he wished Mayer well."I want all of you to know that I really appreciate the endless hours that you have worked, shutting out the noise around us to focus instead on our mission and what we are building for those who rely upon our platform," Zhang wrote. "The entire team is doing an incredible job, competing effectively against some of the biggest technology companies in the world to win the hearts and minds of users and brands, by offering a truly unique online experience."Even before Trump issued executive orders calling for TikTok's ban, the company was rethinking its corporate structure. The Wall Street Journal reported in early July that ByteDance was considering establishing a headquarters for the video app outside of China or a new management board to distance the service from the country. A TikTok spokesperson told CNN Business at the time that it was "evaluating changes."Mayer's departure is a "huge setback for the company," said Edith Yeung, who spent years investing in Chinese companies with venture capital firm 500 Startups. She is a partner with Race Capital, investing mostly in US firms. "[A] leader cannot jump ship in the most critical time for a company," she added. According to Trump's executive orders, TikTok poses a national security threat because the app collects a lot of data on users, which "threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information." The move against TikTok is part of an escalating US-China tech war that has already ensnared other Chinese apps and tech firms, such as Tencent-owned WeChat and Huawei. TikTok has sued the Trump administration over the initial executive order, calling it "heavily politicized." The company said Trump's order illegally rests on emergency powers law in ways that do not apply to TikTok. The company has also said that it stores data on its US users in the United States and in Singapore, and that it would refuse any request by the Chinese government for US user data.TikTok has 100 million users in the United States. The company has explored selling its US business, which industry experts say is worth between $40 billion and $50 billion, to Microsoft and reportedly to Oracle as well. Microsoft said it is exploring a deal to buy TikTok's operations in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, as well as the US business. "The role that I signed up for --- including running TikTok globally ---- will look very different as a result of the US Administration's action to push for a sell off of the US business," Mayer said in the memo to employees. "I've always been globally focused in my work, and leading a global team that includes TikTok US was a big draw for me."ByteDance launched the Chinese version of TikTok, called Douyin, in 2016. The international version debuted the following year and has grown to become one of the most popular social media apps in the world. As of July, TikTok said it had nearly 690 million global monthly active users. That still trails Facebook's 2.7 billion monthly active users, but the app is also considerably younger than its US rival. By August 2020, TikTok said it had surpassed two billion global downloads.Vanessa Pappas, the former YouTube executive who joined TikTok last year to become general manager of North America, Australia and New Zealand, will serve as interim head for TikTok globally, according to Mayer's memo. Pappas tweeted Thursday that she was "proud and humbled" to take her new role. "It's truly amazing what we've accomplished in 2 years, I have no doubt what we can accomplish in this next chapter!" she said.If Mayer had stuck it out, "he would be running one of the biggest social media companies in the world," Yeung said, though she added that "no American would blame him for quitting.""I wish he would hang in there," she said. "He could change the course of China-US tech history. Oh well."CNN Business' Sara Ashley O'Brien contributed to this report.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

DON'T BAN TIKTOK AND WECHATStates News ServiceAugust 14, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1188 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, NY BodyThe following information was released by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU):President Trump's executive orders threatening to ban TikTok and WeChat, two of the most popular messaging and social media apps in the world, are an unprecedented abuse of emergency powers. No president has ever taken actions like these against platforms that tens of millions of people in the United States use.Selectively banning platforms does little to protect our personal data from abuse comprehensive surveillance reform and consumer privacy legislation would actually help accomplish that goal. Instead, the bans could cut off the flow of information, art, and communication that social media provides, interfering with communities and connections users in the United States have with each other and with people around the world. This interference with freedom of expression and association violates the First Amendment.Trump's executive orders are vague and don't explain the "emergency" purportedly at issue. They also leave important details unclear for 45 days like the definition of "transactions" to which the bans apply, and how the prohibitions will apply to WeChat's parent company, Tencent, which has investments in a number of U.S.-based businesses, including Reddit and Riot Games.But here is what we do know:Trump's orders are an abuse of emergency powers under the pretense of national security.Trump has claimed the power to ban TikTok and WeChat under a law that Congress passed in 1977, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). When Congress passed this law, it intended to rein in abuses of presidential power. Too often, though, it has not worked that way.The law allows presidents to respond to "any unusual and extraordinary" foreign "threat" to the United States' "national security, foreign policy, or economy." But Congress did not define terms like "emergency," "threat," or "national security," or impose constraints on powers that presidents can abuse too easily, in violation of fundamental rights. That is why the ACLU believes presidential emergency powers and IEEPA must be fundamentally overhauled.Meanwhile, Trump has taken abuse of authority to yet another level, invoking emergency and national security powers far beyond what Congress intended and the Constitution allows, to score political points, serve his xenophobic and racist agenda, and spread fear and uncertainty. He appears to be doing the same thing by selectively banning TikTok and WeChat, which are owned by companies based in China. But even under IEEPA, Congress explicitly says that presidents can't ban any "personal communication, which does not involve the transfer of anything of value." Trumps orders appear to ignore this important constraint.Selectively banning entire platforms violates the First Amendment and harms freedom of speech online.Millions of people in the United States watch or post videos to TikTok and rely on WeChat for connections to family, friends, and work relationships. They are all engaging in First Amendment-protected speech, association, and expression.The online communities created by TikTok and WeChat are important to their users. People derive joy from posting songs and videos, or de-stressing in these stressful times with games or images of cats sitting in boxes. Simply sending a heart emoji to a family member or friend is a meaningful personal communication. People also use the apps for political activism. Influencers like Jalaiah Harmon, James Jones, and Addison Rae have hundreds to millions of followers on TikTok with all the fun, earnings, and political influence it can bring. "Favoriting" or "liking" a post can convey meaning. It can also be financially important to the platform and to the businesses that advertise their goods and services based on that expressive information.In about six weeks, the Trump administration will specify the "transactions" it wants explicitly to ban. The consequences could be far-reaching, impacting TikTok and WeChat users or app stores, Internet Service Providers, web hosting companies, or any of the other network services that are part of online communications.Still, people who use the platforms are worried that they will lose access to their services and may already stop posting on or engaging with them. And there is real cause for concern. Failing to comply with Trump's orders could violate IEEPA, which carries civil fines of up to $250,000 even if the violation is not intentional and criminal penalties if a violation is intentional. Subjecting people to penalties for exercising their freedoms of expression and association violates the Constitution.Privacy concerns are not the motivating factor behind the bans.The Trump bans refer to threats to privacy if the Chinese government gets its hands on Americans' private information. It is true that the Chinese government censors, suppresses dissent, and commits authoritarian, rights-violating abuses mostly against its own people. It is also true that TikTok and WeChat collect broad categories of their users' data and there are legitimate concerns about the sharing of that information with the Chinese government. But the administration has provided no specific and direct evidence of harm from TikTok and WeChat only vague speculation and assertions. There is no legitimate public basis for these extraordinary bans and in any event, sanctioning entire platforms significantly harms users' First Amendment rights.In fact, the data TikTok and WeChat collect does not appear substantially different from the kinds of data other foreign companies or American companies like Facebook or Google collect. And Trump has made no attempt to address privacy invasions caused by these companies operating in the United States. Nor has he supported surveillance reforms that would better protect the sensitive data of Americans and others against warrantless spying by U.S. intelligence agencies.If protecting the information of users in the United States were a true motivating factor, the U.S. government could, for example, support strong consumer privacy legislation that would limit the amount of data social media companies can collect in the first place. This, as the ACLU has long said, would reduce privacy threats from security breaches; discriminatory advertisements for jobs, housing, and credit; data brokers selling our information to target immigrants; and abusive demands by foreign governments.The government could also pass legislation or seek international agreements ensuring that data brokers or companies providing services to people in the United States can only hand over data, such as location history or web browsing logs, to any government including our own if there is a search warrant or a similar process involving independent oversight and a showing of just cause.The privacy harms from data collection by apps are real. But the solution isn't to capriciously ban two platforms. Bans that violate the First Amendment are the worst choice ineffective, unconstitutional, and harmful to the lives and interests of tens of millions of people.Load-Date: August 15, 2020End of Document

Nam Tai Urges Shareholders to Reject IsZo's Attempt to Replace Nam Tai's Board of Directors; Experienced Board and Management Team are Executing a Focused Strategy to Deliver Enhanced Value to ShareholdersPR NewswireAugust 5, 2020 Wednesday 8:30 AM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2821 wordsDateline: SHENZHEN, China, Aug. 5, 2020 BodyPR NewswireNam Tai Property Inc. ("Nam Tai" or the "Company") (NYSE Symbol: NTP) today responded to the letters published by IsZo Capital Management LP (together with its affiliates, "IsZo") on May 27, 2020 and July 20, 2020, with the following statement:The Company values constructive input from all of its shareholders, and is committed to acting in the best interest of all shareholders to enhance long-term value.The Company has engaged with IsZo since learning of its filing of a Schedule 13G disclosing its holdings in Nam Tai in February 2019, including through a project site visit in Shenzhen, a conference meeting via telephone, and an in-person meeting in New York, in May, June and December 2019, respectively. Despite the Company's attempts to maintain a constructive dialogue, IsZo has chosen to seek control of the Nam Tai Board and removal of a majority of the Directors re-elected by the Company's shareholders two months ago in June 2020. IsZo currently owns less than 10% of the Company's outstanding shares.The Company believes that IsZo's letters and actions demonstrate a significant misunderstanding of the Company's strategic plan and project value. Neither IsZo nor its nominees are equipped with the in-depth knowledge and extensive experience required to successfully operate large-scale industrial real estate and urban renewal projects in China. To date, IsZo has also not provided any credible plan to create further value.Nam Tai remains open to maintaining a constructive dialogue with IsZo, as it does with all shareholders, about Nam Tai's strategy to create sustainable, long-term value.The Board and Management Team are Executing a Clear and Differentiated Strategy to Enhance Shareholder ValueNam Tai's Board and management team are committed to driving value and shaping the Company into a leading industrial ecosystem operator and a respected enterprise with a clear development strategy, including: Unleash the values of existing projects. Promote corporate tenancy of Nam Tai Inno Park, Nam Tai - Tang Xi Technology Park as well as Nam Tai - U-Creative Space (Lujiazui), and improve cash flow; Accelerate the construction of Nam Tai Technology Center and consider application for pre-sale permit when related conditions are met; and Promote the application for urban renewal of Nam Tai Inno Valley.Improve product and service qualities. Deliver top-quality projects that will provide tenants with high-quality industrial space; Further improve industrial operation systems and cultivate the industrial operation team; and Improve the performance of business invitation through enhanced industrial operations and strengthen our image as a technology park operator.Prudently manage financing and control costs. Prioritize the financing support for the development and construction of existing projects; Maintain asset-liability ratio and liquidity at a healthy level; and Continuously evaluate and adjust the project budget to achieve effective and efficient cost control.Explore development opportunities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (the "Greater Bay Area"). Focus on the Greater Bay Area markets and continuously explore differentiated projects and development models; and Maximize returns for the Company and our shareholders through sustainable development strategies.To successfully implement the above development strategies, Nam Tai is taking steps to supplement its portfolio of existing projects with complementary high-quality land resources, strengthen its image in the Greater Bay Area and mitigate risks through project diversification.Proactively Invest in High-Quality Land ResourcesNam Tai employs a strategic development thesis to deepen its investment layout in the Greater Bay Area. Most recently, in its first step into the Dongguan commercial and residential market, the Company successfully won the bidding of a land parcel in Machong Town, Dongguan. Dongguan has been designated a leading advanced manufacturing hub in the region by the Chinese government while Machong is one of the fastest growing areas in Dongguan with the presence of a number of China's top 500 companies and strong local housing demand.The Company has carried out a comprehensive and rigorous assessment, conducted land surveys and surrounding market research in the local area before the land investment in Machong. Although the COVID-19 outbreak in Mainland China was ongoing when we participated in the public auction, we believe that it was a suitable investment opportunity, and the favorable property market policies introduced by the local government at that time were conducive to our bidding. After the successful bidding and settlement of the land payment, as of the end of June 2020, our current ratio and asset-liability ratio were maintained at a healthy level of 1.23 times and 57.5%, respectively. This reflects that this forward-looking investment, as we planned, did not compromise the Company's financial conditions.This strategic site will also help Nam Tai:Expand to Dongguan, a key growth potential city in the Greater Bay Area; Expand the Company's residential and commercial property portfolio; Create powerful synergies with other existing projects in the nearby Shenzhen; Form new relationship networks within the local communities; and Enhance brand awareness in Dongguan and Guangzhou.To successfully implement its differentiated growth strategies, Nam Tai is led by a dedicated management team with rich industry experience and deep insights.Actively Engaged, Professional Management TeamSince the appointment of Mr. Ying Chi Kwok as Chief Executive Officer in February 2018, Nam Tai has attracted and deployed experienced managers in the Chinese real estate industry, covering the areas of project management, construction management, procurement and cost control, financing, human resources, and more. This new management team consisting of China real estate experts has driven the transformation of the Company into a leading industrial real estate developer and operator in the Greater Bay Area. The new management team led by Mr. Kwok has made significant progress driving value for shareholders in the past two and a half years by:Significantly reducing project costs. The original development budget of Nam Tai Inno Park was approximately $312 million[1] as disclosed in 2017. After the new management team arrived and reviewed the cost in 2018, a series of new measures have been adopted. As of June 30, 2020, the estimated development budget of Nam Tai Inno Park has been significantly reduced to approximately $195 million[2]. This critical cost saving has better positioned the Company to create substantial shareholder value and propelled the development of the Company. Unleashing the values of industrial projects. Nam Tai Inno Park was an open space in 2017, and now it has been built into a high-quality large-scale technology park in Guangming District, Shenzhen. Even though it is still in the construction stage, as of June 30, 2020, the pre-leasing rate of Nam Tai Inno Park has reached 23%. The buildings on the site of Nam Tai Technology Center used to be an old factory building. Now Nam Tai is carrying out pile foundation construction and plans to build it into another integrated technology park. Creating value through urban renewal. Prior to the urban renewal, Nam Tai Technology Center was originally located on traditional industrial land, where buildings and units cannot be divided and sold individually. Leveraging their experience in urban renewal, the new management team successfully converted the land into innovative industrial land, enabling buildings and units on the land be divided and sold individually if relevant conditions are met, greatly enhancing the value of the project. In addition, Nam Tai is applying for the urban renewal of Nam Tai Inno Valley to replicate this successful model. Prioritizing financing support for the development and construction of existing projects. Prior to the arrival of the new management team, the construction financing of Nam Tai Inno Park and Nam Tai Technology Center had not been secured. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has successfully obtained credit lines totaling approximately $299 million[3] primarily for the construction of both projects, despite various difficulties due to the fact that industrial land is generally less preferred by banks and other creditors.The Board and the management are united to drive the development of the Company and provide strategic guidance for the Company's development for the best interests of all shareholders.Reputable and Well-Functioning Board of DirectorsNam Tai is strongly committed to integrity and good corporate governance, and the Company's Board of Directors is engaged in overseeing the Company's strategic direction and operational execution for the interests of all shareholders. The members of the Board are experts in their respective fields with excellent reputations.The Board is composed of members from North America and China, providing both strategic advice for the Chinese market and an international perspective, and possesses vast amounts of experience in the real estate industry. The Company values and benefits from the independence of its directors, with six of the seven members being independent and all three committees of the Board, including the Audit Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and the Compensation Committee, comprised entirely of independent directors. In 2019, the Board members had 100% attendance at all Board and committee meetings. The current directors were recently re-elected by our shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in June 2020, a reflection of our shareholders' trust and support for the current Board.Further details on our Board members – Mr. Ying Chi Kwok, Mr. Peter R. Kellogg, Dr. William Lo, Mr. Mark Waslen, Mr. Vincent Fok, Prof. Si Zong Wu and Dr. Aiping Lyu, – including their experience, expertise and background, as well as the Company's corporate governance provisions, are available on the Investor Relations page of the Company's website at:https://www.namtai.com/director/index.html.Strategic Relationship with Kaisa GroupKaisa Group ("Kaisa") is a large-scale comprehensive investment group in China, with competitive advantages in real estate development and urban renewal, among others. In 2019, Kaisa's attributable contracted sales amounted to RMB 88.1 billion, or approximately $12.6 billion[4], ranking 27th in China[5]. In the field of urban renewal, Kaisa is constantly regarded as one of the national leaders. As of December 31, 2019, Kaisa had 147 urban renewal projects covering a site area of nearly 40 million square meters, the majority of which in Guangzhou and Shenzhen[6].Kaisa is not only the largest shareholder of Nam Tai, but also a strategic investor that supports the long-term development of Nam Tai. The strategic relationship with Kaisa is a key asset to the Company. Nam Tai and Kaisa engage in regular business-level cooperation, such as property management agreements, which are beneficial to the Company's transformation from electronic production to real estate operation. The reputational and branding effect of having Kaisa as the Company's largest shareholder is also believed to be a critical contributor to Nam Tai's significant advantages on cost control, business operations, talent recruitment, and government and external affairs in China.In addition, Nam Tai clearly understands that our business must operate in the best interests of all shareholders, which is the guiding principle that the Board and the management always follow.Nam Tai is Taking Actions to Drive Shareholder ValueThe Board and the management, through their extensive experience in the Chinese market and real estate industry, are implementing differentiated strategies to promote business growth and create value for shareholders. The actions taken by IsZo risk derailing the progress the Company is making on executing its strategic objectives and delivering enhanced value to shareholders.Shareholders may need to consider whether it is necessary to convene a special meeting of shareholders to re-elect the board of directors at this critical moment; whether this action will have a negative impact on the execution of our strategy; whether your investment in the Company will be harmed as a result.The COVID-19 pandemic is still spreading around the world, including in China, and we have no way of knowing when the pandemic will end. However, we have done our utmost to ensure the health and safety of our tenants and employees and resume our operations. During the pandemic, we shall remain committed to our posts and continue to promote tenancy and construction.Nam Tai urges all shareholders to refrain from taking any action, including executing a written request for a special meeting at this time.Forward-looking Statement and Factors that Could Cause our Share Price to DeclineCertain statements included in this press release, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements.

TikTok Threatens to Sue after US Moves to Ban AppASEAN TribuneAugust 7, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 ASEAN Tribune All Rights ReservedLength: 499 wordsBody 7 August 2020 (VOA) TikTok reacted to President Donald Trump's executive order barring U.S. companies and individuals from doing business with its parent company, ByteDance, by threatening to take legal action and urging its U.S. users to lobby on its behalf.Trump ordered sweeping bans late Thursday prohibiting U.S. companies from doing business with ByteDance and Tencent, the owner of the messenger app WeChat. The executive orders targeting the Chinese companies go into effect in 45 days.'We are shocked by the recent Executive Order, which was issued without any due process,' ByteDance said in a statement released Friday.The company suggested that the executive order was illegal and that it might be challenged in court. "We will pursue all remedies available to us in order to ensure that the rule of law is not discarded and that our company and our users are treated fairly - if not by the Administration, then by the U.S. courts," the company said.In the meantime, Tencent responded by saying it was evaluating the situation. "The company is reviewing the potential consequences of the administrative order in order to fully understand its impact," Tencent said in a brief statement issued through Hong Kong Stock Exchange.In addition to its hugely popular messaging feature, WeChat also links to finance and other services. It claims that the app has more than 1 billion users.The Trump administration and U.S. lawmakers have expressed concerns that the Chinese social media services could provide American users' personal information to the Chinese government. Both companies have said they do not share their data with the Chinese government.The twin executive orders Thursday added new contention to growing U.S.-Chinese conflict over technology and security. The Chinese foreign ministry accused Washington of 'political suppression' and said the moves would hurt American companies and consumers.'The United States is using national security as an excuse, frequently abuses national power and unreasonably suppresses companies of other countries,' Wang Wenbin, a ministry spokesman, said.Wang, who did not mention TikTok or Tencent by name, said China strongly opposed the move but gave no indication of how Beijing might retaliate.The Trump administration has previously threatened to shut TikTok down if it remains under the ownership of Beijing-based ByteDance.According to a memo sent Monday by Chief Executive Officer Zhang Yiming, ByteDance is exploring all possibilities to ensure that its subsidiary can continue operating in the United States. Without naming Microsoft directly, the company said Friday, "We even stated that we could sell our U.S. business to a U.S. company."The statement ended by calling on its 100 million U.S. users to put pressure on the Trump administration."As TikTok users, creators, partners and family members, you have the right to express your opinions to all levels of lawmakers, including the White House government," the statement said.Load-Date: August 10, 2020End of Document

TikTok would be a 'dangerous dance' move for MicrosoftCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 14, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1217 wordsBodyFor the most part of a decade, Microsoft has stayed largely away from the types of products and services that cause controversy, is, after all, a company whose boldest foray into social media is LinkedIn's neat idea. A deal to buy the TikTok video streaming app, an idea that President Trump is driving, would change all that, leading Microsoft into the kind of mine-traded political field he has managed to avoid in recent years. "Microsoft has remained happily out of techlash so far," says Ashkhen Kazaryan, director of civil liberties at TechFreedom, a libertarian think tank in Washington. "If they get TikTok, that's going to change."Four days after the bosses of Amazon.com, Apple, Facebook and Google were criticized as "cyber-barons" at Congress hearings-Microsoft's interrogation was saved-the company said it was in talks to buy TikTok. Like other social media companies, TikTok faces criticism that it has not done enough to combat harassment and hate speech. A purchase would be a major change for Microsoft, potentially exposing it to the kinds of concerns that caused problems for its rivals with lawmakers: privacy, misinformation, political debate, and child protection. "Any company that voluntarily enlists in content moderation wars becomes an insatiable person of punishment," says Nu Wexler, an independent communications consultant who has worked at Twitter, Facebook and Google training executives on how to deal with Congress.TikTok initially became a hit with teenagers posting absurd videos, typically it was only a few seconds of themselves singing, dancing and doing 'something silly', often challenging friends to respond with similar clips. As people around the world were looking for ways to alleviate the weariness of this spring and summer's blockade, TikTok was inflated with a large torrent of content.That growth has brought scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers who say ByteDance, the service's owner, could be collecting US data on behalf of the Chinese government. This spring, Trump became involved, saying he wanted to restrict TikTok for security reasons and punish China for its handling of the coronavirus. On August 6, Trump intensified his dispute with China, signing a couple of executive orders banning Americans from doing business with TikTok and the WeChat courier service starting in mid-September. For TikTok, at least, there is a potential outlet through a Microsoft agreement. ByteDance has repeatedly denied accusations that it shares data with the Chinese government. But after it became clear that Trump wasn't going to back down, the company indicated that it might be open to selling some of its video service.A purchase would lead Microsoft to deceptive territory, as many users are children, sometimes dressing or dancing provocatively or exchanging messages with adults without parental consent. And mixed with all the ridiculous are the clips that promotedangerous COVID-19 conspiracy theories, angry nationalists about undocumented immigrants, or white supremacists calling for the killings of Jews and blacks.In the second half of 2019, TikTok deleted nearly 50 million videos that he deemed inappropriate, more than three times the number YouTube deleted in the same period.Last year, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission fined TikTok $5.7 million after determining that all personal information that collected the children's application violated U.S. privacy laws. And now it's the subject of a new investigation by the FTC and the US Department of Justice on accusations that didn't cleanse their act, according to privacy advocates who say they've been interviewed by agencies.One of those people, Josh Golin, executive director of the Commercial Free Childhood Campaign, points out that Microsoft has taken care of it since before child safety, especially for services on its Xbox gaming consoles. And the company in 2009 developed PhotoDNA, a web scanner that hunts photos and videos of child sexual abuse.But the trust and security issues in TikTok go far beyond what Microsoft has faced in the past, Golin says. "It's easier to get rid of those things from the beginning," he says. "When you inherit a place where those practices are already so ingrained, it's much harder."With $137 billion in the bank, Microsoft can easily afford a cash settlement, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. But he's wary of overpaying, especially since Trump's pressure makes TikTok seem like a struggling asset. At the same time, Microsoft will want to avoid falling so low that China feels ripped off, according to a person familiar with the issue it asked not to be named discussing internal deliberations.Microsoft has a delicate relationship with China: although some of its products have been banned and the continent accounts for less than 2 percent of the company's revenue, the government has allowed joint ventures that sell the Xbox console and cloud services. Microsoft operates censored versions of LinkedIn and Bing's search engine, and since the 1990s has had a research lab in Beijing, which now has more than 200 scientists. Critics, including White House trade adviser Peter Navarro say all of that is evidence that Microsoft is soft on China.Under discussion is an agreement in which Microsoft would own TikTok in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand and ByteDance would take the rest, which would create a number of concerns about technology transfer and branding, depending on the person familiar with the company's thinking. Closing the gap between two owners would make content moderation a big headache, as the two parties could have very different opinions than should be allowed or banned, the person says.There are already several versions of TikTok for multiple regions, often using Musical.ly code, a ByteDance application purchased in 2017. With ByteDance engineers in China still working on TikTok, it's unclear how Microsoft could split the underlying code and technology to make sure it's free of Chinese interference.Since Satya Nadella became Microsoft's CEO in 2014, the shares have quintupled and the company has returned to the ranks of major technology powers. But while Nadella's strategy has been cost-effective, it has focused on relatively boring things, such as business apps and cloud computing, and in addition to Xbox, there's little in the way of the consumer business.Some previous attempts to go beyond heavy corporate applications-Nokia and Skype come to mind—they have been disasters without mitigation, leaving the impression that the company lacks the guts to succeed with consumers. TikTok could change that narrative, prompting executives to start exploring a purchase about a month ago, according to a person familiar with the situation.Nadella has overseen three major acquisitions: the computer game Minecraft, LinkedIn and GitHub, a collaboration platform for software developers. Each of them brought in large groups that Microsoft understood: players, white-collar workers, and coders, says S. Somasegar, a venture capitalist who worked at Microsoft for 27 years.The teens and young adults who make up most TikTok users are a less obvious setting, although Somasegar says an agreement could work. "Is it a risk? Absolutely," he says. "But if you don't take risks, you become a mediocre company."Load-Date: August 15, 2020End of Document

WeChat ban sends shockwaves through global tech stocksCNN WireAugust 7, 2020 Friday 4:18 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 648 wordsDateline: LONDON (CNN Business) BodyLONDON (CNN Business) --  President Donald Trump's decision to ban TikTok and WeChat rattled shares from Hong Kong to Tokyo, Amsterdam and Johannesburg on Friday in a cautionary sign that Washington's crackdown on Chinese companies could have far-reaching consequences for global tech investors.The reckoning was immediate for WeChat parent, Tencent. The company's stock plunged as much as 10% in Hong Kong on Friday, closing 5% lower. A Tencent spokesperson told CNN Business that the firm is "reviewing the executive order to get a full understanding."Tencent's tumble wiped 6% off shares in Prosus, the technology arm of South African media group Naspers. Prosus, which is listed in Amsterdam, owns a 31% stake in the Chinese internet giant. The stock later recovered some of its earlier losses, but the drop wiped more than 4% off Naspers in Johannesburg.Trump's decision to extend a threatened ban on TikTok to WeChat raises questions as to whether other Chinese tech companies, such as e-commerce giant Alibaba, could be in the firing line.The orders would ban WeChat and TikTok from operating in the United States in 45 days if they are not sold by their Chinese parent companies ---Tencent and Beijing-based ByteDance respectively. Paul Triolo, head of geotechnology at Eurasia Group, described the move as an "unprecedented intervention by the US government in the consumer technology sector."Trump claims the apps pose a national security threat and his order outlines fears that the Chinese government could use them to collect personal information on US citizens, such as location data and browsing histories, which could be used for "blackmail and corporate espionage."If the US government is worried about data privacy, its next target could be Alibaba. The e-commerce platform opened to US sellers last July and the country is its fastest growing market. It has 10 million customers buying merchandise from its platform worldwide, including in the United States, and sold $1 trillion worth of goods over the 12 months through March, mostly in China. Alibaba's biggest shareholder is SoftBank, which holds more than 25% of the company. SoftBank's Vision Fund also owns a minority stake in ByteDance. SoftBank's shares slipped in Tokyo and have lost more than 3% this week. Other major investors in Alibaba and Tencent include big US funds such as Vanguard, BlackRock and T.Rowe Price, according to Refinitiv.Alibaba's stock lost 3% in Hong Kong on Friday, signaling that investors were weighing the risks of Trump's sweeping clampdown on Chinese internet companies. Alibaba's cloud services, which US businesses use to host their online operations, are most immediately at risk after the Trump administration unveiled its "Clean Network" program earlier this week. The program is an effort to protect America's telecom and technology infrastructure from "aggressive intrusions by malign actors, such as the Chinese Communist Party," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.The measures apply to telecommunications networks, app developers, cable makers, and cloud services providers, and specifically target Alibaba, Tencent and Huawei.The program will seek to "prevent US citizens' most sensitive personal information and our businesses' most valuable intellectual property, including Covid-19 vaccine research, from being stored and processed on cloud-based systems accessible to our foreign adversaries through companies such as Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent," Pompeo said.China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday said it "firmly opposes" the bans on WeChat and TikTok. Ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, said during a daily press briefing that the United States is using state power "to oppress non-American businesses."--- Sherisse Pham and Julia Horowitz contributed reporting.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Does Trump hate TikTok?CE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 3, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 702 wordsBodyThe Trump administration will shortly announce action against 'a wide range' of software owned by Chinese firms that are considered risks to national security, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said.Comments suggest a possible extension of U.S. measures beyond TikTok, the popular music video app owned by ByteDance, one of China's largest technology companies.President Donald Trump told reporters Friday that he plans to ban TikTok in the United States, but his decision has not been announced. Pompeo noted that he is expecting a Trump announcement 'shortly'. Chinese newspapers criticized a possible ban on TikTok.Trump's decision has implications for Microsoft, which explores an acquisition of the ByteDance app.Microsoft confirmed Sunday that it is in talks to buy TikTok's operations in the United States and other countries after a talk between Ceo Satya Nadella and Donald Trump.The talks will move quickly "in a matter of weeks" and are expected to be completed by September 15, he said in a statement. The company will continue to involve Trump and the government.'If the company and data can be bought and insured by a reliable U.S. company, it would be a positive and acceptable outcome,' Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said on Twitter. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a confidant of Trump, tweeted that he understands the concerns of TikTok users and that if Microsoft took control would be a 'win-win'.Senators John Cornyn of Texas and Roger Wicker of Mississippi made similar comments, though Wicker also urged 'strict security measures' to protect consumer data.Chinese software companies doing business in the United States are sending data directly to the Chinese authorities, 'either TikTok or WeChat; and there are countless more,' Pompeo said on The Fox News Channel.Trump 'will take action in the coming days with a wide range of national security risks presenting the software connected to the Chinese Communist Party,' he added.The president can 'force a sale' of TikTok or block the application by executive order, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on ABC, adding that he will not discuss details about his conversations with the president on the issue.SupportMnuchin, who heads the Foreign Investment Committee in the United States, said that 'the entire committee agrees that TikTok cannot remain in the current format because it risks sending information about 100 million Americans.'That view that 'change has to be' is shared by lawmakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, Mnuchin said.'We're approaching a solution and I thinkwho will soon see the president's announcement,' Pompeo said.TikTok has become one of the most popular apps in the world. It has been downloaded more than 2 billion times worldwide and more than 165 million times in the United States.ByteDance is ready to sell 100 percent of TikTok's operations in the United States as a way to avoid a Trump ban, two people with knowledge of the situation said.The app has hired nearly 1,000 people in the U.S. this year and will employ another 10,000 in 'well-paid work', according to a company spokesperson in a statement.The company's billion-dollar creators' fund also supports people in the country who are building livelihoods from the platform, he added.'TikTok USA user data is stored in the United States with strict controls on employee access,' he said. 'TikTok's biggest investors come from the United States. We are committed to protecting the privacy and security of our users.'Chinese state media defended TikTok, characterizing the Trump administration's attack on the company in a similar way to the attitude toward Chinese global network giant Huawei.The China Daily wrote in an editorial on Sunday that 'although the Oval Office claims to oppose authoritarianism, it is inclined to arbitrarily demonstrate its own authority.'And an editorial in the Global Times, one of China's most combative state newspapers, said that 'the United States' claim that TikTok threatens its own national security is a purely hypothetical and unjustified accusation, as is the unfounded accusation that Huawei brings intelligence together for the Chinese government.Load-Date: August 4, 2020End of Document

Twitter enters bid for TikTok, the app to which Donald Trump declared warCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 9, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 565 wordsBodyTwitter joins the treats for purchasing the Tik Tok app, after US President Donald Trump declared it a threat to national security by forcing the owner company ByteDance to sell it.The Chinese company, which has a 45-day deadline to complete a transaction, was already in negotiations with US giant Microsoft.However, the San Francisco society already had preliminary meetings with its Chinese peer, according to the Wall Street Journal.Microsoft, on the other hand, is already in an advanced phase of negotiations and has a better chance seen that Twitter is a much smaller company and would have more difficulty paying.Although the valuation of TikTok's U.S. operations is not entirely clear, analysts estimate it at tens of billions of dollars, so It is believed that Twitter – with a market capitalization of about $29 billion – would need investor support to carry out the merger.The figures that were handled around a possible agreement with Microsoft range from $10 billion to $30 billion.While the microblogging network already had a failed experience with Vine, a short video app that achieved some popularity but did not succeed, and was closed in 2016.Losses for the U.S.The Cold War tech, as several media outlets have dubbed the Trump administration's outpost against Chinese apps it denounces for pro-Communist espionage, has generated various views.One of them, cited by the Chinese Xinhua news agency, is that of Wei Shangjin, professor of finance and economics at the Faculty of Postgraduate Business Studies and The Columbia University School of Public and International Affairs.The professor said forcing TikTok to be sold cheaply to a "very American" buyer will endanger many U.S. companies in the Chinese market, according to an opinion piece published Thursday by Project Syndicate."If China were to mimic Trump's tactics, claiming, without providing evidence, that some U.S. multinationals are potential threats to national security, it could force them to sell their operations to 'very Chinese' buyers. Although the Chinese government has not yet done this, the risk (of it occurring) has become higher," said Wei, who served as chief economist for the Asian Development Bank during 2014-2016.Trump issued an executive order on Thursday banning any U.S. transactions with Chinese technology company ByteDance, which owns TikTok, starting 45 days from the same Thursday.In addition, the Senate passed a bill banning that app on government phones, and Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, launched the "clean network" initiative that seeks to ban the use of more Chinese apps on Americans' cell phones.TikTok has trained more than 175 million downloads in the United States and more than 1 billion worldwide, according to the executive order, which states that the app automatically captures "vast swaths of information" from its users, which poses risks to U.S. national security.A similar executive order was also issued for WeChat, a messaging app and social network owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent.While Trump's actions could generate a short-term gain for the United States, they have introduced serious potential risks to U.S. interests, not to mention international and domestic trade rules, Wei said."After all, what would happen to business confidence if governments assumed they could extort companiesprivate at will?" added Wei.Source: ANSA and XinhuaPJBLoad-Date: August 10, 2020End of Document

Wealthy investors stay in Hong Kong... For nowCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 12, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 540 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- They have planned exit routes, opened bank accounts in other countries, and secured foreign passports.But, at least for now, most of Hong Kong's high net worth investors stay in the city, alleviating the fear of the city's new national security law causing a wave of capital outflows.Withdrawals have been minimal since the law came into force on June 30, in part because wealthy investors are still assessing how the Chinese government's stronger control of Hong Kong will affect asset prices and the long-term business environment, according to executives from four Asian wealth managers, who called for their identity not to be disclosed because of private information.Detractors of the legislation have argued that it will undermine Hong Kong's role as a financial center, but some wealthy investors are open to an alternative narrative -- supported by the Hong Kong government and the city's wealthiest tycoons -- that the law will help stabilize an economy hit by months of pro-democracy protests. That view has been reinforced by signs of tacit support from Beijing, such as record purchases of Hong Kong stocks by Chinese funds and a series of high-profile IPO outlets by the nation's tech giants."They are likely to be opening up offshore accounts and considering leaving, but the preparations will not lead to a major exodus of capital," said Kenny Wen, Hong Kong's Hong Kong strata Sun Hung Kai Co. "Money is moving towards Hong Kong at the same time because investors are optimistic about the Hong Kong stock market , especially with the new quotes."It is not known whether these optimistic prospects will endure, especially with Hong Kong caught in the crossfire of an increasingly intense confrontation between China and the United States. But the result since June has been a strong Hong Kong currency, a resilient real estate market and stable stock prices. Capital inflows have been so significant in recent weeks that authorities intervened to prevent the local currency from exceeding the strong end of their trading band, far away from the apocalyptic scenario anticipated by Hong Kong bassists like Kyle Bass.Many wealthy investors who have kept their money in the city have cited expectations that the Chinese government will act to shore up Hong Kong's markets, wealth managers said.Bahren Shaari, bank of Singapore's chief executive, said most are "taking a wait-to-see approach.""They have taken steps to make sure they have positioned themselves if the event is worse than expected or better than expected," Shaari said in an interview on Bloomberg Television on Wednesday.The city's equity inflows through the continental's market links increased more than 100 percent from the previous year to US$16.6 billion since early June, fueling speculation that Chinese government funds are buying."We can expect more business opportunities and greater growth margin for Hong Kong's financial industry," said Eddie Yue, executive director of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority last month. "As we all know, a safe and stable social environment is what every investor is looking for and what he's comfortable with."Original Note:Wealthy Hong Kong Investors Stay Put With Crisis Plans Ready (1)©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: August 13, 2020End of Document

Microsoft wants to buy TikTok, which could save the app from the US vetoCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 3, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 552 wordsBodyMicrosoft has confirmed its intention to purchase the TikTok music microvideo platform in the United States after its CEO, Satya Nadella, had a conversation with US President Donald Trump, who had announced its intention to ban Chinese app in the country."Microsoft is ready to continue discussions to explore the purchase of TikTok in the United States,"the company has informed through a statement disseminated through its 'blog'.The Redmond giant will engage in talks with ByteDance, the company that owns TikTok, "quickly" with the aim of completing the negotiations "within weeks". On the possible date, it has progressed that discussions may be complete "by September 15". During the process, Microsoft has assured that it "hopes to continue its dialogue with the U.S. government, including with the president."Discussions with ByteDance will be based on a notification to the U.S. Foreign Investment Committee. In the statement, the company states that both have notified their intention to explore a preliminary proposal that would involve the purchase of TikTok not only in the United States, but also in Canada, Australia and New Zealand.The new structure "would be based on the experience that TikTok users currently love, while adding security, privacy and digital security protections." Thus, "the operating model for the service would be built to ensure transparency to users, as well as adequate security oversight by the governments of these countries," according to the text."Among other measures, Microsoft would ensure that all private data of U.S. users is transferred and remain in the United States,"he added, while ensuring that data currently stored outside the U.S. country will be deleted after being transferred.In this regard, Microsoft has attached importance to "addressing Trump's concerns" and has pledged to acquire TikTok after "a comprehensive security review" and to provide "the right economic benefits to the United States, including the Treasury.""Microsoft appreciates the personal involvement of Trump and the U.S. government as it continues to develop strong security protections for the country,"he has said.Finally, the company has emphasized that, so far, discussions are in a "preliminary" phase. Thus, you have specified that you "have no intention" to "provide more updates until the discussions do not have a final result".U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed on Sunday that Trump is finalizing preparations to make a decision on restricting the use of the app on suspicion that he would be sending information from his users to the Chinese government.The president already announced Friday that he would ban TikTok using emergency economic powers or an executive order, although he did not provide further details on it.Critics of the app were wary of whether the data TikTok could collect from US users could end up in the hands of the Chinese government, even though the company has assured it stores its data outside China and would resist any attempt by Beijing to seize the information.For their part, cybersecurity experts have pointed out that the potential risk to national securityrepresents the application is, above all, theoretical and that there is no evidence to suggest that the data of TikTok users may be compromised by China Intelligence.Load-Date: August 4, 2020End of Document

First Solar Issues Public Comment on DOE NoticeTargeted News ServiceAugust 26, 2020 Wednesday GENERAL_EDIT_CORRECTION ERROR Document ID 8 Has error Validate old format failed - Input Date Invalid - 00:31: Unparseable date: "00:31" ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4805 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON, Aug. 26 -- Julie Myerholtz, chief information security officer of First Solar Inc., Toledo, Ohio, has issued a public comment on the Department of Energy notice entitled "Securing the United States Bulk-Power System". The comment was written on Aug. 24, 2020, and posted on Aug. 25, 2020:* * *IntroductionFounded in Ohio in 1999, and headquartered in Arizona, First Solar is America's largest solar manufacturer. It is also the only Solar Module Super League manufacturer to innovate and design its products in the United States (U.S.). First Solar has spent over one billion dollars in research and development across the last decade, and consistently sets a global benchmark for quality and reliability. PVEL, which is the leading independent lab tracking the downstream solar industry, recently recognized First Solar in its PV Module Reliability Scorecard as a Top Performer in every test completed.With over 25 gigawatts of thin-film photovoltaic (PV) modules shipped globally and a culmination of two decades of experience and expertise across the entire utility-scale solar power plant value chain, First Solar has independently weathered storms that have claimed other solar manufacturers while doubling down on its commitment to invest in the U.S. First Solar is a standout leader in an industry otherwise dominated by manufacturers based in China, with over 2,500 jobs in the U.S., including in our Ohio-based manufacturing facilities.Grid security plays an increasingly critical role in economic growth and in the overall security of America's Bulk Power System (BPS). We believe the potential for technological manipulation of energy supply at the power generation level presents a real risk. Any component connected to our nation's grid must be secure and sourced from trusted suppliers that are not affiliated with, controlled by, or manufactured in any adversarial country. Our BPS security is only as strong as the weakest link, and given our extensive experience throughout the utility-scale PV industry, it is First Solar's viewpoint that modules can be controlled remotely. In safeguarding America's electric grid, the U.S. has the opportunity to examine each link in order to protect our energy independence and defend against hidden attacks.For this reason we recommend that the Department restrict the importation of PV modules produced by any company owned, influenced, or controlled by a foreign adversary. Given American leadership in the renewable energy industry, we can improve security while also nurturing domestic innovation and manufacturing.Our comments below address issues related to this RFI and EO 13920 as they relate to solar PV modules. Specifically, we discuss:1. Recent Findings Support the Need for EO 139202. Understanding the PV Module-Level, System-Level, and BPS Risk3. Potential Methods for Using PV Modules to De-stabilize the BPS4. All PV Manufacturers Should Comply with U.S. Standards5. Responses to RFI Questions6. Preparing the BPS for Known UnknownsRecent Findings Support the Need for EO 13920As we will discuss below, there is a historical record of threats to the BPS from equipment compromised by foreign ownership, control or influence from adversarial nations, which remain to be remediated. The risks posed by these threats is current, serious, and well established. On August 6th the President's Working Group on Financial Markets released a report recommending that for 'Non-Cooperating Jurisdictions' such as China, "the Securities and Exchange Commission take steps to enhance the listing standards on U.S. exchanges for access to audit work papers, among other recommendations."/1First Solar believes that entities providing equipment to the BPS should be subject to comparable standards to protect the integrity of the BPS to ensure that adversarial nations do not have the opportunity to undermine America's energy security BPS.To characterize the financial and reliability risks to the BPS associated with using unregulated and compromised equipment, researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology recently examined how high-wattage botnets would impact market functionality. Their research indicated that such tactics could create up to $350 million in economic damage to wholesale power markets in New York and California alone./2Financial manipulation of energy markets played a major role in the California Energy Crisis of 2000 and 2001, ultimately leading to long term blackouts throughout much of the state.Our comments seek to highlight potential risks arising from the supply of PV modules manufactured by companies controlled by foreign, ownership, control or influence (FOCI) of adversarial nations. Presently, more than 75% of modules entering the U.S. are imported either directly from China, or imported by companies subject to China's ownership, control, or influence. The Energy Information Administration's Annual Energy Outlook forecasts that within the next 10 years, utility scale solar PV facilities will provide 13% of the generating capacity for the electric power sector./3PV capacity in the U.S. has grown exponentially over the past decade and is projected to continue this rapid growth. The increasing use of smart communications devices within PV modules and the ability to control PV modules through remote communications as detailed in our comments below highlights a need to include PV modules within the scope of this Executive Order.Understanding the PV Module-Level, System-Level, and BPS RiskFirst Solar's leadership as an equipment provider and developer, builder and operator of solar projects currently providing electricity to the U.S. BPS has allowed us to see firsthand the risks that can arise from poor security. Our responses to the Request For Information (RFI) focus on our role as the leading U.S.-based PV module manufacturer and as an equipment vendor for power generation systems connected to the BPS. With more than 10 years of experience throughout all aspects of utility-scale solar development, construction, and operation, First Solar has unique perspective on the risks to the BPS from the unregulated deployment of potentially compromised PV modules. Such risks can be addressed with the right protocols. We strongly encourage the Department to take the following risks into account as EO 13920 is implemented.The most obvious risk to the BPS is manipulation of communications and control devices at utility-scale PV installations. As we will detail further below, First Solar is aware of the use of compromised communications and control infrastructure to overwhelm a third party's solar installation in the U.S. This action prevented the ability to control power at the site. There is a growing trend to install sophisticated communications at Bulk Power generation systems to allow for remote monitoring. For example, Dubai recently announced a partnership with a Chinese-based Engineering, Construction, and Procurement (EPC) partner for a 900 MW facility that would be operated remotely./4The remote operation will apparently be facilitated by the use of "smart PV inverters" that are able to monitor PV systems at the string level. Equipment with this type of remote operation capability can be easily manipulated to affect operation of a solar plant and thereby impact the BPS. Remote operation of Bulk Power solar generation facilities will likely become the norm in the U.S. as they represent cost savings for the owners and operators of the facilities.In addition to these well-known inverter-related risks, it is now possible for modules to be manufactured with microchips or microcontrollers that have a very small form factor (ex. 6x6mm) and can be embedded into the module's junction-box and are increasingly being used to meet the National Electric Code (NEC) 2017 standard on module level rapid shutdown. These tiny devices can leverage power generated by the module itself, while communicating out in various manners. These microchips and/or microcontrollers can be wired into the electronics of a solar module, relying on the solar module to provide power to the controller. Programming of the microcontroller can be done through a program like bootloader/5 that accepts code from a computer into the memory of the microcontroller. Given the ability to wire in the microcontroller to the module and to program the microcontroller, it is possible to manipulate operation of the plant from afar, potentially making the individual PV module a Cyber Asset, as explained below./6With the ability to manage and program the microcontroller, the solar module can also communicate data out from the plant and allow for remote control. Such communication can be accomplished through various mechanisms, including/7 from radio frequency (long range), cellular, Bluetooth, and potentially satellite. A brief review of current models being marketed that contain communications and/or control devices installed on the module reveals that at least 10 models from Chinese owned manufacturers have this capability./8These models are marketed presently for distributed energy applications, however the flexibility of PV modules is such that modules typically used for rooftop applications can also be deployed on utility-scale PV system interconnected to the BPS. Physical form factors and/or electrical wiring do not materially distinguish deployment modes for PV modules and therefore products targeting the distributed market are easily deployed in large-scale applications impacting the BPS. As imported modules can be used in a wide variety of applications that are not pre-defined in the customs process, it will be impossible to manage risks presented by modules with communication capability or even effectively monitor their importation via CBP as they look identical to a traditional PV module. We recommend that the Department restrict access to U.S. markets for any modules manufactured by entities subject to FOCI of foreign adversaries as they may contain micro-inverters, rapid shutdown devices (RSDs) or other communications or control devices that can compromise the integrity of the BPS.Our comments focus specifically on the potential risks arising from PV modules manufactured by companies owned, controlled or influenced by, adversarial nations. As discussed above, real risks arise from PV modules that can be manipulated from remote locations in a manner that would impact the BPS. Specifically, modules with communication or control technology present the possibility of a planned and coordinated attack that could compromise the stability of the BPS. It is important to note at the outset that, in addition to not being subject to FOCI from foreign adversaries, First Solar's manufacturing process globally does not use any electronics components manufactured by adversarial nations. In other words, First Solar modules mitigate security risks because they do not contain communication components at all, nor any electronics components sourced from companies under the control of adversarial nations.There is growing concern that PV modules will become subject to potential compromise by the use of a variety of communications devices that are increasingly installed directly on the module itself.As explained above, the most common occurrence today is the use of micro-inverters or rapid shutdown devices (RSDs) installed on the module that could allow a foreign adversary to remotely control individual modules, harmonize individual modules for amplified group impact and/or ultimately an entire an entire PV power plant. A growing segment of the PV market includes so-called "smart modules" with communications devices installed on the module that allow for control of the device remotely. Lastly, the possibility exists that modules imported from manufacturers subject to foreign ownership, control, or influence may include undetected electronics or communication devices that could be used for a similar purpose.Generally speaking there are 5 primary wireless communication methods that can be employed in PV modules. All of these methods pose a real risk that remote control and disruption of a PV system can surreptitiously be exercised:/9* Radio Frequency: Provides long range Sub-Ghz frequency to communicate from the receiver (Module) to the transceiver (remote). Range of signal could be upwards of 20 miles, relying on radio towers to transmit the signal to the panels.* Cellular Networks: method of increasing the number of simultaneous radio conversations that can be supported by a fixed number of radio frequency (RF) channels by limiting the range of transmitters to a single cell, to which a proportion of the available channels is allocated. NOTE: Chinese manufacturing plays a major role in wireless cellular communication./10* Wireless IP: Module is turned into a smart module by placing a micro-chip that broadcasts through wireless IP. IP communication can be compromised in many ways./11* ZigBee:/12 Low cost and low power wireless mesh solution that would allow for multiple modules to communicate with each other. This type of technology is present in many PV Tracker Plants.* Satellite: Satellite communication can be used to communicate to devices in the field. This type of communication can be levered to communicate to remote microcontrollers for transmission of data./13Given recent actions regarding security of 5G networks using equipment provided by manufacturers from adversarial nations, 5G communications capabilities provide a useful example of how these risks can be managed. Recognizing the risk from foreign adversaries, the Federal Communications Commission officially designated Huawei as a threat to U.S. communications networks as a result of its close ties to the Chinese government and military services./14Similarly, the United Kingdom moved in July to ban Huawei equipment from use in their 5G networks, citing both national security and economic concerns./155G is the next generation of wireless networks, building upon existing 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) infrastructure and improving the bandwidth, capacity, and reliability of wireless broadband services. 5G is intended to meet increasing data and communication requirements, including capacity for tens of billions of connected devices that will make up the Internet of Things (IoT), ultra-low latency required for critical near-real time communications, and faster speeds to support emerging technologies. 5G is expected to bring security improvements and a better user experience, but supply chain, deployment, network security, and competition and choice vulnerabilities may affect the security and resilience of 5G networks.As 5G is being built out, Chinese vendors have played a major role in providing the components of 5G Networking. This includes components of the core network infrastructure (network switches), Radio access network (Radio units), and end user equipment (mobiles phones, IOT devices). With Chinese vendors like Huawei, Xiaomi, ZTE, and OPPO are in the top five providers of such components, the following risks become amplified:1. Supply Chain: Supply Chain is susceptible to malicious or inadvertent introduction of vulnerabilities.2. Deployment: The attack surface for malicious actors has increased, due to the use of more information and communication components.3. Network Security: 5G builds upon previous generations of wireless networks, such as 4G LTE. With this legacy vulnerabilities may affect 5G equipment and networks.4. Loss of Competition: Proprietary interfaces are built by companies into their technologies. If customers are locked into a service provider or technology, they may be forced to continue with an untrusted technology or replace existing equipment.NERC CIP Low Impact provides that any site over 75MW falls under CIP Low Impact standards, which require certain cybersecurity controls to be implemented. This threshold was set in place to provide protection to the BPS. As entities are assessing their PV plants to see if they meet the threshold, they are also having to identify the site Bulk Electric System (BES) Cyber Assets.BES Cyber Asset Definition:"A Cyber Asset that if rendered unavailable, degraded, or misused would, within 15 minutes of its required operation, misoperation, or non-operation, adversely impact one or more Facilities, systems, or equipment, which, if destroyed, degraded, or otherwise rendered unavailable when needed, would affect the reliable operation of the Bulk Electric System. Redundancy of affected Facilities, systems, and equipment shall not be considered when determining adverse impact. Each BES Cyber Asset is included in one or more BES Cyber Systems."/16If a module has a micro-device installed on it, making it programmable, it in turn is considered a Cyber Asset. Given the risk that modules in a PV plant could be taken down or degraded collectively, the modules would also necessarily be defined as a BES Cyber Asset.Potential Methods for using PV Modules to De-stabilize and Installation on the BPSAs modules are being developed, they increasingly are being built with microcontrollers wired into the module. The module so configured has the ability to provide the necessary power from the solar module, while also establishing and maintaining communication to a remote transceiver. Modules equipped with communication devices can be connected together in the form of a botnet that would allow for control over all modules, which in turn would make them IOT devices. With the ability to connect to all modules at the same time, an adversarial actor could shut down the plant, or disable or overwork the modules to cause a system overload.As modules have transformed into IOT devices, they are more at risk of being subject to a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that overloads the modules, with the resulting potential to take the modules offline. With communications and/or control established to the modules, an adversarial actor could also increase power to the point where equipment and personnel safety is a concern. As discussed above, First Solar is aware of such a DDoS overload event at the inverter level for a third party's PV Plant. The DDoS attack affected a field inverter, which in turn lost communication to the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. This resulted in loss of control over the inverter, which had the potential to become a safety event and to jeopardize the ability of the plant to produce and regulate power. Depending on the size of a site and its location within the BPS transmission topology, the impact of such an event could reach beyond the plant and adversely affect the BPS. This is the equivalent of losing control over a car's gas pedal on a busy major highway. The impact to traffic from the loss of control of a single car may be difficult to predict but severe consequences are certainly foreseeable.PV systems often communicate to utilities, aggregators, and other grid operators over the public internet; consequently the power system attack surface has become significantly expanded. At the same time, solar energy systems are equipped with a range of grid-support functions that, if controlled or programmed improperly, present a risk of power system disturbances.1. Systems are typically configured with default credentials that are never changed.2. Typical OT-ICS systems are not patched and are volatile when scanned with vulnerability scanners.3. Typical OT or ICS systems are built with minimal hardening applied. This includes lack of security controls, protections and monitoring in place.The most vulnerable installations are those that are connected to communications systems that are not locked down. One of the more recognizable electric system compromises to date occurred in the Ukraine in 2015./17While they were considered secure in design and implementation, gaps existed within their defense-in-depth strategy. Had those gaps not existed, system operators may have been alerted earlier that malicious individuals were taking action to undermine the system. As noted by investigators of the event:"The power wasn't out long in Ukraine: just one to six hours for all the areas hit. But more than two months after the attack, the control centers are still not fully operational, according to a recent US report. Ukrainian and US computer security experts involved in the investigation say the attackers overwrote firmware on critical devices at 16 of the substations, leaving them unresponsive to any remote commands from operators. The power is on, but workers still have to control the breakers manually."Ukraine's experience points towards the need to proactively address protocols for all devices with communications capability that may feed into the Bulk Power System, including PV modules.National Electric Code (NEC) 2017 requires "Rapid Shutdown" of PV modules./18This code modification is done mainly for fire safety, to limit voltage and current between the modules and the inverters. Today most projects utilize discreet RSD devices however more module companies are integrating chips into their junction-boxes that allow for the module itself to meet RSD requirements./19While NEC 2017 is really only applicable for distributed PV applications it stands to reason that module manufacturers will standardize on these integrated RSD designs to lower costs and ensure their product can be used universally.From a grid stability standpoint solar modules can no longer be considered dumb devices. Even with secured inverters, transformers, and other grid facing technologies if solar panels with integrated RSD devices are supplying Bulk Power by their design they are intended to be controlled remotely and turned off within 30 seconds of a shutdown command. While shutting off a single solar panel may not disrupt a system, a coordinated cyberattack could disrupt thousands of modules across multiple systems would potentially cripple service territory and the broader network. By throttling an array on and off you could cause substantial damage to the transmission and distribution infrastructure. Securing the Bulk Power Supply begins with securing power generation and that starts at the module level.All PV Manufacturers Should Comply with U.S. StandardsFirst Solar offers PV modules that are safe and that cannot undermine the security of the Bulk Power System. First Solar modules do not contain communication components, and moreover, there are no components in the First Solar modules that could be remotely manipulated by a foreign adversary. As part of First Solar's unique thin-film manufacturing process we import limited raw materials from nations subject to this order. However none of those materials include or incorporate electronics or communications devices that could in any way be used to control PV modules. Any materials sourced from adversarial nations are subject to stringent quality controls and are either chemical or structural in nature with no role in controlling the operation of the module itself. First Solar modules cannot be remotely manipulated in a way that would put the Bulk Power System at risk.While most of our U.S. manufactured PV modules are used to supply U.S. projects, we do incorporate modules imported from our global facilities in U.S. projects. First Solar's global facilities are located in non-adversarial nations. It is important to note that all of our imported modules have the same inherent protections outlined above.In addition, materials used in our non-U.S. factories in Malaysia and Vietnam are subject to rigorous protections and restrictions. First Solar is a Tier 3 Participant in the Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (CTPAT). CTPAT members agree to work with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to protect the supply chain, identify security gaps, and implement specific security measures and best practices. Within the CTPAT program, a broad range of security topics are addressed including physical security, personnel security, cybersecurity, and security screening of business partners. As a Tier 3 Participant, First Solar conducts various annual risk assessments that identify threats, assess risk and apply necessary measures to mitigate vulnerabilities. Even as an importer, First Solar offers a higher level of security and reliability; at a minimum, the same standards for compliance and transparency should apply to all other PV module importers.Importers who are members of CTPAT are considered to be of lower risk than non-CTPAT importers. First Solar is unaware of any module manufacturers owned, controlled, or influenced by foreign adversaries which are members of CTPAT, an important consideration as the Department considers approaches to ensure the supply of BPS equipment. Given that First Solar's module manufacturing does not occur in adversarial nations and that the company and its operations are not subject to any foreign ownership, control or influence by adversarial nations, First Solar modules are clearly not subject to this Executive Order. The superior security measures undertaken by First Solar combined with the fact that First Solar modules do not present communication risks that could undermine the Bulk Power System further emphasize the security of First Solar PV modules as reliable BPS components. By contrast it is unclear what security measures are taken by PV manufacturers owned, controlled or influenced by foreign adversaries, and whether those measures are sufficient to ensure the security of the U.S. BPS from interference by foreign adversaries. As a first step to protect against this risk, no modules should be allowed to enter the U.S. that have not been subject to the same security measures imposed by the nation's largest PV module manufacturer.We appreciate the Department's interest in the security and reliability of the BPS as it relates to components imported into the U.S. by manufacturers subject to control, ownership, or influence by foreign adversaries. As the leading U.S. manufacturer of PV modules, First Solar takes these issues seriously. We look forward to engaging with the Department as it moves toward implementation of Executive Order 13920.View full comment at: https://www.regulations.gov/contentStreamer?documentId=DOE-HQ-2020-0028-0071&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdfRespectfully Submitted,Julie MyerholtzChief Information Security Officer419-662-8500jmyerholtz@firstsolar.comwww.firstsolar.com* * *Footnotes:1/ https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm10862/ https://www-wired-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.wired.com/story/hackers-iot-botnets-manipulate-energy-markets/amp3/ EIA AEO 2020 Tables 8, 9 & 164/ https://www.pv-magazine.com/2020/07/29/remote-operation-for-900-mw-fifth-phase-of-dubai-solar-field/5/ https://www.electroschematics.com/working-bootloaders-build-bootloader-1/6/ https://www.nerc.com/files/glossary_of_terms.pdf7/ https://www.microcontrollertips.com/wireless-mcus-bluetooth-wi-fi-zigbee/8/ Jinko model numbers: JKMS320M, JKMS325M, JKMS330M, JKMS335M, JKMS340M; JA Solar model numbers: JAM60S16-310/PR, JAM60S16-315/PR, JAM60S16-320/PR, JAM60S16-325/PR, JAM60S16-330/PR9/ https://www.open-electronics.org/top-5-wireless-ways-to-communicate-with-your-controller/10/ https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/19_0731_cisa_5th-generation-mobile-networks-overview_0.pdf11/ https://www.scmagazine.com/home/security-news/network-security/energy-company-hit-with-dos-attack-last-spring-identified-as-spower12/ https://edalab.it/en/zigbee-wireless-communication/13/ https://nootropicdesign.com/projectlab/2019/09/21/arduino-satellite-communication/14/ https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-20-689A1.pdf15/ https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2020/07/14/uk-government-bans-huawei-devices-from-5g-networks-existing-equipment-to-be-phased-out-by-2027/#66f5a8325b8916/ https://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/Project%20201602%20Modifications%20to%20CIP%20Standards%20DL/2016_CIP_Definitions_Informal_Posting_08092019.pdf17/ https://www.wired.com/2016/01/everything-we-know-about-ukraines-power-plant-hack/18/ https://www.purepower.com/blog/2017-nec-690.12-rapid-shutdown-important-changes19/ https://www.ti.com/solution/solar-rapid-shutdown* * *The notice can be viewed at: https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOE-HQ-2020-0028-0001TARGETED NEWS SERVICE (founded 2004) features non-partisan 'edited journalism' news briefs and information for news organizations, public policy groups and individuals; as well as 'gathered' public policy information, including news releases, reports, speeches.

Trump Accuses TikTok of Spreading Coronavirus Conspiracy Theories after Claiming Virus Came from Wuhan LabNewsweek.comAugust 7, 2020 Friday 5:11 AM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 846 wordsByline: Jason MurdockHighlight: "This mobile application may also be used for disinformation campaigns...such as when TikTok videos spread debunked conspiracy theories about the origins of the novel coronavirus," the order read.BodyPresident Donald Trump's executive order formalizing his threats against TikTok in the U.S. warned the app has been used to spread "debunked conspiracy theories" about COVID-19, despite his own long history in spreading mistruths about the virus.The executive order says TikTok collects huge amounts of data on users that can be provided to the Chinese Communist Party. It says this poses a threat to the U.S., potentially the country to "conduct corporate espionage.""[TikTok] may also be used for disinformation campaigns that benefit [China], such as when TikTok videos spread debunked conspiracy theories about the origins of the... novel coronavirus," the order says.Misinformation about the novel coronavirus swept across social media in recent months as COVID-19 spread worldwide, with Facebook singled out as being one major source. But there was another, and it was sitting inside the White House.In May, Trump claimed to have seen evidence the infectious disease could be traced to a lab in Wuhan, the Chinese city that first recorded an outbreak of the virus."Whether they [China] made a mistake or whether it started off as a mistake, and then they made another one or—did somebody do something on purpose?" he questioned in a White House briefing at the time, seemingly flirting with the conspiracy in circulation at the time suggesting the disease could have been a type of bioweapon.Trump was also asked about the source of the virus during a press conference the same month, questioned: "Have you seen anything at this point that gives you a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the origin of this virus?"He replied: "Yes, I have. Yes, I have. And I think the World Health Organization should be ashamed of themselves because they're like the public relations agency for China."Mike Pompeo, U.S. secretary of state, once said there was "enormous evidence" to say COVID-19 was tied to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The U.S. intelligence community later concluded the virus was "not man-made or genetically modified."Trump, with his fingers on social media, regularly shares false information, including a claim this week that children are "almost immune" to the COVID-19 virus, a post that forced Facebook to act after months of reluctance to sanction the president.Last week Trump retweeted a video containing lies about hydroxychloroquine treatment, a clip showing people claiming "you don't need masks" and there was already a "cure," despite advice from global health officials saying exactly the opposite.The president has repeatedly said COVID-19 will disappear on its own and previously promoted the debunked idea it was similar to the common flu, or cold.He shocked the scientific community in April by appearing to suggest that disinfectants could potentially be used to treat the novel coronavirus in patients. "I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning," he said."Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that. So, that, you're going to have to use medical doctors with. But it sounds—it sounds interesting to me."Microsoft is currently exploring an acquisition of the TikTok app from Chinese company ByteDance, with Trump giving it 45 days to complete a business deal. He has suggested the U.S. Treasury should be given a cut of money if the purchase goes ahead.The U.S. has warned TikTok's Chinese ownership poses a national security concern, although restrictions come as the president is engaged in a trade conflict with Beijing."TikTok automatically captures vast swaths of information from users including internet and other network activity information such as location data and browsing and search histories," the executive order reads, banning U.S. transactions with the firm."This data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information—potentially allowing China to ... build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage."TikTok also reportedly censors content that the Chinese Communist Party deems politically sensitive, such as content concerning protests in Hong Kong and China's treatment of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities. [TikTok] may also be used for disinformation campaigns that benefit [China], such as when TikTok videos spread debunked conspiracy theories about the origins of the... novel coronavirus."The White House has been contacted for comment.TikTok has repeatedly denied that it shares data with the Chinese government, saying that U.S. user data is actually stored in the states, with a backup in Singapore.In its response to the executive order, TikTok said: "We will pursue all remedies available to us in order to ensure that the rule of law is not discarded and that our company and our users are treated fairly—if not by the administration, then by the U.S. courts."Link to ImageGraphic President Donald TrumpSamuel Corum/GettyPresident Donald Trump departs the White House for a trip to Ohio where he will visit a Whirlpool factory on August 6, 2020 in Washington, DC.

TikTok sues Trump administration over ban: 'We have no choice'UPIAugust 24, 2020 Monday 12:56 PM ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 312 wordsByline: SOMMER BROKAWDateline: Aug. 24 BodyByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration Monday over efforts to ban the Chinese video service in the United States.President Donald Trump banned the social app with an executive order this month, citing national security concerns. The order said the app collects Americans' personal data that could be used by the Chinese government.Monday, TikTok replied that there is no evidence to justify the ban and said it violates the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees due process."The executive order seeks to ban TikTok purportedly because of the speculative possibility that the application could be manipulated by the Chinese government," the company wrote in a blog post."But, as the U.S. government is well aware, [we] have taken extraordinary measures to protect the privacy and security of TikTok's U.S. user data, including by having TikTok store such data outside of China (in the United States and Singapore) and by erecting software barriers that help ensure that TikTok stores its U.S. users data separately."The company added that it has given plenty of documentation to the U.S. government outlining its security practices that should refute any concerns.TikTok has 1,500 employees in the United States and the ban threatens 10,000 more planned jobs in California, Texas, New York, Tennessee, Florida, Michigan, Illinois and Washington State, the company said."To be clear, we far prefer constructive dialogue over litigation," the blog added."We have no choice but to take action to protect our rights, and the rights of our community and employees."TikTok also said Trump's order was a misuse of federal law because it's not based on a legitimate national emergency.Trump drew ire from China earlier this month when he threatened the ban if TikTok wasn't sold to U.S. software giant Microsoft.Load-Date: August 24, 2020End of Document

Thanks so much for joining us. Welcome back. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, August 18th.Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.Democrats rallying around the Joe Biden/Kamala Harris ticket last night. Night one of the first ever virtual Democratic National Convention featuring Michelle Obama, Senator Bernie Sanders and a few others from across the aisle. Speakers going heavy on Biden's character but light on policy.Meanwhile, President Trump speaking live to supporters in Wisconsin and Minnesota. He focused on jobs and the economy.Coming up at 8:40 a.m. Eastern this morning, U.S. Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia is here on the president's executive orders to help Americans in need and the ongoing battle over stimulus.The coronavirus impact on retail, meanwhile. Home Depot rising this morning after reporting a double beat on earnings and revenue, seeing same store sales jump better than 23 percent. Heavy hitters Walmart and Kohl's due out any minute. We will have those numbers and see the impact on markets this morning.Broader markets this morning looking higher this morning with the S&P 500 pushing toward another record high. Dow Industrials right now at the high of the morning with a gain of 116 points, given Home Depot's strength, The Nasdaq up 43 points and the S&P 500 currently higher by 8 points. Walmart just reporting revenue and it is above expectations.Meanwhile this, the race to buy TikTok. Oracle stock is surging this morning after reportedly throwing its hat in the ring for the social media giant. What it means for Microsoft and Oracle coming up. Oracle shares are up better than 3 percent.Plus, Budweiser wants to become America's first ever state beer. Find out which state and why.MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.Let's get to Cheryl Casone with the Walmart numbers.We're looking at some good numbers here on a beat.Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Very strong. A double beat, Maria.Let's first look at the earnings per share. The expectation was $1.25. They came in at $1.56. And revenue, big beat there, Maria, 135.48 billion was the estimate. They came in at 137.7 billion.Now to a couple more things we were looking for in Walmart's numbers.First I want to say the stock was up about 2 percent going into this number. It's now up more than 6 percent. This is a Dow component.Same store sales up 9 percent. If you take out fuel out of that number, it was a jump of 9.9 percent. Also, e-commerce sales. This is something else, a jump of 97 percent for e-commerce sales, Maria. That tells us that basically people were not only online but that Walmart's initiative to really take on Amazon seems to be paying off.Also, the cost of the company with regards to the coronavirus, whether it's the healthcare cost, cleaning the stores, obviously paying more for employees, because they have been hiring during this, that came in at $1.5 billion.I do want to say, real quick, though, Sam's Club, they also own Sam's Club. I was looking at the comp sales there. Those rose 13.3 percent. That big bulk, you know, that's kind of the Costco competitor right there if you will on Sam's Club. And new member counts for Sam's Club coming in more than 60 percent. So some really impressive numbers.The stock's up about 14 percent year-to-date. It's up about 6 percent in the pre-market. Again, we're looking for that conference call. It's at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time, Maria. Hopefully we're going to get some more commentary from Doug McMillon and maybe some guidance. We shall see. One could only hope, Maria.Back over to you.BARTIROMO: Yes, and then we will hear it directly from Doug McMillon tomorrow morning on the program. I'll be interviewing the CEO of Walmart. Doug McMillon will be here live at 8:00 a.m. Eastern. Join us for this special interview to walk us through what's going on in retail with the CEO of the largest. Doug McMillon coming up.Time for the "Word on Wall Street."Joining me right now is the former editor and publisher of "The Gartman Letter," Dennis Gartman is here. The Bahnsen Group CEO and Managing Partner David Bahnsen is here, along with IHT Wealth Management President Steve Dudash.Great to see everybody this morning. Gentlemen, thank you so much.STEVE DUDASH, PRESIDENT, IHT WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Thank you.What an earnings period. Let's talk retail, Steve. Your thoughts on the earnings that we've gotten so far from Walmart, Kohl's and Home Depot, surpassing expectations. We're in a pandemic and yet we've got these companies reporting strong earnings and now Walmart's stock is up better than 6 percent.Your reaction?DUDASH: It's a huge morning. You know, two huge bellwethers with Home Depot and Walmart coming out. Kind of stole my thunder. I was going to say Walmart's going to beat expectations and they beat me by a couple seconds to say it.But, you know, Home Depot crushed, up 23 percent. Sales -- same store sales up 23, profits up 25. That's wonderful. Walmart beats, like you guys just said. Both stocks are up a bunch of percents right now. And continuing in the path they've been doing all year long.The e-commerce part, you guys just mentioned it a few seconds ago, that's the critical part, up nearly 100 percent on the e-commerce side. That's not going to change. When the pandemic is over, when people are getting back to some degree of normal, that's expected to continue. And I think that's where you're going to see the biggest profitable gains for that company moving forward.But you guys touched on it and you're going to have the CEO tomorrow, this is the biggest part, we need guidance out of them. And I know it's hard. You've got to feel for the guy. It's hard to give guidance with so many unknowns, especially with Congress apparently failing to put together another stimulus package as of last night. So I'm hoping that you can get some guidance out of him because we don't expect to see any real guidance on paper today in the next few minutes or so.But I want to know, where do they feel -- because they are the best indicator of the U.S. consumer. Where do they feel this continues down that path?BARTIROMO: Yes.DUDASH: I feel that they should be starting to guide a little bit lower. I think you're going to hear that with the stimulus being gone, with the PPP money being gone, you have you to believe the U.S. consumer's going to start catching up.We saw the housing numbers just yesterday, two days ago now, being a little bit down. The lower income people have been hit harder by this pandemic.BARTIROMO: Yes.DUDASH: And it's starting to trickle through. And that's my biggest worry. And that's what we need to really see out of a company like Walmart, how they feel, because they have the best indicators out there in that segment.BARTIROMO: Yes. And we'll get that -- we'll get that guidance for the rest of the year.DUDASH: I know you will.BARTIROMO: The markets are near record levels regardless. The S&P 500 closed up three-tenths of a percent yesterday, nearly topping its pre- pandemic highs. Take a look. It was yesterday up 9 points, but the Nasdaq up better than 1 -- is 1 percent higher. And all of the averages are gaining this morning. We're also waiting on that stimulus, as you mentioned.So -- so, Dennis, what do the charts tell you here? And we've got this market now at -- at the highest of the morning given the Walmart and Home Depot numbers.DENNIS GARTMAN, FORMER EDITOR AND PUBLISHER, "THE GARTMAN LETTER": It's amazing what's going on. It's a bull market. It's been a bull market. Market's moving from the lower left to the upper right. I've said that for months and months and it shall continue to do so.What we have is what I call MEQE-ing (ph), massively excessive quantitative easing. It's taking stocks higher. It's taking interest rates lower. It's taking gold higher. It's taking corn prices higher. It's taking commodity prices higher. And as long as that continues, and there's no reason to believe that that's going to stop any time soon, and it's not just here in the United States, it's the monetary authorities in England, Canada, China, Russia, the U.K., Europe, they're all becoming massively excessive and they're going to continue to do so. They're worried about their economies, while they should. And until we see -- new growth in the economy itself, that excessive quantitative easing moves its way into the stock prices.So that's what's going on. It's going to continue. Mark this down, it will continue until it stops. That's what I've learned in 45 years of doing this.BARTIROMO: Yes.Well, we know that Jay Powell has told us that rates will be near rock bottom levels until 2023.GARTMAN: Yes.BARTIROMO: So we've got that for sure in terms of the path forward. Not a lot of alternatives to companies that actually pay dividends in the stock market.Look at Tesla and this huge boost.David Bahnsen, wrap us up here because the electric market maker this morning is up 11 percent yesterday. It's adding to it. The surge driving Elon Musk's net worth by nearly $8 billion. This makes him the world's fourth richest person.David, the stock this morning is up another 5 percent on Tesla. Your reaction to this and also the backdrop? Got to get your take on what we're hearing this morning with Home Depot and Walmart.DAVID BAHNSEN, CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER, THE BAHNSEN GROUP: Sure. Well, with the Walmart side, let me start there. I want to remind us that Walmart was one of the only two stocks, McDonald's being the other one, that was up in 2008. So the whole world was ending, it was a real actual secular recession and contraction and Walmart was up in that period as well. It's always been a very defensive company and I don't think it's a bellwether for the regular consumer. It's people buying what they sort of have to buy, it's just that now they have that double whammy of being the biggest brick and mortar in the world and their e-commerce platform is legitimate as the only real competitor to Amazon out there.And -- but I think to -- to your point on Tesla, it's a little different than what Dennis is talking about with the kind of QE and the overall liquidity driven market right now, the appetite for risk assets. Tesla's a cold stock. It's a popularity stock. I personally would like to think that Elon Musk deserves the premium to his net worth for being one of the only CEOs in America to stand up to Gavin Newsom and the lockdowns in March/April, but I don't think that's really the way it works. That's just sort of how I'm thinking about it.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a great point.It's good to see you guys this morning. We've got a market that is nearing record highs. Dennis Gartman, David Bahnsen, Steve Dudash, thanks so much for your wonderful insights, as always.A quick break and then we're talking with Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan. He'll talk the DNC and the battle over the post office.Plus, former White House Press Secretary and Fox News Contributor Sarah Sanders is here on the impact of the first convention speeches.Amazon's real estate play. The technology giant making moves to bolster delivery options.And then in the 8:00 a.m. hour, former foreign policy advisor to Donald Trump Carter Page at the -- in the middle of all of the FISA abuse at the FBI. We're going to talk about new revelations with Kevin Clinesmith pleading guilty to changing the story of Carter Page.Plus, former Pennsylvania Governor and DNC Chairman Ed Rendell is here.Former Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker is here.And former interim DNC Chair Donna Brazile on the DNC's best moments so far.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Night one of the Democratic National Convention now in the history books. The first ever virtual event featuring speakers including former First Lady Michelle Obama, Senator Bernie Sanders, both wasting no time, president -- slamming President Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHELLE OBAMA, FORMER FIRST LADY: Whenever we look to this White House for some leadership or consolation or any semblance of steadiness, what we get instead is chaos, division and a total and utter lack of empathy.We have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it.SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): During this president's term, the unthinkable has become normal. He has tried to prevent people from voting, undermine the U.S. Postal Service, deployed the military and federal agents against peaceful protesters, threatened to delay the election and suggested that he will not leave office if he loses. This is not normal.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Tonight's another big night. Sally Yates, Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez, former President Bill Clinton, and Dr. Jill Biden among the speakers tonight.Joining me right now to talk about all of that is Ohio Congressman, House Appropriations Committee member, Tim Ryan.Congressman, always a pleasure. Great to see you.REP. TIM RYAN (D-OH): Great to see you, Maria.BARTIROMO: What did you think of the convention, opening night last night?RYAN: I thought it was pitch perfect. I think it went from John Kasich really talking to moderate Republicans, independent voters. And then you had Bernie Sanders really shoring up, I think, a lot of the former Jill Stein voters, if you can put it that way, to really recognize how important this election is. And then, of course, Michelle Obama hit it out of the park. I think she was just -- just talking to normal people about what's at stake in this election. So I thought it was pitch perfect.BARTIROMO: You know, it's interesting when -- when you consider John Kasich speaking last night, he's a Republican, speaking at the Democrat National Convention. He hates Donald Trump so much he would not even step foot in the convention center last time around. Remember in 2016, he would not go to the GOP convention.Meanwhile, he was the governor. It was -- the convention was in his state and he would not go.RYAN: Well, I just -- there's a lot of people, both at that point I think a lot of Republicans at that point and even more now, Maria, that are appalled with the president's behavior, the way he's dismantled American leadership around the world where no one's looking at the United States. He botched the coronavirus. We're at 170,000. This did not have to be this way if you just played it straight.And President Trump didn't. And what you're seeing in Ohio now, embodied by John Kasich, the suburbs are moving to Joe Biden, suburban Columbus, suburban Cincinnati, people who voted for John Kasich and liked him are now moving to Joe Biden. So he's emblematic of what's happening in the suburban areas, in all of the swing states, and that spells deep trouble for Donald Trump.BARTIROMO: Yes.Congressman, what do you mean he should have played it straight? I mean when -- when, you know, on January 31st, when the president shut down travel from China, Joe Biden called him a -- called him a xenophobe. So what do you mean played it straight?RYAN: Well, we were -- we were -- we -- we were like the fifth --BARTIROMO: How did he not play it straight?RYAN: We were like the 15th or 20th state to do the ban. So let's not act like President Trump was ahead of the curve here. And then he denied it. He kept saying it was a hoax.BARTIROMO: Well, I mean he was. But -- but he was.RYAN: And you saw -- you -- you -- you saw --BARTIROMO: He shut down travel.RYAN: No, he -- he --BARTIROMO: He shut down travel on January 31st and Joe Biden called him a xenophobe. So, no, he was early on stopping travel.RYAN: Maria, he shipped -- he shipped 18 tons of PPP to China instead of making sure we were prepared here. And maybe that was the right move. He didn't use the Defense Production Act to make sure we had PPE here. You saw --BARTIROMO: So how is Joe Biden going to treat China? How is Joe Biden going to treat China?RYAN: Hold -- hold -- hold on.BARTIROMO: I mean his son took home a billion and a half dollars and put it in his hedge fund when he traveled on Air Force Two to China with Joe Biden.RYAN: OK. OK.BARTIROMO: No, seriously, Congressman, how is Joe Biden going to treat China differently than Donald Trump?RYAN: We're going to -- we're going to --BARTIROMO: Let's face it, Donald Trump is the first president to push back on China and their behavior and their espionage campaign. Do you think Joe Biden's going to do the same thing, Congressman?RYAN: Oh, and more. And more.BARTIROMO: What?RYAN: What the president has done with our relationship with China -- go ask farmers in Ohio, Maria, how they're doing with their trade relationship with China. Go figure out how we're beating them at AI.BARTIROMO: Yes.RYAN: They're beating us with Huawei. They're beating us with additive manufacturing.BARTIROMO: Well, that's why -- that's why the president banned Huawei.RYAN: They're beating us in the -- hold on. They -- they are -- they are -- they are --BARTIROMO: The president banned Huawei from doing -- doing business in the U.S.RYAN: Maria, let me talk. They are cleaning --BARTIROMO: It's just a different -- it's a different -- it's a completely different reaction --RYAN: They -- look it -- look it --BARTIROMO: From President Trump and Joe Biden when it comes to China. That you -- that you have to admit.RYAN: Maria, they are cleaning our clock with electric vehicles. They're cleaning our clock with battery storage. They're cleaning our clock with AI. All the (INAUDIBLE) manufacturing. All --BARTIROMO: Well, they stole a lot of it. They stole a lot of it and Congress was nowhere. Where was Congress as -- as the Chinese Communist Party was stealing all our intellectual property? How did they get ahead of us in AI? How did they get ahead of us in electric vehicles? They're stealing a lot of this data, Congressman.RYAN: No, we have -- we have -- we have --BARTIROMO: That's what President Trump is trying to stop. What is Congress doing about it?RYAN: We have failed to reinvest into the technologies of the future. We've failed to reinvest in the basic science. We failed to reinvest in the innovation, early stage capital, all these things that would allow us to compete.Donald Trump -- Donald -- Donald Trump -- Donald Trump --BARTIROMO: Congressman, how are we going to invest? We can't even agree on stimulus. How are we going to invest in anything when we can't even agree on stimulus? Senate Republicans ready to unveil a scaled back coronavirus stimulus package that includes funding for the U.S. Postal Service. $1 trillion plan is supposed to counter $3.5 trillion stimulus passed by House Democrats. Everybody went back for their summer vacation. American citizens are sitting there waiting for this stimulus money because of this shutdown. How come Congress can't make a -- come up with an agreement on this?RYAN: Well, we offered to come in. We came in at 3 -- a little over 3 trillion. The Republicans came in at a trillion. Our leadership said, why don't we split the baby and figure out how to do 2 trillion. We have 40 percent of people in Ohio, Maria, that are at risk of eviction. And -- and the Republican plan had nothing around mortgages or rent relief, nothing around hazard pay for these essential workers.But I'm just saying, Donald Trump has a bravado plan. Joe Biden has an actual plan. When you look at his build back better plan, it's about pumping money into research and development.BARTIROMO: How is an actual plan (ph) $3.5 trillion? Congressman, come on, you've come on this show before and you've raised your hand about debt. You're among the most responsible out there, looking at debt and serious impact here. How do you come to the table with a $3.5 trillion package and tell us you're for real? Seriously?RYAN: Because -- because the only thing more expensive is doing nothing. And if we want to do nothing, you're going to watch millions of Americans slide into bankruptcy, destroy their credit.The average working class person, Maria, if they go through this for a few months, it will take them a decade to climb out of the damage they're going to do to their own credit. And all we're saying is, this is how you inject money to protect working class people so they don't lose their homes, they can pay their bills, they can keep up so when the virus is gone.BARTIROMO: Half of that stuff --RYAN: And Mitch McConnell, they -- they -- they've been MIA here.BARTIROMO: Half of that stuff that Nancy Pelosi wants has nothing to do with coronavirus, Congressman, you know that.RYAN: It has -- it has everything --BARTIROMO: She wants money to the states and the cities. She wants money for mail-in voting. Nothing to do with coronavirus.RYAN: Mil-in voting has nothing to do with coronavirus? Come on.BARTIROMO: That she wants overall mail-in voting.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.A disagreement at the Department of Justice over Google, apparently. There are concerns about the potential anti-trust suit against Google. According the a report from "The Wall Street Journal," lawyers suggesting that they may need more time to go through millions of documents to guarantee a win. Attorney General William Barr says that he's hoping to make a decision by the end of the summer to move forward with the lawsuit.Jon Hilsenrath, your reaction?JON HILSENRATH, SENIOR WRITER, "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL": Well, yes, what's going on here is there are two pieces of this investigation. One on Google's search practices and another on its advertising businesses. And apparently the advertising piece of this is moving more slowly. And one possibility is that they -- is that they break -- they bring this anti- trust investigation into two pieces. One at a time.The Justice Department, Secretary Barr, is pushing to get this done this summer, but some of the lawyers there think that they should move a little bit more slowly.You know, the other thing that I -- that I'd say about this is, we have this weird dichotomy right now where on the one hand I think a lot of people are concerned about the power of big tech and believing that big tech at least should be stopped from acquiring so many other smaller businesses. And then, on the other hand, we're looking to big tech to buy TikTok from the Chinese government. So, you know, I think that this country needs to have a discussion about how -- about whether big tech is allowed to continue to acquire other companies and, if not, what's the alternative.BARTIROMO: Yes, because those acquisitions just make it more powerful and more powerful, bigger and more powerful, right, Jon?HILSENRATH: Absolutely. And the two leading contenders for TikTok right now are Microsoft and Oracle.BARTIROMO: Yes.HILSENRATH: It seems like whenever we have a problem in this sector, we look to the big tech companies to come and solve it. And a lot of people feel like the big tech companies are a part of the problem.BARTIROMO: Yes. Look at the -- look -- look at whose waiting to acquire, Microsoft and Oracle. Can you get any bigger?Joe, what do you think? Do you think that the DOJ moves forward with this case?JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, "THE HILL": I think they do, but I think later this summer. Where are we now? It's August 18th. That's basically in the next couple of weeks. And as "The Wall Street Journal" described it, this is a once in a generation lawsuit. And if you have any flaws in it and lose in court -- remember, Google had something like, what, 46 billion in revenues in 2019. Pretty sure they have a decent legal team.If you lose here, you might not get a second chance, but it feels like it's being rushed in case there is a Joe Biden victory, therefore a different attorney general, a different State Department. So it seems like they're trying to get this in before any changes happen there. I would think that you have to measure twice and cut once, to use an old tiling term, before you go ahead with something like this.BARTIROMO: Yes.CONCHA: And the end of summer feels a little rushed.HILSENRATH: Maria --BARTIROMO: Yes, a lot of that going on, Joe, a lot of that.Go ahead, Jon.HILSENRATH: Maria, there's also a political element to this -- the political element to this is Kamala Harris is close to big tech --BARTIROMO: Yes.HILSENRATH: And, you know, so you have -- you have to wonder if that gets politicized going into this election and if that might be playing into the Justice Department's timing on this, get this done, you know, just in case we have a Biden administration and a vice president who is slow walking some of this stuff.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a great point.CONCHA: Great point.BARTIROMO: We'll take a break.When we come back, we are looking forward to day two of the DNC. We are first taking a look at the first Democratic convention speeches with Sarah Huckabee Sanders. That's coming up.And then J-Lo and A-Rod's new digs. Wait till you check this out. Their sprawling new Miami estate and the price tag, coming up, right here.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, August 18th.Let's take a look at markets. 7:32 am on the East Coast. We are expecting a rally underway this morning Futures, indicating a gain at the start of trading with the S&P 500 nearing another all-time record high. Dow Industrials right now up 57 points. The NASDAQ up 34 and the S&P up 6 points as we've had some strong signals this morning from retail.We have earnings from Walmart, Home Depot out as well as Kohl's beating expectations across the board. Meanwhile, the NASDAQ notching a record close yesterday and is continuing that momentum this morning.Take a look at yesterday's market action with the Dow down 86, with the NASDAQ up 110 points at 4:00 o'clock on Wall Street, 1 percent higher there as the momentum in tech goes on. Global markets this morning are also having a firmer tone. European indices are higher across the board. The European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has warned that banks are unlikely to fully recover from the coronavirus before 2022.Having said that, the FTSE 100 is up 15 and the CAC quarante is up 21, and the DAX Index right now up 110 points, that's almost 1 percent there as well. In Asia, overnight, markets are mixed. You have South Korea's KOSPI Index reporting a sharp decline, concerns are growing there over coronavirus spikes. The KOSPI Index overnight, down 2.5 percent.Meanwhile, NTSB (ph) investigators are trying to figure out what caused a small plane crash into a Connecticut home. Cheryl Casone with the detail. Cheryl.CASONE: That's right Maria. And that small plane went through the roof of a Groton, Connecticut home last night, while the man was still inside the home. Luckily, he walked away without a scratch. Two people that were inside the plane, they both were taken to a nearby hospital, but expected to be OK. Police say the plane was headed to the Groton, New London Airport which is just a few miles away from this crash site.Well, the battle between Fortnite and Apple is intensifying. The game company is asking a judge to prevent Apple from blocking it from making software for iPhone and Macs, set to go into effect August 28th. Epic Games, the move it says is unquantifiable and a repairable damage to its business. Fortnite was kicked off of the App Store last week after Apple says the company violated its rules.Well, Verizon and Disney are expanding their partnership, adding the full Disney Plus, Hulu and ESPN Plus bundle at no charge to subscribers of two of their wireless plans. Starting Thursday, Verizon customers who have the either the Play More Unlimited or the Get More Unlimited packages will get the bundles for free. The Disney bundle currently retails for the rest of us for $13 a month.And finally, a pizza bummer. Pizza Hut closing up to 300 of its locations nationwide. This move is part of a deal between Yum! Brands and its largest us franchisee NPC International. NPC also agreeing to put its remaining 927 locations up for sale. This franchisee also operates, we should say about, 400 Wendy's. They filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection just last month. And those are all your headlines. Maria, back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl. Thank you. We are looking at an unconventional convention season, that's for sure. The first night of the virtual 2020 Democratic National Convention featured a long list of speakers last night, including former First Lady Michelle Obama, Senator Bernie Sanders and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.All wasting no time, slamming President Trump. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHELLE OBAMA, FORMER FIRST LADY: Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country. He has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he is clearly in over his head. Going high is the only thing that works. Because when we go low, when we use those same tactics of degrading and dehumanizing others, we just become part of the ugly noise that's drowning out everything else. We have got to vote for Joe Biden, like our lives depend on it.GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): Today, we trail the world in defeating COVID. We have over 5 million cases. Americans learned the critical lesson, how vulnerable we are when we are divided. And how many lives can be lost when our government is incompetent.SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT): We have a president who is not only incapable of addressing these crises, but is leading us down the path of authoritarianism. Any of the ideas we fought for that just a few years ago were considered radical are now mainstream. But let us be clear, if Donald Trump is reelected, all the progress we have made will be in jeopardy.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Tonight is another big night as Sally Yates, Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez, former President Bill Clinton, and Dr. Jill Biden all scheduled to speak tonight for day two. Joining me right now is former White House Press Secretary, Fox News Contributor, Sarah Sanders. Sarah, it is great to see you. Thank you so much for being here. Your reaction to day one of the DNC last night?SARAH SANDERS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think one thing is clear that Democrats, Hollywood elites and their liberal media allies have one thing in common and they made it very clear last night, they hate Donald Trump.But let's look at the last four years. Let's look at the President's record of success. He's defeated ISIS, he's killed some of the world's most dangerous terrorist, he's remade the judiciary. He's cut taxes and rebuilt our economy. He's put a number of policies in place that have allowed America to become the number one energy producer in the world. He's helped our vets.He's rebuilt our military and made us stronger so that our adversaries don't pick on us and don't mess with us. He is unlike previous presidents. He's actually taken on China. He has done a record number of things to rebuild our country, to make us stronger, to make us more prosperous.The Democrats can say all they want this week. But I look forward to next week when we have a contrast with the Republican convention, where we can point out the Democrat's new agenda of lawlessness and socialism, which is a very, very dangerous thing for this country and would take us back, not take us forward.BARTIROMO: Well, you mentioned lawlessness, and Michelle Obama also said chaos. And she said, look, all we get is chaos. He's had enough time to prove himself, but he's over his head. What I was struck by, which he said, that was, well, how come there are so many Democrat mayors and governors who won't stop the chaos, who won't stop the vandalism? Who won't actually put their police forces in check to restore law and order?SANDERS: Exactly. If you want to look at the chaos in this country, look at all the Democrat run cities, that's where our crime is skyrocketing. That's where you have rioting and looting. And instead of stopping it, they're trying to defund the organization that could.I mean, it is mind blowing to watch the hypocrisy of the Democrats, last night, talk about how they want to implement safety and empathy. They don't take care of the most vulnerable people in our communities. They aren't protecting our big cities. They don't protect the unborn child. The idea that they are the party of empathy and compassion to me is - frankly, it's laughable.BARTIROMO: Well, how come so many Republicans are joining their fight then, Sarah? I mean former Ohio Governor, 2016 Republican presidential candidate, John Kasich, among the speakers last night. He made the case for Joe Biden. Listen to this. Got to get your reaction.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN KASICH (R) FORMER OHIO GOVERNOR: America is at that crossroads today. The stakes in this election are greater than any in modern times. I'm a lifelong Republican. In normal times, something like this would probably never happen. But these are not normal times. We're being taken down the wrong road by a president who has pitted one against the other.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And I mentioned this in the last segment, Sarah, don't forget during the 2016 convention season, the Republican convention was in Ohio, and he was the governor of Ohio and he would not go to the convention hall. He refused to attend the GOP convention four years ago.SANDERS: Look, I hope John Kasich stays out in that field all by himself, because I think that's where he belongs. Republicans don't want him. And, frankly, I don't think most Democrats do either. He doesn't have a lot of credibility. How can you claim to be a Republican when you are voting and pushing for somebody who doesn't represent anything that Republicans stand for?Democrats want bigger government, higher taxes, more government intrusion into your lives, they don't care about the pro-life movement. Everything that John Kasich says he stands for is the opposite of what Democrats embody. Read their party platform, John.I'm afraid for the people in Ohio if that's the kind of leadership they have. I think, John Kasich needs to stay out in the field all by himself right where he belongs, because frankly, the Republican Party doesn't want somebody who doesn't know who he is, doesn't know what they believe in, because he's willing to embrace things that are so far Left and so far outside of what Republicans stand for and frankly what Donald Trump has been able to accomplish in these last four years.BARTIROMO: All right. So give us a preview Sarah. The president says he will officially accept the Republican nomination from the White House next week. the RNC reportedly seeking a permit for a firework show on the National Mall shortly after his speech. The Republican National Convention kicks off Monday with limited events in Charlotte, North Carolina. What should we expect from the RNC a week from today?SANDERS: Look, I think the - they can go out and tell President Trump's story. He has an incredible record to talk about, and they should do exactly that. Make it a contrast. Show the President's compassion. This is somebody who deeply loves our country, and has fought every single day to make it better.Have the people that have been impacted by the President's policies, whether it's criminal justice reform, tax cuts, veterans, our military. All of these individuals who have benefited by President Trump versus those who were hurt by the last decades of leadership or lack thereof from people like Joe Biden.Joe Biden has been in government for 50 years and didn't get anything done. Why should we think that he can show up in Washington and do a better job now? President Trump has proven it. And I think you'll see the faces of the policies that the President has enacted come to life at next week's convention. And I think it'll be a great contrast to the lawlessness and the chaos that comes from Democrats.BARTIROMO: Yes. You make a good point. It's really hard to take somebody seriously who says, we've got all these problems, and yet you've been in office and you've been in Congress for 40 years. What have you done in these four decades?Sarah, it's good to see you. Thank you so much. We will, of course, be following the RNC in a week as well and we'll talk more.Coming up, Amazon's real estate play. The technology giant making big moves to bolster delivery options. Plus, Elon Musk making big money, the Tesla chief, one of the top names on an elite list. You are watching "Mornings with Maria" live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Amazon coming to a mall near you. The retail giant reportedly looking to team up with Simon Property Group to expand its brick and mortar presence. Grady Trimble is live this morning in Schaumburg, Illinois where Amazon is already turning empty commercial space into an Amazon Go Grocery store. Grady?GRADY TRIMBLE, FOX BUSINESS REPORTER: Good morning, Maria. Seems like an unlikely partnership, right? The e-commerce giant going into classic brick and mortar retail. But as you mentioned, Amazon already has a history doing that.This used to be a Babies R Us. Before that it was a Kmart. But very soon it's going to be one of those Amazon Go Grocery stores. And Simon Property Group has led analysts to believe that they'll be moving into the grocery space as well.David Simon, the CEO of that company saying on an earnings call recently, "I'm hopeful that we can certainly do more business in the grocery category." So that led some analysts to think that maybe fulfillment centers will be going into malls by Amazon, but others have said no, it's going to be that Amazon Go Grocery concept where you grab what you need. You've got a bunch of cameras watching you and then you walk out without having to check out at a normal register.The move makes sense for Amazon, if it happens. They'd save on construction costs and move into existing retail space. It would also be a win for Simon. Obviously, there are fewer people going into malls than there have been over the past several decades. And department stores were once anchor tenants, now they're closing by the hundreds.Look at this graphic. 3,500 Sears and Kmart stores just 10 years ago. Now, there are 95 of them open across the country. Investors like this idea for Simon. You can see right around the time of that earnings call earlier this month when they were talking about possibly having grocery stores become anchor tenants at malls. You see shares of Simon Property Group spiking.We should point out, though, Maria at this point, it is mostly analyst inklings and maybe wishful thinking. Neither Simon Property Group nor Amazon would confirm this news, but they didn't deny it either.BARTIROMO: Very interesting developments Grady. We know that you'll be on it. We will keep watching. Thanks so much. Grady Trimble in Illinois this morning.Coming up, making moves in Miami, J.Lo and A-Rod buying and mega mansion in the 305. The mood on the blog coming up next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Time from the "Morning Buzz." First up Elon Musk breaking records again. The billionaire is now the world's fourth richest person after a $7 billion bump up from Tesla stock surge. The stock topping $1,800 a share after soaring more than 30 percent in just four days. It's going to get cheaper soon, Jon, but that's because it's doing a massive stock split.JON HILSENRATH, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL SENIOR WRITER: Yes, Maria. I'm torn about this story. On the one hand, I want to admit that I was wrong. I was very skeptical of where Tesla was going a couple of years ago, and they are turning a profit and investors are responding to that. And so you got to tip your hat Elon Musk.At the same time, you look at the share price. I'm looking at it right now. It's quite quadrupled this year. And, when you look at that, it's just starting to look like Internet stocks we're looking in the late 1990s. You have to be a little bit skeptical of that. But I got to admit, also, my skepticism about Tesla has been wrong in the past.BARTIROMO: Yes. No, the momentum is there for sure. Yes, a lot of people were wrong, Jon. Signed, sealed and sold. Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez reportedly shelling out $40 million for a waterfront mansion in Miami on Star Island, the super private enclave for celebrities and business tycoons. Neighbors are apparently thrilled. Joe, what do you think? Are they happy with the new neighbors or rising property values?JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, THE HILL: Rising property values always follow the money, Maria, right? And look 40 million sounds like a lot for a house, obviously. But when you're worth J-Rod, that's what they're called now J.Lo and A-Rod, they're worth a combined $750 million, yet only have one World Series ring between them, just want to point that out as a former Yankee fan.Yes, this thing has 10 bedrooms, 12 bathrooms. It's on a 40,000 square foot lot. I think they got enough space. And you know what, real estate market is doing great in Florida, because so many people are now moving out of New York because of the rising crime, and it's so expensive. At least down there you don't have any state income tax. So, yes, if I'm living in that neighborhood, probably pretty happy right now to see number 13 and J.Lo come into my block.BARTIROMO: Yes. No, you're right. I mean, people are leaving New York in droves and it certainly has been a big positive for Florida. Yes, Jon go ahead.HILSENRATH: I think I just heard you say former Yankee fan, what's going on there? I mean, this Yankee team is that - they're winning games, they're hitting the balls, they're pitching. Come on, a former Yankee fan? What's that all about?BARTIROMO: You said former Joe?CONCHA: I think that Don Mattingly guy - yes, they just bought everybody and I just didn't recognize him anymore, so when Mattingly retired then I just decided to become a Cubs fan. Total transparency.BARTIROMO: He just decided - you think that Cubs want a fan like that? Do the Cubs want a fan like that? You just decided to become a Cubs fan?CONCHA: I always had a soft spot for the Cubbies, because they hadn't won a World Series. In fact, Maria, I love Chicago, so they were always my second team. And then, yes, once Wade Boggs came for the Yankees, I said, all right, I'm out of here. For A-Rod, I hate these players. I don't want them and that was that.BARTIROMO: All right. Look, we're going to take a break, but when we come back we're zeroing in on the wrongdoing at the top of the FBI. Former Trump Foreign Policy Adviser Carter Page in a first on Fox interview with me coming up exclusive on the new revelations. It's all right here next hour, "Mornings with Maria" live on Fox Business.Load-Date: August 18, 2020End of Document

Tech battle: U.S. companies call on Trump to backtrackCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 28, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 560 wordsBody             By Mauro Albornoz       Every measure announced in relation to the US-China trade war shows that technology is the battleground. Since President Donald Trump's executive order banning US companies from negotiations with the Chinese platform WeChat has been known, a concern alarm has been set on American companies working with the Asian giant. Now they fear a negative impact and ask the first representative to backtrack. While WeChat is popularly known as the "Chinese Whatsapp" it is actually a super-application that brings social, work and financial life together on a single platform. It is used to talk, buy, send money, order a taxi, play games, share photos, among many other functions. With the restrictions of the People's Party on its internet, today this application is about the digital nexus between China and the rest of the world. Its parent company Tencent is currently valued at around $69 billion, making it the eighth largest company in the world, according to Bloomberg. This year the app reached 1.2 billion active users and is the main communication bridge for many Chinese citizens to communicate with their relatives in the midst of a pandemic.Although Donald Trump signed executive orders banning "commercial transactions" with that Chinese platform, there are still some doubts about the scope of the announcement.  The main confusion is due to whether access to WeChat by any U.S. citizen is prohibited or the blockade is to all types of negotiations with parent company Tencent. In the second case it could be due to a commercial situation already going through the Chinese company Huawei and which had a huge impact on large manufacturers in the telecommunications sector. In recent days, however, senior Trump administration officials have sought to appease the waters and reassure big business about the possibility that such a blockade may not be so restrictive. Even several technology-specialized media such as TechCrunch consider this measure to be a Trump communication strategy rather than a concrete measure that can be developed.Apple is one of the companies that could lose more with the WeChat ban because China accounts for one-fifth of its sales. It also depends on China for a large part of its manufacturing, which could be affected if the Chinese government decided to retaliate. This measure would also affect companies, from large multinationals to SMEs. The American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai interviewed 142 representatives of US companies on Chinese soil and 88% of them agreed that this measure would have a negative impact on their operations, while 56.3% said this step would lead to their loss of competitiveness and 41.5% foreseeses negative consequences for their revenue.Tencent has a large stake in U.S. companies and made million-dollar investments in many sectors from the video game 'Fortnite' to Hollywood blockbusters. He owns Riot Games, the studio that creators two of the world's most important games: "League of Legends" and "Teamfight Tactics". In 2015, the Chinese company signed a $700 million deal with the National Basketball Association, making the company the NBA's exclusive digital partner in China.  The presidentDonald Trump seems willing to slow the advance of this tech giant even though it is not yet clear how much collateral damage this measure could trigger.Load-Date: August 29, 2020End of Document

Stock Market UpdateBriefing.comAugust 13, 2020 4:28 PMCopyright 2020 Briefing.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 4702 wordsBody-- S&P 500 closes lower, but mega-caps limit decline-- Weekly initial claims decreased by 228,000 to 963,000 (Briefing.com consensus 1.150 mln) -- first time since March that claims were under one million -- S&P 500 unable to stay above at its all-time closing high (3386.15) -- Coronavirus relief talks remained at standstill S&P 500 closes lower, but mega-caps limit decline - Aug 13 - 16:15 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 declined 0.2% on Thursday, but continued strength in the mega-cap stocks helped limit the decline. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.3%) and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) performed in-line with the benchmark index.  Apple (AAPL 460.04, +8.00, +1.8%) set a fresh record high in a momentum trade, helping the information technology sector (+0.04%) eke out a gain despite a pullback in the semiconductor stocks and an 11% decline in Cisco (CSCO 42.72, -5.38, -11.2%) following its disappointing quarterly guidance. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 1.1%. The communication services sector (+0.4%) also closed higher due to its mega-cap components. Nine sectors closed lower, though, with the energy (-2.0%), real estate (-1.2%), industrials (-0.7%), and financials (-0.6%) sectors declining the most. In key data, weekly initial claims decreased by 228,000 to 963,000 (Briefing.com consensus 1.150 mln), which was the first time since March that claims checked in below one million. This was a relatively positive development for the market, but some speculated whether it would lessen the pressure for lawmakers to reach a timely coronavirus relief bill.A report from Politico suggested that there is little hope among negotiators of reaching a deal by September. House Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) said she will only resume talks with White House officials if they are willing to agree to at least a $2 trillion deal. Interestingly, the S&P 500 grazed above its all-time closing high (3386.15) and matched its high from yesterday at around the 3387 level before facing selling pressure throughout the afternoon. The initial selling, albeit modest, coincided with longer-dated Treasury yields pushing toward session highs. The 10-yr yield finished higher by five basis points to 0.72% after touching 0.65% at its low in overnight action. The 2-yr yield was flat at 0.16%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 93.29. WTI crude fell 0.8%, or $0.34, to $42.26/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data, which included the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report:• Initial claims for the week ending August 8 decreased by 228,000 to 963,000 (Briefing.com consensus 1.150 mln) from last week's revised reading of 1.191 mln (from 1.186 mln). Continuing claims for the week ending August 1 decreased by 604,000 to 15.486 mln from last week's revised reading of 16.107 mln (from 16.090 mln).The key takeaway from the report is that it represented the first sub-one million reading in nearly five months. However, at 963,000, weekly initial claims are still about four times as large as what the market had been accustomed to prior to the surge in late March.• Import prices increased 0.7% in July, and prices, excluding oil, increased 0.2%. Export prices increased 0.8% in July, and prices, excluding agriculture, increased 0.7%.Looking ahead, investors will receive the following reports on Friday: Retail Sales for July, preliminary Q2 productivity and unit labor costs, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for July, the preliminary Univ. of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August, and Business Inventories for June. • Nasdaq Composite +23.1% YTD• S&P 500 +4.4% YTD• Dow Jones Industrial Average -2.3% YTD• Russell 2000 -5.3% YTDNASDAQ - 1472 - 1772 - 3.4 blnNYSE - 1204 - 1736 - 719.1 mlnDJ30 - -80.12 - 27896.72NASDAQ - +30.27 - 11042.58SP500 - -6.92 - 3373.43WTI crude settles lower, energy stocks lag - Aug 13 - 15:30 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading lower by 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is trading lower by 0.4%.One last look at the S&P 500 sectors shows energy (-1.7%), real estate (-1.0%), and financials (-0.6%) leading today's decline, while the communication services (+0.5%), consumer discretionary (+0.1%), and information technology (+0.1%) sectors trade higher. WTI crude futures settled lower by 0.8%, or $0.34, to $42.26/bbl. The lower oil prices added pressure to the energy stocks. NASDAQ - 1492 - 1780 - 2.8 blnNYSE - 1189 - 1740 - 420.4 mlnDJ30 - -80.57 - 27896.27NASDAQ - +39.33 - 11051.64SP500 - -5.31 - 3375.04Resistance at closing high - Aug 13 - 14:55 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading lower by 0.4%, having faced tough resistance at its all-time closing high of 3386.15 for two straight days now. The benchmark index briefly grazed above it today and yesterday but only to have been rejected twice. Most sectors are trading lower now, with the exception being communication services (+0.1%). Cisco (CSCO 42.47, -5.64, -11.7%) remains deep in the red with a 11.7% decline following its downside guidance, while Micron (MU 46.07, -2.41, -5.0%) extends losses following its quarterly warning. Looking ahead, Applied Materials (AMAT 64.80, -1.70, -2.6%) and Baidu (BIDU 124.83, -1.28, -1.0%) are some notable companies that will report earnings after today's close. NASDAQ - 1375 - 1896 - 2.6 blnNYSE - 1064 - 1835 - 385.0 mlnDJ30 - -176.59 - 27800.25NASDAQ - +0.86 - 11013.17SP500 - -15.19 - 3365.16Slide To Session Lows - Aug 13 - 14:30 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have pushed to session lows in the last half hour with the S&P 500 (-0.21%) briefly sliding below the 3370 level. The recent push lower follows a Politico report that the White House and Democrats are "miles apart" on stimulus and there is little hope of reaching a deal by September.S&P 500 constituents HollyFrontier (HFC 25.81, -1.41, -5.18%), HewlettPackardEnterprise (HPE 9.66, -0.48, -4.73%), and Invesco (IVZ 10.76, -0.47, -4.23%) are underperforming. Barclays downgraded IVZ to Underweight as they see further EPS downside if outflows persist at elevated levels, while HFC slips on news the company will be removed from the MSCI USA Index at the end of the month.Conversely, Paycom Software (PAYC 299.44, +11.74, +4.08%) is the best-performing name in the index. The overall iShares Tech-SoftwareETF (IGV 292.73, +3.17) is higher by 1.09% today, helped in part by gains out of Aspen Tech (AZPN 126.16, +28.45, +29.12%).NASDAQ - 1461 - 1812 - 2.43 blnNYSE - 1207 - 1699 - 357.0 mlnDJ30 - -106.82 - 27870.02NASDAQ - +25.13 - 11037.44SP500 - -7.14 - 3373.21Gold Higher Into Settlement As Bond Prices Fall - Aug 13 - 14:00 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages pushed higher in the last half hour as the S&P 500 (+0.07%) once again shows modest gains.Gold futures settled $21.40 higher (+1.1%) to $1,970.40/oz, helped along by a slide in bond prices in the last half hour as well as a softer greenback.The U.S. Dollar Index holds losses of about 0.2% to 93.23.NASDAQ - 1609 - 1666 - 2.23 blnNYSE - 1312 - 1574 - 330.0 mlnDJ30 - -42.95 - 27933.89NASDAQ - +75.83 - 11088.14SP500 - +2.36 - 3382.71S&P 500 Turns Lower, DJIA Also Weaker - Aug 13 - 13:30 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have trickled lower in the last half hour with the S&P 500 (-0.01%) peeking just below flat lines. The DJIA (-0.22%) sits modestly lower, and the Nasdaq Composite (+0.54%) is modestly higher.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that Apple (AAPL 461.52, +9.48 +2.10%), Nike (NKE 106.78, +1.56, +1.48%), and 3M (MMM 165.60, +1.34, +0.82%) are outperforming.Conversely, oil&gas company ExxonMobil (XOM 43.15, -0.94, -2.13%) sits near the bottom of the index.The DJIA now sits 0.85% off Tuesday's highs.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $26 bln 30-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.406% on a bid-to-cover of 2.14.NASDAQ - 1586 - 1700 - 2.07 blnNYSE - 1344 - 1553 - 308.0 mlnDJ30 - -62.56 - 27914.28NASDAQ - +58.99 - 11071.3SP500 - -0.40 - 3379.95Apple, mega-caps power Nasdaq higher - Aug 13 - 12:55 ET[BRIEFING.COM] It's a mixed market on Wall Street, but the mega-cap stocks continue to sport strong gains, which are fueling the outperformance of the Nasdaq Composite (+0.9%). The S&P 500 is up 0.1%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%. Apple (AAPL 463.51, +11.47, +2.6%) is trading at fresh all-time highs and just shy of a $2 trillion valuation, and Tesla (TSLA 1644.00, +88.90, +5.7%) is up another 6% to bring its advance to 19.5% since announcing a stock split on Tuesday. The Nasdaq would be up even more, though, had Cisco (CSCO 42.66, -5.44, -11.3%) not issued disappointing quarterly guidance. CSCO shares are down 11%. The mega-cap sectors -- communication services (+0.9%), information technology (+0.8%), and consumer discretionary (+0.7%) -- lead the sectors in gains. The materials sector (+0.2%) is the only other sector trading higher, while the energy (-1.0%), financials (-0.9%), and real estate (-0.7%) sectors underperform in the red. In key news, weekly initial claims decreased by 228,000 to 963,000 (Briefing.com consensus 1.150 mln), which was the first time since March that claims totaled less than one million. That's eye candy for the market, but some have speculated whether the improving labor market would lessen the pressure on lawmakers for a timely coronavirus relief bill.On a related note, House Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) said she will only resume talks with White House officials if they are willing to agree to at least $2 trillion in fiscal stimulus. Separately, Lyft (LYFT 29.42, -1.10, -3.6%) and Vroom (VRM 59.02, -9.89, -14.3%) are some other earnings laggards, while Micron (MU 46.20, -2.28, -4.7%) trades lower amid negative-minded analyst recommendations. Deutsche Bank downgraded MU to Hold from Buy, and Cascend Securities lowered its price target to $55 from $70. The levels to watch for the S&P 500 are 3386.15 (closing record) and 3393.52 (all-time high). Currently, the benchmark index sits a few points below the closing high. Reviewing today's economic data:• Initial claims for the week ending August 8 decreased by 228,000 to 963,000 (Briefing.com consensus 1.150 mln) from last week's revised reading of 1.191 mln (from 1.186 mln). Continuing claims for the week ending August 1 decreased by 604,000 to 15.486 mln from last week's revised reading of 16.107 mln (from 16.090 mln).The key takeaway from the report is that it represented the first sub-one million reading in nearly five months.

Apple (AAPL 462.62, +10.56, +2.3%) leads with a 2% gain, followed by solid gains in Alphabet (GOOG 1529.95, +23.38, +1.6%), Netflix (NFLX 782.61, +7.14, +1.5%), Amazon (AMZN 3202.96, +40.72, +1.3%), and Facebook (FB 262.68, +2.86, +1.1%).The CBOE Volatility Index is down another 2.6% today to 21.70, nearing its lowest levels since late February when the stock market first started selling off. NASDAQ - 1648 - 1614 - 1.7 blnNYSE - 1367 - 1509 - 261.3 mlnDJ30 - -52.02 - 27924.82NASDAQ - +98.09 - 11110.4SP500 - +2.76 - 3383.11Tough talk on stimulus - Aug 13 - 11:55 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade mixed. The S&P 500 is up 0.1%, the Dow is down 0.2%, and the Nasdaq is up 0.8%.Regarding the latest stimulus news, House Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) recently said she will only resume talks with White House officials if they are willing to agree to at least $2 trillion in fiscal stimulus. Note, that's down from the original $3 trillion plan, but there are key issues that Republicans vehemently disagree with. Over in Europe, the major indices closed on a lower note. Germany's DAX lost 0.5%, UK's FTSE lost 1.5%, and France's CAC lost 0.6%.

It's been a tight-ranged session for the benchmark index. The gains in the mega-caps have already been referenced, but it's worth calling attention to the 5% gain in Tesla (TSLA 1635.09, +80.24, +5.2%), which is now up 19.0% since announcing a five-for-one stock split on Tuesday. Separately, American Airlines (AAL 13.39, -0.15, -1.1%) is preparing to scrap flights serving two-dozen medium and small cities, according to CNBC. The decline in AAL shares, though, speaks more to the general underperformance of the cyclical and value stocks today. NASDAQ - 1564 - 1670 - 1.4 blnNYSE - 1312 - 1538 - 205.3 mlnDJ30 - -44.75 - 27932.09NASDAQ - +96.27 - 11108.58SP500 - +3.54 - 3383.89Jobless claims decline, but market not reacting - Aug 13 - 10:55 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade near its flat line in a mixed session. The benchmark index will have another shot at closing at a record high, as it trades a few points below that level (3386.15).The better-than-expected jobless claims report, which saw claims fall below one million for the first time since March, has not had the positive effect market participants would have hoped. More stocks are down than up at the NYSE and Nasdaq.This could be because claims are still at a relatively high level or because it might lessen the pressure on lawmakers to speed up a coronavirus relief bill. The latest updates indicated that negotiators remained at a standstill. NASDAQ - 1583 - 1609 - 1.2 blnNYSE - 1314 - 1502 - 173.1 mlnDJ30 - -57.52 - 27919.32NASDAQ - +93.51 - 11105.82SP500 - +2.67 - 3383.02Mega-caps power Nasdaq higher, while semiconductors cool off - Aug 13 - 10:25 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is little changed, while the Nasdaq outperforms with a 0.6% gain.

Notably, semiconductor stocks are pulling back, though.

The Nasdaq Composite set the performance pace with a 2.1% gain. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 1.1%, and the Russell 2000 increased 0.5%. After leading yesterday's decline, the mega-caps returned to usual form with a strong rebound. Apple (AAPL 452.04, +14.54, +3.3%) rose 3%; Tesla (TSLA 1554.76, +180.37, +13.1%) surged 13% after announcing a 5:1 stock split; and NVIDIA (NVDA 457.61, +23.61, +5.4%) rose 5% after its price target was raised to a Street-high of $540 from $450 at Cascend Securities. The mega-cap stocks carried the S&P 500 information technology (+2.3%) and consumer discretionary (+1.7%) sectors into the leadership roles today. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index also had a strong day, rising 3.4%. Gains broadened out to the defensive-oriented health care (+1.7%), utilities (+1.5%), real estate (+1.3%), and consumer staples (+1.3%) sectors, too. Interestingly, the financials sector (-0.3%) sat this one out after outperforming in recent sessions as part of the rotation into value and cyclical stocks.In vaccine news, Moderna (MRNA 69.52, +0.55, +0.8%) reached a $1.525 billion deal with the U.S. government to manufacture and deliver 100 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine. MRNA shares gained just 0.8%, though, after starting the day with an 11% gain.Elsewhere, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin reportedly offered to resume coronavirus relief talks but Democratic congressional leadership said that administration officials remained unwilling to budge from their prior stance. The standstill did not deter trading sentiment today. U.S. Treasuries finished little changed in a quiet session. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 0.16%, and the 10-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.67%. The U.S. Dollar Index decreased 0.2% to 93.44. WTI crude rose  2.3%, or $0.94, to $42.60/bbl.Reviewing Wednesday's economic data:• The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for July increased 0.6% m/m (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) following a 0.6% increase in June. Excluding food and energy, CPI rose 0.6% m/m (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%) after a 0.2% increase in June.The key takeaway from the report is that while it followed in the footsteps of yesterday's hotter than expected PPI report, it is unlikely to have significant policy implications, since the Fed has made it clear that discussions about a rate hike are not being conducted at this time.• The Treasury Budget showed a $63.0 bln deficit for July. The budget data is not seasonally adjusted, so the July deficit cannot be compared to the June deficit of $864.1 bln. The deficit in July 2019 was $119.7 bln.The key takeaway from the report is that the delayed tax filing deadline prevented the July statement from showing another big deficit as outlays nearly doubled year-over-year.• The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index rose 6.8% following a 5.1% decline in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report and Import and Export Prices for July on Thursday.• Nasdaq Composite +22.7% YTD• S&P 500 +4.6% YTD• Dow Jones Industrial Average -2.0% YTD• Russell 2000 -5.1% YTDNASDAQ - 1825 - 1426 - 3.6 blnNYSE - 1844 - 1084 - 770.9 mlnDJ30 - +289.93 - 27976.84NASDAQ - +229.42 - 11012.31SP500 - +46.66 - 3380.35Load-Date: August 13, 2020End of Document

By the coronavirus, Donald Trump no longer likes Xi Jinping: "I used to like him, now I don't feel like that"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 12, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 484 wordsBodyU.S. President Donald Trump said Tuesday to have changed his mind about his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, and lamented that his "great" relationship with the Asian giant's leader has deteriorated."I had a great relationship with President Xi," Trump revealed during an interview with Fox Sports radio station. "I liked him, but now I don't feel like this anymore," said the tycoon, who blames the switch to the coronavirus pandemic.Trump said he "hasn't spoken to him a long time ago" and insisted that he dislikes the attitude of the Chinese authorities or "what has happened" since the first outbreak was detected in Wuhan City in late 2019."The world stood up, what has happened is a disgrace," he said before suggesting that the consequences of the pandemic are worse than the trade dispute between Beijing and Washington.Relations between the two countries have been characterized by increased tension since Trump arrived at the White House, at first due to trade and intellectual property disputes, and subsequently by the pandemic.The Trump Administration repeatedly accused the Chinese government of 'hacking' reports on vaccine development and claimed that the virus could have "escaped" from a Chinese lab. In addition, he asked to open an independent investigation into the origin of the coronavirus.Washington also imposed sanctions against China in response to the passage of the Hong Kong National Security Act, which the U.S. government says undermines the region's autonomy.Countries also have disputes over other issues, such as China's expansion in the South China Sea, the development of 5G technology, and the Uighur situation in Xinjiang.TikTokOne of the most recent crosses was Trump's order to demand the sale of Tik Tok in the United States or else the video platform will be banned in the US.The battle for TikTok, a Chinese app that in just a few years has taken on Instagram or Twitter level, is the latest episode of the "cold war" between the United States and China.At a meeting on Tuesday with employees, the TikTok Dome, owned by China's ByteDance, assumed that a forced-sell agreement will have to be agreed to continue operating, something that could be resolved by September 15, a deadline given by President Donald Trump for sale if they do not want to be exposed to a total ban.As reported today by the specialized medium The Information, TikTok's CEO, formerDisney Kevin Mayer, assured employees at a teleconference that the company will emerge stronger from the acquisition, although he noted that the outcome of that negotiation is still in the air.TikTok's is just the latest episode of a conflict that intensified more than two years ago on the commercial level and which is already an open struggle for technological supremacy in which digital walls are building between two powers that, even if they claim victory, will have lost out.With agency informationA.p.Load-Date: August 13, 2020End of Document

US-Microsoft confirms its intention to buy TikTok in US after talking to TrumpCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 3, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 542 wordsBodyMADRID, 3 (EUROPA PRESS)Microsoft company has confirmed on Sunday its intention to purchase the TikTok mobile phone app in the United States after its CEO, Satya Nadella, has had a conversation with US President Donald Trump."Microsoft is ready to continue discussions to explore the purchase of TikTok in the United States," the company has reported through a statement disseminated through its 'blog'.According to the company, it will engage in talks with TikTok's owner Company, ByteDance, "quickly" with the aim of ending in "weeks". On the possible date, it has progressed that discussions may be complete "by September 15". During the process, Microsoft has assured that it "hopes to continue its dialogue with the U.S. government, including with the president."Discussions with ByteDance will be based on a notification to the U.S. Foreign Investment Committee. In the statement, the company states that both have notified their intention to explore a preliminary proposal that would involve the purchase of TikTok not only in the United States, but also in Canada, Australia and New Zealand.The new structure "would build on the experience that TikTok users currently love, while adding security, privacy and digital security protections." Thus, "the operating model for the service would be built to ensure transparency to users, as well as adequate security oversight by the governments of these countries," according to the text."Among other measures, Microsoft would ensure that all private data of U.S. users is transferred and remain in the United States," he added, while ensuring that data currently stored outside the U.S. country will be deleted after being transferred.In this regard, Microsoft has attached importance to "addressing Trump's concerns" and has pledged to acquire TikTok after "a comprehensive security review" and to provide "the right economic benefits to the United States, including the Treasury.""Microsoft appreciates the personal involvement of Trump and the U.S. government as it continues to develop strong security protections for the country," he said.Finally, the company has emphasized that, so far, discussions are in a "preliminary" phase. Thus, you have specified that you "have no intention" to "provide more updates until the discussions do not have a final result".U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed on Sunday that Trump is finalizing preparations to make a decision on restricting the use of the app on suspicion that he would be sending information from his users to the Chinese government.The president already announced Friday that he would ban TikTok using emergency economic powers or an executive order, although he did not provide further details on it.Critics of the app were wary of whether the data TikTok could collect from US users could end up in the hands of the Chinese government, even though the company has assured it stores its data outside China and would resist any attempt by Beijing to seize the information.For their part, cybersecurity experts have pointed out that the potential risk to national security posed by the application is, above all, theoretical and that there is no evidence to suggest that TikTok user data may becompromised by China's intelligence.Load-Date: August 4, 2020End of Document

US tightens its restrictions by en closing Huawei's access to technology and chips around the worldCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 17, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 513 wordsBodyThe U.S. Department of Commerce has today unveiled new rules restricting the Chinese telecom equipment manufacturer's ability huawei to purchase foreign-produced semiconductors using U.S. technology.This new regulation is based on the restrictions already announced in May that prevent the Chinese company from being able to access the chips manufactured with American technology, even if huawei was designed. In statements to Fox Business, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross explained that these restrictions led the Chinese entity to take "some evasive measures" that allowed it to access such semiconductors through third parties. "The new regulation clarifies that any use of U.S.-made software or equipment is prohibited and requires a license," the official stressed.The Ross-led Department also added 38 other Huawei subsidiaries in 21 countries to its "List of Entities," which prevents companies from exporting U.S. technology to those entities without a license. Huawei has been blacklisted since last year along with a total of 152 of its affiliates. A new rule requires companies on this list to obtain a license when a firm such as Huawei acts "as a buyer, interim consignee, end consignee or end user".In a statement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo explained that the Trump Administration considers Huawei "an arm of the Chinese Communist Party (CHP)" surveillance state" and therefore continues to take such measures. "We will not tolerate the PCCh's efforts to undermine the privacy of our citizens, the intellectual property of our companies, or the integrity of the next generation's networks around the world," he added. Relations between Washington and Beijing are at its worst in decades, and the US is pressuring other governments around the world to exclude Huawei from its networks, arguing that the company will hand over the data to the Chinese government for espionage. Huawei denies that it is spying for China. The new measures, which come into force immediately, should avoid Huawei's attempts to circumvent US export controls, Commerce said.This decision comes after the review of the first phase of the trade agreement was cancelled over the weekend, alluding to an agenda dispute. U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Deputy Prime Minister Liu He were expected to address the us's advance by teleconference last Saturday. All this at a time when the PRESIDENT of the United States signed two decrees that will prohibit the use of applications such as TikTok (ByteDance) or WeChat (Tencent) in the US. In the case of TikTok, the company could save its U.S. operations if it manages to sell them to a US company, such as Microsoft and Twitter. Over the weekend, when asked during a press conference if there were other Chinese-owned companies in particular that he was considering banning, such as Alibaba, US President Donald Trump acknowledged that he was considering retaliation. "We are seeing other things, yes, " replied the representative.commentsforum0WhatsApp  FacebookTwitter  Linkedin       Load-Date: August 18, 2020End of Document

Walmart joins Microsoft in bid for video app TikTokAssociated Press Financial WireAugust 27, 2020 Thursday 11:28 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWSLength: 461 wordsByline: JOSEPH PISANI and ZEN SOO, AP Technology WritersBodyWalmart is the latest company to want a piece of TikTok, the popular Chinese-owned video app that has come under fire from the Trump administration.The world's largest retailer made a joint bid with tech giant Microsoft to buy TikTok's U.S. business, according to a person close to the deal who isn't authorized to discuss the terms publicly.It may seem like an unlikely combination, but Microsoft and Walmart are already business partners. Microsoft provides cloud computing services that help run the retailer’s stores and online shopping. The two companies signed a 5-year partnership in 2018, enabling them to join forces against a shared rival: online shopping giant Amazon.Walmart said in a statement Thursday that a deal with Microsoft and TikTok could help it expand its advertising business and reach more shoppers.TikTok, through its fun, goofy videos, has gained 100 million U.S. users. But the White House is pushing TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance to sell its U.S. business if it wants to keep operating in the country, citing security risks.Microsoft has confirmed discussions with TikTok; other tech companies such as Oracle are also reportedly interested in a possible acquisition. While ByteDance hasn't disclosed its asking price for TikTok, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that it is seeking roughly $30 billion for TikTok's U.S. operations. The Journal reported that bidders so far haven't been willing to meet that price. TikTok didn't immediately reply to an emailed request for comment.Over the past year, TikTok has tried to put distance between its app and its Chinese ownership. It installed former top Disney executive Kevin Mayer as its American CEO, but he resigned Thursday after just a few months on the job.In a letter to employees, Mayer said that his decision to leave comes after the “political environment has sharply changed.”ByteDance launched TikTok in 2017, then bought Musical.ly, a video service popular with teens in the U.S. and Europe, and combined the two. A twin service, Douyin, is available for Chinese users.U.S. authorities are concerned that TikTok would turn over user data to Chinese authorities and that it censors content that would upset China. TikTok denies that it has shared user data with the Chinese government and would not do so if asked, nor censored videos at Chinese authorities’ request. It says it's not a national security threat.The sale situation has been unusual, with President Donald Trump demanding payment for the U.S. government for its part in orchestrating a deal, a step that experts say is unprecedented. The president said on Aug. 18 that Oracle was “a great company” that “could handle” buying TikTok. He declined to state a preference between Oracle and Microsoft as buyers.Load-Date: August 27, 2020End of Document

Trump reiterates threat to ban TikTok if sale falls throughPolitico.comAugust 3, 2020 Monday 7:05 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 831 wordsHighlight: "I don't mind if, whether it's Microsoft or somebody else, a big company, a secure company, a very American company buy[s] it," the president said.BodyTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin wants a TikTok sale to Microsoft. But on Monday, Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro took to CNN to say the potential deal makes him uncomfortable, while President Donald Trump said a portion of any TikTok sale should go to the U.S. Treasury - a move critics likened to a "public shakedown."Despite a nine-month national security investigation and weeks of talk of action against TikTok, the Trump administration has yet to settle on a coherent approach to taking on the popular video-sharing app.President Donald Trump said Monday he would force TikTok to close up shop in the United States if the Chinese-owned platform is not sold to U.S. buyers by the middle of next month."I set a date of around Sep. 15, at which point it's going to be out of business in the United States," Trump told reporters Monday at the White House, just days after he announced plans to shut the app down over security concerns as soon as this past weekend.The app has exploded in popularity during the coronavirus pandemic, and has been the most downloaded non-game app in the world this summer, according to data analytics firm SensorTower, with the U.S. accounting for the second-highest volume of downloads.But the app, owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, has come under fire from lawmakers and government officials on both sides of the aisle over fears that it could turn over American users' information to the Chinese government. TikTok says it has not provided consumers' personal information to Beijing and would not do so.Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS, opened an investigation in November into ByteDance's 2017 acquisition of Musical.ly, a $1 billion deal that didn't undergo foreign investment review at the time. Microsoft has emerged as the leading candidate to buy TikTok and said Sunday that the company will push forward with its discussions about a potential purchase.TikTok didn't respond to a request for comment. Microsoft declined to comment beyond the Sunday blog post.Mnuchin - whose agency leads the CFIUS process - is in favor of the deal, according to a person familiar with the acquisition talks who spoke on condition of anonymity because negotiations are ongoing. But on Monday morning, Navarro - a key architect of Trump's strategy on China - told CNN he had qualms about a deal between Microsoft and TikTok."Microsoft should divest its Chinese holdings and then we feel more comfortable," Navarro said, noting that Microsoft's Bing search engine and Skype videoconferencing platform are used by the Chinese Communist Party. "This is not a white-hat company," he added. Trump told reporters Monday afternoon he had spoken to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella about a sale over the weekend because TikTok is "too big, too invasive" to be controlled by China. The president also said that he wanted to see a "substantial portion" of TikTok's acquisition cost "come into" the U.S. Treasury, though it is unclear what process he was referring to."We are making it possible for this deal to happen. Right now they don't have any rights, unless we give it to them. If we give them the rights, it has to come into this country," he said, likening the relationship to that of a landlord and tenant. "Without a lease, the tenant has nothing.""It's a great asset, but it's not a great asset in the United States unless they have the approval of the United States," Trump said he indicated to Nadella.Neither the White House nor Treasury would offer comments clarifying Trump's remarks. Companies pay CFIUS a filing fee when deals are reviewed, but those fees max out at $300,000. During a press briefing Monday evening, Trump again reiterated that the U.S. Treasury should get part of the proceeds from TikTok's sale because it helped broker the deal by threatening to ban it."Either way, whether it's Microsoft or somebody else, the Chinese, the United States should get a large percentage of that price because we're making it possible," he said.The president's comments were quickly panned online, with Trump critic and political campaign strategist Rick Wilson comparing it to a "public shakedown." Jesse Blumenthal, who manages the technology and innovation work at the conservative Charles Koch Institute, said he had concerns about ByteDance's ownership of TikTok but expressed shock at Trump's comments: "this is not how this works."Karen North, a professor of digital social media at USC's Annenberg School, said Trump's politicization of TikTok was unfortunate because it obscures legitimate privacy concerns."The data situation with TikTok, regardless of the politics, is actually a serious problem and one people should worry about," said North, who served in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy during the Clinton Administration. Unfortunately, Trump is "known to take action without necessarily going through all the preliminary steps."Steven Overly and Betsy Woodruff Swan contributed to this report.Load-Date: August 4, 2020End of Document

TikTok seeks lobbyists as Trump forces sale in U.S.CE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 11, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 528 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- TikTok is looking for good lobbyists.The popular Chinese-owned video app wants to bolster its washington office, while rushing to sell its U.S. operations to a domestic buyer before the company's presidential ban takes effect next month.The wave of hiring comes when TikTok faces increasing pressure from U.S. officials who say their capabilities to locate and manage Americans' personal information are a national security risk. President Donald Trump also seeks to curb China's power over technology companies, as he puts the clashes with China as one of the central themes of his re-election campaign.TikTok announced multiple "government affairs" posts on August 3, just as the Trump administration was evaluating whether to ban the application or force the Chinese owner of TikTok, ByteDance Ltd., to sell its operations in the United StatesThe company is looking for lobbyists who can influence Washington, building relationships with political figures, following the legislation, advocating for positions that protect the TikTok user community, interacting with lawmakers, and identifying issues that could affect the company."TikTok isn't going anywhere," the company said in a statement, noting that it has tripled the size of its team in the U.S. since the early 2020s. "We are committed to the long-term success of our dedicated employees who work every day to make TikTok a unique and uplifting corner of the Internet," he said.TikTok has faced constant trump hits. It first threatened to close TikTok if its owners did not sell the business to a U.S. company before September 15. Then, on August 6, he signed a couple of executive orders prohibiting U.S. residents from doing business with the Chinese-owned TikTok and WeChat apps, which take effect within 45 days.Microsoft Corp. has been in talks about a possible purchase of TikTok's operations in the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, Bloomberg reported.TikTok, whose service has more than 100 million U.S. users, was already increasing its lobbying capacity in Washington before Trump began threatening to ban it. Beijing-based ByteDance said it spent $500,000 on federal lobbying in the second quarter of 2020, breaking his previous record of $300,000 in the first three months.TikTok's lobbying efforts in Washington began last year in an attempt to get meetings between company executives and high-profile senators.The social media company is looking for lobbyists with "established relationships" and experience working with Congress, the government and agencies, according to a job offer published on Daybook, a website that specializes in public policy employment.TikTok is also hiring a director of state government affairs to make it a point of contact for elected officials. TikTok first published an ad for that position in February and again in July, according to Daybook.ByteDance, which was founded in China and is built in the Cayman Islands, denies that TikTok collects data for the Chinese government and says it stores US data in the country and Singapore, not China.Original Note:TikTok Seeks More Lobbyists as Trump Ban Aims to Force U.S. Sale©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: August 12, 2020End of Document

TikTok sued Donald Trump for banning its U.S. operationsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 24, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 465 wordsBodyIn an open legal dispute with Donald Trump's administration, social video enforcement TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance,sued the U.S. government for enacting a law prohibiting any transaction or business with that company in the U.S.In his lawsuit, TikTok alleged that President Trump's executive order, signed in early August, "is not based on genuine national security concerns,"according to excerpts from the court document the company itself posted on a blog on Monday."The executive order issued by the Administration on August 6, 2020 has the potential to strip our community of rights without any evidence to justify such extreme and due process," TikTok said in that complaint.The Trump Administration argues that TikTok poses a "threat" to U.S. national security,so it prevented its transactions from September 15, and is seeking to force its sale to a U.S. company like Microsoft, which has shown interest in the popular social network.In his executive order, Trump said TikTok creates "real risks" for the US. Usa,so he banned any business with his parent company, a move that can force ByteDance to sell his social network.The lawsuit, filed monday in the Federal District Court for the Central District of California, in Los Angeles, represents another step in the dispute between TikTok and the White House.It all started with Trump's first executive order against TikTok, which derives from his legal authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which allows the president to regulate economic transactions in a national emergency.Previous administrations have used it to sanction foreign governments, as well as drug kingpins and hackers, but have never used it against a global technology company.TikTok, which in the U.S. has more than 80 million users,is one of the most growing social networks in recent years, where it has become the main entertainment for many teens and a marketing channel for major celebrities.The Trump Administration, as well as leading Democratic congressmen, have insisted that the widespread use of TikTok puts American data privacy and national security at risk as it is exposed through ByteDance to chinese government instructions and intervention.China's Foreign Ministry also opposes the forced sale of TikTok, an operation it believes violates the principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO).Indeed, the Chinese government sees the intention to sell TikTok as another chapter of the trade war between Beijing and Washington, which seeks to contain the growing technological power of the Asian giant, which has already seen the telecommunications firm Huawei face restrictions.Attempts to put pressure on TikTok are also seen with concern by tech giants with global ambitions such as Alibaba and Tencent.

"I don't care if it's Microsoft or another large company, a secure company, a very American company has to buy it," the representative said.Zhang indicated in his letter to employees that his company has "actively cooperated" with the U.S. Foreign Investment Committee in its investigation into the purchase of the app Musical.ly in 2017, by ByteDance to another Chinese company."While we have repeatedly emphasized that we are a private company and are willing to offer more technological solutions to eradicate their concerns, CFIUS still demands that ByteDance must sell TikTok's US business," he said.TikTok, which in the US has more than 80 million users, is one of the most growing social networks in recent years, where it has become the main entertainment for many teenagers and a marketing channel for major celebrities.The Trump Administration, as well as leading Democratic congressmen, claim that the widespread use of TikTok jeopardizes the privacy of American data and national security, as they argue that the application is exposed, through ByteDance, to instructions and intervention by the Chinese government.Microsoft announced this Sunday that negotiations continue for its purchase and promised to complete the operation no later than next month.China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs opposes the forced sale of TikTok, an international version of The Chinese social network Douyin, an operation that it believes violates the principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO).ByteDance on Monday accused its competitor Facebook of "copying" its service with the new formatReels from the American company.TikTok's case is the latest episode of the China-U.S. conflict, which has gone from commercial to technological, and could be further found after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's announcement that Trump will act "soon" against Chinese software companies that he considers a national security risk.(With EFE information)MORE ON THIS TOPIC:ByteDance plans to open an international headquarters for TikTok outside the USThe United States warned that TikTok should be sold or blocked: "It can't go on as it is now"Load-Date: August 5, 2020End of Document

SECRETARY MICHAEL R. POMPEO WITH MARIA BARTIROMO OF FOX NEWS SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES AUG. 2, 2020States News ServiceAugust 2, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 2454 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Department of State:InterviewMichael R. Pompeo, Secretary of StateWashington, D.C.August 2, 2020QUESTION: Joining me right now with his reaction and the state of affairs right now between the U.S. and China is U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Secretary, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for being here.SECRETARY POMPEO: Maria, it's great to be with you this morning on this important topic.QUESTION: So I want to start with the U.S. sanctioning the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corporation and two of its officials for their connection to the human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Tell us about this company, its reach, why these sanctions are important in terms of moving the needle on what's taking place.SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, the risk to the people in that region has been great. I've talked about this. This is the greatest human rights violation of this century to date. And what we have attempted to do is make clear to China, if you want to participate on the world stage, you can't engage in behavior like this. So we've begun to impose sanctions on the individuals and businesses involved in this.The most recent set of sanctions put out by the Department of Treasury will put the businesses operating there on notice they've got to change their behavior, they've got to stop using slave labor, they've got to stop participating in these systems that have been connected to forced sterilizations, forced abortions. These are terrible, terrible things that are taking place there, and we're going to impose real costs on those businesses.This company is involved in the cotton trade and so has deep connectivity to Western businesses, including those in the United States. And we've been very clear: We've told U.S. businesses to take a real, deep look into their supply chains. I don't think companies some brand names here in America want to be connected to what's taking place there.QUESTION: Well, we mentioned the NBA. We were showing video as you were talking. This video was shot in 2018, but it clearly shows the Uyghurs being lined up, blindfolded in some cases, being taken somewhere. Do American companies not understand what has taken place here; for example, the NBA, other companies that want to do a deal? I want to get to Microsoft wanting to acquire TikTok in a moment. But do you think corporations are getting the national security issues that you have laid out over the last couple of years?SECRETARY POMPEO: Maria, I think they are starting to become more aware of it, to be awakened to the challenges this presents to their brand, to their company, to their supply chain. I think they're starting to see that.But as we've discussed before, I think all across the world for an awful long time we didn't recognize the threats posed to freedom, the authoritarian nature of the regime there, and so we we let things go on that we shouldn't. I am very hopeful these businesses will evaluate what's going on and then make the right decisions for their businesses. I am confident that they will.QUESTION: We have news this morning that Microsoft has put on pause its plans to acquire TikTok, the U.S. operations of this video-sharing app. Peter Navarro was with us last week on this program. Here's what he said about TikTok. I've got get your take on this very popular app for young people. Here's Peter Navarro:"What the American people have to understand is all the data that goes into those mobile apps that kids have so much fun with and seem so convenient, it goes right to servers in China, right to the Chinese military, the Chinese Communist Party, and the agencies which want to steal our intellectual property. Those apps can be used to steal personal and financial information, for blackmail and extortion. They can used to steal business intellectual property and proprietary secrets."What happened with TikTok, Secretary?SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, here's what I hope that the American people will come to recognize: These Chinese software companies doing business in the United States, whether it's TikTok or WeChat there are countless more as Peter Navarro said, are feeding data directly to the Chinese Communist Party, their national security apparatus. It could be their facial recognition pattern. It could be information about their residence, their phone numbers, their friends, who they're connected to. Those are the issues that President Trump has made clear we're going to take care of. These are true national security issues. They are true privacy issues for the American people.And for a long time, a long time, the United States just said, well goodness, if we're having fun with it or if a company can make money off of it, we're going to permit that to happen. President Trump has said enough and we're going to fix it. And so he will take action in the coming days with respect to a broad array of national security risks that are presented by software connected to the Chinese Communist Party.QUESTION: I mean, even if Microsoft were to acquire the U.S. assets of TikTok, can you really believe that China's surveillance is gone from U.S. operations of TikTok?SECRETARY POMPEO: Maria, I promise you, the President, when he makes his decision, will make sure that everything we have done drives us as close to zero risk for the American people. That's the mission set that he laid out for all of us when we get we began to evaluate this now several months back. We're closing in on a solution, and I think you'll see the President's announcement shortly.QUESTION: Secretary, I want to ask you about FBI Director Christopher Wray speaking to the Senate Intel Committee in the last week, and he warned about China's increased capability to interfere in U.S. elections, saying that these were classified hearings at the Senate Intel Committee to this week saying that China has developed an ability to interfere with local elections and target members of Congress to influence China policy. What can you tell us?SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, Maria, I don't want to say much more than you just described there. The rest of the information is classified. But make no mistake about it I talked about this back in February to the National Governors Association the Chinese Communist Party and you saw this with our closure of the consulate in Houston is running espionage operations inside the United States and attempting deep-influence targeting of American business leaders, of American congressmen, of city council members. We saw it happen up to a state senator in Wisconsin.This is a deep effort to conduct influence operations to undermine American democracy and put our nation at risk. This administration, President Trump for the first time has said this is enough of this, we're going to fix this, and has given us all the guidance. And you've seen us act on it, whether it was what we did to the consulate with Houston; you saw the FBI indict several PLA members who were studying here in the United States engaged in activity that was clearly unlawful. We're taking seriously this threat. We're going to protect the American people from these Chinese influence operations.QUESTION: Well, I mean, this week Dianne Feinstein praised China as a respectable nation, she said. Why do some in Congress not say the same thing that you've been saying, that this administration has been communicating? There doesn't seem to be an all-out agreement within the Congress on this?SECRETARY POMPEO: Maria, I saw the statement from Senator Feinstein. I found it perplexing. I saw statements from senior American CEOs of the big tech companies this week say they hadn't heard or seen about intellectual property theft in the United States. That's crazy talk.Here's the good news. The good news is we are getting nearly every member of Congress aligned along the administration's policies on China. When we voted about Hong Kong freedom, there were over 400 votes in the House and nearly every vote in the Senate; the same with respect to what's taking place in western China, the human rights violations.I think the tide is turning. I think not only here in the United States but all across the world the threat from the Chinese Communist Party is becoming clearer and clearer, and nations that are likeminded all across the world are beginning to come together to rebalance, to push back against this, to protect our freedom and democracy.I talked at the Nixon Library about this being a battle not between the United States and China but between authoritarianism and freedom. That's the fight the world needs to be engaged in, and I hope we get every member of Congress onboard on the side of the freedom.QUESTION: I mean, I was particularly struck by Dianne Feinstein, because didn't she have a driver for 20 years that we ended up finding out was a Chinese spy?SECRETARY POMPEO: We did. You'll recall she meets with some frequency with Foreign Minister Zarif there, too. There's something not quite right.QUESTION: Mm-hmm.SECRETARY POMPEO: I mean, and this is notQUESTION: Well, we'll certainly keep watching that. Yes.SECRETARY POMPEO: This is not consistent with America's national security in either case. These are adversaries that intend harm for the citizens of her state of California, and I wish that she would not engage in this kind of rhetoric and these kind of meetings that undermine Americans' efforts.QUESTION: Yeah, there seems to be a new angle here, and that is the Chinese communist government trying to compromise certain Democrat members of Congress who are against President Trump. We'll keep watching that.I want to ask you about how China is using the new security law and what has taken place in Hong Kong now, Secretary, because Hong Kong is now delaying election its election for a year. They're talking about COVID-19 being the issue. Your reaction.SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, COVID-19 is not the reason for the delay in the election. The reason for the delay there was scheduled to be an election in Hong Kong on September 6th. The reason for the delay is that the Chinese Communist Party candidates would be crushed, and the freedom-loving people of Hong Kong would prevail, and the leadership in Beijing simply can't permit that to happen.Look, this is part of what we're seeing happen all across the threat from the Chinese Communist Party: increased denial of freedom for people in their own country; and then extending that now to people outside of their country. That national security law can be applied to people all across the world. It has extraterritorial provisions in it saying that someone who so much as speaks against freedom in Hong Kong[1] has violated the national security law and is under threat from the Chinese Communist Party. This is a new and increased scope, and it's the kind of thing we've seen as the direction of travel from the Chinese Communist Party under General Secretary Xi.QUESTION: So, I mean, do you expect an election ever in Hong Kong? I mean, in that speech you referred to at the Nixon Library, you said that we are seeing the tide turn. I mean, you just said that a lot of our allies understand the threat. Do you believe the U.S. has alliances here? I mean, we know that India has banned those 59 apps. We know that the UK has come around in terms of not using Huawei for its 5G. We know what's happened in the South China Sea. What about Western Europe? What about Spain and Germany and Italy? Do you feel you've got the support from the rest of the world?SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, it's better than it was six months and increasing. I think the whole world sees this. It's not because America asks these countries to engage in activity that pushes back against the Chinese Communist Party that they ought to do it. They ought to do it because it's in their nation's sovereign best interest to do so. And we're seeing it, whether it's in the Czech Republic or in Malaysia, in Vietnam.QUESTION: Right.SECRETARY POMPEO: All across the world countries are coming to understand the challenges that the Chinese Communist Party presents and that the United States will be there, that the United States will be there to lead this push to ensure that the next century remains a free and democratic century, not one that is governed by the rules of the road laid down by this communist regime.QUESTION: Secretary, I want to move on to Iran because now we understand that Beijing is set to be in the final stages of approving a $400 billion economic and security deal with Tehran. In addition to the massive infrastructure investments, Forbes is reporting that this agreement is closer cooperation on defense and intelligence sharing. What are the implications, Secretary?SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, it shouldn't surprise you that regimes that don't respect freedom at home and foment national security problems abroad would want to join hands. We will be sure to enforce all the provisions we have, all the sanctions we have on the Islamic Republic of Iran, applied to the Chinese Communist Party and their businesses and state-owned enterprises as well.And I think countries in the Middle East should see this for what it is as well. China's entry into Iran will destabilize the Middle East. It'll put Israel at risk. It'll put the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Emirates at risk as well. Iran remains the world's largest state sponsor of terror, and to have access to weapons systems and commerce and money flowing from the Chinese Communist Party only compounds that risk for that region.QUESTION: Should we expect new sanctions against Iran?SECRETARY POMPEO: So we filed some new sanctions just this Friday. We expanded their sanctions on their metals programs. And then in October we have a significant provision of the JCPOA that expires, the first major provision to expire. It'll allow the Chinese and the Russians to sell weapons systems to Iran and then allow Iran to sell those weapons systems and other arms around the world as well.The United States has been working since 2018 to try and stop this provision from expiring and in the United Nations in just the next handful of days will present a Security Council resolution aimed at doing just that. I hope the whole world can understand that allowing Iran to buy and sell weapons is really, really dangerous.QUESTION: Yes, of course. Secretary, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks very much for being here.SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, Maria. Thank you.[1] It has extraterritorial provisions in it saying that someone who so much as speaks against the denial of freedom in Hong Kong has violated the national security law and is under threat from the Chinese Communist Party.Load-Date: August 2, 2020End of Document

China on Friday introduced export restrictions on artificial intelligence technology, including the type that TikTok uses to choose which videos to spool up to its users. That means TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, would have to obtain a license to export any restricted technologies to a foreign company. The Trump administration has threatened to ban TikTok and ordered ByteDance to sell it, claiming national security risks. TikTok denies it is a national security risk and is suing to stop the administration from the threatened ban. Prospective buyers for U.S. TikTok assets include Microsoft and Walmart and, reportedly, Oracle.___Amazon wins FAA approval to deliver packages by droneNEW YORK (AP) — Getting an Amazon package delivered from the sky is closer to becoming a reality. The Federal Aviation Administration said Monday it has granted Amazon approval to deliver packages by drones. Amazon says the approval is an important step, but added that it is still testing and flying the drones. It did not say when it expected drones to make deliveries to shoppers. The FAA said Amazon is the third drone delivery service to win flight approval. Delivery company UPS and a company owned by search giant Google won approval last year.___Delta, American join United in dropping most US change feesATLANTA (AP) — Delta and American are following the example set by United Airlines and saying they will drop an unpopular $200 fee on customers who change a ticket for travel within the United States. The moves come as airlines try desperately to lure people back to flying. Although air travel has recovered slightly since April, it is still down sharply. Normally in summer, 2 million or more people pass through security checkpoints at U.S. airports each day. That number hasn’t been above 900,000 since the early days of the pandemic in mid-March. But in dropping change fees, airlines are abandoning a lucrative extra.___Stocks end a bumpy day mostly lower, still notch August gainNEW YORK (AP) — Stocks ended mostly lower on Wall Street Monday as the market gave back some of its recent gains following a five-week winning streak. The S&P 500 lost 0.2% as declines in banks and industrial stocks offset more gains for technology companies. It still managed to end August up 7%, its fifth monthly gain in a row and its biggest since April. It was the first day of trading after stock splits for Apple and Tesla, and also the first day for a revamped Dow Jones Industrial Average. Saleforce.com, Honeywell and Amgen have joined the blue chip club. Treasury yields fell.___Zoom rides pandemic to another quarter of explosive growthSAN RAMON, Calif. (AP) — Zoom’s videoconferencing service is deepening its integral role in life during the pandemic as thousands more businesses and other users pay for subscriptions to get more control over their virtual meetings. The surge in paying customers enabled Zoom to hail another quarter of astounding growth in a report released Monday. The company’s revenue for the May-July period more than quadrupled from the same time last year to $663.5 million while its profit soared too. Zoom also forecast its revenue for the rest of the year will be much higher than expected, sending its already lofty stock price to new highs after the results came out.___Pandemic tests shopper loyalty for clothing brandsNEW YORK (AP) — A slew of once-beloved brands from Lord & Taylor to Ann Taylor have filed for Chapter 11 since the pandemic. Many shoppers will see these iconic labels vanish or become mere shadows of themselves as they drastically shrink their businesses or get acquired. But while loyal customers bemoan their loss, the brands themselves have been clearly losing favor for years. Even before the pandemic, shoppers faced an abundance of choices online and were becoming less loyal to clothing labels. Now they pay close attention to not just fit and style but quick deliveries, curbside pickup and an overall better online experience.___Survey: China manufacturing logs feeble growth in AugustBEIJING (AP) — A survey shows China’s manufacturing activity held steady in August while domestic demand helped to offset weaker sales in exports markets that are struggling with the coronavirus pandemic. The monthly purchasing managers’ index released by the Chinese statistics agency and an industry group declined to 51 from July’s 51.1 on a 100-point scale on which numbers above 50 indicate activity increasing.___Administration: 70% of relief payments to the dead recoveredWASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration says that it has recovered nearly 70% of the relief payments that went to dead people. The Government Accountability Office said Monday that it had been told by the Treasury Department that it had recovered nearly 70% of the $1.6 billion in relief payments that had mistakenly gone to dead people. The economic stimulus payments included payments of $1,200 for individuals who had income levels low enough to qualify and were were part of a $2.6 trillion bailout package lawmakers passed in March.___The S&P 500 fell 7.70 points, or 0.2%, to 3,500.31.

Chinese tech companies could face trouble in EuropePolitico.comAugust 8, 2020 Saturday 3:17 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1456 wordsHighlight: After Huawei, all eyes are on TikTok. But security hawks are also looking at other Chinese tech firms.BodyHuawei. TikTok. Who's next?The United States government this week launched a new phase in its campaign to push back on Chinese technology firms, announcing efforts to block cloud and software companies from China from thriving in the West.The move was flanked by a decision Thursday to block business dealings with social media company TikTok and chat app WeChat and follows a two-year-long diplomatic campaign against telecom giant Huawei, as officials warned repeatedly that these firms don't play by Western rules, particularly when it comes to snooping and data protection.And there's more coming.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is scheduled to visit Central Europe next week, signaled Washington's plans to use its trade and export tools against a broader range of Chinese technology firms. Those efforts will likely spill over into Europe, where privacy concerns, human rights woes, security and trade interests are advancing political pushback against Chinese tech.POLITICO lists the likely targets in China's technology sector that are drawing the attention of security authorities, data protection groups, trade officials and China hawks alike.TikTok is owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance and has a sister application in China called Douyin. The app has become immensely popular with young people worldwide: It was the most downloaded app in the first three months of 2020.What's the fuss: U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order Thursday banning "transactions" with ByteDance, alleging the company shares user data with the Chinese state. ByteDance denies the allegations, saying its user data is stored in the U.S. and Singapore. It said it will build a new data center in Ireland. It is now mulling a sale of a chunk of its business to Microsoft to avoid the ban.Between the lines: Like most advertising-funded social media platforms, TikTok collects a lot of user data, raising privacy concerns. The platform's young clientele is an added cause for concern.What Europe thinks: Calls for a ban have so far not been echoed in Europe, even in capitals that have taken tough stances against Huawei. Europe's grouping of privacy regulators set up a task force to look into TikTok earlier this year, and several national watchdogs are also investigating the app.The new Irish data center could shake up ongoing privacy probes in Europe, which could be entrusted to the Irish Data Protection Commission.WeChat, owned by Tencent, is sometimes called a "super app," offering messaging, social media and payment functionalities to its users. It's relatively small outside China.What's the fuss: Trump issued an executive order against WeChat, similar to the one on TikTok, barring "transactions" with the company. Pompeo said earlier on Fox News that the app was "feeding data directly to the Chinese Communist Party."Between the lines: WeChat would have access to large amounts of personal data from its individual users. A recent report by the Toronto-based digital rights research organization Citizen Lab also showed the app used its international users' posts to train its domestic version to better censor the Chinese internet.What Europe thinks: Privacy and human rights concerns could play well with European digital rights groups and politicians.Alibaba is China's dominant e-commerce and cloud company. The firm has data centers in China, the U.S., Germany and the U.K., among other countries.What's the fuss: Founder Jack Ma met Trump days before he took office as president in 2017, and promised to create 1 million jobs in the U.S. Relations have soured since but Alibaba's name had remained largely absent from the U.S. onslaught against Chinese tech giants. That changed this week, when Pompeo announced plans to create "Clean Cloud," which would bar Alibaba from getting access to U.S. citizens' personal data and companies' corporate data.Another concern goes back to last year, when the city of Hangzhou said it would embed state officials at tech companies including Alibaba - blurring the lines between the company and the state.What Europe thinks: Alibaba's cloud services arm has data centers in Europe and caters to the Continent's companies, like Dutch electronics firm Philips. But Europe also wants to move away from foreign cloud providers.Alibaba has also faced harsh criticism from European consumer groups, who warn that the company's e-commerce platform floods the European market with illegal and dangerous items.Founded in 1997 by the son of former Chinese leader Hu Jintao, Nuctech is a state-owned manufacturer of X-ray machines, scanners and explosive detection systems.What's the fuss: Nuctech is owned by an industrial conglomerate that also works in China's nuclear sector, raising security concerns. Also, the EU put anti-dumping duties on the company's cargo scanning equipment a decade ago. But in recent years it has found success in selling security gear to European airports."It's extremely worrisome if a foreign state-funded company gets more and more control over our strategic infrastructure," German conservative MEP Axel Voss told POLITICO previously about Nuctech's success in Europe.Between the lines: One worry is that the gear could be used as a transmitter of malicious software. Another is that Nuctech equipment could cause disruption at Europe's airports and borders if it were to be misused by foreign actors.The case of Nuctech also poses tough questions for Europe's competition authorities, who have trouble protecting the European market from Chinese companies that undercut the prices of European players.DJI is a private drone-manufacturing company based in Shenzhen. It's the biggest beneficiary of the explosion in the world's drone market, securing a 74 percent share, according to 2018 estimates.What's the fuss: The U.S. government has moved away from using DJI drones in recent years. Security officials fear the data gathered through the drones could include detailed imagery of critical infrastructure, military hardware, frontiers or nuclear sites. DJI officials rushed to assuage concerns, insisting it has access to "essentially none" of the data its drones produce.Between the lines: The main problem is that DJI's non-Chinese alternatives are considered up to 10 times as expensive - a hard pill to swallow for public authorities procuring gear.What Europe thinks: National and local governments across the bloc are using DJI drones for surveillance and inspection purposes, as POLITICO has reported. Government authorities have largely dismissed concerns by arguing the drones are only used for non-sensitive work, but both German and French militaries as well as British police use their drones.Video surveillance company Hikvision is a market leader in providing closed-circuit television and surveillance systems to public authorities across the world. Its controlling shareholder is a state-owned defense conglomerate.What's the fuss: The U.S. in 2018 barred the company from providing equipment to the federal government. In October 2019, it also added the company to the export controls "entity list" due to its work with public authorities in Xinjiang, where the government is accused of persecuting the Uighurs, a Muslim ethnic group.What Europe thinks: The company has subsidiaries in a number of European countries. It has had success selling to British authorities, in particular, despite calls from national politicians to investigate the company.At the heart of political concerns around Chinese tech is a cocktail of trade worries, human rights woes, security interests and data protection considerations - as both the U.S. and Europe seek to rebalance diplomatic relations with Beijing.One concern China's tech companies face is the country's domestic intelligence and security legislation, which "obliges" companies to "assist and cooperate" state intelligence services. Another is that Chinese security services could more easily hack and manipulate software and hardware from domestic firms, as the EU grows "more suspicious" of Chinese cyber espionage campaigns.Governments also fear that European champions might get outcompeted by China's growing companies. And Chinese tech companies have come under scrutiny for their role in supporting the Beijing government's detention of Uighur Muslims in the Xinjiang province and the crackdown on protests in Hong Kong.Critics of the campaign against China's tech firms have pointed out these risks aren't limited to Chinese products: Many Western firms have China-based manufacturing plants and deep commercial ties with Chinese manufacturers. In Europe, critics also point to the U.S.'s own mass surveillance schemes exposed by whistleblower Edward Snowden years ago.Load-Date: August 9, 2020End of Document

Microsoft seeks deal for TikTok global businessCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 7, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 492 wordsBodyMicrosoft pursues an agreement to buy TikTok's global business, including viral video application operations in India and Europe, according to five people with knowledge of the conversations.m{947345}The U.S. software firm said last Sunday that it is in negotiations with ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok, to explore "a purchase of the service in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand".Since then, Microsoft has also pursued a plan that will include all the countries where TikTok operates, and that agreement will not extend to its sister douyin app, which is headed to China, where it does not operate the short video app.Meanwhile, Microsoft executives have tried to calm the Chinese government, as it tries to avoid getting caught in a crossfire between Beijing and Washington, two of the people said. A person close to Microsoft rejected the suggestion that the American technology group is discussing asset exchange in China as part of an agreement.The change since Sunday underscores how preliminary the talks between the two sides remain as they rush to meet the mid-September deadline to reach an agreement and prevent TikTok from being banned in the US.m{947346}A person close to ByteDance's operations in the Asia-Pacific region suggested that Microsoft was drawn to the idea of buying the entire TikTok global business by the difficulty of separating administrative functions and ensuring that TikTok users in one country can continue to use the app if they traveled to another.On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump said it was "probably easier to buy everything than to buy 30 percent." He also stated that whoever buys TikTok will pay a "substantial" fee to the US Treasury.Even adding the whole business to any agreement doesn't solve the huge challenge of untangling ByteDance's TikTok technology; it was previously already working on separating data and algorithms between China and the rest of the world before the talks began, employees said.Microsoft discussed adding an agreement where that it would have a year to separate TikTok from its Chinese matrix and address the U.S. government's concerns about the security of the data generated by the application.m{947347}ByteDance and Microsoft did not want to comment.AND BESIDES,TRUMP SIGNS VETO TO COMPANYU.S. President Donald Trump yesterday signed an executive order banning any transaction or business with Chinese developers of TikTok and WeChat, starting 45 days. Trump had threatened with a September 15 deadline to "close" the platform unless Microsoft or "someone else" bought it. Tencent, owner of TikTok, Microsoft and WeChat, had no immediate answers to the queries. In addition, the US Senate approved a bill presented by Sen. Josh Hawley that prohibits federal employees from using the short video app on government-owned devices.With information from: Arash Massoudi, Stephanie Findlay, Primrose Riordan, James Fontanella-Khan, Yuan Yang and Richard Waters.Load-Date: August 8, 2020End of Document

TikTok Sues Trump Administration Over App BanCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 25, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 461 wordsBody       TikTok, a popular Chinese video-sharing mobile app that is being banned by U.S President Donald Trump, has filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging the Administration's decision. It was on August 6 that Trump signed the Executive Order to ban TikTok, along with another Chinese firm WeChat, citing a threat to national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. In a blog post, the company owned by China's ByteDance Ltd. said it strongly disagrees with the Administration's position that TikTok is a national security threat. According to the firm, 100 million Americans turn to TikTok at present for entertainment, inspiration, and connection, and it has more than 1,500 employees across the country. The company has also planned 10,000 more jobs in California, Texas, New York, Tennessee, Florida, Michigan, Illinois, and Washington State. Announcing the lawsuit filing, TikTok said, "The Executive Order issued by the Administration on August 6, 2020 has the potential to strip the rights of that community without any evidence to justify such an extreme action, and without any due process." In its order, the U.S. government had said its decision cites the speculative possibility that the application could be manipulated by the Chinese government. In response, TikTok in its complaint noted its extraordinary measures to protect the privacy and security of TikTok's U.S. user data. TikTok said it stores such data outside of China, on servers located in the United States and Singapore, and has erected software barriers that help ensure that TikTok stores its U.S. user data separately from the user data of other ByteDance products. Further, its key personnel, including CEO, Global Chief Security Officer, and General Counsel, are all Americans based in the United States, and therefore are not subject to Chinese law.  In its complaint, the company alleged that the Administration ignored its extensive efforts to address concerns. TikTok also said the Executive Order is a misuse of International Emergency Economic Powers Act or IEEPA as it authorizes the prohibition of activities that have not been found to be "an unusual and extraordinary threat." "By banning TikTok with no notice or opportunity to be heard (whether before or after the fact), the executive order violates the due process protections of the Fifth Amendment," the company stated. The company said it does not take suing the government lightly, but has no other choice to protect its rights, and the rights of its community and employees.   As per the order, TikTok will get 45 days before the ban comes in to effect. Meanwhile, there are reports that major U.S. tech firms Microsoft, Twitter and Oracle are in the race to buy TikTok's U.S operations.        Load-Date: August 26, 2020End of Document

Trump changes his mind about Xi Jinping for covid-19: "I liked him, but now I don't feel that way"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 11, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 326 wordsBodyUS President Donald Trump said tuesday to have changed his mind about his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, and regretted that his "great" relationship with the Asian giant's leader has deteriorated."I had a great relationship with President Xi," Trump said during an interview with Fox Sports radio station. "I liked him, but now I don't feel like this anymore," said the tycoon, who blames the switch to the coronavirus pandemic.In this regard, the US representative has stated that he "has not spoken to him for a long time" and insisted that he has not liked the attitude of the Chinese authorities or "what has happened" since the first outbreak was detected in The City of Wuhan at the end of 2019."What has happened since Wuhan is worse than the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing""The world stood up, what has happened is a disgrace," he said before suggesting that the consequences of the pandemic are worse than the trade dispute between Beijing and Washington.Relations between the two countries have been characterized by increased tension since Trump arrived at the White House, at first due to trade and intellectual property disputes, and subsequently by the pandemic.China and the US are experiencing constant war on several frontsThe Trump Administration has repeatedly accused the Chinese government of 'hacking' reports on vaccine development and has indicated that the virus may have "escaped" from a Chinese lab. In addition, it has requested to open an independent investigation into the origin of the coronavirus.Washington has also imposed sanctions against China in response to the passage of the Hong Kong National Security Act, which the U.S. government says undermines the region's autonomy. Countries also have disputes over other issues, such as China's expansion in the South China Sea, the development of 5G technology, and the Uighur situation in Xinjiang.commentsforum0WhatsApp  Facebook  Twitter  Linkedin       Load-Date: August 12, 2020End of Document

Donald Trump announced he will ban Tik Tok social network in U.S.CE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 1, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 628 wordsBodyU.S. President Donald Trump announced Friday that he will ban the TikTok social network in the United States, after the country's authorities were concerned that the platform would be used by China's intelligence.The Trump administration believes that the popular short-video app - estimated to have 1 billion users - can be used as an espionage tool by Beijing, something that Bytedance, the company that owns the app, denies.Speaking to reporters on the presidential Air Force One plane, Trump said, "As far as TikTok is concerned, we're going to ban it in the United States."The announcement comes the same week Trump received an update on the national security risks posed by the social network. The presentation was made by the Foreign Investment Committee in the United States (CFIUS), a treasury-chaired panel dealing with the companies and acquisitions affecting this issue."TikTok is under review by the CFIUS and we will make a recommendation to the president this week," U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. "We have a lot of alternatives," he added. Trump, for his part, had said his administration was "looking" at the social network and "thinking about making a decision."Concerns about this transcend political polarization in the United States. On Thursday, two senators - one Democrat and one Republican - called on the Justice Department (DOJ) to conduct an investigation similar to that of the CFIUS, which also included the Zoom video calling platform."We believe it is imperative that doJ investigate and determine whether Business Relations, Data Management Practices, and Operational Connections with China of Zoom and TikTok pose a risk to Americans," wrote Richard Blumenthal (Democrat - Connecticut) and Josh Hawley (Republican- Missouri).Lawmakers said in turn that companies seek to relativize the magnitude of their ties with China. "Based on numerous reports, we are extremely concerned that Zoom and TikTok have disclosed private information about the Americans to the (People's Republic of China) and participated in censorship on behalf of the Chinese government," Deputy Attorney General John Demers said in the letter.In parallel, another bill seeks to make it illegal for federal employees to use the app on government devices.Fox Business reporter Charles Gasparino reported on Friday that, in the event that Bytedance actually sells Tik Tok's operations in the United States, Microsoft would be interested in acquiring them.Tik Tok, for his part, has sought to distance himself from the fact that he is owned by a Chinese company. With respect to the security of user data, it has ensured that it is stored in the United States, and that users have a backing in Singapore.In a blog post, Tik Tok Executive Chairman Kevin Mayer said: "We are not politicians, we do not accept political publicity and we do not have an agenda; our only goal is to remain a vibrant and dynamic platform for everyone to enjoy."The United States is not the first country to act on its concerns of this nature. At the end of June, and after recording a series of clashes with China on a diffusely delimited border, India banned implementation - as well as 59 other Chinese applications - claiming that they are involved in activities "damaging to India's sovereignty and integrity, Indian defense, state security and public order."Most of the applications were pointed out by the agencies ofIndian intelligence in the face of concern that they were collecting user data and possibly also sending it outside the country's borders.Learn more about this topic:U.S. senators asked Justice Department to investigate zoom and TikTok's ties to China threaten national securityAmid tensions with China, India banned TikTok and WeChat over security concernsLoad-Date: August 2, 2020End of Document

Both American and United are higher in pre-market trading, Dagen.And those are your headlines.MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Cheryl, we'll see you at the bottom of the hour.Joining the conversation, meantime, all morning long, Lee Carter and Cabot Phillips. We'll hear from you in just moments.Right now it's time for the "word on Wall Street."Joining me now, Bulltick Capital Markets head of global research, Kathryn Rooney Vera, Michael Lee Strategy's Michael Lee, and the Bahnsen Group's CEO and managing partner David Bahnsen.Futures are pointing to gains ahead of the last trading day of the month. The Dow finishing its best August in more than 30 years as markets bounce back from the coronavirus pandemic. That gauge seeing a 57 percent rise since March.David, your take on these markets right here, right now?DAVID BAHNSEN, CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER, THE BAHNSEN GROUP: Well, it's certainly been a very robust August and I think that what you have to see next is that leadership democratized. You need a broader penetration, get past just the big tech and see it move into other sectors.It started to do so, but that gap between those five companies and the other 495 is still too big. We want to see that come in a bit and we think that it will. We think the financials are deeply undervalued. Energy, same story. And you're going to see continued market strength with a lot of Fed support and recovery out of these lows of the Covid moment.MCDOWELL: Turning to TikTok. A deal to sell the apps' U.S. division reportedly stalling over new Chinese restrictions on exporting artificial intelligence, or AI. TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in talks with companies, including Microsoft and Walmart and Oracle. The Trump administration set a mid-September deadline for the deal.Mike, is this a hurdle that can't be overcome? What do you say?MICHAEL LEE, MICHAEL LEE STRATEGY: You know, Dagen, the irony here should be lost on no one that the Chinese Communist Party is worried about proprietary technology being exported. It's important to remember the gentleman last week at the Republican National Convention said that the Chinese Communist Party is not just the enemy of America, it's the enemy of humanity. And this -- the reason we're in this situation is TikTok is essentially a spyware app on teens and preteens as the Chinese Communist Party seems to -- seeks to become the Saudi Arabia of data.So I think this story has got lots of twists and turns and it may be -- end up being banned here in the U.S. I think China is a little bit worried that once the U.S. gets our hands on it, they'll do an accurate damage assessment to see just how much they've exported from there. So I think there's going to be daily news coming of out, this leading up to September 15th.MCDOWELL: Well, Michael, that's the issue is how do you -- how do you separate China and the communist government and a Chinese-based company and, you know, cut off the U.S. division? How do you separate the data, the code, and then the people? How do you really protect the asset that you're buying, so-to-speak, and protect the users in the future?LEE: Yes, I'm not -- I'm not hopeful for a -- for a deal to get done. Like, if TikTok goes away, I mean, it's a nice little business. It's cool for the young kids to play with this and it's funny to see those little videos, but if it just didn't exist tomorrow, would anybody's life be seriously set back? No. I mean this is just antics on the side. It's a nice revenue opportunity for either Oracle or Microsoft or whoever gets their hands on it. But, in the end, national security and putting a hard line in front of the Chinese Communist Party, in my mind, is much more significant.MCDOWELL: The August jobs report is due out on Friday. The estimate right now is pointing to a job creation of 1.4 million jobs during the month of August. The unemployment rate falling to 9.8 percent.Katherine, what are your expectations for Friday and please explain the disconnect between markets and an economy that we haven't even recovered half the jobs lost in February, March and April.KATHRYN ROONEY VERA, HEAD OF GLOBAL RESEARCH, BULLTICK CAPITAL MARKETS: Well, the disconnect can be explained, Dagen, by the aggressive hand of the federal government and the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve is effectively propping up the markets and moving them to record highs while we have 20 million people unemployed. And 30 million people, there's a disconnect between unemployed people and those who are collecting unemployment benefits because the unemployment benefits have been made far more generous and the requirements to attain them have been loosened.So I expect a moderation, Dagen, this month. I expect less than market consensus. So between 1 and 1.4 million, which, of course, would be less than the previous month. We are on track to drop the unemployment rate, but it's still going to be in double digits. So this is a spectacular phenomenon where you have the -- as one of your other guests said, the five biggest companies really smashing records in terms of new wealth created.And let's not -- let's not forget, Dagen, it's public information what the Fed is buying. The Fed is actually subsidizing the national champions. This reminds me, as an emerging markets strategist in my -- in my history, of an emerging markets country. You have the BNDES in Brazil which does effectively exactly the same thing. So I think it's to the detriment of small and medium enterprises where the government is effectively crowding out the private sector.MCDOWELL: It's really incredible. And small businesses have gotten virtually no help from anyone. And particularly in -- not to bring it back to these cities that are in flames, but these businesses are just being destroyed. And who's going to help them.VERA: They're being walloped.MCDOWELL: Right.VERA: Absolutely.MCDOWELL: Who's going to help them recover?Katheryn, great to see you --VERA: Thank you, Dagen.MCDOWELL: Along with Michael Lee and David Bahnsen, Katheryn Rooney Vera. Great to see all three of you.Much more ahead this morning.

Ratcliffe saying that the leaks are meant to portray Russia as a greater threat than China. Congressional Democrats say the move is meant to downplay Russia's involve in the 2020 election. Ratcliffe defending his decision to Maria Bartiromo in an exclusive interview yesterday on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES."(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX HOST, "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES": Tell us why you're making this change to change the way you brief Congress on security matters.JOHN RATCLIFFE, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: I reiterated to Congress, look, I'm going to keep you fully and currently informed as required by the law, but I also said, we're not going to do a repeat of what happened a month ago, when I did more than what was required at the request of Congress to brief not just the Oversight Committees but every member of Congress. When I did that, Maria, I said, my only condition is that you treat this information with the respect that it deserves and you keep it private. And yet, within minutes of that -- one of those briefings ending, a number of members of Congress went to a number of different publications and leaked classified information.We've had a pandemic of information being leaked out of the intelligence community and I'm going to take the measures to make sure that that stops.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Joining me now, Ohio congressman, House Intelligence and House Ways and Means Committee member, Brad Wenstrup.Congressman, what do you make of this? It's surely going to become a lightning rod for criticism from the Democrats.REP. BRAD WENSTRUP (R-OH): Well, it probably will be a lightning rod for them. But the real lightning rod is what they have been doing for the last several years. Keep in mind that Director Ratcliffe was on the Intelligence Committee and he knows firsthand how we would have classified briefings and apparently members of the other party were leaking. Someone was leaking on a routine basis. Sometimes while we were even still in hearings. So he's very familiar with the behavior that has taken place.And I look at situations where even last week "The New York Times" was calling me, asking me about something that happened during a classified briefing. And we always tell them, we don't talk about anything that happened in a classified setting.You know, former acting Director Grenell has stated that former staffers, people that worked for both sides of the aisle as far as administrations had told him, don't go to The Hill if you don't have to because they're going to misconstrue things that you said and leak it.I remember going to a CNN reporter two or three years ago during all the Russian collusion narrative and I said, you know, if you really want to be an American patriot, you might reveal who's doing the leaking. And he just grind and said, oh, I can't do that, and walked away.You know, we're the committee that's supposed to be seen and never heard from. And that goes throughout Congress if you're in a classified setting. And what has been taking place over the last few years is really despicable and it's really made a shambles out of the Intelligence Committee in Congress and it's got to stop.And I think that the director made a good decision. They can't say that they're not being informed. But they can't just run out to the swath of reporters that are sitting outside of briefings and go ahead and reveal information that they shouldn't be talking about.MCDOWELL: Lee Carter, jump in here.LEE CARTER, POLLSTER AND PRESIDENT, MASLANSY AND PARTNERS: Well, I -- the thing that I'm really curious about is how do you navigate the -- I mean, obviously, putting things in writing is going to be very, very important. But everything that we talk about, everything that's said is misconstrued and we -- how do you define your own narrative for yourself when it's constantly being twisted?WENSTRUP: Well, it's very difficult because at the same time that someone is doing that, twisting the narrative and going out and making it public, we're respecting what -- we're respecting the oath that we took, a signed oath that we took, as a matter of fact. So it does make it challenging. And I think that it becomes very important for Director Ratcliffe to take an action like this and let the country know why he is taking it because the American people need to know that, one, not only are these people that aren't -- that these are people that aren't adhering to their oath, but they are misrepresenting an people need to be aware of that misrepresentation and keep that in mind when they hear certain things that are coming out through leaks.MCDOWELL: The stimulus stalemate, let's talk about that, Congressman. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows blaming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for stalling negotiations for the next round of Covid-19 relief.Is there any way, ever, that the Democrats get on-board with stimulus and more rescue money this close to an election?WENSTRUP: I don't think they -- I don't think Speaker Pelosi wants to do anything that would make the president look good and make the president look like he's reacting to what the American people need, which is what he has been doing and is doing. And same with the Senate. And so she has stalled. We have not been engaged with conversations as far as the House of Representatives go. Republicans have been shut out. And as far as I know, most of the Democrats have too. It seems to me that Nancy Pelosi and -- and her staff have written any bills that have come forward. And -- from -- from their side.So it is -- it is a stalemate. She plays politics as hard as anyone and puts the American people second. That's what's taking place. We should be addressing the needs of schools as they reopen. We should be addressing reopening and we should be addressing some of the glitches we found in the programs that we did put in place that have helped the American people. And she doesn't seem willing to do that. It's all about the election and it has been for the last couple of years, at least, especially since she took control of the House as speaker and it's a shame because most of us went to Congress to try and take care of the American people and guide our of country in the appropriate fashion.MCDOWELL: She also called you an enemy of the people, so we have that. I'm talking about Republicans, the one in the White House and the ones in Congress.WENSTRUP: Yes. Well, as somebody -- as -- that was one of the most despicable things I've ever heard. You know, what motivated the man who shot at us on the baseball field? Her rhetoric and the rhetoric that had been coming out of the Democrat Party from Bernie Sanders to -- to Joe Biden now and -- and Speaker Pelosi. That drove that man to try and assassinate us that day. And so that -- that statement there by itself is - - is shameful and way beneath the dignity of the office of speaker of the House.MCDOWELL: Congressman Brad Wenstrup, good to see you. Thank you, sir.WENSTRUP: You bet.MCDOWELL: Coming up, a terrifying ride. A toddler airborne. The accident going viral. Oh, it's getting buzz this morning.Plus, get in line. Apple ready to release its newest iPad. We're taking a look straight ahead.MCDOWELL: We're less than two weeks away from the kickoff of the NFL season, but the looming question remains how will the coronavirus affect the game?Cabot, we've seen how the pandemic has impacted the NBA and Major League Baseball. The NFL has had more time to prepare. What do you think?CABOT PHILLIPS, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, CAMPUSREFORM.ORG: Well, the problem is they're not able to do this bubble situation like the NBA did because of the size of their rosters, the prominence of injuries and the season is a lot longer than some of the other seasons with the condensed NBA season, condensed MLB season. There's going to be a much longer season, more opportunity for players to get sick.And you've got to look at what's going to happen if some of these marquee players get sick. On a Sunday morning, if Tom Brady tests positive for the coronavirus, is the NFL going to seriously say, well, we're going to roll the team out there without Tom Brady, maybe on a Sunday night football game. You're going to have -- start to have serious questions there about what they're going to do when some of their marquee players go down and if this is going to be able to last into flu season. The playoffs are scheduled for January and February. What's going to happens if we have a resurgence of the virus there as these players are traveling around more.I love the NFL. I hope it's able to stick around. I hope that, you know, everything goes well, but I'm not entirely optimistic that they're going to make it a full season.MCDOWELL: Yes, with the NBA, I saw -- and this is not about the protests, but a friend of mine posted something on Instagram about how the NBA, oh, they had made this great sacrifice to play basketball and they were putting their lives on the line. I'm like, it's called risk/reward and they get paid to take on that risk. And I was like, maybe you say that about nurses and doctors and healthcare workers or even people who were running registers at grocery stores to make sure we were fed during the height of the pandemic, but not handsomely paid basketball players.I digress.We're looking at more than professional sports. A controversial situation developing in Ohio where high school football is ready to play but the state's top college team, Ohio State, excuse me, The Ohio State University, won't be hitting the field. The Big Ten delaying the season but other college teams in the state are playing.Lee Carter, what do you make of this?CARTER: Listen, I think that it's all so tough to follow. I think that everybody's got such different opinions about what's appropriate and the risk/reward of different things.You know, I -- I feel like schools not playing sports is a really big deal for these kids. This is so much of their life. It's so much of their future. They're all counting on it to happen. I think that we've got to do whatever we can to get the kids back as safely as we can.And when you think about the equipment these kids are wearing, how close are they getting to each other, when you think about football players, or you think about these kinds of things. I think sometimes common sense has to prevail.MCDOWELL: Cabot, final word to you on The Ohio State University and high school ball.PHILLIPS: Well, it's ironic. They -- they're allowing students on campus to play intramural sports, but they're not letting the football team play football. And I think also you've got to look at how a lot of these athletes are actually safer when they're on campus. They're following all sort of health protocols, CDC regulations. If they aren't playing football, they're going to be spending a lot more free time hanging out with their friends, maybe going back home, transmitting the virus there. I think this is a short-sighted move. They're a lot more concerned with liability, which I understand. I just don't think this is a solution to keep them from playing this fall.MCDOWELL: Great talk, fella and lady.Next up, former Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker is here to talk about the ongoing unrest in Kenosha.Plus, the old college try. Students looking for new ways to make money as classes shift to remote learning.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Welcome back. I'm Cheryl Casone. Some headlines making news this morning, '404 error page not found.' That was the message many on the internet and gaming systems got yesterday when service provider CenturyLink went down. Many users were not able to access Amazon, Hulu and Xbox live.Connection issues were not only reported in the U.S. but also across Europe. Service to the sites and apps have since been restored. Well, Hertz already filing bankruptcy reportedly wants to pay the company's CEO and other executives $5.4 million in bonuses. That is after the company paid out more than $16 million in retention bonuses to keep executives from leaving.Hertz raised $29 million through stock sales, only to suspend the sale of the Securities and Exchange Commission risk questions about that deal. There's Hertz in the premarket. A buck 52, its share's up more than half a percent.Well, Apple will reportedly unveil the new Apple watch and iPad in an event in mid-September. Leaked images of what is believed to be the new iPad Air have been circulating on social media for a few days and now MacRumors is reporting that the tech giant registered several versions of the new Apple watch and iPad with the Eurasian Economic Commission.Taking a look at premarket trading ahead of Apple stocks split. Here we go today. It is up by more than three-quarters of a percent but that's like what, today at the opening bell and then there's this dramatic finish to that BMW Championship.Jon Rahm sinks a crazy 66-foot putt at Olympia fields to defeat Dustin Johnson after he made a 45-foot putt that forced a play-off of Rahm's but his longest of the season was good enough to give him his second one of the year. After making that play Rahm said he still can't believe what just happened.And a lot of people that love golf couldn't quite believe it either. Dagen, those are your headlines.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Thank you so much Cheryl. Love that. President Trump planning to visit Kenosha, Wisconsin tomorrow. Wisconsin governor Tony Evers urging the president to reconsider saying this," I'm concerned your presence will only hinder our healing. I am concerned your presence will only delay our work to overcome division and move forward together."Joining me now former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker. Governor, should the president visit and is that a political statement being masked as something that's well heartfelt?SCOTT WALKER (R) FMR GOVERNOR OF WISCONSIN: Well, I think the president should absolutely go to Kenosha, first and foremost because I think people want to thank him. His leadership last week, dramatically changed it back after three nights of violence and sadly two deaths and we finally saw local and state leaders responding to the president's request or his offer I should say for more assistance.But not only that, I think it's really important when you think about so many of the businesses that were boarded up and some that were even burnt down early in the week, I think it's important for the President to hear from those employers and find out what the federal government can do to partner with local leaders there, both elected leaders but more importantly employers to get this great community back up on its feet again and help improve it for everyone. The President can do just that.MCDOWELL: Is it important for the president to meet with Jacob Blake and his family? Is that a possibility?WALKER: Well, I think right now the important thing is Wisconsin has an independent investigation and this is the Kenosha news - newspaper locally that historically endorses Democrats went after the very governor who put that letter out, attacking him for really inflaming the situation until it got to the point where the rioters came and that's because he jumped to a conclusion here.Seeing the video I know many Americans myself included, were disturbed by what we saw but there's a process to look into this. And day after day, as we hear more information that's a process that should be handled by the Wisconsin Department of Justice. That's not something the president should be involved in.He denounced what happened to George Floyd as did the vice president, others, rightfully so. In this case, we need to have all the facts but the community itself needs to heal. Thankfully the president's leadership brought us back to a sense of calm and some peace in terms of ending the rioting, providing the force that was needed to support the local law enforcement.Now the next step is making sure and - and for example Congressman Brian Stiles has been putting this together so it's a perfect time to bring people together, business, community and civic leaders to figure out what do we do next to help Kenosha move forward.And in terms of the unrest and the violence and the just outright mayhem that you've seen in places not just Wisconsin but particularly in Seattle and in Portland, why is it so difficult for these governors and local leaders to understand their basic constitutional, not only right to provide safety but their obligation to protect those people who they govern?It's the tenth amendment of the constitution. Why is this so difficult for people to stand up and do what is - what is in their charge under our constitution?WALKER: What is politics and it's unfortunate because the number one responsibility of the government at any level is to protect the public. Public safety in the truest sense of the word and they're feeling in these communities and unfortunately what we saw early on was a governor who'd first didn't even return the a call from Mark Meadows after he branched out, tried to get help from the federal government.And they reached out and then they finally did but remember, it wasn't till later on Wednesday and I sadly, I think more than anything it was probably because focus groups came back and found out that the president offered to help but the presidential nominee, Joe Biden for the Democrats didn't say anything about the violence until after the three nights of riots after the two sad deaths.You saw the same time the governor, a Democrat; the Attorney General, a Democrat; all put out statements on Wednesday. I have to believe, it was because of focus groups and polls. Donald Trump doesn't need a focus group to stand up and do what's right to protect people be it in Kenosha; in Madison, Wisconsin; in Seattle, Portland; Chicago or anywhere else across the country.What he's saying is just reach out, let us know if you need assistance. It will be there and that's what we expect out of a President, someone who actually doesn't focus on the focus groups but focuses on the safety of the American people.MCDOWELL: It's called craven self-interest when it's the polls that wake you up, not the actual underlying violence and destruction of people's lives and livelihoods. Scott, I want to ask you about the police reform, I mentioned earlier. Just as a reminder that with the Senator Tim Scott bill, the Senate Republicans tried to open the floor debate on that bill in June.All the proposals would be guaranteed an up or down vote, both Democrats and Republicans and the Democrats voted filibuster and wouldn't even send it up for debate.WALKER: Tim Scott obviously talked about this in his remarkable speech he gave last week at the national convention. As you know, he's been working on this for years and he rightfully is upset with Senate Democrats who as he said and I believe he's right, cared more about a political point, using this as a political issue, going into the November elections as opposed to actually passing and enacting meaningful reform.It can be done, I know again because I signed the law years ago, the very first independent investigation law in the country we can do it but we got to set politics aside and we got to make sure that we not only protect against horrible situations like what happened in Minneapolis with George Floyd but at the same time we then protect the good and decent honorable men and women who every day law enforcement are protecting us and keeping us safe. There can't be that balance.MCDOWELL: I'll just point out that Senator Kamala Harris last week said, the Republican Convention is designed for one purpose to suit the Donald Trump's ego. What a slap in the face to all the people who spoke, especially Senator Tim Scott. Scott Walker, good to see you.WALKER: Good to be with you. Have a great morning.MCDOWELL: Good to see you. Coming up, college students getting resourceful. Many finding new ways to make money as classes shift to remote learning plus I got to break it to you. I must break you again rather. Sylvester Stallone taking a new swipe at Rocky and Ivan Drago's battle in the rank. You're watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business.MCDOWELL: Putting skills to work. College students faced with a somewhat decimated job market, doing what they can to make money. Gerri Willis shows us how they're changing course, Jerry.GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hey good morning Dagen, that's right. Those RA jobs, waitressing, bartending, all that stuff is gone, right? So most of the students are getting really, really creative. Studies show that a third of students lost their job because of the pandemic.Tamarek Sweat is one student who has tapped her creativity to pay the bills. The sophomore at Texas A&M has started a custom clothing business which she runs from her apartment near campus. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TAMAREK SWEAT, TEXAS A&M SOPHOMORE: I do have to pay rent and I have a light bill and I have to also juggle that and school, stuff like as far as books and access codes and this other stuff that college requires so I knew I needed money and I knew I needed it fast and so I just found a way to get money.WILLIS: Her cousin lent her the money to start her venture and in July she bought a machine to cut cloth and a heat press. Tamarek takes orders from students in over 30 universities, most of her business is done on Instagram where she sells sweatshirts, T-shirts, hoodies and masks. She's made about $2000. Listen.SWEAT: So it started off for financial reasons but now it is truly something that makes me happy. I enjoy seeing everyone when they get their stuff and they take videos and they tag me on Instagram and Twitter.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIS: Among the things, college students are doing door to door sales, customer research. Some of them are selling homemade Ramen noodles and one young woman is reading tarot cards Dagen. I got to tell you, some folks are saying this is a new generation of entrepreneurs because they're looking what seemingly might be chaos in finding opportunity.MCDOWELL: Go Aggies is this I'll say to that, industrious young woman. Thank you so much Gerri. Cabot, how are students harnessing technology to create these money making opportunities?CABOT PHILLIPS, EDITOR-IN CHIEF, CAMPUSREFORM.ORG: Yes well, I've seen this first-hand at CampusReform, we have a team of college students that write for us. We've had a huge increase in the number of students that are coming forward and saying, hey, I need some extra money. How can I get paid to write for your website? Can I learn the trade of writing and journalism.I've seen this first-hand. Also my brother in law. He got laid off from his job at Applebees. He's a student at Oregon state. You know what he did? He took a pickup truck, he started his junk removal business in Scappoose, Oregon so he could make some money to get by.That is capitalism. That's the beauty of America and so for the next generation to get to see, hey, capitalism actually isn't that bad. I can go out, I can use my talents. I can work hard. I can provide a service for people and like that student in the video earlier said, I feel good that I'm helping people.This is a great entry way for people and the next generation to realize that in America, you have the freedom to start something. You don't have to sit around and wait for other people to give it to you. Hopefully we can change some people's minds about the beauty of the free market in the next generation.MCDOWELL: And Lee, it really is easier than ever nowadays to start your own business, particularly if you're selling something online like they awesome T-shirts and sweatshirts that this young Aggie was making?LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, POLLSTER AND MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: Yes, it's amazing. I mean the very entry is nothing. I mean these kids seem to know how to harness technology but one of the things that I think is so fascinating too and looking at studies is how much innovation is accelerated over the last six months.Things that we never thought would happen with virtual work, with virtual connections and these kinds of moments really breed innovation and entrepreneurial spirit so I can't wait to see what innovations come out of this time, as hard and challenging it is, American spirit rises up and great things can happen. I love seeing these kinds of stories so more to come.MCDOWELL: Great stuff, guys. Coming up, a terrifying ride, a toddler goes airborne. The accident goes viral. We take a look and that little lady is OK. Plus Amazon keeping you fit. The new fitness tracker contract more than just your steps.MCDOWELL: It's time for the morning buzz. First up, Rocky Balboa and Ivan Drago getting a rematch sort of. Sylvester Stallone making a director's cut of Rocky IV to celebrate the film's 35th anniversary. One thing we do know about the bizarre poly robot is being removed.Someone says the robot is going to the junk yard for ever. Cabot, do we need a director's cut of Rocky IV?PHILLIPS: Well, if they say if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I don't think we need to change a thing about this movie. I remember watching this as a very young kid, elementary school, getting fired up by it. I wanted to go fight the Soviets, my parents had to tell me that the Cold War was long over. I didn't need to worry about that but I think that also the thing you got to keep in mind here is at least we're not getting a new Rocky completely.Don't put it past along to come out and say he's just going to film a new one even though he's a little bit advanced in age. We've seen him revamping Rambo. I wouldn't be surprised if we saw an entirely new Rocky film in the next couple years but this is an absolute classic. No need to change it though I'm excited to see what Stallone has to add.MCDOWELL: So speaking of that, I'm watching Terms of Endearment on show time over the weekend and there's a scene where Aurora and Garrett, Shirley MacLaine and Jack Nicholson first kiss out in the water in the Gulf of Mexico and he grabs her in an appropriate way and she fights back and runs off.That was edited completely out of the version that's on showtime with no warning so I'm just raising the question of like who said it's sensitive that they couldn't watch that and make a judgment about it themselves and why would showtime cut that out. Very, very disturbing if you ask me.Next terrifying moments, watch this. Captured on video, a three-year old girl caught in a kite and taken up about a 100 feet into the sky. Look at that. This is during a festival in Taiwan. The crowd got the girl down and she reportedly only suffered some scratches but isn't it amazing that this child wasn't seriously injured and as a mom, relatively new mom, it makes you worried about like situations your child can get into.CARTER: You just can't imagine how terrified that family was. That little girl, she's 28 pound, three-years old. I have a 16 month old. I am devastated just watching that video. Thank the Lord that she just came out with scratches and the goodness of all the people that come together and try and help her but my Lord, I cannot imagine. I cannot imagine.MCDOWELL: So - so here's a quick story. My brother - well, my mother was standing at the window at the kitchen sink and she was looking out in the backyard and just saw this hatchet flying up in the air and my brother at three had gone into the shed and gotten a hatchet.And was playing like hatchet toss and throw it in the air. I think it took my mother 20 years to recover from that so finally I - little boys you know. You got a little girl. Be grateful. Finally a love for the ages. Ecuador is home to the oldest living married couple with a combined age of about 215 years.Guinness book of world records certifying that 110-year old Julio Cesar and his wife Waldramina, nearly 105 years young. Couple married in secret in 1941 because their families did not approve. Lee, I guess the parents got it wrong and they look so beautiful and handsome.CARTER: Can you just imagine, what they have been through and endured and seen together? Gosh, they should give us all, some tips. That's amazing almost - almost 80 years, I mean that's beautiful. In 1941. Think of all that's happened in the world since they've been together and what they've seen.MCDOWELL: And Lee, Cabot just got married.CARTER: Amazing. Congratulations.PHILLIPS: I'm four months in. I'm going to do some research on what the tips were here and you got to think that at a certain point, they're just continuing to relish in proving their family is wrong and I'm sure their families have come along at this point. they probably have so many children and grandchildren. I love stories like this. I have a lot to learn though. I'm very excited.MCDOWELL: You only need to learn two words Cabot. 'Yes dear.'PHILLIPS: I've learned that one very quickly.MCDOWELL: Yes dear. Can you go and change the tires on the car? Yes dear. Still ahead everybody, former White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders is here on the shape of the 2020 race. That's next and the office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy Director Peter Navarro talks the economy, China, TikTok and more. It all begins next hour on Mornings with Maria, live on Fox Business.MCDOWELL: Good morning. I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, August 31. Your top stories at 8:00 AM ET. The 2020 right tightening up. Joe Biden back on the campaign trail, heading to Pennsylvania today.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.6%) and Russell 2000 (+0.3%) performed slightly better, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.3% after setting an all-time high earlier in the session.Financial stocks were among today's biggest winners, benefiting from some curve-steepening activity after Fed Chair Powell outlined a shift towards an average inflation target. Under the new framework, the Fed would allow PCE inflation to run moderately beyond 2.0% over time to make up for years when it ran below 2.0%.From a sector perspective, the S&P 500 financials sector finished atop the standings with a 1.7% gain, followed by real estate (+1.4%), health care (+0.8%), and consumer staples (+0.6%). The communication services (-1.3%), consumer discretionary (-0.7%), and materials (-0.2%) sectors were the lone holdouts.Other positive factors today included reports that Microsoft (MSFT 226.58, +5.43, +2.5%) and Walmart (WMT 136.63, +5.93, +4.5%) are teaming up to possibly acquire TikTok US, and Abbott Labs (ABT 111.29, +8.10, +7.9%) receiving emergency use authorization from the FDA for its $5.00, 15-minute COVID-19 antigen test.Mega-cap growth stocks had a relatively weak outing today after an incredibly strong performance yesterday. Microsoft was an exception, of course, and so was Tesla (TSLA 2238.75, +85.58, +4.0%).As an aside, Senate Majority Leader McConnell (R-KY) reportedly said stimulus talks remained at a stalemate, which may have been a contributing factor in the market's brief dip into negative territory around 1:00 p.m. ET. The market, however, swiftly rebounded into positive territory.Recapping the moves in the Treasury market, the 2-yr yield finished flat at 0.16%, while the 10-yr yield increased six basis points to 0.75% as investors sold longer-dated bonds following Fed Chair Powell's speech. The U.S. Dollar Index was little changed at 93.03. WTI crude futures declined 0.8%, or $0.36, to $43.03/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Initial jobless claims for the week ending August 22 were roughly in-line with expectations, decreasing by 98,000 to 1.006 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.000 million). Continuing claims for the week ending August 15 decreased by 223,000 to 14.535 million. The key takeaway from the report is that the labor market, while recovering, is still fractured in a big way that is not conducive for strong and sustained economic growth.The second estimate for Q2 GDP showed output decreased at an annualized rate of 31.7% (Briefing.com consensus -32.9%) versus the advance estimate of -32.9%. The GDP price index was down 2.0% (Briefing.com consensus -1.8%) versus the advance estimate of -1.8%.The key takeaway from the report is that the upward revision doesn't change the fact that the COVID crisis triggered the biggest downturn for the U.S. economy on record.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Personal Income and Spending report for July, the final Univ. of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August, and Wholesale Inventories for July on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +29.6% YTDS&P 500 +7.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -0.2% YTDRussell 2000 -6.2% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1648/1289. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1578/1760.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 28, 2020End of Document

(HPQ 20.01, +1.31, +7.0%), and Dell (DELL 65.97, +3.53, +5.7%). Three of these are tech-based companies, falling in-line with today's general outperformance of tech stocks.Interestingly, the CBOE Volatility Index is up 7.0% to 26.17 today despite the slight uptick in the market, suggesting investors are somewhat nervous about a potential downdraft in equities given their strong outing in August.10:25 ETDow +53.81 at 28546.08, Nasdaq +71.81 at 11697.15, S&P +6.16 at 3490.71[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.2% in a slow start to the session. Microsoft (MSFT 229.59, +3.01, +1.3%) is up another 1.3%, extending its weekly gain to 7.8%.Semiconductor stocks are also having a good day, evidenced by the 1.0% gain in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. Interestingly, Taiwan Semi (TSM 80.47, -0.14, -0.2%) is among the few components trading lower despite the stock being initiated with a Buy rating at New Street.Financial stocks, on the other hand, are seeing modest losses after leading yesterday's advance.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.6%) and Russell 2000 (+0.3%) performed slightly better, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.3% after setting an all-time high earlier in the session.Financial stocks were among today's biggest winners, benefiting from some curve-steepening activity after Fed Chair Powell outlined a shift towards an average inflation target. Under the new framework, the Fed would allow PCE inflation to run moderately beyond 2.0% over time to make up for years when it ran below 2.0%.From a sector perspective, the S&P 500 financials sector finished atop the standings with a 1.7% gain, followed by real estate (+1.4%), health care (+0.8%), and consumer staples (+0.6%). The communication services (-1.3%), consumer discretionary (-0.7%), and materials (-0.2%) sectors were the lone holdouts.Other positive factors today included reports that Microsoft (MSFT 226.58, +5.43, +2.5%) and Walmart (WMT 136.63, +5.93, +4.5%) are teaming up to possibly acquire TikTok US, and Abbott Labs (ABT 111.29, +8.10, +7.9%) receiving emergency use authorization from the FDA for its $5.00, 15-minute COVID-19 antigen test.Mega-cap growth stocks had a relatively weak outing today after an incredibly strong performance yesterday. Microsoft was an exception, of course, and so was Tesla (TSLA 2238.75, +85.58, +4.0%).As an aside, Senate Majority Leader McConnell (R-KY) reportedly said stimulus talks remained at a stalemate, which may have been a contributing factor in the market's brief dip into negative territory around 1:00 p.m. ET. The market, however, swiftly rebounded into positive territory.Recapping the moves in the Treasury market, the 2-yr yield finished flat at 0.16%, while the 10-yr yield increased six basis points to 0.75% as investors sold longer-dated bonds following Fed Chair Powell's speech. The U.S. Dollar Index was little changed at 93.03. WTI crude futures declined 0.8%, or $0.36, to $43.03/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Initial jobless claims for the week ending August 22 were roughly in-line with expectations, decreasing by 98,000 to 1.006 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.000 million). Continuing claims for the week ending August 15 decreased by 223,000 to 14.535 million. The key takeaway from the report is that the labor market, while recovering, is still fractured in a big way that is not conducive for strong and sustained economic growth.The second estimate for Q2 GDP showed output decreased at an annualized rate of 31.7% (Briefing.com consensus -32.9%) versus the advance estimate of -32.9%. The GDP price index was down 2.0% (Briefing.com consensus -1.8%) versus the advance estimate of -1.8%.The key takeaway from the report is that the upward revision doesn't change the fact that the COVID crisis triggered the biggest downturn for the U.S. economy on record.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Personal Income and Spending report for July, the final Univ. of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August, and Wholesale Inventories for July on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +29.6% YTDS&P 500 +7.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -0.2% YTDRussell 2000 -6.2% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1648/1289. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1578/1760.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 28, 2020End of Document

Losses in the dollar also contributed to today's advance.The U.S. Dollar Index 0.7% to $92.40.13:30 ETDow +82.35 at 28574.62, Nasdaq +17.60 at 11642.94, S&P +6.62 at 3491.17[BRIEFING.COM] The DJIA (+0.29%) still holds a narrow lead over its counterparts, now slightly off session highs.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that Intel (INTC 50.34, +0.94, +1.90%), Exxon Mobil (XOM 40.41, +0.67, +1.69%), and McDonald's (MCD 215.37, +3.18, +1.50%) are outperforming.Conversely, pharmacy retailer Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 38.76, -0.58, -1.47%) sits at the bottom of the index.The DJIA has now advanced about 2.31% this week.13:00 ETDow +141.14 at 28633.41, Nasdaq +56.34 at 11681.68, S&P +14.37 at 3498.92[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up near session highs with a 0.4% advance as the gains start to broaden out of the technology sector, which remains among today's winners. The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.5%, and Russell 2000 is up 0.4%.Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are trading in positive territory. The information technology sector's 0.7% gain is carrying the most weight, but the energy (+1.2%) and materials (+0.9%) sectors are up the most. Conversely, the defensive-oriented real estate (-0.2%), utilities (-0.2%), and health care (-0.3%) sectors are the lone holdouts.The gains are broad in the tech space. Heavyweight Visa (V 214.86, +3.82, +1.8%) is up 2%, semiconductor stocks are outperforming based on the 1.3% gain in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, and there are numerous earnings winners.For example, Workday (WDAY 243.04, +26.41, +12.2%), HP Inc. (HPQ 19.85, +1.15, +6.1%), Dell (DELL 66.16, +3.73, +6.1%), and VMware (VMW 147.51, +4.61, +3.2%) are up noticeably following better-than-expected earnings reports.Reopening stocks like casinos, airlines, and cruise lines are also exhibiting strength. Retailer Ulta Beauty (ULTA 237.65, 13.70, +6.1%) is up 6% after exceeding earnings estimates.Walmart (WMT 140.16, +3.54, +2.6%) is another standout today. Walmart is approaching the $400 billion market capitalization, which would put it an exclusive club with Tesla (TSLA 2249.20, +10.45, +0.4%), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 152.78, -0.21, -0.1%), and Taiwan Semi (TSM 80.35, -0.24, -0.3%).Elsewhere, there are subtle signs of caution. The 10-yr yield is down three basis points to 0.72% amid an uptick in buying interest, gold futures are up 2.4% to $1970.00 amid a weaker dollar (92.32, -0.68, -0.7%), and the CBOE Volatility Index is up 1.6% to 24.86 but it was up as much as 7.5% earlier.Reviewing today's economic data:Personal income increased 0.4% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -0.2%), which was much better than expected, and personal spending rose 1.9% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +1.5%), which was also much better than expected. The PCE Price Index and core-PCE Price Index both increased 0.3% m/m and were weaker than expected increases of 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively. That left the PCE Price Index up 1.0% yr/yr, versus 0.9% in June, and the core PCE Price Index up 1.3% yr/yr, versus 1.1% in June.The key takeaway from the report is that the income gain was driven by an increase in compensation (+1.3% m/m), which more than offset a 1.7% m/m decrease in personal current transfer receipts. In other words, the income gain was driven by people returning to work as the economy reopened.The preliminary University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August ticked up to 72.8 (Briefing.com consensus 70.5) from the final reading of 72.5 for July.The key takeaway from the report is that there was little overall change from the preceding period. The University of Michigan provided a table showing consumer expectations by political affiliation, which showed a stark difference in expectations among those who identify as Republican (97.4) and Democrat (45.0). Expectations of respondents identifying as Independent were essentially in the middle (66.7).The Chicago PMI for August decreased to 51.2 from 51.9 in July.Wholesale inventories decreased 0.1% in July following a revised 1.3% decline in June (from -1.4%). ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1861/1059. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1935/1307.12:25 ETDow +110.90 at 28603.17, Nasdaq +56.79 at 11682.13, S&P +10.52 at 3495.07[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, and the Nasdaq is up 0.5%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows the five members trading within 0.5% of their flat lines, which is a pretty tame day for the high-flying stocks. Netflix (NFLX 525.63, -0.53, -0.1%) is the only component trading in negative territory.The CBOE Volatility Index, which was up as much as 7.5% intraday, is now up just 1.8% to 24.92.11:55 ETDow +103.07 at 28595.34, Nasdaq +71.14 at 11696.48, S&P +11.42 at 3495.97[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade in the green in a lackluster session. The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, the Dow is up 0.3%, and the Nasdaq is up 0.6%.Coca-Cola (KO 49.19, +0.97, +2.0%) shares are up 2% after the company outlined strategic steps to reorganize its business for future growth. The structural changes will include voluntary and involuntary reductions in employees and are not related to events caused by the coronavirus.The major European indices ended the week on a lower note. Germany's DAX lost 0.5%, UK's FTSE lost 0.6%, and France's CAC lost 0.3%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 0.4%.11:30 ETDow +88.69 at 28580.96, Nasdaq +72.42 at 11697.76, S&P +10.17 at 3494.72[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.3% and near session highs, although remains slightly below yesterday's intraday (and record) high.Walmart (WMT 139.15, +2.55, +1.9%) is trading at fresh all-time highs and is nearing the $400 billion market capitalization. The stock is up 5.6% this week, boosted by TikTok-acquisition speculation with Microsoft (MSFT 229.35, +2.80, +1.2%).Separately, MGM Resorts (MGM 24.14, +1.30, +5.8%) is planning to lay off 18,000 furloughed workers as a result of pandemic shutdowns, according to The Wall Street Journal. MGM shares are up 6.0%.10:55 ETDow +37.67 at 28529.94, Nasdaq +46.85 at 11672.19, S&P +3.91 at 3488.46[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading near session lows with a 0.1% gain. Earnings reports have continued to come in mostly better than expected.Earnings standouts include Workday (WDAY 241.35, +24.87, +11.5%), Ulta Beauty (ULTA 236.41, +12.64, +5.7%), HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, +1.31, +7.0%), and Dell (DELL 65.97, +3.53, +5.7%). Three of these are tech-based companies, falling in-line with today's general outperformance of tech stocks.Interestingly, the CBOE Volatility Index is up 7.0% to 26.17 today despite the slight uptick in the market, suggesting investors are somewhat nervous about a potential downdraft in equities given their strong outing in August.10:25 ETDow +53.81 at 28546.08, Nasdaq +71.81 at 11697.15, S&P +6.16 at 3490.71[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.2% in a slow start to the session. Microsoft (MSFT 229.59, +3.01, +1.3%) is up another 1.3%, extending its weekly gain to 7.8%.Semiconductor stocks are also having a good day, evidenced by the 1.0% gain in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. Interestingly, Taiwan Semi (TSM 80.47, -0.14, -0.2%) is among the few components trading lower despite the stock being initiated with a Buy rating at New Street.Financial stocks, on the other hand, are seeing modest losses after leading yesterday's advance. The S&P 500 financial sector is down 0.1% but remains up 3.8% for the week.10:00 ETDow +97.46 at 28589.73, Nasdaq +76.74 at 11702.08, S&P +11.30 at 3495.85[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, and the Russell 2000 is up 0.4%.Just in, the final reading of the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for August increased to 74.1 (Briefing.com consensus 72.8) from 72.8 in the preliminary reading.The Chicago PMI for August decreased to 51.2 from 51.9 in July.09:40 ETDow +59.44 at 28551.71, Nasdaq +67.41 at 11692.75, S&P +8.41 at 3492.96[BRIEFING.COM] The major indices start the session in positive territory but slightly below yesterday's highs.

The 2-yr yield is down five basis points to 0.11%, and the 10-yr yield is down three basis points to 0.72%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.7% to 92.39.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.6%) and Russell 2000 (+0.3%) performed slightly better, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.3% after setting an all-time high earlier in the session.Financial stocks were among today's biggest winners, benefiting from some curve-steepening activity after Fed Chair Powell outlined a shift towards an average inflation target. Under the new framework, the Fed would allow PCE inflation to run moderately beyond 2.0% over time to make up for years when it ran below 2.0%.From a sector perspective, the S&P 500 financials sector finished atop the standings with a 1.7% gain, followed by real estate (+1.4%), health care (+0.8%), and consumer staples (+0.6%). The communication services (-1.3%), consumer discretionary (-0.7%), and materials (-0.2%) sectors were the lone holdouts.Other positive factors today included reports that Microsoft (MSFT 226.58, +5.43, +2.5%) and Walmart (WMT 136.63, +5.93, +4.5%) are teaming up to possibly acquire TikTok US, and Abbott Labs (ABT 111.29, +8.10, +7.9%) receiving emergency use authorization from the FDA for its $5.00, 15-minute COVID-19 antigen test.Mega-cap growth stocks had a relatively weak outing today after an incredibly strong performance yesterday. Microsoft was an exception, of course, and so was Tesla (TSLA 2238.75, +85.58, +4.0%).As an aside, Senate Majority Leader McConnell (R-KY) reportedly said stimulus talks remained at a stalemate, which may have been a contributing factor in the market's brief dip into negative territory around 1:00 p.m. ET. The market, however, swiftly rebounded into positive territory.Recapping the moves in the Treasury market, the 2-yr yield finished flat at 0.16%, while the 10-yr yield increased six basis points to 0.75% as investors sold longer-dated bonds following Fed Chair Powell's speech. The U.S. Dollar Index was little changed at 93.03. WTI crude futures declined 0.8%, or $0.36, to $43.03/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Initial jobless claims for the week ending August 22 were roughly in-line with expectations, decreasing by 98,000 to 1.006 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.000 million). Continuing claims for the week ending August 15 decreased by 223,000 to 14.535 million. The key takeaway from the report is that the labor market, while recovering, is still fractured in a big way that is not conducive for strong and sustained economic growth.The second estimate for Q2 GDP showed output decreased at an annualized rate of 31.7% (Briefing.com consensus -32.9%) versus the advance estimate of -32.9%. The GDP price index was down 2.0% (Briefing.com consensus -1.8%) versus the advance estimate of -1.8%.The key takeaway from the report is that the upward revision doesn't change the fact that the COVID crisis triggered the biggest downturn for the U.S. economy on record.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Personal Income and Spending report for July, the final Univ. of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August, and Wholesale Inventories for July on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +29.6% YTDS&P 500 +7.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -0.2% YTDRussell 2000 -6.2% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1648/1289. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1578/1760.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 28, 2020End of Document

The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6% to close at a record high, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6%, and the Russell 2000 gained 0.9%.All 11 S&P 500 sectors closed in positive territory, with energy (+1.9%) and materials (+1.1%) rising more than 1.0%. The information technology sector (+1.0%) was next in line, but it was perhaps the most influential gainer today given its top-weighted position in the S&P 500. The health care sector (+0.2%) lagged.In the tech space, Workday (WDAY 243.88, +27.25, +12.6%), HP Inc. (HPQ 19.85, +1.15, +6.2%), Dell (DELL 66.21, +3.78, +6.1%), and VMware (VMW 146.09, +3.19, +2.2%) stood out as earnings winners. Semiconductor stocks also chipped in a solid outing, evident by the 2.0% increase in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.There was no one specific catalyst today, but investors did receive another batch of better-than-expected economic data that helped broaden out the gains.For July, personal income increased 0.4% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -0.2%) and personal spending rose 1.9% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +1.5%). The final University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August ticked up to 74.1 (Briefing.com consensus 72.8) from the preliminary reading of 72.8.The data provided some fuel for the reopening stocks like casinos, airlines, cruise lines, and hotels. Shares of MGM Resorts (MGM 23.86, +1.05, +4.6%) rose nearly 5%, even as the company announced plans to lay off 18,000 furloughed employees as a result of the pandemic.U.S. Treasuries finished mixed. The 2-yr yield was flat at 0.15%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.73%. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.7% to 92.32. WTI crude futures declined 0.1% to $42.97/bbl. The CBOE Volatility Index declined 6.2% to 22.96 after touching 26.30 at its intraday high.Reviewing Friday's economic data:Personal income increased 0.4% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus -0.2%), which was much better than expected, and personal spending rose 1.9% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +1.5%), which was also much better than expected. The PCE Price Index and core-PCE Price Index both increased 0.3% m/m and were weaker than expected increases of 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively. That left the PCE Price Index up 1.0% yr/yr, versus 0.9% in June, and the core PCE Price Index up 1.3% yr/yr, versus 1.1% in June.The key takeaway from the report is that the income gain was driven by an increase in compensation (+1.3% m/m), which more than offset a 1.7% m/m decrease in personal current transfer receipts. In other words, the income gain was driven by people returning to work as the economy reopened.The final University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August ticked up to 74.1 (Briefing.com consensus 72.8) from the preliminary reading of 72.8. The final reading for July was 72.5.The key takeaway from the report is that consumer sentiment has been slow to rebound and that the incremental improvement seen has been based simply on the view that things couldn't get worse than they were at the depths of the shutdown period.The Chicago PMI for August decreased to 51.2 from 51.9 in July.Wholesale inventories decreased 0.1% in July following a revised 1.3% decline in June (from -1.4%).Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.4% YTDS&P 500 +8.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +0.4% YTDRussell 2000 -5.4% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2056/914. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2176/1105.15:25 ETDow +224.59 at 28716.86, Nasdaq +58.78 at 11684.12, S&P +21.24 at 3505.79[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading at fresh all-time highs with a current 0.6% gain.Every sector is now trading higher, with health care (+0.1%) recently turning positive. The energy (+1.9%) and materials (+1.1%) sectors remain in the lead and are the only sectors up more than 1.0%.WTI crude futures settled lower by just 0.1%, or $0.06, to $42.97/bbl.15:00 ETDow +150.28 at 28642.55, Nasdaq +39.67 at 11665.01, S&P +14.18 at 3498.73[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.4% and is on pace for its sixth straight record high. The Russell 2000 is up 0.6%.It's a broad-based advance despite the modest index gains. The underperformance of the mega-cap stocks has limited the upside, but the market appears healthy with the wealth spreading around to less-loved areas of the market. This year's worst-performing sector, energy, is up currently up 1.8%.Looking ahead, Zoom Video (ZM 298.36, +3.68, +1.3%) will report earnings on Monday.14:30 ETDow +118.28 at 28610.55, Nasdaq +43.34 at 11668.68, S&P +12.17 at 3496.72[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (+0.35%) now stands in last place, albeit in a modestly higher fashion, as the major averages attempt to push toward afternoon highs.S&P 500 constituents Western Digital (WDC 37.58, +2.34, +6.64%), Wynn Resorts (WYNN 91.45, +4.93, +5.70%), and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX 15.63, +0.73, +4.90%) show decent strength. WDC benefits from general strength in semis/storage, WYNN finds gains in reaction to reports that the NBA will resume playoff games starting Saturday, and FCX moves higher on strength in precious metals.Conversely, online retailer eBay (EBAY 54.27, -2.04, -3.62%) sits at the bottom of the index; the stock fell through its 50-day SMA (55.60) this morning.14:00 ETDow +88.29 at 28580.56, Nasdaq +43.94 at 11669.28, S&P +10.21 at 3494.76[BRIEFING.COM] In the last half hour the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (+0.38%) has taken the top spot among its major counterparts.Gold futures settled $42.30 higher (+2.2%) to $1,974.90/oz, erasing its weekly declines to end up 1.4% on the week, as investors gauged the implications of the Fed's policy of "Average Inflation Targeting" whereby the Fed would allow for above-target inflation for periods of time to balance times of below-target inflation. Losses in the dollar also contributed to today's advance.The U.S. Dollar Index 0.7% to $92.40.13:30 ETDow +82.35 at 28574.62, Nasdaq +17.60 at 11642.94, S&P +6.62 at 3491.17[BRIEFING.COM] The DJIA (+0.29%) still holds a narrow lead over its counterparts, now slightly off session highs.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that Intel (INTC 50.34, +0.94, +1.90%), Exxon Mobil (XOM 40.41, +0.67, +1.69%), and McDonald's (MCD 215.37, +3.18, +1.50%) are outperforming.Conversely, pharmacy retailer Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 38.76, -0.58, -1.47%) sits at the bottom of the index.The DJIA has now advanced about 2.31% this week.13:00 ETDow +141.14 at 28633.41, Nasdaq +56.34 at 11681.68, S&P +14.37 at 3498.92[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up near session highs with a 0.4% advance as the gains start to broaden out of the technology sector, which remains among today's winners. The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.5%, and Russell 2000 is up 0.4%.Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are trading in positive territory. The information technology sector's 0.7% gain is carrying the most weight, but the energy (+1.2%) and materials (+0.9%) sectors are up the most. Conversely, the defensive-oriented real estate (-0.2%), utilities (-0.2%), and health care (-0.3%) sectors are the lone holdouts.The gains are broad in the tech space. Heavyweight Visa (V 214.86, +3.82, +1.8%) is up 2%, semiconductor stocks are outperforming based on the 1.3% gain in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, and there are numerous earnings winners.For example, Workday (WDAY 243.04, +26.41, +12.2%), HP Inc. (HPQ 19.85, +1.15, +6.1%), Dell (DELL 66.16, +3.73, +6.1%), and VMware (VMW 147.51, +4.61, +3.2%) are up noticeably following better-than-expected earnings reports.Reopening stocks like casinos, airlines, and cruise lines are also exhibiting strength. Retailer Ulta Beauty (ULTA 237.65, 13.70, +6.1%) is up 6% after exceeding earnings estimates.Walmart (WMT 140.16, +3.54, +2.6%) is another standout today. Walmart is approaching the $400 billion market capitalization, which would put it an exclusive club with Tesla (TSLA 2249.20, +10.45, +0.4%), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 152.78, -0.21, -0.1%), and Taiwan Semi (TSM 80.35, -0.24, -0.3%).Elsewhere, there are subtle signs of caution. The 10-yr yield is down three basis points to 0.72% amid an uptick in buying interest, gold futures are up 2.4% to $1970.00 amid a weaker dollar (92.32, -0.68, -0.7%), and the CBOE Volatility Index is up 1.6% to 24.86 but it was up as much as 7.5% earlier.Reviewing today's economic data:Personal income increased 0.4% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -0.2%), which was much better than expected, and personal spending rose 1.9% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +1.5%), which was also much better than expected. The PCE Price Index and core-PCE Price Index both increased 0.3% m/m and were weaker than expected increases of 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively. That left the PCE Price Index up 1.0% yr/yr, versus 0.9% in June, and the core PCE Price Index up 1.3% yr/yr, versus 1.1% in June.The key takeaway from the report is that the income gain was driven by an increase in compensation (+1.3% m/m), which more than offset a 1.7% m/m decrease in personal current transfer receipts. In other words, the income gain was driven by people returning to work as the economy reopened.The preliminary University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August ticked up to 72.8 (Briefing.com consensus 70.5) from the final reading of 72.5 for July.The key takeaway from the report is that there was little overall change from the preceding period. The University of Michigan provided a table showing consumer expectations by political affiliation, which showed a stark difference in expectations among those who identify as Republican (97.4) and Democrat (45.0). Expectations of respondents identifying as Independent were essentially in the middle (66.7).The Chicago PMI for August decreased to 51.2 from 51.9 in July.Wholesale inventories decreased 0.1% in July following a revised 1.3% decline in June (from -1.4%). ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1861/1059. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1935/1307.12:25 ETDow +110.90 at 28603.17, Nasdaq +56.79 at 11682.13, S&P +10.52 at 3495.07[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, and the Nasdaq is up 0.5%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows the five members trading within 0.5% of their flat lines, which is a pretty tame day for the high-flying stocks. Netflix (NFLX 525.63, -0.53, -0.1%) is the only component trading in negative territory.The CBOE Volatility Index, which was up as much as 7.5% intraday, is now up just 1.8% to 24.92.11:55 ETDow +103.07 at 28595.34, Nasdaq +71.14 at 11696.48, S&P +11.42 at 3495.97[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade in the green in a lackluster session. The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, the Dow is up 0.3%, and the Nasdaq is up 0.6%.Coca-Cola (KO 49.19, +0.97, +2.0%) shares are up 2% after the company outlined strategic steps to reorganize its business for future growth. The structural changes will include voluntary and involuntary reductions in employees and are not related to events caused by the coronavirus.The major European indices ended the week on a lower note. Germany's DAX lost 0.5%, UK's FTSE lost 0.6%, and France's CAC lost 0.3%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 0.4%.11:30 ETDow +88.69 at 28580.96, Nasdaq +72.42 at 11697.76, S&P +10.17 at 3494.72[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.3% and near session highs, although remains slightly below yesterday's intraday (and record) high.Walmart (WMT 139.15, +2.55, +1.9%) is trading at fresh all-time highs and is nearing the $400 billion market capitalization. The stock is up 5.6% this week, boosted by TikTok-acquisition speculation with Microsoft (MSFT 229.35, +2.80, +1.2%).Separately, MGM Resorts (MGM 24.14, +1.30, +5.8%) is planning to lay off 18,000 furloughed workers as a result of pandemic shutdowns, according to The Wall Street Journal. MGM shares are up 6.0%.10:55 ETDow +37.67 at 28529.94, Nasdaq +46.85 at 11672.19, S&P +3.91 at 3488.46[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading near session lows with a 0.1% gain. Earnings reports have continued to come in mostly better than expected.Earnings standouts include Workday (WDAY 241.35, +24.87, +11.5%), Ulta Beauty (ULTA 236.41, +12.64, +5.7%), HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, +1.31, +7.0%), and Dell (DELL 65.97, +3.53, +5.7%). Three of these are tech-based companies, falling in-line with today's general outperformance of tech stocks.Interestingly, the CBOE Volatility Index is up 7.0% to 26.17 today despite the slight uptick in the market, suggesting investors are somewhat nervous about a potential downdraft in equities given their strong outing in August.10:25 ETDow +53.81 at 28546.08, Nasdaq +71.81 at 11697.15, S&P +6.16 at 3490.71[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.2% in a slow start to the session. Microsoft (MSFT 229.59, +3.01, +1.3%) is up another 1.3%, extending its weekly gain to 7.8%.Semiconductor stocks are also having a good day, evidenced by the 1.0% gain in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. Interestingly, Taiwan Semi (TSM 80.47, -0.14, -0.2%) is among the few components trading lower despite the stock being initiated with a Buy rating at New Street.Financial stocks, on the other hand, are seeing modest losses after leading yesterday's advance. The S&P 500 financial sector is down 0.1% but remains up 3.8% for the week.10:00 ETDow +97.46 at 28589.73, Nasdaq +76.74 at 11702.08, S&P +11.30 at 3495.85[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, and the Russell 2000 is up 0.4%.Just in, the final reading of the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for August increased to 74.1 (Briefing.com consensus 72.8) from 72.8 in the preliminary reading.The Chicago PMI for August decreased to 51.2 from 51.9 in July.09:40 ETDow +59.44 at 28551.71, Nasdaq +67.41 at 11692.75, S&P +8.41 at 3492.96[BRIEFING.COM] The major indices start the session in positive territory but slightly below yesterday's highs.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.6%) and Russell 2000 (+0.3%) performed slightly better, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.3% after setting an all-time high earlier in the session.Financial stocks were among today's biggest winners, benefiting from some curve-steepening activity after Fed Chair Powell outlined a shift towards an average inflation target. Under the new framework, the Fed would allow PCE inflation to run moderately beyond 2.0% over time to make up for years when it ran below 2.0%.From a sector perspective, the S&P 500 financials sector finished atop the standings with a 1.7% gain, followed by real estate (+1.4%), health care (+0.8%), and consumer staples (+0.6%). The communication services (-1.3%), consumer discretionary (-0.7%), and materials (-0.2%) sectors were the lone holdouts.Other positive factors today included reports that Microsoft (MSFT 226.58, +5.43, +2.5%) and Walmart (WMT 136.63, +5.93, +4.5%) are teaming up to possibly acquire TikTok US, and Abbott Labs (ABT 111.29, +8.10, +7.9%) receiving emergency use authorization from the FDA for its $5.00, 15-minute COVID-19 antigen test.Mega-cap growth stocks had a relatively weak outing today after an incredibly strong performance yesterday. Microsoft was an exception, of course, and so was Tesla (TSLA 2238.75, +85.58, +4.0%).As an aside, Senate Majority Leader McConnell (R-KY) reportedly said stimulus talks remained at a stalemate, which may have been a contributing factor in the market's brief dip into negative territory around 1:00 p.m. ET. The market, however, swiftly rebounded into positive territory.Recapping the moves in the Treasury market, the 2-yr yield finished flat at 0.16%, while the 10-yr yield increased six basis points to 0.75% as investors sold longer-dated bonds following Fed Chair Powell's speech. The U.S. Dollar Index was little changed at 93.03. WTI crude futures declined 0.8%, or $0.36, to $43.03/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Initial jobless claims for the week ending August 22 were roughly in-line with expectations, decreasing by 98,000 to 1.006 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.000 million). Continuing claims for the week ending August 15 decreased by 223,000 to 14.535 million. The key takeaway from the report is that the labor market, while recovering, is still fractured in a big way that is not conducive for strong and sustained economic growth.The second estimate for Q2 GDP showed output decreased at an annualized rate of 31.7% (Briefing.com consensus -32.9%) versus the advance estimate of -32.9%. The GDP price index was down 2.0% (Briefing.com consensus -1.8%) versus the advance estimate of -1.8%.The key takeaway from the report is that the upward revision doesn't change the fact that the COVID crisis triggered the biggest downturn for the U.S. economy on record.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Personal Income and Spending report for July, the final Univ. of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August, and Wholesale Inventories for July on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +29.6% YTDS&P 500 +7.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -0.2% YTDRussell 2000 -6.2% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1648/1289. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1578/1760.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 28, 2020End of Document

All Rights ReservedLength: 4826 wordsBody-- Another record-setting performance-- Gains broadened out amid better-than-expected economic data-- Tech sector remained an influential leaderS&P 500 notches sixth straight record high - Aug 28 - 16:15 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 gained 0.7% on Friday for its sixth straight record-setting advance. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6% to close at a record high, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6%, and the Russell 2000 gained 0.9%.All 11 S&P 500 sectors closed in positive territory, with energy (+1.9%) and materials (+1.1%) rising more than 1.0%. The information technology sector (+1.0%) was next in line, but it was perhaps the most influential gainer today given its top-weighted position in the S&P 500. The health care sector (+0.2%) lagged. In the tech space, Workday (WDAY 243.88, +27.25, +12.6%), HP Inc. (HPQ 19.85, +1.15, +6.2%), Dell (DELL 66.21, +3.78, +6.1%), and VMware (VMW 146.09, +3.19, +2.2%) stood out as earnings winners. Semiconductor stocks also chipped in a solid outing, evident by the 2.0% increase in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. There was no one specific catalyst today, but investors did receive another batch of better-than-expected economic data that helped broaden out the gains. For July, personal income  increased 0.4% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -0.2%) and personal spending rose 1.9% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +1.5%). The final University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August ticked up to 74.1 (Briefing.com consensus 72.8) from the preliminary reading of 72.8. The data provided some fuel for the reopening stocks like casinos, airlines, cruise lines, and hotels. Shares of MGM Resorts (MGM 23.86, +1.05, +4.6%) rose nearly 5%, even as the company announced plans to lay off 18,000 furloughed employees as a result of the pandemic. U.S. Treasuries finished mixed. The 2-yr yield was flat at 0.15%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.73%. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.7% to 92.32. WTI crude futures declined 0.1% to $42.97/bbl. The CBOE Volatility Index declined 6.2% to 22.96 after touching 26.30 at its intraday high. Reviewing Friday's economic data:• Personal income increased 0.4% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus -0.2%), which was much better than expected, and personal spending rose 1.9% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +1.5%), which was also much better than expected. The PCE Price Index and core-PCE Price Index both increased 0.3% m/m and were weaker than expected increases of 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively. That left the PCE Price Index up 1.0% yr/yr, versus 0.9% in June, and the core PCE Price Index up 1.3% yr/yr, versus 1.1% in June.The key takeaway from the report is that the income gain was driven by an increase in compensation (+1.3% m/m), which more than offset a 1.7% m/m decrease in personal current transfer receipts. In other words, the income gain was driven by people returning to work as the economy reopened.• The final University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August ticked up to 74.1 (Briefing.com consensus 72.8) from the preliminary reading of 72.8. The final reading for July was 72.5.The key takeaway from the report is that consumer sentiment has been slow to rebound and that the incremental improvement seen has been based simply on the view that things couldn't get worse than they were at the depths of the shutdown period.• The Chicago PMI for August decreased to 51.2 from 51.9 in July.• Wholesale inventories decreased 0.1% in July following a revised 1.3% decline in June (from -1.4%).Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday. • Nasdaq Composite +30.4% YTD• S&P 500 +8.6% YTD• Dow Jones Industrial Average +0.4% YTD• Russell 2000 -5.4% YTDNASDAQ - 2176 - 1105 - 3.0 blnNYSE - 2056 - 914 - 789.0 mlnDJ30 - +161.60 - 28653.87NASDAQ - +70.30 - 11695.64SP500 - +23.46 - 3508.01S&P 500 hits new record highs - Aug 28 - 15:25 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading at fresh all-time highs with a current 0.6% gain.Every sector is now trading higher, with health care (+0.1%) recently turning positive.

The Russell 2000 is up 0.6%.It's a broad-based advance despite the modest index gains. The underperformance of the mega-cap stocks has limited the upside, but the market appears healthy with the wealth spreading around to less-loved areas of the market. This year's worst-performing sector, energy, is up currently up 1.8%. Looking ahead, Zoom Video (ZM 298.36, +3.68, +1.3%) will report earnings on Monday.NASDAQ - 1977 - 1297 - 2.3 blnNYSE - 1921 - 1027 - 414.3 mlnDJ30 - +150.28 - 28642.55NASDAQ - +39.67 - 11665.01SP500 - +14.18 - 3498.73Wynn, betting peers higher following plans to resume NBA playoff games - Aug 28 - 14:30 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (+0.35%) now stands in last place, albeit in a modestly higher fashion, as the major averages attempt to push toward afternoon highs.S&P 500 constituents Western Digital (WDC 37.58, +2.34, +6.64%), Wynn Resorts (WYNN 91.45, +4.93, +5.70%), and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX 15.63, +0.73, +4.90%) show decent strength. WDC benefits from general strength in semis/storage, WYNN finds gains in reaction to reports that the NBA will resume playoff games starting Saturday, and FCX moves higher on strength in precious metals.Conversely, online retailer eBay (EBAY 54.27, -2.04, -3.62%) sits at the bottom of the index; the stock fell through its 50-day SMA (55.60) this morning.NASDAQ - 1953 - 1314 - 2.11 blnNYSE - 1881 - 1058 - 388.0 mlnDJ30 - +118.28 - 28610.55NASDAQ - +43.34 - 11668.68SP500 - +12.17 - 3496.72Gold cozies up to nice gains on Friday, erasing WTD losses - Aug 28 - 14:00 ET[BRIEFING.COM] In the last half hour the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (+0.38%) has taken the top spot among its major counterparts.Gold futures settled $42.30 higher (+2.2%) to $1,974.90/oz, erasing its weekly declines to end up 1.4% on the week, as investors gauged the implications of the Fed's policy of "Average Inflation Targeting" whereby the Fed would allow for above-target inflation for periods of time to balance times of below-target inflation.

The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.5%, and Russell 2000 is up 0.4%.Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are trading in positive territory. The information technology sector's 0.7% gain is carrying the most weight, but the energy (+1.2%) and materials (+0.9%) sectors are up the most. Conversely, the defensive-oriented real estate (-0.2%), utilities (-0.2%), and health care (-0.3%) sectors are the lone holdouts. The gains are broad in the tech space. Heavyweight Visa (V 214.86, +3.82, +1.8%) is up 2%, semiconductor stocks are outperforming based on the 1.3% gain in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, and there are numerous earnings winners.For example, Workday (WDAY 243.04, +26.41, +12.2%), HP Inc. (HPQ 19.85, +1.15, +6.1%), Dell (DELL 66.16, +3.73, +6.1%), and VMware (VMW 147.51, +4.61, +3.2%) are up noticeably following better-than-expected earnings reports. Reopening stocks like casinos, airlines, and cruise lines are also exhibiting strength. Retailer Ulta Beauty (ULTA 237.65, 13.70, +6.1%) is up 6% after exceeding earnings estimates. Walmart (WMT 140.16, +3.54, +2.6%) is another standout today. Walmart is approaching the $400 billion market capitalization, which would put it an exclusive club with Tesla (TSLA 2249.20, +10.45, +0.4%), Johnson &Johnson (JNJ 152.78, -0.21, -0.1%), and Taiwan Semi (TSM 80.35, -0.24, -0.3%). Elsewhere, there are subtle signs of caution. The 10-yr yield is down three basis points to 0.72% amid an uptick in buying interest, gold futures are up 2.4% to $1970.00 amid a weaker dollar (92.32, -0.68, -0.7%), and the CBOE Volatility Index is up 1.6% to 24.86 but it was up as much as 7.5% earlier.  Reviewing today's economic data:• Personal income increased 0.4% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -0.2%), which was much better than expected, and personal spending rose 1.9% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +1.5%), which was also much better than expected. The PCE Price Index and core-PCE Price Index both increased 0.3% m/m and were weaker than expected increases of 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively. That left the PCE Price Index up 1.0% yr/yr, versus 0.9% in June, and the core PCE Price Index up 1.3% yr/yr, versus 1.1% in June.The key takeaway from the report is that the income gain was driven by an increase in compensation (+1.3% m/m), which more than offset a 1.7% m/m decrease in personal current transfer receipts. In other words, the income gain was driven by people returning to work as the economy reopened.• The preliminary University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August ticked up to 72.8 (Briefing.com consensus 70.5) from the final reading of 72.5 for July.The key takeaway from the report is that there was little overall change from the preceding period.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.6%) and Russell 2000 (+0.3%) performed slightly better, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.3% after setting an all-time high earlier in the session. Financial stocks were among today's biggest winners, benefiting from some curve-steepening activity after Fed Chair Powell outlined a shift towards an average inflation target. Under the new framework, the Fed would allow PCE inflation to run moderately beyond 2.0% over time to make up for years when it ran below 2.0%.From a sector perspective, the S&P 500 financials sector finished atop the standings with a 1.7% gain, followed by real estate (+1.4%), health care (+0.8%), and consumer staples (+0.6%). The communication services (-1.3%), consumer discretionary (-0.7%), and materials (-0.2%) sectors were the lone holdouts. Other positive factors today included reports that Microsoft (MSFT 226.58, +5.43, +2.5%) and Walmart (WMT 136.63, +5.93, +4.5%) are teaming up to possibly acquire TikTok US, and Abbott Labs (ABT 111.29, +8.10, +7.9%) receiving emergency use authorization from the FDA for its $5.00, 15-minute COVID-19 antigen test.Mega-cap growth stocks had a relatively weak outing today after an incredibly strong performance yesterday.  Microsoft was an exception, of course, and so was Tesla (TSLA 2238.75, +85.58, +4.0%). As an aside, Senate Majority Leader McConnell (R-KY) reportedly said stimulus talks remained at a stalemate, which may have been a contributing factor in the market's brief dip into negative territory around 1:00 p.m. ET. The market, however, swiftly rebounded into positive territory. Recapping the moves in the Treasury market, the 2-yr yield finished flat at 0.16%, while the 10-yr yield increased six basis points to 0.75% as investors sold longer-dated bonds following Fed Chair Powell's speech.

"Any insinuation to the contrary is unfounded and unansyed, " he added.Data from US users is stored in that country, with a backup in Singapore, according to TikTok.Han described On Thursday the rules and actions being taken to make it more difficult to find threatening, violent or dehumanizing content on TikTok.The platform has a zero-tolerance stance against accounts linked to white nationalism, male supremacy, anti-Semitism and "other hate-based ideologies," Han added.U.S. technology companies Microsoft and Oracle discuss the possible purchase of TikTok.gc/caw/mls/gmaLoad-Date: August 22, 2020End of Document

Faced with Trump's veto, TikTok will go to U.S. justiceCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 7, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 382 wordsBodyPEKON, China.- TikTok, china's social network banned for national security reasons in the United States, said they will do everything they can to reverse that decision and that, if Washington refuses to do so, they will go to U.S. Justice.In a statement posted on its website, TikTok claims to be "surprised" by the executive order signed yesterday by US President Donald Trump prohibiting any transaction with its developer, Chinese technology, ByteDance.We will use all (legal) remedies available to us to ensure that the rule of law is not discarded (...), if not with the Administration, it will be with the courts of the United States," he says.The social network, which has about 100 million users in the US country, believes that due procedures have not been respected and the law has never been respected, and that the U.S. government has never lent itself to seeking a "constructive solution."TikTok reports that Trump's order speaks of unre cited information and fears that the app "may be used" for disinformation campaigns.It also asserts that the user data it collects falls within the "industry standard for thousands of mobile applications worldwide". The social network also insists that it has never shared data with the Chinese government and has not censored content at Beijing's request."We have even expressed our willingness to agree on a full sale of our U.S. business to a U.S. company," the platform adds, referring to open negotiations with Microsoft that, if closed, could allow it to remain active in the U.S. country, where it enjoys great popularity.In the statement, TikTok states that the decision to veto it "creates a dangerous precedent for the concept of freedom of expression" and asks its users to exercise "their right to be heard" by contacting their political representatives and even the White House to show their opposition to the measure. Meanwhile, Beijing said today that the veto on TikTok - Trump also signed one in similar terms against WeChat, the "Chinese WhatsApp" - is a "shameless act of hegemony" by Washington.Chinese chancellor Wang Wenbin said China will protect the rights and interests of its companies and that the United States "should bear the consequences of its actions," although it did not specify details of possible retaliation.Load-Date: August 8, 2020End of Document

Trump's real goal is to 'kill' TikTok with its US ban, ByteDance accusesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 4, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 341 wordsBodyA U.S. investigation into ByteDance's TikTok really aims to end a Chinese-owned application that has become a sensation for Americans, founder Zhang Yimingsaid on Tuesday to his employees in China.In his second missive to his team in the same number of days, the employer indicated that a government investigation into the purchase of Musical.ly in 2017 by the company, TikTok's parent, intended to cause a total closure.Rising tensions between the US and China have led US politicians to warn that the app poses a potential threat to national security and to request an investigation into whether DATA from US users shared with Beijing, accusations that ByteDance has repeatedly rejected.ByteDance, based in the Chinese capital, has been pressured by the White House and US lawmakers to sell its TikTok operations in the US and now has until September 15 to hold negotiations with Microsoft for such an agreement. Trump commented Monday that any sale of TikTok's U.S. operations would have to include a substantial payment to the US, although it was unclear under what law he can withdraw a payment.While a forced sale of TikTok to an American buyer is "unreasonable," it remains part of a legal process and the company has no choice but to comply with the law, Zhang said."But this is not your goal, not even what you want. Their real goal is to achieve a comprehensive ban,"he wrote.On Monday, Zhang said ByteDance is exploring every possibility to resolve an increasingly intense confrontation with Washington and that the world's largest startup has not made a final decision on options. On Tuesday, the CEO noted that both he and ByteDance have been the subject of intense criticism in his country after receiving news of a possible sale and thanked Chinese employees for their efforts.Beijing has also gotten into the conflict. The Chinese government will not accept a acquisition of TikTok's U.S. operations by Microsoft and could take action against Washington if forced to sell, China Daily's state newspaper warned Tuesday in its editorial.Load-Date: August 5, 2020End of Document

The world could look very different to investors in three monthsCNN WireAugust 6, 2020 Thursday 12:03 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1055 wordsDateline: LONDON (CNN Business) BodyLONDON (CNN Business) --  As investors carefully scan an uncertain horizon, one thing is clear: The backdrop for markets will look very different in three months' time.In a note to clients this week, Goldman Sachs strategists including Kamakshya Trivedi predicted a "substantially different landscape" by December.They pointed to three potential developments:We'll know the results of sending kids back to school this fall. The US election will be behind us. A Covid-19 vaccine could be on the "verge of approval."On reopening schools, Goldman Sachs expects a "bumpy process" characterized by "some false starts," especially in the United States. That could hang over markets, particularly in September."The evidence so far suggests that there is a path to reopening schools without prompting a sharp increase in virus spread," the investment bank said. "But those examples have generally been in places where transmission has been very low and where strict protocols have been followed."The passage of the US election will also provide investors with greater clarity, particularly regarding the relationship with China. Goldman Sachs thinks that decoupling between the world's two biggest economies is poised to continue no matter who wins, though Joe Biden would be less likely to employ tariffs.Most importantly, Goldman Sachs thinks there's a "good chance" that at least one vaccine will be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration by the end of November, allowing it to be "broadly distributed" by mid-2021."This kind of timeline could see a substantial boost to GDP relative to a 'no-vaccine' case, particularly for the US, which is likely to lead the vaccine race and is likely to experience worse outcomes than in Europe without a vaccine," the bank's strategists said.They predict the S&P 500 will end the year around current levels, but see the potential for the index to shoot up another 11% if a viable vaccine comes into play.What it means: The picture for investors is murky this summer, with little transparency on the path of the virus or upcoming rounds of stimulus spending. But Wall Street thinks some clouds could clear before year-end."We're at a crossroads," Thomas Lee, cofounder of Fundstrat Global Advisors told my CNN Business colleague Alison Kosik on Wednesday.If it becomes evident that the virus has peaked in the United States and the surge of cases in the Sun Belt has been brought under control, investors should go on the offensive, he said.Of course, nothing is a given. In three months, the situation also could look materially worse, with cases rising in new parts of the United States. There are also growing concerns about a second wave hitting Europe and Asia.What Microsoft's long history in China means for TikTokMicrosoft has spent decades building goodwill with Beijing. That could help its bid to buy TikTok's operations in the United States and a few other countries --- that is, unless deteriorating US-China relations get in the way.Microsoft has emerged as the leading candidate to save TikTok from President Donald Trump's threat to ban the app unless it finds an American buyer. The app is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance. A deal would give Microsoft ownership and operation of TikTok services in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.Unlike other big US tech companies, Microsoft has major clout in China, and its products have a significant presence there, my CNN Business colleague Sherisse Pham reports.The backstory: Microsoft has been in China since 1992 and employs 6,000 people in the country. Its software is used by the Chinese government and companies, and LinkedIn is a popular social media platform for Chinese professionals. Bing is the only foreign search engine with any market share.The Washington-based company also boasts an A-list alumni network in China, thanks to the hugely influential Microsoft Research Lab Asia, or MSRA.Many founders and senior executives at companies such as Alibaba, smartphone maker Xiaomi and e-commerce upstart Pinduoduo got their start at Microsoft and were trained at MSRA. Even Zhang Yiming, the founder and CEO of ByteDance, briefly worked at Microsoft before reportedly leaving out of boredom.That said: Some Trump administration officials are suspicious that Microsoft is too cozy with Beijing. Microsoft-owned products such as Bing and Skype have enabled Chinese surveillance and censorship, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said in an interview on CNN Monday.Watch this space: Tensions over technology keep rising. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday urged American companies to remove "untrusted" Chinese-owned technology from their digital networks, detailing a broad plan aimed at dramatically curbing China's reach.Nintendo knocks it out of the parkSales of video games continue to skyrocket during the pandemic, and Nintendo is cashing in big time.The latest: The company said Thursday that net sales shot up 108% between April and June compared to the same period last year. Operating profit soared an eye-popping 428%.Sales of Switch gaming consoles and the popular "Animal Crossing: New Horizons" game continue to power earnings. Nintendo said it has now sold 22.4 million units of "Animal Crossing" since the game launched in March."Sales of this title continue to be strong with no loss of momentum, contributing greatly to the overall growth in software sales," the company said in its earnings release.That's not all: Zynga, which brought the world "FarmVille," is also thriving. The company raised its full-year earnings guidance on Wednesday."With so many of us staying at home, we saw heightened levels of player engagement, social connection and monetization in our portfolio," the company said in a statement. Shares are up more than 5% in premarket trading.Up nextHilton reports results before US markets open. Booking Holdings, Caesars Entertainment, Datadog, Uber, Yelp and Zillow follow after the close.Also today: Initial US claims for unemployment benefits for the week ending August 1 are expected to come in at nearly 1.42 million. That would be slightly lower than the number of claims received during the previous week.Coming tomorrow: How did the US job market fare during July?TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

TikTok strengthens communication battle against Donald TrumpCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 18, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 368 wordsBodyThe popular social network TikTok, accused of spying by Donald Trump's government, intensified its communication campaign on Monday, with a new website and a Twitter account dedicated to fighting "rumors.""Given the rumors and misinformation about TikTok that proliferate in Washington and in the media, we want to restore the truth," the company said on its website, with the motto "the last corner of the Internet's sun."U.S. President Donald Trump has accused the popular video-sharing platform of using U.S. user data to benefit Beijing in recent months, though without any proof.Trump signed two executive orders aimed at forcing ByteDance, a Chinese group that owns TikTok, to quickly sell the network's U.S. operations, otherwise it will block it in the United States."TikTok is not available in China. U.S. user data is stored in Virginia with a backup in Singapore," the company said. "TikTok never provided any American data to the Chinese government and would not do so if asked to do so," the platform's officials added.Against a backdrop of high trade and political tensions with China, the White House tenant has taken radical action against the network, which is very popular with younger people.On August 6, Trump banned TikTok and WeChat, China's tencent social network, from making any transactions with U.S. partners for 45 days because he considered them a threat to U.S. security, foreign policy and economy.On Friday, it signed a second executive order, forcing ByteDance to sell the U.S. operations of TikTok, its international social network, within 90 days."We've been trying to talk to the U.S. Government for almost a year to find a solution," TikTok reacted. "But we have been confronted with an administration that does not take the facts into account, does not respect legal procedures and tries to interfere in negotiations between private companies," the enforcement officials stress.U.S. computer giant Microsoft is in negotiations with ByteDance to buy TikTok, at least in the United States.ByteDance should also confirm that it has destroyed all data "from Us users obtained through TikTok and Musical.ly", a U.S. application acquired by Chinese society and merged with TikTokLoad-Date: August 19, 2020End of Document

TikTok sues Trump administration over looming US banCNN WireAugust 24, 2020 Monday 5:48 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 742 wordsDateline: WASHINGTON (CNN Business) BodyWASHINGTON (CNN Business) --  TikTok sued the Trump administration Monday in response to what it said is a "heavily politicized" executive order that seeks to ban the short-form video app from the United States.The suit marks a major escalation in the fight between President Donald Trump and the wildly popular TikTok, which has 100 million users in the US and is owned by a Chinese company, ByteDance. TikTok argued in California federal court that the administration did not give the company a fair chance to defend itself from allegations that it poses a national security risk. And it claimed Trump's executive order illegally rests on emergency powers law in ways that do not apply to TikTok. "We far prefer constructive dialogue over litigation," TikTok said in a blog post announcing the case. "But with the Executive Order threatening to bring a ban on our US operations --- eliminating the creation of 10,000 American jobs and irreparably harming the millions of Americans who turn to this app for entertainment, connection, and legitimate livelihoods that are vital especially during the pandemic --- we simply have no choice."TikTok's legal challenge reflects a high-stakes, last-ditch effort to prevent a looming ban by the Trump administration, which gave the company until Sept. 20 to address concerns that the app could "allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information --- potentially allowing China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage."TikTok has previously said that it stores data on its US users in the United States and in Singapore, and that it would refuse any request by the Chinese government for US user data.Since then, TikTok has explored selling its US business to Microsoft, and reportedly to Oracle as well. But with the suit, TikTok is going on the offensive --- challenging what it said is an unlawful executive order and a hastily completed national security review. TikTok's complaint, which was filed in the US District Court for the Central District of California, argued that the Trump administration ignored evidence TikTok presented to US national security investigators and that its order is part of a campaign to discredit China for Trump's own political gain.The complaint cited Trump's anti-China rhetoric, including his repeated references to the novel coronavirus as the "China virus" and "Kung flu." "The President's actions clearly reflect a political decision to campaign on an anti-China platform," TikTok's complaint said.For weeks, the Commitee on Foreign Investment in the United States has been analyzing TikTok and its potential risk to US security. In its blog post, TikTok alleged that CFIUS "rushed out its decision within five minutes of its deadline" concluding that it had identified national security risks in TikTok."The CFIUS letter was principally based on outdated news articles, failed to address the voluminous documentation that Plaintiffs had provided demonstrating the security of TikTok user data, and was flawed in numerous other respects," TikTok's complaint said. TikTok also claimed that Trump's justification for his executive order relies on the same emergency powers law that he cited in an earlier executive order targeting Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant. But Tiktok is nothing like Huawei, the company argued."TikTok Inc. is not a telecommunications provider and it does not provide the types of technology and services contemplated by the 2019 executive order," the complaint said. However, Trump's 2019 order does not refer to telecommunications providers, only to the "information and communications technology and services supply chain."Robert Chesney, a professor in national security law at the University of Texas-Austin, said TikTok's odds of success are not high on its due process argument --- though it may still be able to use the legal challenge to create delays in the ban."Getting the litigation delayed long enough so Joe Biden wins [the election] could be their whole game," Chesney said. But, he added: "I think it's unlikely the delay strategy achieves anything. I don't think Joe Biden will retract the executive order. They will be plenty hawkish on China." -- CNN's Selina Wang contributed reporting. TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

"It's the only method I can communicate with my family": WeChat shouldn't be banned from U.S.Miami Student: Miami UniversityAugust 5, 2020 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 800 wordsByline: Kylie PursifullBodyImagine living thousands of miles from home and not being able to message your family, hear their voices or see their faces, even through a screen.Imagine needing a certain form of communication to follow your dreams, but then that platform is potentially being stripped away.This is the reality of the possible ban of WeChat in the United States - a move that should not be made. According to Bloomberg News, WeChat, owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings, is the top communication app in mainland China and used by Chinese users globally. This includes many in the Miami community.President Trump suspects WeChat, TikTok and other Chinese apps are used for information warfare against the United States. Information warfare is the gathering, providing and denying of information to benefit one party while harming the other - in this situation, China against the U.S."There are a number of ... administration officials who are looking at the national security risks as it relates to TikTok, WeChat and other apps that have the potential for national security exposure, specifically as it relates to the gathering of information on American citizens by a foreign adversary," White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said.President Trump himself hasn't listed many specific reasons why WeChat is such a danger to our national security. For many people, I've seen it do nothing but good.Nick Vennefron, a local music producer from Oxford, and half of the group StarOcean Music, is feeling the effects of the possible ban of WeChat."WeChat is how I communicate with my business partner, who is the other half of our music duo from China. It's how I send him messages, files, voice messages and video clips," Vennefron said. "Sending him emails would be impossible, because most of the files we send back and forth are too large to be sent through email. If I lose communication with Ben (his partner), I won't be able to continue on with my music journey."Vennefron has been working at his music career for almost 10 years and is my boyfriend of eight years, so this possible ban hits home for me.After speaking with a couple of international students who are currently attending Miami, my heart has grown even heavier with the possibility of outlawing WeChat.Haoduan Jiang, a senior at Miami majoring in computer science, said the app is convenient for three reasons."First of all, there is no region restriction of using it, so no matter where I am in the world, I am able to use it to chat with my friend on WeChat," Jiang said. "The other option is to actually call their Chinese number, which would be [very] expensive. Google is banned in China, so there aren't many apps they can use to communicate with me."Xiu Gao, a graduate student, is another WeChat user."It's the only method I can keep in touch with my parents and elder sister," Gao said. "My mother can hear and see me through WeChat when she misses me. It is ridiculous to ban WeChat because it's only a simple communication software that can bring us with our family and friends together. It's the only method my parents can reach me when they miss me. Since they're nearly 60 years old, it's difficult to learn another social media like Facebook or Skype. I really don't want WeChat to be banned." How exactly does this help anything? What does banning a social media app solve, especially if there's no concrete evidence of information warfare?It could pose a threat to significantly drop the rates of international studentswho come into the U.S., which would hurt universities like Miami already decreasing in those demographics.When you come here, it's supposed to be about achieving your goals and dreams. How is someone supposed to come to America and not be able to communicate with their family about those dreams? Sure, a few alternatives exist, but none offer the features and accessibility of WeChat when working around the censorship of the Chinese government.President Trump is not thinking about anyone else but himself in this situation. He isn't thinking of the international students who come thousands of miles away to build a new life for themselves. He isn't thinking about music producers and WeChat being their only way to communicate with their partners. America is the Land of the Free and Home of the Brave, but right now, it doesn't feel too damn free.Imagine moving to a new country and feeling very alone, and not even being able to tell your family you made it. Imagine not being able to tell them your classes are going well, or that you made new friends and were adapting.How exactly, President Trump, is this information warfare? And if it is, what reasons do you have that could be good enough to almost entirely stop communication between loved ones?We're waiting. kypursifull8pursifkn@miamioh.eduLoad-Date: August 6, 2020End of Document

REPUBLICAN, DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS CALL ON USAGM TO RELEASE $20M FOR CENSORSHIP-EVADING TECHStates News ServiceAugust 4, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 547 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):By VOA NewsAugust 04, 2020 09:05 AMA group of Republican and Democratic lawmakers is pressing the Trump administration to release $20 million in congressionally approved funds aimed at promoting internet access throughout the world, especially in authoritarian countries such as China and Iran.Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement, "The Open Technology Fund provides a lifeline for people living under oppressive regimes." He added, "Unfortunately, this critical programming is on the brink of collapse."Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called the funding hold "a gift to repressive governments in China, Iran and elsewhere," according to the Washington Post.Lawmakers spoke out after Laura Cunningham, the acting chief executive of the Washington-based Open Technology Fund, accused USAGM and its leader, Michael Pack, of forcing the OTF to halt 49 of its 60 internet freedom projects that assist human rights and pro-democracy advocates in about 200 countries, because of the funding lapse.USAGM responded to Cunningham's letter in a statement to VOA that did not say whether the agency plans to release the funds but said "advancing internet freedom and protecting the safety of journalists and activists are among USAGM's highest priorities." The statement also accused OTF of unspecified security failures that jeopardize its mission and the security of people working to advance internet freedom.The Open Technology Fund is one of several government-funded global media entities, including Voice of America, overseen by Pack as chief executive of USAGM. He assumed control of USAGM in June after a protracted fight in Congress over his appointment by President Donald Trump.USAGM announced last month that the agency is looking into "long-term security failures" at all of the organizations it oversees, without specifying what those failures are, or how the agency proposes to address them.When he took over USAGM, Pack fired several heads of the government-funded media entities. But a federal appellate court in Washington recently blocked him from dismissing the board and officials at the Open Technology Fund, saying it believed the officials would eventually win their case contesting Pack's ability to oust them.In her letter, Cunningham said, "This arbitrary and unnecessary delay in funding has now compromised the work of our projects and jeopardized the lives of millions of users who rely on our technologies worldwide."This funding delay is needlessly undermining USAGM's reach and impact abroad," she said. "According to USAGM's own analytics, 85% of USAGM's audience in Iran and 40% of USAGM's audience in China rely on OTF-supported technologies to access USAGM content."Most troubling is that these actions will directly strengthen the hands of internet freedom adversaries, like the Chinese and Iranian governments, who are actively working to undermine freedom and democracy around the world," Cunningham said.She asked Pack to release the funding "so that we can resume the truly critical work of countering repressive censorship and surveillance abroad."Load-Date: August 4, 2020End of Document

In the letter, Mayer said the "political environment has sharply changed" and he had done "significant reflection" on what the administration-forced changes would mean for his role. "We are confident that a Walmart and Microsoft partnership would meet both the expectations of U.S. TikTok users while satisfying the concerns of USA government regulators".TikTok's general manager Vanessa Pappas will replace him on an interim basis. In a letter toTikTok's employees, Mayer had said that the company is going to rectify the situation in the USA "very soon".All of this is unlikely what Mr Mayer signed up for when he left Walt Disney to take on the role atTiktok. With ByteDance required to sell off itsTikTok's US division, that has put a damper on the company's global strategy. First, India bannedTikTok after its border skirmishes with China and the ByteDance-owned app "lost" one of its critical markets.TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer has quit after US President Donald Trump's order to block the app's operations in the country unless it sells its American assets to a domestic company. Meanwhile,TikTok have thanked Mayer and accepted his resignation.Some security experts have theorized that the Chinese government may be able to obtain American users' data through the app, sparking fears among U.S. politicians on both the left and the right.PlayStation 5 pre-order raffle signup opens to existing usersOh, and you'll need a U.S. address to ship it to, just in case you're not living over there anyway.

"Microsoft is ready to continue discussions to explore the purchase of TikTok in the United States," the company reported through a statement disseminated through its 'blog'.The president already announced Friday that he would ban TikTok using emergency economic powers or an executive order, although he did not provide further details on it.Critics of the app were wary of whether the data TikTok could collect from US users ended up in the hands of the Chinese government. The company, on the other hand, has assured that it stores its data outside China and would resist any attempt by Beijing to appropriate the information.Response from the owner of the 'app'ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming told employees on an internal letter Tuesday that the goal of the United States was not to force a sale of TikTok's operations in that country but rather to ban the application, and that some people have misconceptions about the situation.The letter, reported by the Chinese media and confirmed by a Reuters source, was sent only to Chinese ByteDance employees after news that the company was in talks to sell parts of TikTok to Microsoft.Load-Date: August 5, 2020End of Document

Sen. Peters Introduces Bipartisan Bill to Protect American Telecommunications Networks From Threats by Foreign SuppliersTargeted News ServiceAugust 12, 2020 Wednesday 7:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1198 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: DETROIT, Michigan BodySen. Gary Peters, D-Michigan, issued the following news release on Aug. 11:U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI) today announced he introduced bipartisan legislation that would help safeguard American telecommunications networks against cyber threats from untrusted foreign equipment suppliers, including those linked to the Chinese government. The Ensuring Network Security Act, which Peters introduced with Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI), would expand access to federal funding for telecommunications providers and educational institutions for the removal and replacement of prohibited telecommunications equipment from dangerous sources, including Huawei and ZTE. Equipment would be replaced by trusted and known suppliers. Peters and Johnson wrote a letter last month to Senate leaders regarding the need to prioritize removal of high-risk equipment from untrusted foreign suppliers."As we become increasingly interconnected - especially during this pandemic - it is vital our telecommunications networks are secured against adversaries like the Chinese government. We must have affordable and reliable telecommunications grids that can withstand national security and economic challenges," said Senator Peters, Ranking Member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a member of the Commerce, Science and Technology Committee. "This bipartisan bill will further transition our nation away from relying on foreign telecommunications networks that may jeopardize our security - while incentivizing and encouraging domestic suppliers. In doing so, we can strengthen the network security for Michigan.""The vulnerabilities associated with the development and deployment of 5G technology, especially the threat posed by China, are one of the 'generational threats that will shape our nation's future,' as the FBI recently put it," said Senator Johnson, Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. "This critical legislation addresses an eligibility issue so that all appropriate telecommunications carriers can access funds to 'rip and replace' equipment that poses a national security threat. In our increasingly connected world, it is imperative that 100% of our communications networks are secure, and this bill will help accomplish that.""The proposal by Senator Peters and Senator Johnson to the Secure and Trusted Communications Network Reimbursement Program is the critical support needed for Northern to revamp its Education Access Network (EAN), which ensures that 16,000 households, 105 communities and thousands of K-12 schoolchildren in Michigan's rural Upper Peninsula will continue to have a robust, high-speed broadband network to rely on," said Fritz Erickson, President, Northern Michigan University."The University's EAN provides critical broadband access to over 6,600 K-12 families and community members, 9,000 college students, faculty and staff, and 5 tribal communities in underserved rural areas of the Upper Peninsula," said Gavin Leach, Vice President of Finance and Administration, Northern Michigan University. "If the EAN had to stop existing because of the cost of the mandate to remove all Huawei equipment, it would be a great hardship for our region, especially for our schools and schoolchildren. Senator Peters' legislation is incredibly important to rural areas across the nation, where broadband options are limited, in meeting the federal requirements. We urge Congress to act quickly and pass it.""Thank you Senator Peters and Senator Johnson for leading on the critical need to fund the replacement of untrustworthy equipment in our telecom networks," said Geoffrey Starks, FCC Commissioner. "In particular, this legislation ensures that America's small carriers will get the targeted help they need to protect their customers, and secure our networks. It's important for Congress to act now to appropriate the necessary funds so carriers can start replacing their untrustworthy equipment as soon as possible.""Bad actors would exploit any vulnerability in America's communications networks to undermine our national security. So I want to commend Senator Johnson and Senator Peters for their leadership and work to secure our nation's communications infrastructure," said Brendan Carr, FCC Commissioner. "Their legislation would help ensure that America has the world's strongest and most secure 5G networks.""NTCA appreciates the leadership of Senators Peters and Johnson in introducing a bill to further address the security of the nation's communications supply chain," said Shirley Bloomfield, CEO, NTCA - The Rural Broadband Association. "NTCA supports effective steps to manage risks in our national communications networks and is pleased that the bill rightly recognizes the need to ensure providers, particularly our country's smallest communications companies, using equipment subsequently found to present such risks have the resources to remove and replace prohibited equipment.""I thank Senators Peters and Johnson for their continued focus on ensuring that all Americans have access to secure, trusted communications services," said Steven K. Berry, President and CEO, Competitive Carriers Association. "This legislation unequivocally recognizes that national security threats must be addressed and that there is a need for Congress to fund this priority. I also appreciate their work to clearly prioritize funding for those most in need, specifically, smaller carriers and providers serving high cost areas. I look forward to continued work with Congress on these important issues, including fully funding the reimbursement program."The bipartisan legislation would allow both telecommunications carriers that service between two to ten million customers and public and private educational institutions to apply for this funding through the Federal Communications Commission. The bill builds off the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act signed into law earlier this year, which prohibits telecommunications companies from installing equipment from untrusted suppliers and formed a program to reimburse telecommunications providers serving under two million customers.Peters has led numerous efforts to bolster American cybersecurity. Last month, Peters introduced legislation that would enable the National Guard to provide remote cybersecurity support and technical assistance to help states respond to cyber incidents. Peters also introduced a bipartisan bill this past January that would ensure that each state has its own Cybersecurity Coordinator, who would be responsible for helping to prevent and respond to cybersecurity threats by working with federal, state, and local governments as well as schools, hospitals, utilities and other entities at risk of cyber-attacks. Peters also introduced bipartisan legislation to implement stronger cybersecurity protections for K-12 educational institutions across the country. Schools are responsible for securing a considerable amount of sensitive records related to their students and employees, including student grades, family records, medical histories, and employment information.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7205714 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: August 12, 2020End of Document

TikTok influencers mourn possible US banCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 4, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 751 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- Days after the U.S. government challenged Facebook Inc.'s growing power over social media at a Congressional hearing, the Trump administration handed a gift to the company.Late last week, the president said he planned to shut down Facebook's biggest challenger: TikTok, the Chinese-owned video-sharing app. That threat caused panic among users who thought their digital club would soon be removed or sold to Microsoft Corp. Many popular TikTokers shifted their creative efforts to Instagram, Facebook's proprietary rival mobile app. But switching to Instagram is an unsatisfactory solution, said Max Beaumont, who created followers on TikTok documenting his path of self-improvement with videos about diet and skin care. TikTok has become "fundamentally an escape for a generation that is in isolation, and that needs it," he said. "The fact that one has a massive follow-up on TikTok doesn't necessarily translate to YouTube or Instagram or others." Beaumont organized an open letter with signers who had hundreds of thousands or millions of followers, asking Trump to keep TikTok.TikTok has widely attracted through his lip-sync and dance videos and a formidable artificial intelligence algorithm that offers fans an endless stream of more content of their interest. It has also contributed to rising geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, which have worsened amid the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. politicians have expressed concern that TikTok, owned by one of China's largest technology companies, is accumulating data on millions of U.S. users and could be forced to hand them over to the Chinese government. TikTok has repeatedly denied such allegations, but Trump seems determined to take action against the company. The president said Monday that TikTok will have to close in the U.S. no later than September 15, unless it reaches an agreement to sell social network operations in the country to a U.S. company. He also said that the Federal Government should be paid a "substantial amount of money" as part of such an agreement. TikTok's problems arise just as Facebook faces several antitrust tests in the US. Facebook CHIEF executive Mark Zuckerberg was questioned, along with peers of other major U.S. tech players who are also under scrutiny, at a Congressional committee hearing last week. At the meeting, members of the House of Representatives presented documents showing that Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 primarily to eliminate what was then a rising competitor. Zuckerberg argued that any weakening of American tech companies, such as a rupture for antitrust reasons, would only strengthen China and its influence over the internet and other technologies. But U.S. restrictions on TikTok might also prove otherwise. On Sunday, ByteDance said he strictly respects local laws and has faced complicated and unimaginable difficulties, including "plagiarism and defamation" by Facebook.In recent days, TikTok devotees flooded the app with tributes to the platform, similar to when mourning the loss of a friend, and protests against Trump for what many younger users considered a personal offense. Videos filled with tears, outrage and anger helped boost the hashtag #savetiktok (save TikTok) in more than 800 million views, even after the news of a possible agreement with Microsoft gave hope that the app might not becompletely eliminated.Nearly 60% of people under the age of 25, often classified as A Z-generation, oppose the TikTok ban, according to a July survey conducted by Morning Consult Brand Intelligence. At all ages, about a third of Americans have never heard of TikTok, while a third have a favorable impression and a third have an unfavorable view of the app, according to the survey.Users and market experts say that part of TikTok's appeal is its global reach, which drives users to internet stardom by exposing their videos to billions of users worldwide. "TikTok has great appeal not only in the U.S. but in many countries around the world," said Debra Aho Williamson, EMarketer's senior analyst. "Dividing it into pieces would greatly hurt your overall growth."Many TikTok users applauded a possible acquisition by Microsoft, such as a white knight who saves his beloved digital space.With 45 days to develop an agreement acceptable to the U.S. government, as well as to Microsoft and TikTok, it is not certain that the transaction will be completed.Original Note:TikTok Influencers Mourn Potential Ban, Flock to Instagram©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: August 5, 2020End of Document

Trump says he will ban TikTokCNN WireAugust 1, 2020 Saturday 6:28 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 510 wordsDateline: (CNN Business) Body (CNN Business) --  President Donald Trump said Friday night that he will ban the popular short-form video app TikTok from operating in the United States, rejecting a potential deal for Microsoft to buy the app from its Chinese-owned parent company."As far as TikTok is concerned, we're banning them from the United States," Trump said to reporters while aboard Air Force One.Trump said he could use emergency economic powers or an executive order. It was not immediately clear what such an order would look like and what legal challenges it might face."Well, I have that authority," he said.Earlier on Friday, people working on the issue within the Trump administration expected the President to sign an order to force ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns the social media platform, to sell the US operations of TikTok, according to a person familiar with the matter.The move was aimed at resolving policymakers' concerns that the foreign-owned TikTok may be a national security risk. The US government is conducting a national security review of TikTok and is preparing to make a policy recommendation to Trump, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters this week at the White House. ByteDance has been considering changes to its corporate structure and had reportedly already been looking into the possibility of selling a majority stake in TikTok.Microsoft is in talks to acquire TikTok, according to the New York Times, citing a person with knowledge of the discussions. Microsoft declined to comment to CNN Business. Trump firmly rejected the idea of a potential spin off deal satisfying national security concerns.The app has exploded in popularity in the US and other western countries, becoming the first Chinese social media platform to gain significant traction with users outside of its home country. It was downloaded 315 million times in the first three months of this year, more quarterly downloads than any other app in history, according to analytics company Sensor Tower.Critics of TikTok worry that the data it collects on its US users could end up in the hands of the Chinese government, though TikTok has said it stores its data outside of China and that it would resist any attempts by Beijing to seize the information."TikTok US user data is stored in the US, with strict controls on employee access. TikTok's biggest investors come from the US. We are committed to protecting our users' privacy and safety as we continue working to bring joy to families and meaningful careers to those who create on our platform," TikTok spokesperson Hilary McQuaide told CNN Business Saturday. Cybersecurity experts have said TikTok's potential risk to national security is largely theoretical and that there is no evidence to suggest that TikTok's user data has been compromised by Chinese intelligence.This story and its headlining have been updated with President Trump's comments Friday night.CNN's Zachary Cohen and Sherisse Pham contributed to this report.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

U.S.- Trump signs an executive order banning "any" transaction with the company that owns TikTokCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 7, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 406 wordsBodyMADRID, 7 (EUROPA PRESS)U.S. President Donald Trump has on Thursday signed an executive order banning "any" transaction with the company that owns the TikTok mobile app, ByteDance, within 45 days.Specifically, the order prohibits "any transaction by any person, or with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States with ByteDance or its subsidiaries," as disseminated.In its view, the spread in the Usp"of mobile applications developed and owned by Enterprises in China remains under threat of national security, foreign policy and the U.S. economy" and specifically alluded to the threat posed by TikTok in particular.As he explained, TikTok automatically captures "large amounts of information" from its users, including information about the internet and other network activities, such as location and browsing data and search histories.Thus, "this data collection threatens to allow the Communist Party of China (PCCh) access to personal and American-owned information" something that would potentially allow "tracking the locations of federal employees and contractors, building personal information records for blackmail, and conducting corporate espionage." "The risks are real," Trump has riveted.In addition, it has criticized the application of "censorship" content that the PCCh considers "politically sensitive", such as those relating to the Hong Kong protests or the Chinese Executive's treatment of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities. "It can be used for disinformation campaigns that benefit the PCCh," he said.The representative has also signed a similar executive order addressed to the wechat messaging app, owned by the Chinese company Tencent Holdings Ltd.Trump has already warned earlier this week that his government will ban TikTok from September 15 if it doesn't reach a sale deal on its U.S. operations before that date.Microsoft on Sunday confirmed its interest in acquiring part of TikTok, which the president appreciated in a positive way. The president already announced Friday that he would ban TikTok using emergency economic powers or an executive order, although he did not provide further details on it.Critics of the app were wary of whether the data TikTok could collect from US users could end up in the hands of the Chinese government, even though the company has assured it stores its data outside China and would resist any attempt by Beijing to seize the information.Load-Date: August 8, 2020End of Document

REMARKS ON USAID ADVANCING RELIGIOUS LIBERTY FROM USAID ACTING ADMINISTRATOR JOHN BARSA ON A VIRTUAL ROUND TABLE WITH THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM INSTITUTEUS Fed NewsAugust 19, 2020 Wednesday 3:55 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 2365 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, Aug. 19 -- The U.S. Agency for International Development issued the following newsletter:MR. BARKER: Hello. I'm Jermy Barker, director of the Religious Freedom Institute's Middle East Action Team. And it's my privilege to welcome you to today's online event. We're looking forward to a great conversation on the United States Agency for International Development's role in advancing religious liberty. For those who are not familiar with the Religious Freedom Institute, RFI is committed to achieving broad acceptance of religious liberty as a fundamental human right, a source of individual and social flourishing, a cornerstone of a successful society, a driver of national and international security. In short, RFI's work is to secure religious freedom for everyone everywhere.Today's event will be a conversation lead by Kent Hill, RFI co-founder and senior fellow for Eurasia, the Middle East, and Islam. Leading the conversation with USAID's acting administrator John Barsa and the agency's chief advisor for International Religious Freedom, Samah Norquist. Time permitting, we will have time at the end for -- of the conversation for some questions. We've had a number submitted in advance. You can also submit questions through the chat feature below this video on YouTube or Facebook. Please feel free to post questions there throughout the event. And as we have time, we'll try to get to a few of those questions at the end. So, now it's my privilege to hand over the rest of the event to my colleague, Kent Hill.MR. HILL: Thanks very much, Jeremy. And welcome everybody and particularly to acting administrator Barsa and Samah Norquist who's the point person for USAID on religious freedom. And I should mention at the outset, we've had a terrific RSVP for this event, well over 100 people from all over the world, as a matter of fact. And so, we welcome all of you to this. And I think that bespeaks the fact that there is a sense that religious freedom is important and not just for the religious individuals involved but for societies and for human flourishing and for -- we're going to talk about this a little bit later, national security stability and things like that. But as it turns out, we've actually had an event the last couple of weeks that's extremely troubling. Everybody knows about the terrible explosion and the aftermath of chaos that has occurred in Lebanon.And what's particularly troubling about this is that Lebanon was one of the few places in the Middle East where a variety of religions had gotten along reasonably well, had been a democracy. There were major economic and corruption problems as we all know, but at least it was a place that many pointed to as a poster child for religious groups being able to get along together. And one of the big questions that is now right in front of us, staring us all right in the face, is whether the violence and the protest, much of it legitimate to the corruption, will lead to chaos and sectarianism which in other parts of the Middle East and the world has really spelled the end of religious freedom and the rising of extremists.And as it turns out, the acting administrator of USAID, John Barsa, has just gone briefly to Lebanon to take a look at the situation, to talk to religious and political and other leaders. He even gave blood. That was on Twitter, I guess, that he managed to take time out to give blood while he was there. But I think we might start today by just asking John Barsa, if you could just give us a few reflections on what you saw there and particularly maybe this question, the religious leaders he talked to there and others, do you believe that they have a major role to play in calming things down and producing a more stable situation?ACTING ADMINISTRATOR BARSA: Over to me?MR. HILL: Over to you.ACTING ADMINISTRATOR BARSA: Well, thank you, Ken. Thank you so much to you, to the Religious Freedom Institute for this invitation and for coordinating the event. There's so much to talk about in terms of not just what I saw in Lebanon, but I'm going to say this works for international, you know, protecting religious freedom. So, I'm happy to take any questions as well as prepared comments and try to cover some of what we do but happy to engage in a conversation to the extent that time allows. We're certainly grateful for our collaboration with RFI. We certainly look forward to building on this important partnership.As Kent mentioned, I just got back from Beirut yesterday. I was there on a short visit, mostly to observe the damage from the explosion and oversee USAID's response. But what I saw on the ground shook me to the core. It's -- the level of destruction and loss of life is unimaginable. Throughout my career, I've traveled to many disaster sites and nothing I have ever experienced comes close to what I saw in Beirut. On behalf of the USAID and the United States government and the people of the United States, I offer my sincerest condolences to all of those affected by the catastrophic explosions last week. Three hundred thousand people have lost their homes, and many are still waiting to hear from missing family and friends. We are praying for the survivors and their families and stand with the people of Lebanon. This disaster could not have come at a worse time for the Lebanese people. They are already suffering from an ailing economy, and their generosity is being pushed to the limit hosting nearly 900,000 Syrian refugees. And when you consider the growing number of COVID-19 cases, the agony and despair on the ground becomes so much more worse.The U.S. will continue to stand with Lebanese people as they grieve and cry for transparency and accountability from their government. I can't get this quote from Lebanese American writer Kahlil Gibran out of my head. It goes, "Out of the suffering have emerged the strongest souls. The most massive characters are seared with scars." It certainly reminds me of the Lebanese people as the most resilient people in the world. I met with some of those people who are part of the faith-based community in Lebanon. I was able to really understand and see their needs and challenges that they face in responding effectively to the disaster. USAID's proud to be collaborating with these organizations. They're immensely important to Lebanon as the country works to rebuild.Support for faith-based organizations has long been one of USAID's policy priorities, not only in the Middle East region but around the world. Working with these types of organizations with extensive on-the-ground contacts and expertise is part of a new strategy that USAID is undertaking.In 2019, we launched our new partnership initiative, what we call NPI, in Northern Iraq. It was the first time USAID has worked directly with local groups in nearly 20 years. We were looking for ways to expand similar programming and grow our partnerships with civil society groups and faith-based organizations across the region, including Lebanon.As a Cuban American, I know firsthand how discrimination on the basis of faith can sow chaos, destroy lives, and uproot society, and divide families. My mother, a devout Catholic, was forced to flee Cuba as the nightmare of Fidel Castro's communist revolution began to cascade throughout the country. She risked her life and well-being by immigrating to the United States in search of better opportunities, but more importantly, to enjoy life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. My mother was one of the lucky ones. Christians who were unable to escape faced harassments, beating, imprisonment, and even death. To this day, the totalitarian Castro regime has continued to surveil, control, and harass church leaders and worshippers. That is why combating religious persecution means so much to me. It is deeply ingrained in my personal upbringing, and it pains me to see an intense persecution in my mother's homeland which is why, like President Trump and so many other Americans, I'm deeply concerned with the decline of religious freedom across the globe. Believers of nearly all faiths, including Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, Muslims, and Jews have been increasingly persecuted over the past decade.For Americans, religious freedom is grounded in our founding documents and has always been a bipartisan issue. Under President Clinton, the International Religious Freedom Act was signed. And under President Obama, the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act was enacted. More recently, President Trump signed the bipartisan Iraq and Syria Genocide Relief and Accountability Act, which authorizes assistance to victims of genocide and crimes against humanity committed by ISIS. He also signed the Nicaragua Human Rights and Anti-corruption Act, which imposes sanctions against violators of civil rights in Nicaragua.In June, the president signed the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act. This legislation allows the U.S. to take decisive measures against the Chinese government in response to its heinous treatment of the Uyghurs and other minority communities and Xinjiang.Finally, this past June, the president followed up on these unprecedented statements of principle by releasing the executive order on advancing International Religious Freedom. This executive order makes clear that advancing religious freedom is a major U.S. foreign policy and national security priority, one that USAID is proud to play a key role in implementing.Our mission at USAID is to help countries continue along their journey to self-reliance. We empower countries to become more free, more prosperous, and more accountable to their citizens. When governments suppress freedom of religion, they prevent entire segments of society from making meaningful contributions to their country's political and economic development. This is antithetical to USAID's goal of fostering inclusive societies. Embracing pluralism is fundamental to ensuring stability and prosperity. USAID is committed to addressing the needs of vulnerable communities, including those of religious and ethnic minorities. Our programs aim to respond to and prevent mass atrocities including genocide.There are a couple of areas where we're really seeing religious persecution. Most recently in northern Iraq and Syria, our efforts to focus on helping communities recover from the genocidal campaign by the so-called Islamic State. In Nigeria, we are working to protect Christian communities and other vulnerable groups from attacks and destabilization by Boko Haram, Islamic State in West Africa and other jihadists. For decades, the Rohingya have been driven out of Burma, periodically forced to flee to other surrounding countries in Muslim majority nations such as Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Indonesia. USAID, in partnership with the State Department, has provided more than $950 million in humanitarian aid for IDPs in Burma and refugees in host communities in Bangladesh.Lastly, we remain steadfast in our support for persecuted minority groups in Xinjiang, China. USAID will not stand idly by this communist -- Chinese Communist Party that carries out abuses, targeting people who simply want to practice their customs and faith. As you can see, USAID has an unwavering commitment to International Religious Freedom around the world. President Trump's executive order on International Religious Freedom cements the important role our agency plays in carrying out this U.S. foreign policy priority.Here's how the order does that. First, the United States will budget at least $50 million per year on programs that advance International Religious Freedom. USAID is working closely with the State Department to realize this and ensure that protecting religious freedom is a central tenet of our foreign assistance strategy. Our programs will focus on preventing attacks on religious minority communities and preserving pluralistic cultural heritage. We'll ensure our assistance addresses the political, social, and economic constraints that religious and ethnic communities face on a daily basis.Second, the State Department and USAID now mandate that foreign service officers undergo training on how to promote International Religious Freedom. We've already gotten a head start on this. In January 2020, USAID mandated all its foreign service officers to take training on upholding religious liberty.Third, the order states that the U.S. government will expand the availability of economic tools to support allies of religious freedom and confront bad actors. This aspect of the order will likely be carried out by either increasing our support to religious freedom programming, by realigning foreign aid to better reflect the country's circumstances or restricting the issue of visas and deploying Global Magnitsky's sanctions where appropriate.The Executive Order recognizes that healthy societies protect religious freedom, just as they protect property rights, legal rights, and human civil rights of all kind. USAID is proud to play such a key role in one of the president's top priorities. And you'll hear from Samah Norquist soon who serves as our new chief religious freedom advisor and is leading the implementation effort.In closing, it's truly an honor to be with you here today. RFI, its staff, and the many advocates listening in play just as important the role of advancing this cause as the U.S. government. It doesn't fall on deaf ears to say that religious freedom is under siege worldwide. USAID recognizes this troubling trend and is committed to further strengthening our efforts to advance religious liberty, and make sure that countries recognize it as a prerequisite for inclusive stability and prosperity. Thank you, again, for helping to amplify this important issue. I look forward to engaging further discussion, taking questions, and having a conversation with you. Thank you so very much.*(The rest document can be viewed at :https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/aug-19-2020-remarks-usaid-advancing-religious-liberty-usaid-acting-administrator) For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at contentservices@htlive.comLoad-Date: August 20, 2020End of Document

Trump signed a decree forcing ByteDance to sell his TikTok shares in the US within 90 daysCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 15, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 492 wordsBodyPresident Donald Trump on Friday signed a decree forcing Chinese group ByteDance to sell the activities in the United States from TikTok, its international social network, within 90 days, thus materializing repeated threats.The US official has for months accused the popular video-sharing platform of diverting data from US users to deliver to the Chinese government."There is credible evidence that leads me to believe that ByteDance (...) it could take measures that threaten to damage America's national security," the presidential decree explains.Against a backdrop of strong trade and political tensions with China, the US president already took radical action a week ago against TikTok and WeChat, another Chinese digital gem. He banned transactions with U.S. partners from 45 days of the announcement.The decree signed on Friday specifies that the buyer must be A.D. and "demonstrate his will and ability to comply with this decree."US computer giant Microsoft is in negotiations with ByteDance to buy TikTok, at least in the United States, or even more broadly.ByteDance must also confirm that it has destroyed all data "from US users, obtained or derived from TikTok and Musical.ly", a US application that had been purchased by the Chinese company and merged with TikTok.U.S. President Donald Trump (SARAH SILBIGER/)Trump accuses the app of exposing Americans to the risk of data theft or propaganda by the Chinese-born company.For its part, the company that owns the application has repeated that TikTok has reached more than 100 million Americans because it is home to "training, self-expression and connection"."We are committed to continuing to bring joy to families and careers that are meaningful to those who believe in our platform for many years," the company has conveyed in a statement, collected by the newspaper 'Politico'.Trump last week signed an executive order to ban "any" transaction with ByteDance in 45 days. Specifically, the order prohibits "any transaction by any person, or with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States with ByteDance or its subsidiaries," as disseminated.As explained by the representative, TikTok automatically captures "large amounts of information" from its users, including information about the internet and other network activities, such as location and browsing data and search histories.Thus, "this data collection threatens to allow the Communist Party of China access to personal and American-owned information" something that would potentially allow "tracking the locations of federal employees and contractors, building personal information records for blackmail, and conducting corporate espionage."(With information from AFP and Europa Press)MORE ON THESE TOPICS:Trump criticized the Russian Covid-19 vaccine: "We believe it's important to go through the entire testing process"Mike Pence called Alvaro Uribe "hero" and called for an end to his house arrestLoad-Date: August 16, 2020End of Document

Why Microsoft wants to purchase TikTokUSA TODAYAugust 4, 2020 TuesdayFIRST EDITIONCopyright 2020 Gannett Company, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: MONEY; Pg. 2BLength: 854 wordsByline: Jessica Guynn and Mike Snider, USA TODAYBodySo why does Microsoft want to buy TikTok, a social media service favored by American teens? It could be that the stodgy software giant's long-awaited fountain of youth.Microsoft isn't exactly tech's most consumer-friendly company. Just think of the long list of doomed products marooned over the years: Groove Music, Mixer streaming service, the social network Socl, the Win-dows Phone, the Zune digital music player.But Microsoft aspires to break out of its Windows desktop, suit-and-tie, 9-5 image to capture more of the consumer market.Early on in 2007, it saw the potential for social media, investing $240 million in Facebook at a $15-billion valuation and even offering to buy Mark Zuckerberg's company outright.A TikTok acquisition would deliver something that has eluded the software giant for years: a major platform to rival Facebook and Google-owned YouTube. And it could remake its image with young people.TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, is quickly emerging as a potent competitor to Snapchat, Facebook and Facebook-owned Instagram, says eMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson."Getting TikTok would give it another chance to get in on a fast-growing, youth-oriented social media property and be a way to try to get back at Facebook for spurning its advances," Williamson said in a statement.Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives agrees."This would be a major foray into the social media space which has been long overdue for Microsoft over the last decade," he said.A TikTok acquisition would be a "crown jewel" snapped up at a discount, "an asset with 100 million users, massive momentum, engagement, advertising revenue and something they could cross-sell into the broader Microsoft base," Ives said.Microsoft wants your data, tooPerhaps the biggest prize of all? Vast amounts of data about TikTok users.That data could be used by Microsoft in building software and hardware projects, and not just Xbox. For the first time, it would have deep insight into consumer behavior and a real hook into young people who are being taught on Chromebooks and other Google products in classrooms and scrolling through Snapchat and Facebook-owned Instagram in their spare time.Protection of that data is Microsoft's biggest selling point to the Trump administration which is concerned about TikTok's ties to the Chinese government.TikTok, which is currently owned by a Chinese company, has come under scrutiny and investigation in the U.S. over allegations it is supplying user data to Beijing, a charge that company officials have denied."Microsoft would ensure that all private data of TikTok's American users is transferred to and remains in the United States," Microsoft said.President Donald Trump's threat to issue an executive order to ban TikTok in the U.S. follows another from last year that, due to national security concerns, effectively banned Chinese telecom giant Huawei.TikTok represents not just a risk of data privacy Chinese surveillance, "but also a direct challenge to U.S. technological dominance," said Michael Priem, founder and CEO at Modern Impact, an advertising technology firm Minneapolis. "TikTok has become the fastest-growth social platform in history and its inception as a Chinese technology threatens the U.S. reputation," he said. "The U.S. using sanctions to intervene in its usage is unprecedented."What kind of data are we talking about? Your location, times you are on the app, the time of day you consume certain genres or content, says Shelly Palmer, CEO at The Palmer Group, a tech strategy advisory group."By your behaviors (known as behavioral data), you 'teach' the algorithm exactly what you love, what you hate, what engages you and what you will ignore," Palmer said."The vast amount of data gathered from your behaviors on TikTok allow Bytedance to predict, with astounding accuracy, what you are or are not likely to do," Palmer said. "This is an unprecedented capability."While the data is not personally identifiable, "the concern has been, will or would China breach these data standards that are regulated here in the U.S. and in Europe and many parts of the world," Priem said.The other upside for Microsoft?Potential advertising dollars. TikTok would boost Microsoft's share of the U.S. digital display ad market. This year, eMarketer predicts Microsoft to hold just 1.5% of that market, slightly ahead of Snapchat but well behind Facebook's 42% and Google's 10.4%."From an advertising business standpoint, the value of TikTok to Microsoft could potentially be very large, but I want to emphasize that it's just potential at this point," eMarketer's Williamson said. "TikTok is very early in the development of its ad business, and there's no guarantee that it will attract a large share of ad dollars."What it does have: a broad cross-section of marketers and  creative ad formats, Williamson said. "But to build a lasting ad business, TikTok also needs to develop easy self-serve tools that allow marketers to buy ads in bulk, using automated buying tools. Microsoft could help with this, although it's not particularly well known for its ad technology." Load-Date: August 4, 2020End of Document

JOHNSON INTRODUCES BIPARTISAN BILL TO PROTECT AMERICAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS FROM THREATS BY FOREIGN SUPPLIERSStates News ServiceAugust 11, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 822 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Wisconsin Senator Ronald Johnson:U.S. Senators Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Gary Peters (D-Mich.) announced Tuesday that they introduced bipartisan legislation to help safeguard American telecommunications networks against cyber threats from untrusted foreign equipment suppliers, including those linked to the Chinese government. The Ensuring Network Security Act would specifically expand access to federal "rip and replace" funding for telecommunications providers and educational institutions for the removal and replacement of prohibited telecommunications equipment from dangerous sources, including Huawei and ZTE. The senators wrote a letter last month to Senate leaders regarding the need to prioritize removal of high-risk equipment from untrusted foreign suppliers."The vulnerabilities associated with the development and deployment of 5G technology, especially the threat posed by China, are one of the 'generational threats that will shape our nation's future,' as the FBI recently put it," said Senator Johnson, chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a member of the Senate Commerce Committee. "This critical legislation addresses an eligibility issue so that all appropriate telecommunications carriers can access funds to 'rip and replace' equipment that poses a national security threat. In our increasingly connected world, it is imperative that 100% of our communications networks are secure, and this bill will help accomplish that.""As we become increasingly interconnected especially during this pandemic it is vital our telecommunications networks are secured against adversaries like the Chinese government. We must have affordable and reliable telecommunications grids that can withstand national security and economic challenges," said Senator Peters, ranking member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a member of the Senate Commerce Committee. This bipartisan bill will further transition our nation away from relying on foreign telecommunications networks that may jeopardize our security while incentivizing and encouraging domestic suppliers. In doing so, we can strengthen the network security for Michigan.""Bad actors would exploit any vulnerability in America's communications networks to undermine our national security. So I want to commend Senator Johnson and Senator Peters for their leadership and work to secure our nation's communications infrastructure," said FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr . "Their legislation would help ensure that America has the world's strongest and most secure 5G networks.""Thank you Senator Peters and Senator Johnson for leading on the critical need to fund the replacement of untrustworthy equipment in our telecom networks," said Geoffrey Starks, FCC commissioner. "In particular, this legislation ensures that America's small carriers will get the targeted help they need to protect their customers, and secure our networks. It's important for Congress to act now to appropriate the necessary funds so carriers can start replacing their untrustworthy equipment as soon as possible.""NTCA appreciates the leadership of Senators Peters and Johnson in introducing a bill to further address the security of the nation's communications supply chain," said Shirley Bloomfield, CEO, NTCA - The Rural Broadband Association. "NTCA supports effective steps to manage risks in our national communications networks and is pleased that the bill rightly recognizes the need to ensure providers, particularly our country's smallest communications companies, using equipment subsequently found to present such risks have the resources to remove and replace prohibited equipment.""I thank Senators Peters and Johnson for their continued focus on ensuring that all Americans have access to secure, trusted communications services," said Steven K. Berry, President and CEO, Competitive Carriers Association. "This legislation unequivocally recognizes that national security threats must be addressed and that there is a need for Congress to fund this priority. I also appreciate their work to clearly prioritize funding for those most in need, specifically, smaller carriers and providers serving high cost areas. I look forward to continued work with Congress on these important issues, including fully funding the reimbursement program."The bipartisan legislation would allow both telecommunications carriers that service between two to ten million customers and public and private educational institutions to apply for this funding through the Federal Communications Commission. The bill builds off the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act, signed into law earlier this year, which prohibits telecommunications companies from installing equipment from untrusted suppliers and formed a program to reimburse telecommunications providers serving under two million customers.Load-Date: August 12, 2020End of Document

PEN America digital freedom program director Matt Bailey said the following:"The president's twin orders to effectively ban TikTok and WeChat in the U.S. respond to real problems with overly blunt tools. These orders shine a harsh light on the expansive and expanding world of apps and tools that spy on their users, and the normalization of that surveillance."We, like many others, are particularly concerned about the privacy and security of users' information on TikTok and WeChat, as well as the reach of censorship and influence operations by the Chinese government."All governments should adopt transparent, watertight consumer protections that ensure that, as our lives move increasingly online, our personal information cannot be sucked away without our knowledge and swept up by governments and corporations for uses that have nothing to do with a gaming or messaging app."It bears noting, of course, that a slew of major U.S. apps and digital platforms have long been banned in China. Nonetheless, banning apps wholesale in the name of national security is a risky business, particularly amid an escalating tit-for-tat set of tensions in the U.S.-China relationship. The internet must remain open and global; good governance, not bans, is what is needed."[Category: Government/Public Administration]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7203341 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: August 8, 2020End of Document

TikTok's strategy to tackle Donald Trump's onslaughtCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 18, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 466 wordsBodyA nueva website and a Twitter account are the first weapons that the Centennials' favorite app to deal with the disinformation campaign launched against the Chinese company by US President Donald Trump."Given the rumors and misinformation about TikTok proliferating in Washington and the media, we want to make things clear," the company says in place.In early August, the Trump administration banned doing business with TikTok, of Chinese developer ByteDance,and with WeChatof Chinese technology company Tencent,as it considers them a threat to the country's national security for providing data of American users to Beijing.Since then, the social network has been striving to clean up its image and combat the information disseminated on the company. TikTok launched tiktokus.info,a website that collects generic company information, statements from its representatives and company-related news, as well as a "frequently asked questions" section and another dedicated to "expert opinion"."Given the rumors and misinformation about TikTok proliferating in Washington and the media, we want to make things clear," the company says in its new place.Under the heading "The last Sunny Corner of the Internet", TikTok defends its application as the place where millions of people "express themselves creatively, enjoy entertaining content and engage with a diverse global community."In addition, TikTok took advantage of this new channel to ensure that it never provided data from its US users to the Chinese government. "Any insinuation to the contrary is unfounded and unawarely false,"they added.The company also launched the Twitter account @tiktok_comms with the aim of sharing TikTok news and updates.Although it is common for companies to have their own communication teams and channels, it is true that this particular campaign seems designed ex profeso to react more quickly to possible information that goes against their interests, especially in the current situation in which it is located.Against a backdrop of strong trade and political tensions with China, the U.S. military already took radical measures against the network heavily used by younger people 10 days ago: it banned it, from 45 days after the action announced, transactions with US partners.On Friday, Donald Trump signed a second executive order to force ByteDance to sell the U.S. operations of TikTok, his international social network, within 90 days."For almost a year, we have tried to discuss with the U.S. government to find a solution," TikTok reacted."But we are facing an administration that does not give any weight to the facts, does not respect the legal procedures and tries to meddle in the negotiations between private companies."To all this, Microsoft is in advanced negotiations to buy the app.Source: AFPLoad-Date: August 19, 2020End of Document

In addition, they also targeted their cyberattacks against human rights activists in North America and Hong Kong.U.S. authorities believe That Li and Dong are in Chinese territory, beyond the scope of American justice. Prosecutors say in some instances acted "for their personal benefit" and others to give the Chinese government an advantage.With information from Europa PressMORE ON THIS TOPIC:Russia hacked the mail of former British Trade Secretary and stole classified information from US-UK trade negotiationsA report details how China's hack into the Vatican and its offices in Hong KongLoad-Date: August 7, 2020End of Document

TikTok files lawsuit against U.S. for banCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 24, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 286 wordsBodyThe complaint was filed with an executive order issued on August 6 to ban the platform for the possibility that the application could be manipulated by the Chinese government, TikTok explained in a statement."But, as the U.S. government well knows, the plaintiffs have taken extraordinary steps to protect the privacy and security of TikTok's user in the United States," the company said in the statement.President Donald J. Trump set a deadline for ByteDance to conclude its operations in that country, including pressures for the purchase of the platform by US technology companies, amid the U.S.-China trade war.In July, Microsoft, one of the leading software and technology companies, disclosed that it was exploring the purchase of the app, which would be related to the Trump administration's request to ByteDance to divest into the U.S. side of that company, while the apple technology also refused to be interested in acquiring the platform.TikTok argued that the platform's key staff, including the executive director, global security officer and general counsel, are Americans, based in that country, so they are not subject to Chinese law.The company, which has 100 million U.S. users, as well as more than 1,500 employees in the United States, accused the Trump administration of ignoring its efforts to address its concerns about its commitment to serving the U.S. market and its alleged relationship with the Asian giant's government."Content moderation in the United States is also led by a team based in that country and operates independently of China, and, as noted above, the TikTok app stores data from U.S. users on servers located in the United States and Singapore," the social network added. Load-Date: August 25, 2020End of Document

The Department of Justice declined comment.Microsoft said earlier this month that it was pushing forward with talks to acquire TikTok's US operations, following a conversation between CEO Satya Nadella and President Donald Trump. Since then Larry Ellison's Oracle has emerged as a potential rival suitor, and last week Trump indicated he would support such a bid. "I think Oracle is a great company and I think its owner is a tremendous guy, a tremendous person," Trump said Tuesday. "I think that Oracle would be certainly somebody that could handle it.The Trump administration has argued that TikTok's ties to China could result in US users' data being transferred to the Chinese government. TikTok has rejected those claims, saying it would refuse to give American data to China even if it were asked. Cybersecurity experts say there is a theoretical risk of Americans' data falling into the wrong hands, but that there is no evidence to suggest it has occurred and that many US tech companies, which collect similar data, are just as much a target for spying.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Continue reading TikTok parent comes up with a plan to save the app in the U.S.; no word from the White HouseUPDATE: The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Microsoft and ByteDance have put talks on hold as the companies seek to get clarity from the White House. The two firms had been in talks, a    source familiar with the negotiations said, and Trump s comments last night caught them by surprise. Another source said that the White House was involved in the talks for weeks and that the goal    is for TikTok to be owned by an American company. In a statement today, a White House spokesman said,  The administration has very serious national security concerns over TikTok. We continue to    evaluate future policy.  If you woke up this morning expecting to hear that popular short-form video app TikTok had been banned in the U.S. as President Donald Trump said that he would do last    night, the entire drama has taken another turn. Reuters is reporting that the owner of the app, China s ByteDance, has allegedly offered to divest the entire U.S. operations of TikTok. With over    2 billion installs from Apple s App Store and the Google Play Store worldwide, the app allows creators to produce videos of 15 or 30 seconds in length. Typical content includes dancing, comedic    pranks, and protests. The app has been helping pre-teens, teens, and even adults pass the time while being forced inside because of the pandemic. TikTok has approximately 80 million active daily    users in the states and has a valuation estimated to be somewhere between $50 billion-$100 billion.ByteDance will divest TikTok and the unit will be run by Microsoft in the statesByteDance originally hoped to keep a portion of TikTok in any spinoff of the unit. However, the U.S. considers many Chinese companies like Huawei and ZTE to be national security threats    because of their ties to the communist Chinese government. As a result, the latest rumor calls for ByteDance to have nothing to do with the U.S. operations of TikTok after the divestiture;    Microsoft would end up running the app in the U.S. and be in charge of protecting all U.S. user data. On Friday, there was speculation that the U.S. based software giant was going to purchase    TikTok. President Trump threw cold water on the idea and said,  We are not an M&A (mergers and acquisitions) country.  The deal with Microsoft still allows another company to buy the U.S.    operations of the app according to Reuters. The White House has yet to comment on whether it would allow the divestiture to take place.Other Chinese companies have been forced to divest apps by    the U.S. government. For example, earlier this year the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) forced Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd to sell the Grindr    dating app for $620 million. CFIUS is the U.S. agency that reviews foreign purchases of U.S. companies looking for potential national security risks. When ByteDance purchased Shanghai s    Musical.ly video app in 2017 for $1 billion, it relaunched it as TikTok but did not seek CFIUS review. As a result, TikTok reportedly been under investigation. At the same time, the Peterson    Institute for International Economics called the app a  Huawei-sized problem  for the U.S.Save 20% on select AirPods with an iPhone purchase from AT&TLast month, it was discovered that a new feature in iOS 14 warns users when an app is checking out your iPhone s clipboard. The latter copies data from one app and pastes it on another app;    it often holds personal information like PIN numbers and passwords. Several apps, including TikTok, were found to be copying iOS users  clipboards. The list of other apps spying on users     clipboards includes some owned and by American companies including AccuWeather, Google News, and Overstock. TikTok s U.S. General Manager Vanessa Pappas posted a message to the TikTok community    on the app this morning that did not mention any hint of a U.S. ban. She said,  I want to say thank you to the millions of Americans who use TikTok every day bringing their creativity and joy    into our daily lives. We ve heard your outpouring of support and we want to say thank you. We re not planning on going anywhere. TikTok is a home for creators and artists to express themselves,    their ideas, and connect with people across different backgrounds. And we are so proud of all the various communities that call TikTok their home. I m also proud of our 1,500 U.S. employees who    work on this app every day and the additional 10,000 jobs that we are bringing into this country over the next three years. I m thrilled about our U.S. Creator Fund where we just announced our $1    billion fund to support our creators and when it comes to safety and security, we re building the safest app because we know it s the right thing to do. So we appreciate the support. We re here    for the long run and continue to share your voice here and let s stand for TikTok. See Campaign:https://www.phonearena.com/news/bytedance-to-divest-tiktok-us-operations_id126320Contact Information:Alan FriedmanTags:, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: August 2, 2020End of Document

Did Comey go rogue?YATES: You could use that term, yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Yates went on to say that she still supports the investigation into Flynn. Yates was appointed by Former President Obama.President Trump walking back comments that a massive explosion in Beirut was a bomb.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, 45TH US PRESIDENT: Perhaps it was an attack. I don't think anybody can say right now, we're looking into it very strongly.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: At least 135 people were killed in the blast. The immense force of that explosion captured by a wedding photographer, as it tore through Lebanon's capital. Watch this.(VIDEO PLAYING)BARTIROMO: The bride nearly knocked to the ground by the blast miles away. Lebanese officials believe the explosion may have been caused by ammonium nitrate which was stored in a warehouse. It had been stored in that warehouse for years. Why was it stored there?Unrest in Portland stretching to 70 straight nights. Now, police are declaring a riot overnight using tear gas to clear out the crowd. Protesters gathered outside a police precinct alleging trying to break the windows. Another group was seen ripping off plywood and smashing windows of the Police Union Office.Former Vice President Joe Biden will not travel to Wisconsin to accept the Democratic Presidential nomination for President due to the coronavirus concerns. The Democratic National Committee announced all of the convention speeches, including the Former Vice President's, will be delivered virtually across the country. The DNC is set to kick off its convention virtually on August 17th.Markets this morning are mostly higher. Take a look at Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading. The Dow Futures up 64 point, NASDAQ is up 4.25, but the S&P is up 3.75. As you saw, it is negative in Europe however.Markets ticking up yesterday on hopes of a stimulus deal. We're not there yet. Jobless claims will be out due later this morning. The July jobs report, of course, coming out Friday and we are expecting a 1.65 million non-farm payrolls and an unemployment rate of 10.5%. The ADP private payrolls number is causing some concern after lower than expected gains yesterday.Joining me right now is ProShares' Global Investment Strategist Simeon Hyman; also joining the conversation this morning, Republican Strategist and Pinion Enterprises Founder and CEO Joseph Pinion; Fox Business's Dagen McDowell; and Payne Capital Management President Ryan Payne. Great to see everybody this morning. Thanks so much for being here.Simeon, let me kick it off with you. What is driving markets from your standpoint this morning?SIMEON HYMAN, GLOBAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, PROSHARES: Look, in the very short run, it's hope for the stimulus and the potential for good news on the vaccine front, because the economic news has been quite mixed. It has not been all sort of bad. We have the rough GDP number. Very unlikely we're going to hit that consensus employment number, but very strong ISM Manufacturing and Services.And also, earnings season is going a lot better than expected. Expectations going in where something for a 40% decline year-over-year, we might come in only at 10% down. So trying to look at the economic data is tough, the short run volatility is going to come from the stimulus and health -- and health issues.BARTIROMO: So what about the economic data? We were expecting to see a soft spot in the month of July for jobs. That's certainly what Nancy Lazar told us from Cornerstone Macro a week ago. Do you think this indicates an interruption to the recovery from the bottom?HYMAN: Well, it seems extremely likely that given the persistence of the virus, the acceleration of poor outcomes, particularly in the Sunbelt and flare ups even almost everywhere. I live in New Jersey and there's a slight uptick in cases; that has to be reflected in that almost V-shaped recovery we saw initially has got to be slowing down.I think you have to look a little bit past it. We saw some calls for perhaps a market that was under-pricing good news on the vaccine front. So again, short run stimulus and vaccine; I think the long run, you have to think about where there's a little bit of value in the market.BARTIROMO: Yes. Dagen McDowell, jump in here. A coronavirus vaccine moving markets. Goldman Sachs is warning a successful vaccine could unsettle markets causing a bond sell-off, shifting investment from tech stocks to more cyclical names. Dagen, so when we do actually get news of a vaccine?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS HOST: That's a question, is because interest rates are so low and money has been pouring into the safety of treasuries. Do you see a massive reallocation if there is a vaccine? Let's hope that we're all kind of have our arms locked that these vaccines come out and come out quickly. This is the October surprise that people are talking about that could really lift not just the stock market, but look at where the 10-year yield is.It's all - close to just 0.5 percent, that it lifts the entire nation. And we're getting some pricing data on how much this might cost just for Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. And at the upper end, it's roughly $37 a dose. So, it would be $74 for a kind of two dose vaccine. That's a really reasonable price and what the administration has done with these hundreds of millions of vaccines that have been ordered in advance from Pfizer, Glaxo SmithKline and Johnson & Johnson. This is ready to go once a vaccine is approved.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's great news to me but do you think that it causes moves in markets?HYMAN: First to the treasury market, news about a vaccine is almost assuredly to sell to - to cause a sell-off in the treasury market. I think that comment was spot on. Those yields are so low, we're talking negative real yields. Frankly, I think even in the absence of great news on the vaccine and the health front, you could have at least a modest rise in longer-term interest rates. Even if the Fed does yield curve control, it's likely to be focused on the shorter end of the curve.With regards to the broader equity markets, for sure a rotation, perhaps not to the deep cyclicals and the deep values, but just to the quality names that have not kept up with the tech rally. And one of the things we've been paying attention to is, if you look at the rally since the market bottom, we've seen out-performance from some of the riskiest and almost the lowest-quality pieces of the market.Emerging markets have been great beneficiaries of easy money and weakness of the dollar. And in the U.S., it's been as an example, the lowest quintile of return on equity and small caps have dramatically outperformed. A more prudent path would be, yes, rotate away from large cap tech but perhaps to higher-quality players like dividend growers and mid and small caps, and outside the U.S., perhaps to developed markets a little bit less than emerging markets. Even now, withstanding that little bit of uptick in Germany, the news from continental Europe and that Hamiltonian moment, we think are powerful.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean anything for yield where rates are right now, there are certainly better alternatives. Simeon, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks very much.HYMAN: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Simeon Hyman joining us there from ProShares. Your morning mover, Rocket Companies, the parent company of Quicken Loans, the company is set to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange today, but it priced its IPO at $18 a share which was below expectations.

Stimulus showdown, lawmakers gridlock now while inching toward the next round of coronavirus stimulus. The Trump Administration says if a deal is not reached by tomorrow, it likely will not happen. Democrats saying that there could be light at the end of the tunnel, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that there has been barely any progress. President Trump is speaking out. He spoke yesterday on possible executive action.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: If Democrat leaders put partisan demands aside, we would reach an agreement very quickly. It would happen very quickly. In the meantime, my administration is exploring executive actions to provide protections against eviction, as well as additional relief to those who are unemployed as a result of the virus. Very importantly, I'm also looking at a term- limited suspension of the payroll tax, something that has great support from many, many sides.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Texas Congressman House Financial Services Committee Member Lance Gooden. Congressman, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.REP. LANCE GOODEN (R-TX), HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE MEMBER: Great to be here.BARTIROMO: Where are we?GOODEN: Not very far along. In fact, the senate's negotiators which consists of no one in the senate, have been meeting with Nancy Pelosi. And why I say no one is, Mitch McConnell is not really involved in these talks. It's Steve Mnuchin, Treasury Secretary; White House Chief of Staff, Nancy Pelosi; and Chuck Schumer. That's it. They've said that if they don't have an agreement by Friday, then Mark Meadows recently said that we should perhaps just move on as if there's not going to be one.The clip you just played of the president talking about executive action, I suspect that's what's going to end up happening. A week ago I told you, I thought we'd have a deal this week. So I should probably stop speculating. But I see a scenario at this point where no one reaches a deal, president issues an executive action and do you really think the Democrats are going to sue the president saying, don't evict Americans that are past due on their rent? I can't imagine that being the case. But it seems as if progress has stopped and we're approaching that deadline.BARTIROMO: Why did progress stop? What is the sticking point that Democrats won't agree to? The eviction?GOODEN: They won't come down off the $600 extra unemployment. They're not interested in the liability protections that Republicans want to make sure schools and businesses aren't being sued for the next several years. They want the $3 trillion plus number to be what it is.Republicans at one point, I understand, were saying we want something closer to $1 trillion. And the other problem is that we've now come to a point where we're not panicking like we were back in the spring time, when Republicans voted 96:0 on aid packages that they otherwise would never have supported in the past. That panicky situation doesn't exist today.I believe there'll be at least 20-plus Republicans that are no votes on whatever agreement, if there is one agreement, comes forward. I think that's the same on the House side. Republicans are not united in this belief that we need to spend trillions more dollars at this point, especially if it involves concessions to Nancy Pelosi that are too painful.BARTIROMO: Aye (ph). Yes, Dagen jump in.MCDOWELL: Congressman, did the Republicans realize that the Democrats might be setting up the president and Republicans for - to keep unemployment high and still look like the victors and champions of the American people with this plan? What are you going to do? You're going to keep paying people an extra $600 per week in unemployment benefits, which encourages people not to get back to work with so many earning more on unemployment than they did in their jobs? You funnel money to schools, even though they might be staying closed.So you keep schools closed. That hurts unemployment. And then you refuse to include a liability protection, which discourages businesses from bringing workers back and from hiring. It is the recipe for unemployment to stay in the double digits.GOODEN: Which is what I think they would like between now and November. Obviously, Nancy Pelosi is not going to say that, but I think Democrats are perfectly fine with no deal passing at all, being able to blame the president and the heartless Republicans as they say, and then move forward in the next 90 days and say, "We'll save you if you vote for us." You're absolutely right.The $600 number encourages people at that level not to work. It's dis- incentivizing people from coming back to work. Businesses want to hire people but people that are actually making more money with the $600 addition are not going to go back to work because it makes no sense for them financially. And Democrats want this to continue through the election. You're absolutely right.BARTIROMO: Yes, that definitely feels that way. Meanwhile, you better watch out if you made any money during this pandemic. Senator Bernie Sanders taking to Twitter tweeting this, I will be introducing legislation tomorrow to tax the obscene wealth gains billionaires have made during the public health crisis. So, Sanders is suggesting that he wants to tax any gains on billionaires at a 60% rate if they made money during this pandemic. What do you think?GOODEN: I think that he'll be successful if Democrats take the Senate and Joe Biden wins the White House. They're spreading this message that progressives are going to run the nation if they win, and they're rights. It's interesting to me that many of these billionaires that he's going to be taxing are in Silicon Valley and are worried about censoring the president in the next few months.You would think that some of these billionaires in Silicon Valley would not be interested in Bernie Sanders led senate majority in January but that seems to be a par for the course. Concern to me is we haven't heard anything from Joe Biden. I have really no idea what his plans are if he were to win. He seems to be letting the far-left like the Bernie Sanders crowd do his talking and planning for him.BARTIROMO: Well, he has already come out with a unity task sheet which is, he and Bernie Sanders. So we know a little about Biden's plans.GOODEN: Yes.BARTIROMO: He has teamed up with Bernie Sanders when it comes to economics. So it may very well include some of Bernie's plans, and one of those plans is to tax anybody who made money during the pandemic. Congressman, it's good to see you this morning. Thank you so much, Congressman Lance Gooden.GOODEN: Thanks, you too. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Stay with us. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Joe Biden snapped at a reporter during a virtual event yesterday. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ERROL BARNETT, CBS NEWS ANCHOR: Have you taken a cognitive test?JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: No, I haven't taken the test. Why the hell would I take a test? Come on, man. That's like saying, "You, before you got into this program, you take a test whether you're taking cocaine or not, what do you think? Are you a junkie?BARNETT: What do you say--(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joseph Pinion, your thoughts?JOSEPH PINION, FOUNDER & CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, PINION ENTERPRISES: I think that the crazy thing is the most damaging argument against Joe Biden and his cognitive ability, and not necessarily the fact that he's running around saying you know the thing, but the fact that he can't necessarily articulate a plan to get America back on track in a post-COVID-19 world.We just had a recent data from the census saying we've got close to 24 million Americans who stated they did not have enough food in the last week, in the month of July. So we've got serious problems and I think that we have people on Main Street who are in pain. If Democrats don't have a plan to put them back to work, if they want to keep them trapped in unemployment purgatory forever, I think it's an opportunity for President Trump to talk to those workers, those working poor. He was able to win close to 2:1 in 2016 and said that I am here to protect you. The same reason that you've voted from me in 2016 is the same reason you should vote for me in 2020.BARTIROMO: Yes, but there's more to this. I mean, Dagen McDowell, yes, it's true. Joe Biden has not articulated and communicated his plans in terms of the economy, foreign policy. You never hear anything like that. But there is more to this. This video, he's questioning this reporter if he's a junkie, asking him if he took cocaine. Where does that come from?We have spoken about the cognitive issues around Joe Biden before. And I know Dagen that Joe Biden himself has discussed having a brain aneurysm. I've reported in the past. I believe it's actually two brain aneurysms. If you're running for President, if there are issues, I think they need to be disclosed. We need some more transparency here. Am I wrong?MCDOWELL: No, it was in I believe 1988 and he wrote about it in a book that he wrote, and it was two brain aneurysms. He nearly died from it. But we can see what's going on right here. Usually in the world of social media, you get the headline, the click-bait, the quote about the junkie comment from Vice President Biden.But if you watched that video, it was a great deal more jarring, a great deal worse than even that headline to watch his response. It looked as if off camera or to the side that somebody was trying to coach him like, "Oh, you said something that was highly offensive, reel it in." But I think that this has to give a lot of people pause, number one. And number two, for the Democratic Party and for left-wing liberals who have been pulling their hair off for four years or even longer about President Trump's, the language that he uses, why doesn't this bother them?BARTIROMO: Nice (ph), yes, good point - because it's not about Trump; Dagen, come on. That's why. Coming up, Sally Yates sounded off yesterday her scathing testimony about Former FBI Director James Comey. We're going to take a look at that when we come back and then coming attractions, Walmart taking its big screens to the parking lot. You're watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business.MARIA BARTIROMO, ANCHOR, MORNINGS WITH MARIA: Welcome back, good Thursday morning everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, August 6th. Let's take a look at markets right now at 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast, we are expecting a mixed opening now. Things have certainly turned a little more negative in the last 30 minutes. Dow futures up 10 points, the Nasdaq is down, it's now negative by 14, S&P is also in negative territory by about a point.Markets given up an earlier rally this morning. The Nasdaq recorded its third record close in a row yesterday meanwhile, the momentum is there, the S&P 500 within 2 percent of the new record high close. And the Dow Industrials have to close yesterday, up 373 points. Nasdaq up 57 and the S&P up 21. Global markets this morning look like this.European indices right now are trading lower. The Bank of England warning of a slow economic recovery, it held interest rates steady at a record low, one-tenth of a percent this morning, the FTSE 100 is at their lows of the morning, down 92 points, the CAC Quarante is down 37 and the Dax Index in Germany is lower by 50 points. In Asia overnight, markets were mixed. The Kospi Index at a 22-month high. It is up better than 60 percent from its March 19th low.As you see, it was up 1.3 percent, the others moving fractionally overnight. At least, 9 people are dead this morning in the wake of the massive tropical storm. Cheryl Casone with the details now, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: That's right, Maria. Police found the body of Alyssa Thurlow(ph) near her home in Pennsylvania. The 5-year-old girl who had autism walked out of her home during the storm. Nearly 3 million people are still without power days after Isaias crossed into the northeast. Crews are working to restore service after high winds brought down trees. And then check out this, incredible video from New York's bravest. The FDNY saving two people that were stranded on a boat near Queens.They had almost zero visibility as you can see from the video inside of their cab. Well, President Trump says that he supports a plan to give U.S. airlines another$25 billion in federal aid. More than a dozen GOP senators also backed the proposal. The airline industry has been one of the hardest hit by the pandemic. U.S. carriers have warned that 70,000 workers could lose their jobs when a current round of assistance runs out in the Fall.And ahead of the opening bell, I want to take a look at some of the major U.S. airline stocks. And these of course are certainly stocks that you want to be watching, whether it's Southwest or Delta or United. But let's move to trends instead. Here's a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos just sold off more than $3 billion worth of shares in his company, this brings his total cash out for 2020 so far to about $7 billion.Microsoft reportedly in talks with outside investors to help it buy TikTok. We should say TikTok could be worth about $50 billion. And then Samsung unpacked its newest devices yesterday, this includes the new Galaxy Z Fold 2, and as the name sounds, Maria, it is a folding smartphone. And those are your headlines from the newsroom, back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you. Meanwhile, Sally Yates testified on Capitol Hill yesterday as part of the Senate Judiciary's oversight of the crossfire hurricane investigation. That's the investigation into Donald Trump. The former acting Attorney General telling lawmakers that she was irritated with James Comey not sharing information about General Michael Flynn with her before briefing President Obama. Yates criticizing Comey even further when asked about his interview with Flynn. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): When you heard about the interview, you got upset, didn't you?SALLY YATES, FORMER UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL: I was upset that Director Comey didn't coordinate that with us and acted unilaterally, yes, I was.GRAHAM: OK, did Comey go rogue?YATES: You could use that term, yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is former Whitewater independent counsel and former federal prosecutor Robert Ray. Robert, it is great to see you this morning, thanks so much for joining me. First, let's get your thought on this big admission, Comey, going rogue. What was your reaction to that testimony?ROBERT RAY, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: She got rolled by Jim Comey, and it was the third time that it happened. Remember now, it's January 24th with the interview of Michael Flynn, January 5th with the briefing of President Obama. And the third time was in connection with the announcement of the conclusion of the Hillary Clinton investigation which occurred the year before in 2016.So, you know, I guess in some sense, Senator Graham was trying to set this up as Sally Yates as the -- you know, the adult in the room. But the fact is that she was the deputy Attorney General and she failed to supervise the person she was supposed to supervise who was the FBI director and that FBI director reported in the flow-chart directly to her.BARTIROMO: I see. So you think there's culpability on her part then, because I'm wondering who is going to -- who is going to flip here now that John Durham is doing investigations and obviously Lindsey Graham is bringing people down as witnesses. Do you think somebody is going to flip against Comey and McCabe?RAY: It's clear that, you know, Sally Yates through former Director Comey under the bus. And so everybody now is pointed in that direction. I mean, ultimately, the question is whether there's going to be accountability here under the criminal law for those who are responsible for submitting false information to the FISA court in connection with the applications for wiretap authorization, and also just generally about continuing an investigation of Michael Flynn when at least the recommendation the day before on January 4th, 2017 from the lying FBI agents that, that investigation should be closed.So they didn't really have any basis to interview in my judgment Michael Flynn contrary to what Sally Yates testified to yesterday. I mean, they seemed to confuse the fact that it was politically material to them that Michael Flynn was acting contrary to President Obama's foreign policy. Well, hello, there was an election, he was the designate to be the National Security adviser and, of course, he was talking and would have been expected to talk to Russians with regard to the foreign policy of the United States.And they obviously were out to get him, and the FBI facilitated that effort. So the question is, who is going to be held accountable for that, and actually who knew about that effort which was unsupported?BARTIROMO: Yes, and how about who is accountable to this lie that the whole country got on board of collusion. I mean, Yates also admitted to Senator John Kennedy, the role that the Steele dossier played in acquiring the FISA warrant to spy on the campaign, getting a warrant to spy on Carter Page. Watch this exchange.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): To be sure I understand you, was the -- was the Steele dossier critically important to the FISA applications?YATES: Yes, it was.(END VIDEO CLIP)RAY: Well, there -- Maria, there you go.BARTIROMO: Yes, it was --RAY: I mean, that is a crucial admission --BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly.RAY: And that crucial admission is the one that you've been focused on from the very beginning now. We're up to years and not even months that we've been after this.BARTIROMO: Wow --RAY: And they knew that, that was critical, which is why they focused on it in the FISA application, but beyond that, they also knew that there was serious question about the authenticity and the accuracy of the information that was relayed through the Steele dossier, and they didn't disclose that. And so what I want to know is who knew that, that wasn't authentic and accurate information, and why they go ahead and do it anyway?And who was in the chain of information leading up to the authorization of that application. It seems fairly apparent that Rod Rosenstein and Sally Yates, at least, there's not sufficient proof to know that they know we submitted an authorized information that was false to a court. But somebody did, and whoever those somebodys are, they should be held to account. That's the purpose of the John Durham investigation.BARTIROMO: And we know that the FBI interviewed the so-called sub-source, the person who gave the information to Christopher Steele to put in that dossier. His name is Igor Danchenko. But we know that they interviewed Igor on January 24th, 25th, 26th. This was a three-day interview in 2017. And what he told them was, oh, no! We made it up, it was in a bar, it was hearsay, all that was just hearsay. I didn't say, I didn't say that -- oh, Christopher Steele must have been embellished. I never said that.So they knew in January of 2017 that the dossier was garbage, and yet they still used it to re-up the warrant and re-up the warrant again to keep spying on Carter Page. Is there -- is there criminality there?RAY: If that information was passed up the chain, and there were people in the know who knew about it, particularly those who were in a position and did in fact, authorize the FISA application and at least the first or second renewals, the answer is yes. And I think where you're going to find who knew, I think will be what you suggest either people rolling other people or the e-mail and text messages that are internal FBI and Department of Justice documents should indicate what level of knowledge there was among those who were in a position to -- of authority who authorized these applications.And if they knew, and they authorized it --BARTIROMO: Right --RAY: It seems to me that there's criminal liability there, yes.BARTIROMO: So there's a rumor going on that Peter Strzok and Kevin Kleinsmith are folding, are squeezing their bosses, saying they knew it. It's their fault. But everyone is trying to understand how far up the ladder this goes. So Yates in her testimony insisted that President Obama and then Vice President Biden did not influence the investigations. What does the evidence tell you, Robert?RAY: It tells me that they were all present including Susan Rice during a meeting in which it was the subject of discussion was the Logan Act which was a false predicate to the continuation of an investigation against Michael Flynn, and that's wrong, OK. That was politically wrong and it may also have been criminally wrong, and the question is, you know, who knew that, that was wrong, and how far did this go and how far up, you know, beyond just simply, you know, the lying agents and Peter Strzok, did it go.And so it's not surprising, it seems to me that it's likely that Peter Strzok has liability, and that's one of the reasons that he's turning around, say, hey, listen, if I'm going down, you know, I'm taking other people with me. And I imagine that that's the state of the --BARTIROMO: Yes --RAY: Investigation at the moment. And I will say finally, I --BARTIROMO: Yes --RAY: Hope and expect that the American people who deserve to know answers to this are going to get them in time for the November election. And I suspect also that the --BARTIROMO: I know --RAY: Attorney General of the United States feels the same way.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, it would be really wrong if we did not get answers before this election on what has been as I've said from the beginning biggest political scandal we've ever seen. It's incredible. Robert, it's great to get your thoughts as always. Thank you, sir.RAY: Thanks very much, Maria, take care.BARTIROMO: You too. Robert Ray joining us. We'll be right back, stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Instagram takes on TikTok. The Facebook-owned app launching Reels, that's their answer to the popular Chinese-owned video app TikTok whose fate hangs in the balance this morning. President Trump threatening to ban TikTok in the United States as Microsoft is hoping to acquire it. Joining us right now is tech analyst and CoinDesk executive editor Pete Pachal. Pete, it's great to see you, thanks for being here.PETE PACHAL, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, COINDESK: Thanks Maria --BARTIROMO: Tell us about Reels, how does Reels compare to TikTok?PACHAL: Well, I mean, for starters, Instagram is really pushing this thing. They have completely revamped the camera so that Reels is front and center when you go to the app. So you go into the camera, Reels is basically right there. It's just one quick swipe, it's a prominent button for it. Now, basically it's a problem of TikTok problem. Now, TikTok obviously, you get video, you shoot video clips, you -- it's very easy to put popular music on top of them.That is pretty much the exact same feature on Instagram and, so you know, they say that yes, there's settle differences, I mean, the way it's built in, the exact -- you know, nature of the tools are slightly different. But, you know, obviously it is intended for people to produce the same kind of clever, really short videos that TikTok is famous for.BARTIROMO: Do you think that it's an easy -- it's an easy alternative if TikTok is banned? Do you think Reels get the market share? Reels.PACHAL: Well, I think even if TikTok isn't banned, Reels has a really strong shot at getting market share. I mean, just look at what Instagram has done previously with stories which was also an important copy of SnapChat, and it's a signature feature of like quickly disappearing pictures and videos. This is -- this very similar. So right now, the number of people using Instagram stories is probably about double what SnapChat's entire user base.So Instagram has an untenable ability to cut across cultures, age groups, demographics, it is the very friendly social network, and it is huge. So that --BARTIROMO: Yes --PACHAL: Leverage, I think is going to probably position into the market extremely well.BARTIROMO: Pete, any security concerns with Reels because we know that there are serious security concerns around TikTok that they're using it as part of their espionage campaign where they're mining information about American citizens, do you have any security worries about Reels?PACHAL: Well, that's a big question, and there's no straight answer. I mean, well, here is the thing. I mean, Facebook, the one thing it can say is that your privacy is sort of better protected with Reels because mostly of a credibility standpoint. This simply has no credibility in a privacy sense whether true or not because of its history of scandals --BARTIROMO: Right --PACHAL: And things like Cambridge Analytica. That said it is not owned by the Chinese government or there's no -- there's no direct link there --BARTIROMO: Right, exactly --PACHAL: You know, that is arguably -- that is arguably a little overblown or probably a lot overblown with regards to TikTok. I mean, a lot of its operations are in the -- are in the U.S., keeps its user data outside --BARTIROMO: Right --PACHAL: Of China.BARTIROMO: Well, the bottom line is that it's owned by the -- by the Chinese -- Pete, thank you so much. Pete Pachal joining us there --PACHAL: Yes --BARTIROMO: Stay with us --PACHAL: My pleasure --BARTIROMO: We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Time for the Morning Buzz. First up, soft serve your booze. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo expanding a bill to allow the sale of ice cream infused with hard liquor. Ryan, are you in?RYAN PAYNE, PRESIDENT, PAYNE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: I appreciate that I got the booze question. You know, it's almost open --(LAUGHTER)Down here in the bill of January, it's like I'm already brought down here, so we might as well add that, and we can have a big party on my roof and eat ice cream that infused in booze. Sounds good to me, Maria.BARTIROMO: You know, I bet you, this is going to spike -- cause a spike in ice cream with alcohol in it, an ice cream parlor. I mean, I -- it's interesting where this story goes. We'll watch it. All right, next up, see you at the drive-in, Wal-Mart teams up with Tribeca Film Festival for free movie screenings across the country. Some top flicks include, "Black Panther", "Lego", "Batman" and "E.T.". Joseph?JOSEPH PINION, FOUNDER & CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, PINION ENTERPRISES: I mean, look, I mean, if the Democrats have their way, I mean, they're going to turn all the malls of America into ghost towns and just play movies 24/7 because Americans need to get back to work, but at least, in these down times, we're going to have some relaxation on our hands. I could have a "Lego" movie, you know, to take some of my cousins too.BARTIROMO: I like the idea of having a drive-in at a -- in Wal-Mart parking lots. I've got to say, it's a fun idea.PINION: Yes --BARTIROMO: All right, finally, how about this? A new way to clean out your closets. Samsung releasing the AirDresser. The system uses steam to refresh your clothes. It's all hooked up through Wi-Fi. Price start at $1,049, Dagen, what do you think of this?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: I think this is an awesome idea, and I would buy one if that wasn't --BARTIROMO: Me too --MCDOWELL: The size of my apartment, though. So I don't know where that would go.(LAUGHTER)But I encourage people not to dry clean their clothes. If you have a front- loading Samsung washer, a lot of these washing machines have a steam cycle, you can just throw your clothes in there and clean them that way rather than sending them out for regular old dry cleaning. I love this.BARTIROMO: Me too! I love it too! Imagine if you had that right in your closet. It's like -- it's so easy to get everything just steam --MCDOWELL: Christmas gift, Christmas gift for it, Maria --BARTIROMO: Cool stuff, guys, all right --(LAUGHTER)There you go.

TikTok CEO resigned amid Donald Trump threatsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 27, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 402 wordsBodyTikTok CEO Kevin Mayerannounced on Wednesday that he is leaving the company,at a time when tensions between Washington and Beijing are rising over Chinese-owned application.Mayer's resignation comes days after TikTok filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government over the pressure he puts on against the platform, which he accuses of spying on its users.A former Disney executive and at TikTok since May, Mayer told employees in a letter that "the political environment has changed dramatically" in recent weeks."In this context, and as we hope to reach a resolution very soon, I want to let you know with great regret that I have decided to leave the company,"he wrote."I understand that the role I signed for, including the execution of TikTok globally, will be very different as a result of the US administration's action to drive the sale of the U.S. business," he said.For his part, TikTok issued a statement on this subject: "We recognize that the political dynamics of recent months have significantly changed Kevin's scope for action in the future, and we fully respect his decision."TikTok is at the center of a diplomatic storm between the US and China. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on August 6 giving Americans a 45-day deadline to stop doing business with TikTok's parent company, China's ByteDance.The text also provided for the same period for TikTok to be sold to a US company.TikTok, downloaded 175 million times in the United States, and more than 1 billion worldwide, argued in the lawsuit that Trump's order was an incorrect application of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act because the platform, on which users share short videos, is not "an unusual or extraordinary threat."Trump, meanwhile, is looking to force its sale to an American company like Microsoft, which showed interest in one of the most growing social media in recent years and became the top entertainment for many teens and a marketing channel for major celebrities.China's Foreign Ministry opposes the forced sale of TikTok, an operation it believes violates the principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO).In fact, the Chinese government sees the intention to sell TikTok as another chapter of the beijing-Washington trade war, which seeks to contain the growing technological power of the Asian giant, which it already saw as telecoms firm Huawei had to face restrictions.Source: AFP/ EFELoad-Date: August 28, 2020End of Document

Donald Trump supported Oracle's bid to buy TikTok: "It's a great company"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 19, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 412 wordsBodyUS President Donald Trump has shown his support for Oracle for purchasing operations in that country from the Chinese shared video app TikTok.Thus, Oracle enters the negotiations for TikTok, whose owner, ByteDance, faces the end of the trump administration's deadline for detaching itself from its operations in the United States.Asked Tuesday whether Oracle would be a good buyer for TikTok, President Trump replied, "Well, I think Oracle is a great company and I think its owner is a fabulous guy, a fabulous person. I think Oracle would certainly be someone who could take over."The giant in the enterprise software sector has had preliminary discussions about the possibility of teaming up with some of ByteDance's current minority investors to buy TikTok's U.S. operations, but it's unclear how advanced those talks are.Microsoft said this month that it was negotiating with ByteDance and was coordinating with the White House. Twitter is also considering bidding, The Wall Street Journal has previously reported.The Financial Times advanced the involvement of Oracle, a company that maintains closer ties with the White House than most of the rest interested in the process.(EFE) (ALEX PLAVEVSKI/)Larry Ellison, the company's co-founder, president and largest shareholder, held a home fundraiser for the president earlier this year. And CEO Safra Catz also served on the executive committee of Trump's transition team in 2016.Oracle is working with Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic, investors who already have stakes in ByteDance, some of the sources indicated.Trump also reiterated Tuesday's condition that whoever buys TikTok will have to make a substantial payment to the U.S. government as part of the transaction, a rare and even possibly unconstitutional lawsuit.The Trump Administration has said that TikTok poses a threat to national security because it is owned by a Chinese company. ByteDance has repeatedly rejected US accusations that it would share information from US users with the Chinese government.Microsoft is particularly interested in buying TikTok in Europe and India, where it was recently banned by the government in the wake of border tensions with China, Financial Times said. But ByteDance opposes the idea of selling any asset beyond those of the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, according to the paper.(With information from EFE and Reuters)MORE ON THIS TOPIC:What is Triller, the rival TikTok app worn by Donald TrumpLoad-Date: August 20, 2020End of Document

Donald Trump issues order to ban Tik TokCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 7, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 369 wordsBodyU.S. President Donald Trumpsigned an executive order as a "national emergency" to block the country's transactions with Bytedance, the Tik Tok app's parent company dated September 20.The order is also directed towards Tencent,the Chinese multinational in charge of brands such as Riot Games, Epic Games, Miniclip, TiMi Studios and the wechat courier service."The expansion in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in China continues to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. At this time, action must be taken to address the threat posed by a particular mobile application: Tik Tok," the executive order said.For the time being, the Department of Homeland Security; The Transportation Security Administration; and the US Armed Forces have banned the use of the app on government phones. Security issues in Tik TokAccording to the US government, the app automatically captures a lot of information from its users; including data such as location and search and browsing history. In that regard, the Trump administration assured that information collection threatens to allow the Chinese government access to personal information and property of American citizens."Potentially, it would allow China to locate the locations of federal employees and contractors, build reports of personal information to blackmail and lead to corporate espionage," he added.Tik Tok defends himselfIn previous days, Vanessa Pappas,the U.S. director general of the app, appreciated the support of millions of Americans who use Tik Tok on a daily basis and noted that they have no plans to go anywhere."Tik Tok is a home for creators and artists to express themselves and their ideas and connect with people with different backgrounds. We are proud of all the diverse communities that call Tik Tok their home. I'm also proud of our 1,500 American employees who work in the app every day; and the 10,000 additional jobs we're going to bring to the country in the next three years," he added.In addition, he said that they are working on creating a totally secure app, because it is the right thing to do. However, he gave no further clarification on this issue.Load-Date: August 8, 2020End of Document

Trump announces he will ban TikTok use in U.S.CE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 1, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 589 wordsBodyUS President Donald Trump announced Friday that he will ban the Chinese-owned social network TikTok in the United States, faced with concerns that the platform might be used by Beijing to spy. The announcement is a new step in the Republican Administration's escalation of hostilities towards the Chinese technology sector."As far as TikTok is concerned, we're going to ban it in the United States," Trump said in statements to reporters on the presidential Air Force One plane. The president added that he could take action this Saturday by resorting to emergency economic power or through an executive order, a mechanism that would allow him to exclude threats on the Network to U.S. national security.TikTok is a very popular video application among young people, whose parent company is ByteDance, based in China, and has around 1 billion users worldwide. The app has been downloaded 165 million times in the United States. The Wall Street Journal and the Bloomberg agency anticipated that Trump was planning to announce a decision ordering ByteDance to sell his operation in the United States, estimating that the service could be used by Chinese secret services. ByteDance would be willing to sell his shares in the U.S. in reaction to Trump's veto, a source related to the process has told The New York Times on Saturday.Sources cited by The Washington Post say Microsoft is negotiating to buy it, for a price that could reach several tens of billions of dollars. Microsoft's acquisition of production would suddenly place the U.S. company at the forefront of technology, and substantially change the map of social media in the United States. E later this week, in his testimony in Congress with the bosses of Google, Apple and Amazon, an audience in which Microsoft, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, was not present, he referred to TikTok as his rival. On Friday, on Air Force One, the president made it clear that he is not in favor of an agreement that allows an American company to purchase TikTok's operation in the U.S.Members of the Administration and congressmen have expressed concern that the Chinese government has access to personal data of millions of U.S. citizens, that the social network will be used by Beijing for espionage purposes. The secretary of state himself, Mike Pompeo, said earlier this month that the United States was "certainly" "contemplating" banning TikTok. The Pentagon already recommended in December that members of the Army not use the application.TikTok has denied any ties to the Beijing Government. The company has promised this week a high level of transparency, being open to allowing even revisions of its algorithms. "We are not politicians, we do not accept political publicity and we do not have a political agenda; our only goal is to remain a dynamic platform for everyone to enjoy. TikTok has become the ultimate target, but we're not the enemy," the social network's top official, Kevin Mayer, said in a post this week. The company's spokesman Hilary McQuaide declined to comment on Trump's announcement but expressed her "confidence in TikTok's long-term success."Last June, TikTok made headlines after hundreds of social media users, as well as teens fond of the K-pop music genre, were credited with sabotaging a President Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, mobilizing their users to register as attendees of the event to makebelieve to the organizers that the attendance was going to be much greater. The rally had a much more modest call than the president's campaign expected.Load-Date: August 2, 2020End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 36 of 350Stock Market Update  Page 38 of 350Microsoft confirms talks seeking to buy US arm of TikTok  Page 40 of 350CRITICAL TEST OF ACADEMIC FREEDOM FOR AUSTRALIAN UNIVERSITIES  Page 42 of 350Trump signs executive order to ban social media app TikTok  Page 44 of 350Pompeo Hits HSBC Anew on Bowing to China Pressure in Hong Kong  Page 47 of 350GRAVES SECURES A DOZEN CYBERSECURITY PRIORITIES IN FUNDING BILLS  Page 49 of 350U.S.- China will not accept US "theft" of its technology companies, according to Chinese state press  Page 52 of 350Smartphone Production Registers Largest YoY Drop on Record with 16.7% Decline in 2Q20, Although Rebound in 2H20 Appears Likely, Says TrendForce  Page 65 of 350REMARKS ON USAID ADVANCING RELIGIOUS LIBERTY FROM USAID ACTING ADMINISTRATOR JOHN BARSA ON A VIRTUAL ROUND TABLE WITH THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM INSTITUTE  Page 68 of 350CARAFANO: Tick Tock For TikTok  Page 72 of 350'Why We Are Suing the Administration': Read TikTok's Explanation for Taking on Trump  Page 74 of 350TIKTOK CEO RESIGNS AS TENSIONS MOUNT WITH WHITE HOUSE  Page 76 of 350Donald Trump wants to ban TikTok in U.S.  Page  of Ricketts bans TikTok on State Issued Devices  Page 80 of 350ASBMB JOINS AMICUS BRIEF  Page  of Trump cancels trade talks with China over coronavirus crisis  Page 85 of 350Trump’s TikTok War Pits Free Speech Against National Security  Page 87 of 350Microsoft negotiates TikTok business purchase in US  Page 89 of 350Why does the US want to ban TikTok?  Page 92 of 350This is what it's like when a country actually bans TikTok  Page 95 of 350Walmart is joining Microsoft in the pursuit of TikTok  Page 98 of 350DON'T BAN TIKTOK AND WECHAT  Page 100 of 350RONN MOTOR GROUP, INC.
