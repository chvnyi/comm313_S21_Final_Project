Islamic Center of Boulder shares human rights injustice of Muslim minorities in China, Kashmir, IndiaColorado Daily: University of Colorado at BoulderJanuary 17, 2020 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 592 wordsByline: Kelsey HammonBodyWhen Sarah Tynen went to the Nanjing, China, to conduct field work on a Fulbright scholarship between 2011 to 2013, she found herself immersed in the culture of Uighur people, a group of Turkish Muslims.Tynen, a who earned a doctorate from the University of Colorado Boulder in human geography, was on a quest to understand what it was like to live as a minority Muslim."I lived, dined, laughed and cried with my Uighur neighbors," Tynen said. "What I found was heartbreaking. Life was increasingly defined by police surveillance and discrimination, especially of poor Muslims, who were more likely to get picked up for small offenses like not carrying an ID."Tynen's story was among those shared Friday night at the Islamic Center of Boulder, as part of an open house on human rights issues. In addition to the Uighur Muslims, the more than 100 people that packed the prayer room at 5495 Baseline Road heard about cultures who experienced oppression as Muslims in India and Kashmir.The Uighur people have been forced into "re-education camps" at the hands of the Chinese government, Tynen said, a human rights injustice corroborated by stories published by the New York Times and the Washington Post. Tynen and media accounts detail how the culture has been subject to brain washing in an effort to strip them of their cultural identity.In 2017, friends that Tynen knew began to disappear. She said more than 1 million Uigher Muslims are now detained in internment camps.One Uighur woman also spoke to the crowd about how members of her extended family have disappeared. The woman asked that she not be named so as to protect the members of her family who still live in China. She said what's happening to the Uigher people is genocide."It's like a virus, we can't just treat the symptoms," she said. "The virus is deep inside. Your voice is your action."Tracy Smith, the ICB's executive communication member, said it was an important topic to bring to Boulder's attention, because it affects not only people across the globe, but also along the Front Range. She said many community members have family in these regions who are suffering."Stories like these, they don't get a lot of press in the U.S.," Smith said. "We are very removed from a lot of the news. It's important to bring it to the U.S. and especially people in Boulder, who are aware and caring."Smith said those who are aware can strive for changes, whether a social media campaign or protesting. She hoped people took from the stories some compassion and they remembered to keep the issue at the forefront.Many of those who spoke asked Boulder County residents to take action. Tynen encouraged those who heard the stories to write a letter to the secretary of state or members of Congress.Erika Blum, a representative from Congressman Joe Neguse's office, was among those who attended the event Friday. Looking out on the crowd, Blum encouraged people to reach out to congress to share their feedback on the human rights issuesNeguse (D-CO) is a consponsor of House H.R. 649 the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2019, which seeks to have the U.S. government bodies investigate and prepare reports about the treatment of the culture at the hands of the Chinese government. The bill was introduced into the House this week.As she spoke to the crowd, Tynen said she hoped to emphasize people around the world are more alike than different."Now I know we are all connected through a shared humanity," Tynen said. "I hope to illustrate today why when one person is harmed, we are all harmed."Load-Date: January 18, 2020End of Document

Coronavirus kills 259 in China, nearly 12,000 infected worldwideUPIFebruary 1, 2020 Saturday 9:30 AM ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 470 wordsByline: SOMMER BROKAWDateline: Feb. 1 BodyChina's death toll from the coronavirus rose to at least 259 people Saturday as the number of cases worldwide rose to nearly 12,000.The National Health Commission said that among those infected by the disease, which began in December, were 10 in Taiwan.Officials said the number of suspected cases reached 17,988, adding that they were monitoring about 137,000 people who had close contact with infected individuals.In Hong Kong, more than 9,000 medical workers voted Saturday to begin a five-day strike Monday after the government refused to shut down all its borders with mainland China.The Hospital Authority Employees Alliance said 99 percent of its members voted to take part in the strike.The first stage outlined in a post on the union's Facebook page is to stop non-emergency services, the second phase is limited emergency services and the strike could escalate if there is no response by next Friday.Hong Kong has at least 13 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. The government has extended school holidays and suspended residents of China's Hubei province, at the center of the outbreak, from entering the city.The outbreak is believed to have originated from a now-closed Wuhan seafood market. The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern Thursday after the first case of human-to-human transmission in the United States was confirmed.On Friday, health officials in Britain and Sweden confirmed their first cases of the coronavirus. One of two people who tested positive for the coronavirus in Britain was a student at the University of York in northern England.Australia also recorded its first case of the virus and on Saturday barred all entry for foreigners traveling from China."Effective immediately, foreign nationals (excluding permanent residents) who are in mainland China from today forward, will not be allowed to enter Australia for 14 days from the time they have left or transited through mainland China," Prime Minister Scott Morrison said.Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has asked the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen over the phone to help China obtain medical supplies to curb the epidemic, a Chinese government statement showed.The country also canceled retaliatory tariffs on U.S. medical and other products needed to help combat the virus, the Ministry of Finance said.Meanwhile, China continued to encourage residents to stay home amid the outbreak. Some 60 million people are under lockdown in the country. Authorities in 19 provinces have also encouraged businesses to delay workers' return to work after the Lunar New Year Holiday. Officials requested a delay until at least Feb. 10.Apple temporarily closed all its stores in mainland China and Britain recalled some staff from its consulates in China.Load-Date: February 2, 2020End of Document

CHINESE MILITARY HACKERS CHARGED IN EQUIFAX BREACH; INTRUSION AFFECTED NEARLY HALF OF ALL AMERICANSStates News ServiceFebruary 10, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 571 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the FBI:During a February 10, 2010 press conference at the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich joined other officials in announcing charges against four Chinese military-backed hackers in connection with the 2017 cyberattack against Equifax.Today, the U.S. Department of Justice announced charges against four Chinese military-backed hackers in connection with carrying out the 2017 cyberattack against Equifax, a consumer credit reporting agency. The intrusion led to the largest known theft of personally identifiable information ever carried out by state-sponsored actors.Investigators had previously discovered and announced the type of malware that allowed the hackers to harvest addresses, birth dates, Social Security numbers, and other data on approximately 145 million Americans. Today's indictment charges that members of the People's Liberation Armythe armed forces of the People's Republic of Chinawere behind that malware attack.According to the indictment, Wu Zhiyong, Wang Qian, Xu Ke, and Liu Lei exploited a vulnerability in the dispute resolution website within the Equifax system. From that initial access point, the hackers used a number of techniques to force their way into the company's network and back-end databases.In announcing the charges, U.S. Attorney General William Barr said the Equifax intrusion is among other efforts by the Chinese government to steal the personal data of Americans. The Justice Department believes the Chinese were also responsible for breaching systems controlled by the Office of Personnel Management, Marriott hotels, and the health insurance company Anthem.This data has economic value, and these thefts can feed China's development of artificial intelligence tools as well as the creation of intelligence-targeting packages, Barr said. In addition to the thefts of sensitive personal data, our cases reveal a pattern of state-sponsored computer intrusions and thefts by China targeting trade secrets and confidential business information.We in law enforcement will not let hackers off the hook just because they're halfway around the world.FBI Deputy Director David BowdichTo uncover the actors behind the Equifax theft, a broad and multinational investigative team led by the FBI's Atlanta Field Office tracked the crime's digital breadcrumbs back to the four co-conspiratorswho allegedly used servers in multiple countries and approximately 40 different IP addresses to disguise the origin of the attack.FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich said today's announcement is a testament to the hard work and determination of everyone involved in this investigation.Bowdich also said that although these types of breaches have become disturbingly common, businesses cannot become complacent about protecting data and consumers. And as American citizens, we cannot be complacent about protecting our sensitive personal data, Bowdich emphasized. We in law enforcement will not let hackers off the hook just because they're halfway around the world. We've got to do everything we can to keep people safe, secure, and confident online.You can find additional information about the Equifax data breach through the Federal Trade Commission at ftc.gov/equifax.Learn more about protecting your personal and business systems and reporting cyber-enabled crime at the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center.Load-Date: February 10, 2020End of Document

CHINESE MILITARY PERSONNEL CHARGED WITH COMPUTER FRAUD, ECONOMIC ESPIONAGE AND WIRE FRAUD FOR HACKING INTO CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY EQUIFAXStates News ServiceFebruary 10, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 932 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC):Indictment Alleges Four Members of China's People's Liberation Army Engaged in a Three-Month Long Campaign to Steal Sensitive Personal Information of Nearly 150 Million AmericansA federal grand jury in Atlanta returned an indictment last week charging four members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) with hacking into the computer systems of the credit reporting agency Equifax and stealing Americans' personal data and Equifax's valuable trade secrets.The nine-count indictment alleges that Wu Zhiyong (a,ai‡), Wang Qian (cŽia), Xu Ke(eR¸a ¯) and Liu Lei (c ) were members of the PLA's 54th Research Institute, a component of the Chinese military. They allegedly conspired with each other to hack into Equifax's computer networks, maintain unauthorized access to those computers, and steal sensitive, personally identifiable information of approximately 145 million American victims."This was a deliberate and sweeping intrusion into the private information of the American people," said Attorney General William P. Barr, who made the announcement. "Today, we hold PLA hackers accountable for their criminal actions, and we remind the Chinese government that we have the capability to remove the Internet's cloak of anonymity and find the hackers that nation repeatedly deploys against us. Unfortunately, the Equifax hack fits a disturbing and unacceptable pattern of state-sponsored computer intrusions and thefts by China and its citizens that have targeted personally identifiable information, trade secrets, and other confidential information."According to the indictment, the defendants exploited a vulnerability in the Apache Struts Web Framework software used by Equifax's online dispute portal. They used this access to conduct reconnaissance of Equifax's online dispute portal and to obtain login credentials that could be used to further navigate Equifax's network. The defendants spent several weeks running queries to identify Equifax's database structure and searching for sensitive, personally identifiable information within Equifax's system. Once they accessed files of interest, the conspirators then stored the stolen information in temporary output files, compressed and divided the files, and ultimately were able to download and exfiltrate the data from Equifax's network to computers outside the United States. In total, the attackers ran approximately 9,000 queries on Equifax's system, obtaining names, birth dates and social security numbers for nearly half of all American citizens.The indictment also charges the defendants with stealing trade secret information, namely Equifax's data compilations and database designs. "In short, this was an organized and remarkably brazen criminal heist of sensitive information of nearly half of all Americans, as well as the hard work and intellectual property of an American company, by a unit of the Chinese military," said Barr.The defendants took steps to evade detection throughout the intrusion, as alleged in the indictment. They routed traffic through approximately 34 servers located in nearly 20 countries to obfuscate their true location, used encrypted communication channels within Equifax's network to blend in with normal network activity, and deleted compressed files and wiped log files on a daily basis in an effort to eliminate records of their activity."Today's announcement of these indictments further highlights our commitment to imposing consequences on cybercriminals no matter who they are, where they are, or what country's uniform they wear," said FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich. "The size and scope of this investigation affecting nearly half of the U.S. population, demonstrates the importance of the FBI's mission and our enduring partnerships with the Justice Department and the U.S. Attorney's Office. This is not the end of our investigation; to all who seek to disrupt the safety, security and confidence of the global citizenry in this digitally connected world, this is a day of reckoning."The defendants are charged with three counts of conspiracy to commit computer fraud, conspiracy to commit economic espionage, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The defendants are also charged with two counts of unauthorized access and intentional damage to a protected computer, one count of economic espionage, and three counts of wire fraud.The investigation was conducted jointly by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia, the Criminal and National Security Divisions of the Department of Justice, and the FBI's Atlanta Field Office. The FBI's Cyber Division also provided support. Equifax cooperated fully and provided valuable assistance in the investigation.Assistant U.S. Attorneys Nathan Kitchens, Samir Kaushal, and Thomas Krepp of the Northern District of Georgia; Senior Counsel Benjamin Fitzpatrick of the Criminal Division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section; and Trial Attorney Scott McCulloch of the National Security Division's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting this case. Attorneys with the Office of International Affairs provided critical assistance in obtaining evidence from overseas.The details contained in the charging document are allegations. The defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.The year 2020 marks the 150th anniversary of the Department of Justice.

He has overtaken Elizabeth Warren for third place.Joining the conversation is "The New York Post" editorial board member Kelly Torrance; Fox Business' Dagen McDowell; and "The Wall Street Journal" senior writer Jon Hilsenrath.Interesting developments in New Hampshire.JON HILSENRATH, SENIOR WRITER, "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL": That would be a huge win I think for Bloomberg if he can get to number three without even investing the place.KELLY JANE TORRANCE, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER, "THE NEW YORK POST": It's amazing. He decided to skip these early states. I think it was a good idea. There's not that many delegates but his ad buys -- he's spending an unprecedented amount, I think, more than anyone in history that are still reaching people.And I think once we saw Biden tank in Iowa and Bernie do so well, I think you know anybody who is not a Democratic socialist is worried and they're trying to figure out who is best positioned to beat Bernie Sanders and actually have a shot at unseating Trump.BARTIROMO: Have you guys seen the commercial that Michael Bloomberg is running with Obama in it?TORRANCE: Yes.BARTIROMO: So I wonder if President Obama had to give the ok for that. So there is the commercial and Obama is all over it. Not that he actually comes out and says I'm endorsing Michael Bloomberg but there are clips of him talking about Michael Bloomberg, talking about how the two worked together, and President Obama is all over Michael Bloomberg's commercial.And I just want to note this because we know that Michael -- that President Obama refused to endorse Joe Biden.TORRANCE: I find it fascinating that he refused to endorse and really has hardly even said anything about Joe Biden. And I think it's actually very great you brought that up because I wonder we have now seen Joe Biden's African-American support start to tank well and Michael Bloomberg has been picking up a lot of those voters.So you wonder if, you know, his ad touting how much Barack Obama said so many good things about him -- some of these were when Michael Bloomberg was still a Republican.BARTIROMO: That's right.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That's in the new Quinnipiac poll. If you look at African-American or black Democratic primary voters. In late January Joe Biden polled in terms of polling, 52 percent of those voters with Bernie Sanders in second at 15 percent. Now 27 percent for Joe Biden. He's lost almost half that support in.In second place is Mike Bloomberg, 22 percent. So clearly, this ad campaign that's over $300 million in just advertising so far is having an impact.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: And Michael Bloomberg saw that there was a little 2.5 minute clip on the Internet over -- last week where he's trying to out troll President Trump. It was a little gingerbread man going lies, lies, lies -- dancing around this clip of --BARTIROMO: I did not see that. Wow.MCDOWELL: -- President Trump -- of course, the little gingerbread man. I said on "THE GREG GUTFIELD SHOW" over the weekend was that supposed to be mini Mike?BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE)Look, we also have to see what Michael Bloomberg says about China. I mentioned this earlier in the show and this is an important situation because Mike Bloomberg was asked what he thought of China.Let me just tell you the story of the day. The United States, has indicted four members of the Chinese military on charges that they hacked Equifax. They stole personal data from nearly 150 million Americans back in 2017.Attorney General William Barr spoke out about it yesterday. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: This was one of the largest data breaches in history. This theft not only caused significant financial damage to Equifax but invaded the privacy of many millions of Americans and imposed substantial costs and burdens on them, as they had to take measures to protect themselves from identity theft.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And this, of course, is on top of Secretary Mike Pompeo this week giving a speech in front of the governors where he said the Chinese government has been methodical in the way it's analyzed our system, a very open system. It's assessed our vulnerabilities. It's decided to exploit our freedoms to gain advantage over us at the federal level, the state level and the local level.And yet Michael Bloomberg was asked about China and what did he say -- Dagen?MCDOWELL: He gave an interview to Margaret Hoover on PBS. And this was only a few months ago. This was in the fall. And Margaret Hoover was challenging Mike Bloomberg on just the environmental policies in China and they're burning of coal.And he said look they are now moving plants away from the cities. The Communist Party wants to stay in power in China and they listen to the public. When the public says I can't breathe air Xi Jinping is not a dictator. He has to satisfy his constituents or he is not going to survive and Margaret Hoover pressed him on it. He's not a dictator? No, he has a constituency to answer to. That's what he said.BARTIROMO: How is he not a dictator.MCDOWELL: He's not a dictator. Do you think --BARTIROMO: That's laughable.HILSENRATH: To take devil's advocate side here. The President has spoken very highly of President Xi as well. He calls him a great man, and a great friend so --BARTIROMO: That's a good point but you also have people like Bill Barr, like Secretary Pompeo going out and telling us the facts about how China's military. That is the most important thing in China.And there is something called Civil Military Fusion. Any innovation that goes into the country first has to be seen, to see if it is going to be working in the military because they want to be the number one superpower. They want to win not just economically but militarily as well.These are important issues that American people need to understand especially when you've got Chinese nationals that are working for the Chinese military hacking Equifax and getting the data of 150 million Americans.HILSENRATH: Absolutely. And I think one of the messages that the Chinese took from the trade battle that we took to them is that they have to double down on all the investments that they're putting into high tech, that they are putting into Huawei, that they are putting into you know, subsidizing their own industries.And the idea that we --BARTIROMO: Well, they've gotten it for free stealing it for way too long.HILSENRATH: Right. And the idea that we've reached some kind of amicable truce with China, I think is going to be a passing event. This is a long run confrontation that we have --BARTIROMO: Absolutely.HILSENRATH: -- with the second biggest economy in the world.BARTIROMO: Does Michael Bloomberg understand that?TORRANCE: I don't think he understands how the Chinese government works let alone what we need to do --(CROSSTALKING)MCDOWELL: I think he understands. And he is in -- I mean he's siding with Communist China. No. He is --BARTIROMO: Yes. He wants American companies to have access into China. He's a globalist in that regard.MCDOWELL: We will have a big debate about his financial interests.BARTIROMO: Let's talk more about that coming up and in the days ahead.We've got a big hour ahead.Cyber spies are on the rise. What you need to know to protect yourself against cyber criminals targeting our go-to check out list like Google, Apple and Amazon.And then making strides in STEM. How two women determined to break down male stereotypes are inspiring young girls to achieve the jobs of their dreams. Don't miss that.But first, coming up right after this, the final push. Voters casting their first ballots in New Hampshire today as Democrats go head-to-head in the fierce battleground state. But can the party avoid a repeat of the caucus chaos in Iowa?And then shares of Sprint are sprinting this morning. The stock up on reports that a judge will greenlight its merge with T-Mobile. The stock is up this morning 62 percent.Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.We are looking at New Hampshire this morning. Democratic candidates fighting for the top spot in the first of the nation primary, after the disaster in Iowa. Voting is underway.Mayor Mike Bloomberg scored a victory in tiny Dixville Notch with three write-in votes out of the five votes total. Senator Bernie Sanders and Mayor Pete Buttigieg appear to be neck and neck right now.Joining me right now is House Foreign Affairs and House Financial Services Committee member Congressman Gregory Meeks. Congressman -- it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining me.REP. GREGORY MEEKS (D-NY): Good to be with you.BARTIROMO: So give me your assessment of what is happening in New Hampshire this morning and what is resonating with the people.MEEKS: Well, democracy is happening. I think that you see candidates that are, you know, going out on detail politics to earn the votes of those in New Hampshire to win that primary, to get the delegates that would come from it.And you've got individuals who are talking from their positions. Bernie Sanders and Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar and Vice President Joe Biden. They are all trying to get to their lane and trying to talk to why they would be the best person to be our Democratic nominee.BARTIROMO: Congressman -- have you gotten behind somebody yet?MEEKS: I have not. I have not endorsed any one as of yet. You know, we're looking at it very carefully and trying to make sure, I'm trying to come up to who I decide is going to be the best person to take on the current president.And I think that is extremely important to make sure, that ultimately, you know -- and I'm going to support whoever wins I think whoever wins will beat Donald Trump that can unify this country, and bring us together. That is what I'm looking for. We desperately need to come together.BARTIROMO: You know, it's interesting that Michael Bloomberg -- people wrote in Michael Bloomberg's name even though he wasn't there. Then you've got this recording of Bloomberg making waves this morning. Back in 2015 the Democratic candidate was taped defending the controversial stop and frisk program put in place here in New York City to deal with gun violence.Listen to this -- got to get your reaction to this -- Congressman. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE BLOOMBERG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: 95 percent of your murders -- murderers and murder victims fit one M.O. You can just take the description, xerox it and pass it out to all the cops. They are male, minorities. The way you get the guns out of the kids' hands is to throw them up against the wall and frisk them.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Wow. That is harsh. But of course, the New York -- former New York City mayor admitted that the police tactic targeted minority kids. Bloomberg apologized for supporting the policy back in November. What did you feel about that?MEEKS: Well, you know, I think Bloomberg got it right now that it was a mistake. It was the wrong policy. Should not have happened. It was incorrect. It was bad.I think he had the goal of trying to stop and save some of those young kids' lives by taking the gun down at the end also.BARTIROMO: Yes.MEEKS: But I don't think that, you know, last election would have happened -- and I think that our intelligence shows it with reference to the bots and the other things the Russians were doing trying to target the African- American community when they were talking about the crime bill and others - -BARTIROMO: Yes.MEEKS: -- to prevent folks from coming out to vote. I don't think that this is going to work this time. I think that African-American voters, they're going to look and they're going to discern who's the best person to beat Donald Trump, who has the policies that's best for them.And that is what they're going to come out to vote. They're going to be recognized if African-Americans come out to vote -- and so.BARTIROMO: Is it an uphill battle, Congressman -- in the African American community given the fact that this president has really tried to come up with policies to impact this portion of Americans? I mean look at the proposed 2021 budget totaling $4.8 trillion, increasing -- including an increase in military spending, also focused on cutting drug prices.But that is on top of these policies that have brought the unemployment rate for the African American community to a record low. Unemployment is at a record low in the black community.You've also got -- you've also got wages up at the bottom earnings. And of course, these earnings opportunity zones, he gave a shout-out to Senator Tim Scott -- that was Tim Scott's bill for the opportunity zones that hereto have attracted support from the poorest areas including minorities.MEEKS: Well, look. In districts like mine, you see asymmetrical economy. Still individuals are not able -- they have $400 emergency -- they're not able to come up with that money without having to borrow some more money.You look at what is taking place with his budget cuts when you talk about Medicaid and Medicaid and Social Security. This is all devastating for communities like mine of the people of color.So I don't think that this budget that the President has come up with is going to be something that is going to be appealing to the African American communities. And the African American communities also understand how they want someone that they can look up to with dignity. But when you have the kinds of words that come out of the President's mouth whether it's immigration reform that he is talking about that's against them, or you talk about these good people --BARTIROMO: Yes.MEEKS: -- on both sides, that is a problem. And it has been a problem for the Republicans also because if you look at the primaries, before, that in Republican primary, where it was hotly contested. And just listen to what Lindsey Graham, and Ted Cruz, and Rubio said about the President (INAUDIBLE) -- those things are still true today.BARTIROMO: Well, they want an investigation of Hunter Biden -- the people you just mentioned. I mean Lindsey Graham wants it to happen in the House Foreign Affairs committee which is your committee. Would you do that?MEEKS: I'm just saying --BARTIROMO: I'm sorry?MEEKS: I'm just saying what Lindsey Graham said during the primary season of Barack Obama when said that the President was the worst person in the world to represent the Republican Party.BARTIROMO: OK, I thought you were referring to what he said about Hunter.MEEKS: No, no.BARTIROMO: Let me just ask you real quick -- Congressman. Real quick before you go, this New York bail reform -- I'm glad you mentioned your district in New York -- do you want to take a second look at this given the fact that crime is up in New York, right now?MEEKS: Well, what I think that needs to be done, there's all these conversation. There's never a perfect bill. I believe in judges having discretion, et cetera. But I think what we want to do is to make sure that the playing field is level.If an individual is rich and commits a crime, that person should not be out of jail while somebody commits the very same crime --BARTIROMO: Right. Yes, I understand the reason for the bail reform --(CROSSTALKING)MEEKS: -- that don't have any money. And so -- we got to figure out and we got to talk to try to make sure that the playing field is level and individuals --(CROSSTALKING)BARTIROMO: But isn't there -- aren't there unintended consequences? Crime is up, and you know, these people are getting out of prison saying nonviolent things like punching somebody in the nose -- that that's nonviolent.MEEKS: Well look, the President said punch somebody in the nose in front of a crowd also --BARTIROMO: No, I'm talking about the New York bail reform -- Congressman. That is what I'm talking about right now.MEEKS: And New York bail reform I said that there's room to make sure there's discretion. But the playing field has to be level. A person should not have to sit in jail simply because they are poor.BARTIROMO: Even if they're going to come out and rob another bank? Even if they come out and rob another bank?MEEKS: Well -- the worst thing --BARTIROMO: That's what happens.MEEKS: -- in the world is -- the worst thing in the world is people sitting in jail who are innocent.BARTIROMO: Yes. That's true. That I agree with.MEEKS: If you were sitting in jail, you did not do it.BARTIROMO: I agree with that. You don't want an innocent person in jail.MEEKS: -- our system says you are presumed innocent until proven guilty.BARTIROMO: Yes. Due process.MEEKS: And what needs to happen is we've got to make sure that judges have discretion and people, rich and poor --BARTIROMO: that's something we agree on for sure.MEEKS: -- are treated equally.BARTIROMO: We need fairness in this country. Congressman -- it's good to see you, sir.MEEKS: Good to be with you.BARTIROMO: Gregory Meeks -- please come back soon, sir.We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: And a Fox Business Alert -- it is official. A U.S. federal judge approved the $26 billion merger between Sprint and T-Mobile. In the ruling, the judge is disagreeing with a group of state attorneys general who argue that the merger would lead to lower competition and higher prices for consumers. And he disagreed and approved this deal. These stocks have been soaring all morning.Meanwhile, cyber spies are on the rise. IBM releasing its annual index of the largest cyber security threats of 2019. This report shows how cyber criminals are getting more sophisticated.Joining me right now is IBM's X-Force head, Wendy Whitmore. Wendy -- good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.And we should point out that we got story this morning which is one of the lead stories, that Chinese nationals -- four Chinese nationals, part of the members of Chinese military were indicted because they were behind the Equifax breach which breached and got the information from 150 million Americans. Tell us where the bad actors are coming from when it comes to cyber threats.WENDY WHITMORE, X-FORCE HEAD, IBM: Yes. Hi. Good morning -- Maria. Great to be here.So I think, you know, in terms of these breaches right, I have been responding to some of the most major breaches in the world for nearly the last 20 years. And nation state actors are a huge component of that.One of the things though that I think we are seeing that we have seen previously, is that you know spear phishing, for example, so the stealing of information -- that is still prevalent. But it's actually becoming less prevalent both by nation states and by other types of cyber criminals because there is so much data that's already out there that's been stolen previously whether that's user accounts and credentials and passwords. Or it's things like vulnerabilities that they're exploiting that has been out for a couple of years.We're seeing attackers really leverage that data that's out there, and you know, that 8.5 billion records that were stolen just last year alone.HILSENRATH: Wendy -- what would you say the Chinese are doing with all this information that they are stealing from Americans? And what do our viewers out there need to do to protect themselves to make sure it doesn't affect their finances or something else?WHITMORE: You know, a lot of these attacks are targeted at (INAUDIBLE) intellectual property, so business type of information, right. But as we talk about consumers, one of the things that is really prevalent is that people actually aren't changing their passwords, believe it or not.So all of these records that have been stolen, people are becoming too complacent. So in terms what have we can do to protect ourselves, make sure that you have strong passwords that you're not using the same password on every single account. And that you are using two factor authentication. So that means some other form in addition to a password. Something like it.(CROSSTALKING)BARTIROMO: Yes. Fingerprint.HILSENRATH: What are they doing with the information they're taking?WHITMORE: Well, nation state actors have been doing this a long time, right. So whether it's China or Russia or North Korea, they're typically leveraging that intellectual property to then move towards some sort of a political objective. And that really varies, right, in every type of organization.But the reality is that these attacks are coming, you know, fast and hard organizations every day.BARTIROMO: I think what Jon is getting at is we're trying to understand what they are doing with this data. And I know that China has been stealing intellectual property for decades from the United States. So I think partly is just learning from Americans how they do things, what they do, you know, and using that information and stealing it.I mean, do you have any sense of specifically what the bad actors do with the personal data of Americans?WHITMORE: Yes, I mean lots of different angles right with that but in terms of what they're actually looking to do and when you look at nation state actors, right. Organizations like big countries, they're typically trying to amass large amounts of data, then do analytics on it and make decisions that are related to political objectives.BARTIROMO: Right. And that includes tracking. Look, these cyber attackers are impersonating top brands like Google and Amazon also, right. Because they want to gain info and access their operations in terms of Google and Amazon. I mean you got to be worried about these phishing attacks.WHITMORE: Well, I think what's key here, right are these are brands that we all trust, right. Amazon, Google, Facebook, YouTube -- and so we are expecting to receive some communications from them, right, so attackers know that hey if I can spoof e-mails from them, I have a better chance at stealing your data.So consumers really need to be aware of that and you know, making sure that if you don't need to receive an e-mail from them, that not opening it and that you're not sharing personal data when you respond.BARTIROMO: Great point.Wendy -- thank you so much. Wendy Whitmore -- we appreciate you joining us this morning from IBM.We are right around the embargo that's going to be up. Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell is testifying before the House Financial Services Committee this morning. And we've got the embargoed copy of the testimony. It's about to be up in four seconds. Let's get to Ed Lawrence. He's got the headlines from Capitol Hill right now.EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK GENERAL ASSIGNMENT REPORTER: Maria, the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is going to say the economy is very strong. He is hinting that the Fed will be on the sidelines as the Federal Reserve goes throughout the rest of this year and less the data he says changes but there would be no interest rates or hikes or cuts related to them according to the Powell speech here.Now, Powell believes that inflation will get back to that two percent target in 2020. However, he says it all of 2019 both P.C. inflation and core P.C. inflation were at 1.6 percent. Well below that Fed's target. Now Fed Chairman says that consumer spending is driving this economy. He did however, see -- say that he saw consumer spending sort of taper off a little bit at the end of last year, but he says that household spending fundamentals are still there to go into 2020.He sees that going forward now home sales, the Federal Reserve Chairman says that in the second half of last year he saw home sales tick up, they were down, they were a little bit weaker in the first half, second half going up, he sees that strong into 2020. Now, Powell is telling the committee that some trade uncertainty that there's been slower global growth and trade uncertainties has made business investment weaker.He sees those uncertainties clearing up a little bit. However, there are some risks and one big risk, specifically the Federal Reserve Chairman will say is the coronavirus. They're watching this very closely according to the Federal Reserve Chairman and he is concerned that it would cause disruptions in China, that would spill over to the global economy. Now the second half of Powell's speech will focus on productivity.He says that there should be a national gauge for how the economic expansion is going. And it should be a national priority to get labor force participation rate up as well as productivity up. And he's also telling lawmakers that to get there in the sustainable budget needs to be on the horizon here. The Federal Reserve Chairman says that the Federal funds rate is so low close to the zero-lower bound.There may be fiscal policy needed to help in the case of a severe downturn. Now, he does not see a downturn coming but the Federal budget needs to be on a sustainable path to get there. Now, one last thing in this report, not in his speech in the report is going to say that the fine print, the risk of a recession in the next 12 months has diminished noticeably. And that is what this report says according to the Federal Reserve. So he does not see a recession within the next 12 months. Back to you, Maria.BARTIROMO: All right Edward. Great. Thanks so much. We got the embargo first from Edward Lawrence. We will take a break. When we come back, the final push. Voters rushing to the polls in New Hampshire this morning as Democrats go head to head in the first battleground state. Can the party avoid a repeat of the caucus chaos in Iowa?Then making strides in stand. How two women, determined to break down male stereotypes are inspiring young girls to achieve the job of their dreams. All right here.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. 2020 heating up. The New Hampshire primaries underway with residents of the tiny Dixville Notch. Heading to the polls at midnight. Tonight, President Trump held a rally in Manchester last night. He criticized how speaker Nancy Pelosi's conduct during the State of the Union expressed optimism for a big GOP win in 2020. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: On Tuesday, I delivered by address or the State of the Union and I had somebody behind me who was mumbling terribly, mumbling. Mumbling, wah, wah, ho, ha. He was mumbling. Very distracting. The first step to victory in November's tomorrow, go send a message that Republicans and you can vote for the weakest candidate if you want. Don't worry about it.I don't really think we actually have a candidate against us that Republicans are energized, that we're united. And that nine months from now we are going to take back the House of Representatives. We are going to hold the Senate and we are going to keep the White House. A very brave man. He took the bullet, he got shot. And he got up. He was going to die that night. The doctor told me he didn't have a good chance, but he's tough as hell.And he's a really terrific friend. He's a winner. He put himself back into shape. He actually looks better now than they did before he got shot. Steve Scalise.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And joining me right now is the man himself, Louisiana Congressman and House Minority Whip, Steve Scalise. Congressman, it's good to have you this morning. Were you expecting that shout out from the President?REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA): You never know what you're going to get. But like -- I love working with this guy and he was really fired up on the flight to the rally. And of course, you saw overflow crowd. They said something like 50,000 people requested to go to the rally. So we had a lot of fun. Maria. He's got a great story to tell. But there's a lot of energy here on the ground in New Hampshire for President Trump's reelection.BARTIROMO: I want to talk to you about what the Federal Reserve is saying. We just got the embargoed comments from Jay Powell about the economy. But let me get to that in a second. I've got all the headlines here, which I'm going to talk to you about what Jay Powell is going to testify today in front of the House Financial Services Committee. But, Congressman, your thoughts right now on what this whole impeachment battle has done?I mean, yes, the President has a good story to tell. And yet, you know, the Democrats want to get more dirt on him.SCALISE: You know, I think it just shows you when you watch the State of the Union, especially and the President is talking about all these great indicators. And, you know, we had a great jobs report, by the way, come out at the end of last week that probably got overshadow over 200,000 new jobs created. Again, you're seeing record numbers, a job creation. When the President talked about how every different sector of our economy, every different segment of this country has a better chance at the American Dream maybe than ever before where, you know, whether it's African-American unemployment, Hispanic unemployment, Asian unemployment at an all-time low.Women owned businesses on double digit increases, everybody's participating in this recovery that wants to get out there and be a part of the American dream again, and with this sign that, you know, the chances for recession are even lower, because the economy continues to be strong. That's going to be the dominant force in this election where the President wants to keep this going and said the best is yet to come.And the Democrats want to move towards socialism. Maria, I don't think this country is a socialist nation and never will be. And this election, I think it's going to be a great contrast to show what we're doing with a -- with a free economy, a growing economy versus where they want to go with government control of your life.BARTIROMO: So the chairman of the Federal Reserve will be testifying in front of the House Financial Services Committee today couple of things from his embargoed speech that we know that he's going to say in his prepared remarks. He's -- the Fed is closely monitoring coronavirus. Economic activity increased at a moderate pace. The economy is resilient at in global in the face of global headwinds that intensified this summer.He thinks inflation is running low at two percent, job openings are plentiful, says Jay Powell. Employers increasingly willing to hire workers and then train them. And he says that residential investment turned up in the second half of the year. My question to you is how do you keep this going? I mean, the President just said that you're going to take back the House. Let's say the GOP takes back the House in November of this year. What's your first priority?SCALISE: The first priority is to focus on lowering healthcare costs, prescription drug prices. We have a lot of legislation teed up that was very bipartisan, two lower drug prices, Maria and Speaker Pelosi won't bring those kind of packages bills to the floor. I think if you look at trade deals, you and I talked a lot about USMCA and you saw it drag on at least six months longer than it should have.There are more trade deals out there to be had, you know, something that can help get this economy growing even stronger. Our European allies, our Asian allies, want to get trade deals with us now that they've seen Canada and Mexico get better relationship. But then China, we all know taking on China has been necessary. President Trump just sign phase one of an agreement, but we've got to hold them accountable and make sure they play by the same rules as everybody else.And I think as you see that move forward, and we address it. I think, again, there's even more growth in this economy to come from that.BARTIROMO: And the President also talks about another tax cut plan, and then he came out with this proposal for the budget yesterday, talking about the debt and deficits that continue at $22 trillion in debt. Congressman, when does debt and deficits, when do these things become a real priority? Your reaction to these proposals from the president, given the fact that we're not looking at balance anytime soon.SCALISE: Yes. You know, it's a big priority and we worked on it in the healthcare bill that we had passed through the House two years ago that failed by one vote in the Senate. Not only would that bill have focused on lowering healthcare costs for families, protecting people with preexisting conditions, but it also blocked granted Medicaid to the states. Medicaid by, you know, anybody that understands healthcare knows, is probably the most broken form of healthcare.Under Obamacare they dumped millions more people on it. It's a program that's got a lot of financial problems, and it doesn't deliver the good quality healthcare for low income people that we should all have. Having states run that program will get you better healthcare outcomes for low income families, and you can save over $800 billion. That's one kind of reform that I think we need to see.But again, if you look at what President Trump has already done, tax cuts 2.0 is something we've absolutely talked about, but just making the tax cuts permanent, these great tax cuts that have worked to make our country competitive, to create this great economic environment where millions of people are getting off the unemployment rolls and getting into good jobs. Those -- some of those tax cuts expire. We want to make those tax cuts permanent, and then go do more things that will make this an even stronger economy.Growth absolutely helps you balance the budget, but also reforming broken programs like Medicaid will give you better healthcare outcomes and help you balance the Federal budget.BARTIROMO: You're talking about priorities. If you take the House back, you think you'll get anything done this year? I mean, Nancy Pelosi just wrapped up his script at the State of the Union. Obviously, the vitriol is hotter than ever.SCALISE: Yes. She did not show a willingness to want to work with the President. At the beginning of last year when she took over as speaker. You know, President talked about infrastructure. There's a lot of infrastructure on both -- interest and infrastructure on both sides of the aisle.BARTIROMO: OK. So you think you can maybe get that done?SCALISE: An ability to get that done. Yes. And there's something need to get done again, she's got to show a willingness to work with them. It took her over six months to bring USMCA to the road, when it's virtually the same agreement that he negotiated with Mexico and Canada. She just didn't want him to get a win.BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.SCALISE: The same thing can be said for prescription drugs. A lot things out there to do, if she doesn't want to do them that's fine, we will do that when we take over the House by the end of this year.BARTIROMO: Congressman, it's good to see this morning. Thanks so much.SCALISE: Great being with you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Steve Scalise joining us there. Coming up. Sealing the deal. A U.S. Federal judge approved the $26 billion merger between Sprint and T- Mobile. Well -- we're live on the trading floor with reaction.And then the Oscar is not shining so bright. Sunday's award show rated the lowest in the show's history. Stuart Varney has a thing that he has to say about that. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A U.S. federal judge has approved the $26 billion merger between Sprint and T-Mobile. Shares of both companies are soaring this morning on the news. Susan Li on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with more details. Susan?SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Maria, two-year ordeal to get this merger approved. It looks like the finish line is close and as you see the stocks are reacting. Sprint up from 60 percent in the premarket, now 70 percent. Now, the district, the DOJ, the Department of Justice sue to block this merger because they say that this prevents competition and eventually might hurt the consumer, taking four telecoms down to three but Sprint and T-Mobile say look we need to get together in order to build up 5G which is very expensive and to compete against the likes of AT&T and Verizon as well since both of those are very, very large when it comes to the number of customers.Now don't forget in May, on May 1st in May we do have John Legere stepping down, the pink t- shirt, wearing CEO will be stepping down as the head of T-Mobile in his place that on top of this. Now it looks to be a unified entity. It will be Mike Sievert who's currently the coo. We still await the California Public Utilities Commission to approve this transaction, but it looks like indications are they will likely do that.Now let's talk about some other movers and going in different directions on the back of earnings. First of all, Under Armour cratering this morning down 17 percent as much as 17 percent in the premarket and this is after some disappointing sales saying that coronavirus will drag on the first quarter by 50 or $60 million. Also, they lost money in the final three months of 2019 during the all-important holiday period.Now this company suffered its first quarterly loss back in 2017. And since then it's been struggling. We know that Kevin Plank the founder has stepped down. We have Patrick Frisk stepping in in January but a long road ahead with charges -- restructuring charges, Maria, around 300 to $400 million just in the first quarter. Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right. Stock is down 15 percent right now. Susan, thank you. Let's head over to studio B. Stuart Varney is there. "VARNEY & COMPANY" host preparing for his show top of the hour. Hey Stu, what's on deck?STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Maria, I have a big smile on my face because I got the Oscar ratings and they are way down. And I'm very happy about that because I don't know about you, Maria, but I'm absolutely sick and tired of multimillionaire actors telling me what a rotten person I and America really are. Well, the numbers sank to 24 million viewers down from 30 million last year.I believe it's the lowest rating ever. This is not just because these are more these ceremonies, these awards ceremonies are going down across the board. It's because Hollywood sticks it down our throat. We're all sick of it and we're not watching, Maria?BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, I think that's a feeling being felt increasingly three seconds in. Brad Pitt is over there talking about John Bolton. Stu, we'll see in 10 minutes. Thank you so much.VARNEY: Sure.BARTIROMO: First though, making strides in STEM. How two women determined to break down male stereotypes are inspiring young girls to achieve the job of their dreams. They will join me right here on set right after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. In honor of International Day of Women and Girls in Science today, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation is launching a new digital campaign called Light a Spark. It is shining a light on women who inspire and shape future careers. The goal for girls to consider a career in science, technology, engineering and math.My next two guests are two fabulous women who have found success getting girls on board. Joining me right now is Vantage Point Founder and CEO Morgan Mercer. And Hatch Beauty Brands Vice President of Product Development, Gillian Ratto. Great to see you both. Thank you so much for joining us girls.MORGAN MERCER, FOUNDER AND CEO, VANTAGE POINT: Thank you.GILLIAN RATTO, VICE PRESIDENT OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, HATCHBEAUTY BRANDS: Thank you.BARTIROMO: It is good to see you. Women make up less than 25 percent of the STEM workforce, which is a small number. Is that gender gap more likely to widen as technology takes over and sort of gets into every industry? What do you think?MERCER: I think it's incredibly important that we're making sure that the pipelines of talent going into STEM are as diverse as the jobs in STEM themselves. So I think that's why campaigns like this are crucially important, because if we're not focusing on solving the problem of the pipeline going in, then yes.BARTIROMO: It can be scary, right, Gillian? I mean, you are an amazing woman. You both are amazing women. You're a chemist, working for cosmetics company and you have tips for girls who were trying to pursue a STEM education. How did you become a chemist? Tell us about that. And what you want to say to girls who might want to break in?RATTO: There is a ton of failure throughout my career in terms of like schooling, I have no idea what I wanted to be. So I wanted to be a dentist, and then I fell in love with raw materials. And then I was traveling abroad that time and then I started making cosmetics. And I love it. So what I would just recommend is just getting a mentor and finding a path that works for you.BARTIROMO: And not to be intimidated by the subject, right? I think the first, when you feel like you don't know much about it, you get intimidated and that stops you from moving forward.RATTO: You need to experiment with failure for sure.BARTIROMO: Tell me about the reception that you've gotten in terms of women wanting to get in.MERCER: Yes. Breaking into sim as a whole?BARTIROMO: Yes.MERCER: Yes. I think that, you know, it's been incredibly empowering to be inspiring to young women and to be able to pass the baton forward. One of the biggest things I saw, you know, breaking into STEM was that there was a lack of female leadership and role models.BARTIROMO: Yes.MERCER: And so actually being able to have other female role models. It's incredible.BARTIROMO: Well, I've got two great ones right --Load-Date: February 11, 2020End of Document

Barr's call for U.S. control of 5G providers quickly rebukedAssociated Press Financial WireFebruary 7, 2020 Friday 10:35 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 1162 wordsByline: By TALI ARBEL, AP Technology WriterDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) - Trump administration officials, increasingly intent on preventing Chinese global technological domination, keep floating the idea that the U.S. government should take a more direct hand in running next-generation 5G wireless networks.But the notion isn't terribly popular - not even within the administration.On Thursday, Attorney General William Barr said the U.S. government should consider taking a " controlling stake " in the European companies Nokia and Ericsson to thwart the global ambitions of China-based Huawei, which holds a leading share of the market for 5G wireless equipment. The federal government could do so directly or via a consortium of U.S. companies and private investors, Barr said.The backlash didn't take long. In an interview on CNBC Friday, Vice President Mike Pence said "the best way forward" on 5G relies on private enterprise, not government takeovers. The Federal Communications Commission, which regulates the nation's airwaves, already plans to auction off additional radio spectrum for 5G."That's the plan the president has endorsed," Pence said. Later on Friday, Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow also argued against the idea, telling reporters at the White House that "the U.S. government is not in the business of buying companies, whether they're domestic or foreign."Trump has not tweeted about the proposal.Depending on how you count it, Barr's speech is the second or third time people in Trump's administration or 2020 campaign have suggested direct federal involvement in 5G networks, which boast faster speeds and promise a variety of new applications. Barr suggested in his speech that 5G speeds will turn wireless networks into "the central nervous system of the next generation of internet, called the 'Industrial Internet,'" with potentially dramatic economic consequences.In 2018, leaked National Security Council documents obtained by Axios proposed a U.S. government-built 5G network. That plan went nowhere.Then in 2019, members of Trump's reelection team offered up an idea, first reported by Politico, to create a new "wholesale" 5G network run under government contract that would provide bandwidth to network operators on an as-needed basis. Trump himself repudiated that notion after criticism from industry and other government officials, telling reporters that 5G remains "private-sector driven and private-sector led."Barr's speech, however, appears to be the first time a member of the Trump administration has publicly endorsed direct U.S. government ownership of 5G suppliers. The specific steps he suggested carry echoes of " industrial policy," which calls for a level of government involvement in the free market anathema to many economists and, at least previously, most Republican politicians.The idea enjoyed brief U.S. popularity in the 1980s amid fears that Japan's government-backed companies were destroying the U.S. technology industry. It then subsided as American tech companies surged ahead in the 1990s. Critics of free trade frequently note that China and Europe still run their own industrial policies.Barr argued that Huawei - and, by extension, the Chinese government - stands to dominate the "industrial internet" and reap the economic rewards unless the U.S. and its allies take quick, dramatic and unprecedented action. Huawei is the world's largest maker of telecom equipment."I would call that crazy," Michael Thelander, CEO of telecom consultancy Signals Research Group, said of Barr's idea of taking over European equipment companies. For the government to effectively take over a corporate entity "doesn't sound like a very Republican position," he said.AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson criticized Barr's idea of a government stake in private companies during a CNBC interview, and said that investing in software would help get around the need for Huawei.The Trump administration has positioned the transition to 5G as a race, particularly with China. It has cast Huawei as a de facto arm of the Chinese government that could enable global espionage. Huawei has denied these allegations.Despite its global footprint, Huawei has been largely absent from the U.S. since 2012, when a congressional panel warned phone carriers to avoid Huawei. The U.S. government has also taken steps to try to excise Huawei from small and rural wireless networks that still rely on its equipment, and has pressured allies to kick Huawei out of their telecom networks."There's a certain amount of desperation here as the U.S. government tries to figure out what do on 5G," said Washington lawyer David Hanke, a former GOP congressional aide. Hanke, however, said Barr's suggestion might be "the least-worst option" for dealing with Huawei, since the alternative would be permanent Chinese domination of the global market for 5G technology.Huawei has grown in Asia, Europe and Africa, helped by its dramatically lower prices, said Roger Entner, a telecom expert with Recon Analytics. Nokia and Ericsson have lost some market share along the way.Any acquisition of a majority stake in Ericsson or Nokia by an American company, let alone the U.S. government, would likely draw close scrutiny by European governments and EU regulators. Some European nations have also suggested setting up regional champions that could compete with U.S. and Chinese giants.The U.S. has other alternatives. A bipartisan group of senators have proposed a bill to invest $1 billion in Western alternatives to Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese telecom-equipment maker, by focusing on software. Kudlow also said in a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal that the administration was working with U.S. tech and telecom companies to develop software that could help reduce the need for Huawei's equipment.Barr dismissed that approach Thursday, calling it "pie in the sky" that could take a decade or more to implement. Telecom experts say it could be ready much sooner.The U.S. could also support research and development at the European companies, said James Lewis, director of the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He noted that Nokia and Ericsson are both big employers in the U.S.The FCC declined to comment on Barr's remarks. Democratic FCC commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement that discord over 5G policy showed that the Trump administration doesn't have a plan to "secure our 5G future."Ericsson and Nokia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Barr held bonds issued by Nokia as of December 2018, but he was required to sell them along with dozens of other holdings when he became attorney general last year, according to financial disclosure reports filed with a federal ethics agency. He has worked in the telecom field as general counsel for Verizon, which he left in 2008.__Paul Wiseman, Kevin Freking and Marcy Gordon in Washington, D.C.; Matt O'Brien in Providence, R.I., and Carlo Piovano in London contributed reporting.Load-Date: February 8, 2020End of Document

CHINA JAILS STUDENT FOR TWEETS SENT IN US SHOWING PRESIDENT AS WINNIE THE POOHStates News ServiceJanuary 23, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 957 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A student who tweeted a cartoon of Winnie the Pooh in connection with President Xi Jinping while studying in the U.S. was jailed for six months on his return to China for the summer vacation last year.The Wuchang District People's Court in the central city of Wuhan announced on Jan. 22 that Luo Daiqing, a student at the University of Minnesota, had been arrested and sentenced to six months' imprisonment for "posting a tweet criticizing President Xi Jinping, general secretary of the [ruling] Chinese Communist Party on Twitter."Luo, 25, was accused of posting dozens of "comments and inappropriate images insulting to the leader of this country" while studying in the U.S. in September and October 2018, the court said.Among the tweets cited by the court in evidence against Lu was a depiction of President Xi as Winnie the Pooh, whose likeness has been banned from China's tightly controlled internet after a number of memes likening the fictional bear to the president went viral.Luo was detained on July 12, 2019 by police in his hometown of Wuhan after he returned to China for the summer vacation, it said.He was handed a six-month jail term on Nov. 5, 2019 for "picking quarrels and stirring up trouble," a charge frequently used to target peaceful critics of the government.Luo was released on Jan. 11, 2020 after time in pretrial detention was included as part of his sentence, but declined to say much when contacted by RFA on Thursday.Taking a breakAsked if the media reports about him were correct, Luo said: "Pretty much! The online reports are pretty factual."But he declined to say whether he remains under surveillance or police restrictions or whether he has plans to resume his studies in the U.S."My situation right now is that I am taking a break," he said.Luo had also tweeted images depicting Xi as Lawrence Limburger, the villain in the Biker Mice From Mars cartoon, along with satirical reference to ruling Chinese Communist Party slogans, including "No national security without online security."Senator Ben Sasse of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee hit out at the sentence, saying that Twitter is blocked by government censorship and can't be accessed inside China's Great Firewall."The Chinese Communist Party ought to release Luo Daiqing immediately, and the University of Minnesota ought to give him a full-ride scholarship," Sasse said in a statement."Don't forget that the Chinese Communist Party has banned Twitter, so the only people who even saw these tweets were the goons charged with monitoring Chinese citizens while they're enjoying freedom here in the United States," the statement said."This is what ruthless and paranoid totalitarianism looks like."A University of Minnesota spokesman said the school has received no information about the case.Luo's defense lawyer Hu Jibin declined to comment on the case when contacted by RFA on Thursday.Global reachSulaiman Gu, a graduate student at the University of Georgia, said Luo's jailing is similar to the February 2017 jailing of Kwon Pyong by a court in the northeastern province of Jilin for posting a selfie wearing a T-shirt criticizing Chinese president Xi Jinping.Kwon Pyong, an ethnic Korean whose name in Mandarin is Quan Ping, was jailed for subversion after he "used words, images and video to insult and slander this country's government and the socialist system" on social media, according to the indictment."This case reminds me of the Kwon Pyong case three years ago. That also involved a student studying in the United States, who also ridiculed Xi Jinping," Gu said, adding that Kwon had planned to take his protest to the streets in China."Here, China is exercising cyber sovereignty over the U.S. internet and implementing global control over speech on U.S. soil," he said.Kwon, a graduate of Iowa State University, had previously spoken out online in support of dozens of detained Chinese human rights lawyers, as well as Guangzhou-based rights activist Guo Feixiong.He was detained on Sept. 30, 2016 after posting selfies wearing a T-shirt with several satirical nicknames for President Xi, including "Xitler," and "Baozi Xi" in a reference to the president's widely publicized visit to a regular restaurant to eat baozi, or steamed pork buns, with local people.Personality cultGu said both cases show that Xi is highly image-conscious and is building a personality cult around himself."Xi Jinping ... has been established by the regime as an unattainable idol, a god against whom blasphemy is not permitted," Gu said. "But he is not a god, so we should redouble our efforts to blaspheme against him."Wu Lebao, an international student at the Australian National University, said Beijing has wielded an unprecedented level of power over Chinese students on overseas campuses since Xi came to power in 2012."They now have an outrageous level of control over overseas students, and I think the [government-backed] Chinese Students and Scholars Associations (CSSA) have played a disgraceful role here," Wu said."The U.S. should consider banning the CSSAs and making them legally responsible for their actions."Liu Dasheng, a freelance journalist living in the United States, said the jailing of Luo shows how long Beijing's arm has become."This is all about what they call long-arm jurisdiction, and I think it violates U.S. sovereignty, not just freedom of speech," Liu told RFA."If this case is handled in this way, won't it then be possible for them to retaliate against any Chinese person overseas on their return to China?"Reported by Ng Yik-tung and Sing Man for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Jia Ao for the Mandarin Service.

History of Alibaba: Timeline and FactsTheStreet.comJanuary 2, 2020 Thursday 12:41 PM EDTCopyright 2020 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1336 wordsByline: Brian O'ConnellHighlight: The Alibaba story is one of a vision fulfilled. Here is the history of Alibaba and how one man's vision helped changed the way we buy goods and services.BodyFor all the accolades for U.S.-based internet-technology giants like Amazon.com and Facebook, the real king of the digital hill lies thousands of miles to the east in China -- the home of Alibaba.There's really no doubting that sentiment. Alibaba is the largest e-commerce company on earth, with its three primary e-commerce sites -- Taobao, Tmall and Alibaba.com -- engaging tens of millions of online users daily.How big is Alibaba? How does  sound? Or 755 million mobile users? Or  (in Chinese yuan) in revenues each year (that's $54 billion in U.S. dollars).No doubt about it, Alibaba is a huge e-commerce success story that continues to grow. How did the company take wing and soar to historically record-breaking commercial heights?It's a story worth telling, and it's a story primarily written by a visionary founder who saw a marketing opening in Internet-based e-commerce and took full advantage.Alibaba: A HistoryTechnically, Alibaba  was founded in December, 1999 by  , former school teacher, who spearheaded a group of 18 tech pioneers whose initial goal was to leverage the power of the wholesale internet marketplace.The founders hammered out Ma's real-world vision of a China-based e-commerce company that could deliver to the country's 730 million internet users on an efficient and timely basis.Just like Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak launching Apple  out of Job's Palo Alto, Calif., home, the Alibaba group laid out Alibaba in a small apartment in Hangzhou, China.But Ma had laid out his own vision for the company first. Born Sept. 10, 1964 in Hangzhou, Ma's initial career goal was to become an English teacher, as the demand for learning the English language was just taking off among capitalistic-minded Chinese consumers.While Ma eventually did land a teaching job, it didn't last long. He transitioned to a career in business and, after being turned down for a job as a manager at Kentucky Fried Chicken in China, he traveled to the U.S. with the intent on enrolling in his dream school -- Harvard University.Ma's quest for an Ivy League degree was derailed after he began using the internet and soon noticed a decided absence of Chinese companies engaging in the burgeoning e-commerce marketplace.Soon, he started a web site that focused on China commerce and was soon approached by Chinese investors who shared Ma's vision for a Far East-based e-commerce company. He opened another company called China Pages, and revenues picked up immediately; within three years, China Pages was valued at $1 million.With China Pages, Jack Ma had the broad contours of a major, China-based business-to-business online e-commerce site and took the idea to various investors and partners. With $35 million in venture funding in his back pocket, he and his partners rolled out Alibaba in late 1999, just before the old century rang out and a new one rang in.Shifting Into Higher GearAlibaba had opened for business at an opportune time.By the start of the 21st century, the idea of shopping online for goods and services had genuine appeal to consumers. There was no need to get into the car or onto a bus to hit a mall and find the exact item you were looking for at a discount price.Already, emerging web sites like Amazon  and eBay  and Netscape, which launched its Netscape Navigator web browser, were making it easy and efficient for shoppers to spend their retail dollars.Commerce-starved China, with hundreds of millions of consumers with money to spend, was the perfect landing spot for Alibaba. Chinese consumers, flush with cash from good jobs that came with the country's transition from communism to capitalism, were immune to the dot-com bubble crash that wiped out billions in capital and took years to recover from.With additional venture funding rolling in, Alibaba soon rolled out new sites like Taobao.com, an eBay-like consumer-to-consumer online retail market place and Aliwangwang, an instant-messaging tool that made it easier for consumers to research and shop for good deals online. A third-party payment platform called Alipay soon followed, giving Alibaba all the business tools it needed to dominate the Asian e-commerce marketplace.As the first decade of the new century progressed, Alibaba found a business partner from an unlikely but welcome source -- the Chinese government.Suspicious of foreign business invaders, the Chinese government embarked on a campaign of strict internet control within the country, effectively locking out U.S. e-commerce giants like Amazon out of the Chinese market -- and leaving that market wide open for Alibaba to prosper.It wasn't until 2005, when China gave the green light to a partnership between U.S. technology giant Yahoo.com and Alibaba (the latter wound up running the former's China business in due time). By that time, Alibaba was firmly entrenched as the leader in the Asian e-commerce market, and U.S. and European like-minded companies have been playing catch-up ever since.By 2014, the future was set for Alibaba on a worldwide basis, as its $25 billion initial public offering took Wall Street by storm, and flush with billions in investment cash, Alibaba reigns supreme as China's premier e-commerce company and, along with Walmart  and Amazon, one of the  .Alibaba TimelineHere are the key dates in Alibaba history.1999: The company was founded by Jack Ma and 18 partners in Hangzhou, China. 2000: The company raises $25 million in funding from Goldman Sachs,  Softbank  and Fidelity Investments, among others. 2002: Alibaba turns its first-ever profit. 2003-04:Alibaba rolls out Taobao, its consumer e-commerce site, and launches Alipay, its online payment system. 2007: Alibaba is listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. 2009: On its 10th anniversary, Alibaba introduces its new cloud computing platform. 2010: Ray-Ban and Gap  open online stores on Alibaba's Taobao Mall, opening a new path to profit for U.S. businesses doing business in China. 2013: Jack Ma steps down as CEO of Alibaba. He is succeeded by Jonathan Lu, Ma's hand-picked successor. 2014: Alibaba grows to become the largest online commerce platform for small businesses. The same year the company goes public, with a $25 billion IPO and a new trading price of $68 per-share -- besting big technology stalwarts like Facebook  and Google  . 2016: Scandal and controversy shroud Alibaba, as the company is tied directly to the sale of illegal, fraudulent products. The U.S. government fuels the fire by labeling Taobao as a counterfeit e-commerce platform. 2018: Alibaba rebounds from scandal as Taobao crests 580 million active monthly users and Tmall hits 500 monthly users. The same year, Jack Ma announces that he will step down as chairman of Alibaba in 2019.2019 and Alibaba's Stock PriceBy 2019, Jack Ma makes good on his pledge to walk away from Alibaba. He does so in September 2019 and is succeeded by Daniel Zhang, now the current chief executive officer at Alibaba.By June 2019, Alibaba was smashing new e-commerce records. Its mobile user base had grown to 1.1 billion while revenues had grown by 42%. The site now boasts 674 million active monthly users and represents (as of year-end 2018) 60% of the entire Chinese e-commerce market.Its employee base had grown to 86,000 staffers worldwide and the company was delivering 57 million packages a year via its Cainiao Network.The company's stock price is experiencing robust growth as a result. It's currently trading at $176 with a sturdy market cap of $458 billion.Wall Street analysts expect share price growth to continue, with an average analyst consensus calling for BABA stock to rise to $222 per-share within a year's time.Even though Jack Ma is no longer calling the shots, Alibaba continues to thrive as one of the world's largest online commerce marketplaces, and should do so for years to come.That more than fulfills the founder's vision of an e-commerce platform for the Chinese populace -- and make no mistake, Alibaba has achieved that goal and then some in just 20 years in business.Load-Date: January 3, 2020End of Document

Mastercard Gets the Nod to Offer Up Plastic in ChinaTheStreet.comFebruary 11, 2020 Tuesday 7:05 AM EDTCopyright 2020 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 426 wordsByline: M. Corey GoldmanHighlight: Mastercard receives 'in-principle approval' from China's central bank to set up shop there, granting it access to the country's $27 trillion payments market.BodyMastercard  on Tuesday said it received "in-principle approval" from the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, to set up a bank card clearing business in China, granting it access to the country's $27 trillion payments market.Mastercard and its partner, NetsUnion Clearing Corp (NUCC) will need to complete preparation work within a year, at which point the company will be able to apply for formal approval to begin domestic bank card clearing activity, Mastercard said. Mastercard's application was submitted by Mastercard NUCC Information Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd, a joint venture of Mastercard and NUCC."China is a vital market for us and we have reiterated our unwavering commitment to helping drive a safer, more inclusive and seamless payments ecosystem for Chinese consumers and businesses," Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga said in a statement.The approval not only represents China's ongoing efforts to open up its capital markets to outside participants like Mastercard, it also symbolizes its commitment to reforming and updating its capital markets and payments network to make it more integrated and global - something it agreed to as part of the recent phase one trade agreement with the U.S.As part of the recently signed trade accord, Chinese regulators said they would take no longer than 90 days to consider applications from providers of electronic-payments services such as Mastercard, Visa  and American Express . Mastercard set up its majority-owned joint venture nearly a year ago.The approval means the credit-card and payments processing giant will soon be able to offer Chinese consumers and businesses the ability to provide and receive payment for goods and services with Mastercard- something they were previously unable to do.It also means it will be competing with the likes of state-run banks and credit providers including state-run China UnionPay, which until a few years ago was the only credit clearing provider in the country. In June 2015, the Chinese government eased rules to allow foreign bank-card clearing providers to obtain licenses by setting up units or acquiring a local company.American Express also recently cleared a key hurdle in its bid to accessing China after the central bank last month accepted its application to start a bank card clearing business. Mobile transactions topped 190 trillion yuan ($27 trillion) in China in 2018, making it the world's largest such market, according to iResearch.Mastercardis a holding in Jim Cramer's .

U.K. allows limited Huawei role in 5G networks FierceWirelessJanuary 28, 2020 Tuesday 12:28 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 999 wordsByline: Bevin FletcherHighlight: The U.K. government has decided China's Huawei can supply gear for the country's 5G networks, but it will be restricted to non-core portions, considered less security-sensitive. BodyThe U.K. government has decided China's Huawei can supply gear for the country's 5G networks, but it will be restricted to non-core portions, considered less security-sensitive.The decision, announced Tuesday, comes despite increased            U.S. pressure on allies for a complete ban of Huawei equipment from next-generation communications networks, over security concerns related to Huawei's ties to the Chinese government. The U.S. has            warned that Huawei could be used by China for state-sponsored activities like espionage or disruption– allegations the vendor has continuously denied.The U.K.'s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to issued guidance for the country's telecom operators on the new restrictions, and the government said it plans to bring forward legislation as soon as possible to implement the new security framework.“We want world-class connectivity as soon as possible but this must not be at the expense of our national security. High risk vendors never have been and never will be in our most sensitive networks,” said U.K. Digital Secretary Baroness Morgan in a statement. “This is a UK-specific solution for UK-specific reasons and the decision deals with the challenges we face right now.”Specifically, the restrictions exclude “high risk vendors” from sensitive ‘core' network functions and limit their presence in the radio access network (RAN)to a hard cap of 35%. The 35% limit applies to the volume of expected traffic on any particular network that passes through Huawei (or any single high risk vendor) equipment and the percentage of base station sites nationally supplied by a vendor.The recommended cap will be kept under review and may be reduced further as more vendors enter the market, the U.K. said in its announcement, which also stressed the need for the country to diversify its equipment vendor pool and adopt open interoperable standards to encourage new entrants.RELATED: 5G NR drives huge growth for RAN market: reportThe restrictions also exclude Huawei from all safety-related and safety critical networks, and from sensitive geographic locations like nuclear sites and military bases.Huawei in a statement called the U.K. decision reassuring and noted the company has supplied telecom operators in the U.K. for more than 15 years.“Huawei is reassured by the UK government's confirmation that we can continue working with our customers to keep the 5G roll-out on track. This evidence-based decision will result in a more advanced, more secure and more cost-effective telecoms infrastructure that is fit for the future,” the statement said. “We agree a diverse vendor market and fair competition are essential for network reliability and innovation, as well as ensuring consumers have access to the best possible technology.”Once new legislation is in place based on today's conclusions and the Telecoms Security Requirements (TSR) announced in July, it will give U.K. telecom regulator Ofcom “something tangible to check the operators against,” wrote NCSC Technical Director Ian Levy in a blog post. “Huawei has always been considered higher risk by the UK government and a risk mitigation strategy has been in place since they first began to supply into the UK,” noted the NCSC.The fact that Huawei is already present in U.K. networks (alongside Nokia and Ericsson) is one factor that weighed on the country's consideration of excluding the vendor. Major operators like BT and Vodafone had pushed back against an outright ban, citing high costs of replacing equipment and potentially significant delays in 5G rollouts.The NCSC said operators who currently have Huawei equipment that exceeds the recommended 35% limit should reduce it “as soon as practical,” but indicated it should be possible to reach that level within three years.RELATED: Huawei issues don't mean ‘free ride' for Ericsson, CEO saysA Vodafone spokesperson said the company noted the U.K. decision to restrict Huawei and shared thefollowing statement:“While Vodafone UK does not use Huawei in its core – the intelligent part of the network – it will now analyse the potential impact of today's decision on the non-core elements of its network (masts and transmission links). Vodafone UK uses a mix of Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia equipment for its 4G and 5G masts, and we continue to believe that the use of a wide range of equipment vendors is the best way to safeguard the delivery of services to all mobile customers. By working closely with the relevant authorities on any required substitution of equipment and it's timing, we aim to keep any potential disruption to customers to a minimum.”In March, Vodafone ‘s UK technology chief told Reuters that Huawei radio equipment was used in nearly a third of its 18,000 U.K. base stations.As for U.S. response, a senior U.S White House official told CNBC the U.S. is “disappointed with the U.K.s decision, and urged countries to continue evaluating impacts of using untrusted vendors in important 5G networks. Earlier this month, U.S. lawmaker            introduced a bill that would limit sharing intelligence with any countries who don't exclude Huawei from 5G their networks. 5G Action Now, a new political advocacy group formed with the aim of advancing U.S. efforts to lead in 5G particularly against China, had harsh words, calling the decision “terrible.” RELATED: 5G Action Now aims to win 5G race against China, zeroes in on C-band“Great Britain's decision to allow Huawei to build 'non-core'parts of the 5G network is a terrible decision, period. Allowing Huawei access to any part of your network—core or otherwise—is a recipe for disaster as even a non-core door is still a door to a critical communications network. I worry that by the time London realizes this, it will be too late to close the barn door and the digital horses will be in Beijing's stables,” said Mike Rogers, Chairman of 5G Action Now and former Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, in a statement.Load-Date: January 28, 2020End of Document

Starbucks closes 2,000 cafes in China for coronavirus and warns it will impact its beadsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 29, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 708 wordsBodyStarbucks has closed more than half of its cafes in mainland China, some 2,000, and Toyota Motor is halting production in the country, as global corporations face a SARS-like coronavirus that has killed more than 130 people and is threatening key market growth.Starbucks, which has more than 4,000 locations in China, maintained its forecast for 2020 but said it does not include the impact of closing half of the continent's stores because it can't calculate it. Compared to McDonald's and Domino's Pizza,Starbucks is the most exposed to the outbreak, as measured by a percentage of global revenue and operating income, according to Guggenheim analyst Matthew DiFrisco.Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus has about 6,000 people infected, is a manufacturing, transportation and business center. Apple is working with its suppliers in the city to mitigate any production losses, but the impact outside the region is less clear, CEO Tim Cook said Tuesday.Apple provided a wider than usual forecast range for the current quarter due to the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus. CEO Cook referred to the virus during a conference calling analysts, saying Apple is following the events.Virtually all iPhones are made by Hon Hai Precision of Foxconn Industry Co. Zhengzhou, China, and by Pegatron Corp. at an assembly site near Shanghai. "We can confirm that we have taken steps to meet the obligations," said a spokesman for Foxconn, who says he is maintaining the planned production plan for a holiday week in China.Toyota explained today that it will suspend operations at its China plants until February 9. As the virus has spread in China and beyond despite travel restrictions and other global efforts to contain the disease, airlines suspended flights and chains including McDonald's Corp. and KFC have closed their premises.Volkswagen, Canadian insurer Sun Life Financial and Credit Suisse banks Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs have asked their employees to telework.AB Inbev suspended production at its Wuhan brewery. Apple closed one of its stores in China and reduced its working hours. Walt Disney, for his part, closed its resorts and theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong during what is probably the busy time of the year. IKEA closed its only store in Wuhan.H&M; closed 45 stores and suspended business travel to and within China. Staff arriving from China are advised to stay at home for 14 days.Carnival Corp. and Royal Caribbean Cruises are working with the Chinese government and decided to suspend their travels. In the case of Carnival, there are nine trips leaving China from January 25 to February 4. In a separate statement, Royal Caribbean said it suspended departures on January 27 and January 31.Both pledged to provide refunds to customers. China is a small but growing market for American cruise companies, and analysts project more cancellations could hurt profits.More companiesTesla and NIO sold nearly 8 million cars last year in the approximately 40 Chinese cities that have been diagnosed with 10 or more cases of coronavirus, or 36.8%total retail volumes in the country, Bernstein analysts estimate. Those cities accounted for 82.5% of Tesla's sales volume, and 68% of NIOs, analysts add.Imax, the Mississauga, Ontario-based company, known for its large-format display technology, has said it is delaying the release of its films in cinemas in China following the outbreak. The impact of chinese New Year revenue loss will cost Imax at least $60 million in box office sales globally, according to MKM Partners.Remy Cointreau SA,the French cognac manufacturer, abandoned its forecasts for this year after a drop in Hong Kong sales over the Christmas period and while the viral outbreak threatens businesses in China, the source of 20% of its profits, according to Jefferies estimates.Aeon, Japan's largest supermarket operator, expects sales of Wuhan area stores to halve, spokesman Makoto Sueyoshi said last Monday. Aeon closed the three shopping malls it operates in Wuhan, but its five general supermarkets were operating on a limited base to sell daily goods and food.The Starbucks ticket closes 2,000 cafes in China for coronavirus and warns that it will impact on its accounts was first published in The Third.Load-Date: February 26, 2020End of Document

US judge dismisses Huawei suit over government contracts banAssociated Press InternationalFebruary 19, 2020 Wednesday 7:30 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 268 wordsByline: By MAE ANDERSON, AP Technology WriterDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) - A federal judge in Texas has dismissed Chinese tech giant Huawei's lawsuit challenging a U.S. law that bars the government and its contractors from using Huawei equipment because of security concerns.The lawsuit, filed last March, sought to declare the law unconstitutional. Huawei argued the law singled out the company for punishment, denied it due process and amounted to a "death penalty."But a court ruled Tuesday that the ban isn't punitive and that the federal government has the right to take its business elsewhere.Huawei, China's first global tech brand, is at the center of U.S.-Chinese tensions over technology competition and digital spying. The company has spent years trying to put to rest accusations that it facilitates Chinese spying and that is controlled by the ruling Communist Party.The lawsuit was filed in Plano, Texas, the headquarters of Huawei's U.S. operations. It was dismissed before going to trial. Experts had described Huawei's challenge as a long shot, but said the company didn't have many other options to challenge the law.Huawei said it was disappointed and will consider further legal options.The Trump administration has been aggressively lobbying Western allies to avoid Huawei's equipment for next-generation, 5G cellular networks. Administration officials say Huawei can give the Chinese government backdoor access to data, allegations that the company rejects.U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has also spoken out against Huawei, including during a talk with reporters in Brussels on Monday, turning U.S. opposition to Huawei into a bipartisan effort.Load-Date: February 20, 2020End of Document

The Mobile of Barcelona, in vilo by the coronavirus: more than 6,500 Chinese professionalsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 3, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 609 wordsBodyThe coronavirus looms over the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona, which is scheduled to take place at the end of this month. The mobile phone sector remains "on standby", according to different sources participating in the forum consulted by the WORLD who are confident that the epidemic has become more successful by then, although they recognize that under current conditions it would be impossible to develop the industry's largest global forum.The GSMA, organizer of the event, argues that the Mobile will "be developed as planned", i.e. from 24 to 27 February, although "the measures are already underway". In fact, the GSMA envisages that absences may occur, as it undertakes to "guide exhibitors who are not able to travel to the MWC of Barcelona towardslocal companies and services that would have the capacity to meet their needson site".Of the 109,000 visitors to the 2019 edition, 6% came from China, according to the GSMA's own calculations, above 6,500 professionals. The proportion of the country's citizens has been increasing in recent years - it was estimated at 5% in 2018 - but the positive trend is on the side of a halt to be discontinued in 2020.Next week, the lunar New Year holidays, which the Chinese government are extended to, will conclude as an extraordinary measure to resolve the epidemic crisis. The travel arrangements would then be underpinned, with options that have been reduced.Iberia has stopped flying between Madrid and Shanghai, three flights a week suspended "during the month of February". British Airways and Lufthansa, among other airlines, have also stowed their routes with the mainland of that country. Air China, China Eastern, Hainan Airlines and Cathay Pacific Airways, Hong Kong's last one, continue to connect the Asian country and Spain, either through Madrid or Barcelona.The Chinese industry is fundamental for telecommunications and also, therefore, for Mobile, in which they take on special prominence: Huawei, Xiaomi and Oppo are three of the top five smartphone manufacturers in the world, only surpassed by Samsung, South Korea, and American Apple.The iPhone company prefers to focus presentations on its own events rather than on forums like Mobile. However, Apple, which released results last week, admits that ecoronavirus generates uncertainty in its business over the coming months.Last week, Huawei stated that the Chinese firm carries out "pretty strict control to ensure that all employees are healthy," pablo Wang, director of Consumer at Huawei Spain, said last week. Only this company, the world's largest provider of telecommunications equipment, mobilizes hundreds of professionals at the Catalan event.The Independence ThreatA few months ago, the Mobile did not feel threatened by coronavirus, but by the independence demonstrations in Barcelona, which took on a violent nature last October. The meeting mobilizes a total of 473 million euros and 14,000 temporary jobs,so there would be no shortage of candidates to give shelter to the appointment, for which Madrid has been postulated as stated by the President of the Community, Isabel Díaz Ayuso.The GSMA has already announced several extraordinary measures for this edition of the Mobile: a cleaning programme reinforced with disinfected in critical areas such as catering or on railings, increased presence of medical staff in the Fira de Barcelona premises, a preventive campaign, free health materials, training to all forum employees and partners,specific attention to exhibitors and communication with those responsible for public and private transport, hotels, restaurants and catering services in the Catalan city.Load-Date: February 4, 2020End of Document

American Colleges Seek to Develop Coronavirus Response, Abroad and at HomeThe Chronicle of Higher Education January 28, 2020  TuesdayCopyright 2020 The Chronicle of Higher Education All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL; NewsLength: 1608 wordsByline: Karin FischerBodyABSTRACTA case of the highly infectious respiratory illness has been confirmed at Arizona State University.FULL TEXTAmerican colleges have begun limiting travel to China, even as they scramble to prepare for the potential impact of coronavirus on their home campuses.Arizona State University, the only college with a confirmed case of the highly infectious respiratory illness, on Tuesday announced a moratorium on all college-related travel to China by students and faculty and staff members. As the State Department and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned against nonessential trips to China, other colleges and study-abroad providers, such as the University of Michigan and Georgetown University, also imposed restrictions. Previously, the U.S. government had urged only against travel to Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus first emerged.Colleges have longstanding experience in dealing with health and safety threats when sending students and professors abroad. But unlike the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, pandemic, when the primary concern was about risks to Americans traveling overseas, this time around, colleges must also pay close attention to possible effects of coronavirus at home. That's because Chinese students are far and away the largest group of international students in the United States, with 370,000 enrolled in American colleges. And the risk of infection is growing just as many students return to campus for the start of the spring semester.As a result, colleges across the United States are developing plans in case of widespread campus illness. "What we're dealing with today was not what we were dealing with Friday, and by the end of the week, it could be totally different," said David S. Reitman, the medical director at American University's student-health center. "Everything is moving so fast."In a campuswide email, Arizona State officials confirmed that a person associated with the university had tested positive for the virus, although they have not said how the individual is affiliated with the university. The note, from Mark S. Searle, the provost, said that the individual does not live in campus housing, is not severely ill, and is currently in isolation to keep the disease from spreading.Colleges across the country reported testing students who had recently been to Wuhan and were experiencing some of the symptoms of coronavirus, including fever and difficulty breathing. Universities including Baylor, Texas A&M, and Tennessee Tech said that students had tested negative for the illness, which can often appear much like the flu or other forms of pneumonia.As of Tuesday night, several other colleges, such as George Mason University and Miami University of Ohio, were waiting for test results. At Yale, a Model United Nations conference was cut short after a student from China exhibited flu-like symptoms.Because this strain of coronavirus is a new one, there is no commercial test available, and universities, hospitals, and local public-health departments must all send samples to the CDC headquarters in Atlanta. As the number of possible cases rise, it is taking longer for test results to be returned, campus health directors said.At the University of Washington, in Seattle, one student has been cleared by testing, while two others are waiting to get their results back. The students, who were tested on Saturday, are being housed in isolation, said Wolfram Latsch, the director of study abroad.Latsch is part of a campuswide committee, including health services, public safety, and global affairs, that has been meeting daily to coordinate strategies as well as messaging to the campus community.So far, Washington has not halted international travel, although Latsch has been in contact with students who are currently in China to provide them with updates and to encourage them to reach out with questions or concerns. There are fewer than 10 students in China, he said, and none are in Wuhan. Students could choose to come home from China, or they could have to leave if their local Chinese university or study-abroad provider suspends their program, Latsch said.ISEP, a study-abroad and exchange provider, will suspend a program it operates in Shanghai, said John S. Lucas, the organization's president. The dozen students who were to have enrolled in the program had not yet arrived in China and will be offered placements in other locations, he said.About 11,600 American students studied in China in the 2017 academic year, making it the seventh most popular destination.Gary Rhodes, the director of the Center for Global Education and a professor of education at California State University-Dominguez Hills, said it can sometimes be safer for students and professors abroad to stay where they are. Task forces, like Washington's, are increasingly common and can help set policy as well as communicate across campus and combat misinformation, he said.A large research university like Ohio State University is practiced in quickly working to deal with potential public-health challenges, said Andrew M. Thomas, chief clinical officer at the university's medical center. "It's almost muscle memory." But a key difference between coronavirus and earlier outbreaks, like the swine flu in 2009, or ebola in 2014, is the "scope and scale" of American higher education's connections with China, he said.Few institutions are as intertwined with China as Duke University, which late Tuesday announced it was restricting all university-funded travel to China. The policy does not apply to personal travel, and those with urgent research or clinical needs to travel to China can apply for an exception. The university had been constantly assessing its policy on travel to China over the past couple of weeks as the outbreak spread, said Michael J. Schoenfeld, the vice president for public affairs.The university also has a China campus, Duke Kunshan University, outside of Shanghai. Like colleges across China, Duke Kunshan is currently closed for the Lunar New Year holiday, the equivalent of winter break. Although the university will postpone the start of the spring semester to mid-February, about 70 students remained on campus during the break, Schoenfeld said. To limit the possibility of exposure, administrators have restricted access to Duke Kunshan and are providing students with resources including dining services, health checks, and counseling.If the public-health crisis continues beyond the scheduled February 17 reopening, the university could consider alternatives, such as online courses, holding classes in a different location, or suspending the semester, Schoenfeld said, although he cautioned it was too early to pursue such options.New York University's campus in Shanghai also announced that it would push back the start of the spring semester, although dormitories will be open for students who have already returned to campus.Some NYU-Shanghai students and parents, however, have expressed concern about resuming their classes during the outbreak and have instead called for students to be relocated to New York. Half of NYU-Shanghai's student body are not Chinese. "It defies logic to send a child into the epicenter of a global health disaster," several parents wrote on a Facebook page for families of students on the China campus.In an email, John Beckman, a spokesman, said NYU is working on contingency plans for the Shanghai campus. "Concern is understandable in the face of a novel, emerging, as yet not-fully-understood illness," he wrote of the parents' fears. "As we have looked ahead to do our academic contingency planning, the unease of NYU Shanghai students and families has definitely been in our thoughts."Meanwhile, a handful of NYU students missed the start of Monday's classes in New York because of travel restrictions the Chinese government has imposed on residents of Wuhan. The university has been reaching out to professors who have these students in their classes to try to find ways that they can participate in coursework from afar. Beckman said he did not know the precise number of students at NYU, which enrolls more international students than any other American college, who were unable to start the semester on time because of coronavirus.Because of the threat of disease, the Chinese government has also canceled the February sitting of standardized exams such as the GRE and English-language proficiency tests that students need to study abroad.But Reitman, of American University, said the focus could soon shift away from China. Already, the coronavirus has spread to more than a dozen countries, including five cases in the United States. If the outbreak isn't contained, students and faculty members who have never set foot in China could be a risk.Like other campus health officials, Reitman pointed out that most of the people who have died from coronavirus were older or in poor health. Those who are younger and healthier are more likely to experience a few days' discomfort and then recover. Still, he said, university officials had to plan for all sorts of possibilities: What would happen if ill students overwhelmed the capacity of the health center? How would the college feed a large number of students who had to be kept in isolation and couldn't come to the dining halls? Would sick students be allowed to go home? "We have to keep our radar up," he said, "because there's a lot to consider."Karin Fischer writes about international education, colleges and the economy, and other issues.

The company anticipates steel price volatility to decrease in 2020, as uncertainty caused by global and regional trade negotiations appears to have moderated after significant turbulence during the past two years and a prolonged steel inventory destocking in North America recently has come to an end.Ternium expects EBITDA to increase in the first quarter 2020 compared to the fourth quarter 2019, with higher shipments and a recovery in steel margin, mainly as a result of slightly lower costs.With marginally improving steel market sentiment in Mexico, the company anticipates steel shipments in the country to increase in the first quarter of the year after a seasonally weak fourth quarter 2019. Demand in Mexico's industrial markets remains stable and public construction activity in the country is beginning to show some signs of improvement. In addition, the recent ratification by the USA of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) has reduced uncertainty, which should help foster economic activity and investment in Mexico in the years to come.16:40AWK American Water Works misses by $0.01, misses on revs; reaffirms FY20 EPS guidance (139.26 -0.06)Reports Q4 (Dec) earnings of $0.73 per share, $0.01 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.74; revenues rose 6.1% year/year to $902 mln vs the $928.56 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Currently, BIFMA is forecasting 2% growth for the coming year. That seems like a reasonable starting point for core growth, though it is quite a bit lower than the double digit increases in both the number of and dollar value of the projects we are tracking and the growth in the number of clients visiting with us. We have seen average order size continue to stabilize and believe some of that is a function of our ability to capture a greater portion of our client's workplace spend. If you add on approximately three quarters of Fully sales, you arrive at a mid-single digit top line growth rate for 2020.We expect gross margin expansion of 20 to 30 basis points during 2020, driven primarily by continued lean initiatives in our manufacturing facilities and supply chain, and favorable commodity pricing. Mid-term gross margin expansion will be bolstered by our manufacturing footprint optimization and we expect to begin recognizing savings late in 2020, but more meaningfully in 2021, delivering an additional 50 basis points of improvement. However, we do expect that the combination of a slight reduction in production capacity during the first quarter of 2020 as the result of our manufacturing optimization moves, combined with somewhat extended client request dates in our backlog, will result in a shift of revenue from the first to the second quarter. Additionally, while we have very little revenue exposure in China, we are watching any potential supply disruptions due to extended supplier shutdowns in China. At this point in time we do not see any material impact but understand that the situation is fluid.As we look out over the 2020 year, we expect EBITDA margin expansion to be more modest. Looking to 2021, we will move closer to our long-term goal of 15% consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin with the benefit of a year of savings related to the footprint and logistics optimization activities. As we continue to focus on debt reduction as a use of available free cash, we believe our average outstanding debt will be approximately $435 million during 2020, with an average interest rate of approximately 3.7%. This is reflective of the $250 million interest rate swap for 2020 and an average credit spread of 150 basis points. We expect our consolidated effective tax rate to be between 25% and 26% for full year 2020.As a result of the continued efforts around showroom enhancements to make the most use of our floor space to support the constellation selling strategy and residential initiatives, as well as investments in new product development and technology expansion for our e-commerce capabilities, we expect 2020 capital expenditures will be between $55 million and $60 million.16:23DT Dynatrace launches follow-on public offering of 25.0 mln shares of common stock by certain selling stockholders (35.14 -0.98)Dynatrace will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares being offered by the selling stockholders but will bear the costs associated with the sale of such shares.16:22KRG Kite Realty beats by $0.01, beats on revs; guides FY20 FFO below consensus (18.00 +0.08)Reports Q4 (Dec) funds from operations of $0.40 per share, $0.01 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.39; revenues fell 13.4% year/year to $75.27 mln vs the $73.17 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The market resiliently cut its losses during the afternoon, though, leaving the S&P 500 down 0.3% for the session.The Nasdaq Composite (+0.02%) eked out a closing record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.6%) and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) still finished lower.Apple specifically said it doesn't expect to meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter due to the coronavirus restraining its supply chain and impacting consumer demand in China. The news didn't come as a surprise given similar warnings previously issued by companies, and investors presumably viewed the situation as temporary and China-specific.Investors, however, did assume some defensive positioning, evident by the gains in bonds, gold futures ($1590.00, +$19.00, +1.2%), and the CBOE Volatility Index (14.83, +1.15, +8.4%). The resulting decline in Treasury yields undercut the financials sector (-0.9%), while it benefited the utilities sector (+0.8%).The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.40%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.56%. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.4% to 99.43. WTI crude inched up 0.1% (+$0.05) to $52.10/bbl, recouping its intraday losses.Microsoft (MSFT 187.23, +1.88, +1.0%) and Amazon (AMZN 2155.67, +20.80, +1.0%), which have a combined market cap of nearly $2.5 trillion, helped offset the weakness in Apple with 1% gains of their own. Both stocks extended their yearly gains to 18.7% and 16.6%, respectively, while Apple trimmed its yearly gain to 8.6%.Walmart (WMT 119.63, +1.74, +1.5%) also outperformed despite missing profit estimates.

In the first-quarter 2020, oil production is projected to average in the range of 158,000 to 163,000 barrels per day. Importantly, Devon expects to deliver this improved oil growth outlook with less capital than previously projected. The company is now lowering the top end of its upstream capital guidance by $50 million to a range of $1.7 billion to $1.85 billion in 2020. Furthermore, the capital efficiency of this investment in 2020 is expected to be enhanced by reallocation of capital to the Delaware Basin from the STACK play. The company now projects that capital spending in the Delaware Basin will increase by approximately 15 percent year-over-year and account for approximately 60 percent of Devon's total capital investment in 2020. Another noteworthy guidance item for 2020 is the company's full-year G&A outlook that is expected to decline to a range of $360 million to $400 million. Including costs reclassified as discontinued operations, this represents an improvement of more than 20 percent compared to 2019. With this outlook, Devon remains on track to meet or exceed its stated goal of reducing total G&A expense to a level of $350 million by the end of 2021.16:13TPH TRI Pointe Homes beats by $0.14, beats on revs (17.23 -0.27)Reports Q4 (Dec) earnings of $0.85 per share, $0.14 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.71; revenues rose 1.5% year/year to $1.14 bln vs the $1.09 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Excluding interest, impairments and lot option abandonments, adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage was 26.2%.New home orders of 1,235 compared to 812, an increase of 52%.Backlog units at quarter end of 1,752 homes compared to 1,335, an increase of 31%.For the first quarter of 2020, the Company expects to open 15 new communities and close out of 7 communities, which would result in 145 active selling communities as of March 31, 2020.

America's Hopelessly Anemic Response to One of the Largest Personal-Data Breaches EverAtlantic OnlineFebruary 12, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1497 wordsByline: Robert D. WilliamsBodyThe Justice Department raised eyebrows on Monday when it unveiled charges against four members of China's People's Liberation Army for hacking into the credit-reporting agency Equifax and stealing sensitive information on 147 million Americans. The charges are the latest in a campaign of indictments against Chinese-government-linked hackers that dates to 2014 but has ramped up considerably since 2017, the year the Equifax breach took place. Like the defendants in several prior hacking indictments, the men whose identities were revealed to the world this week are based in China and almost certainly will never appear in a U.S. court to stand trial. Taken alone, the indictments are a hopelessly anemic response to one of the largest personal-data breaches ever recorded.The bigger picture doesn't look much better. As the Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith and I have argued before, if deterrence is the measure of success, the United States' Chinese-hacking indictment strategy has all the earmarks of a spectacular failure. A raft of            media and            government reports suggests that China's state-sponsored cybertheft has not meaningfully diminished in response to the U.S. indictment campaign. This shouldn't come as a surprise: The costs to China of being "named and shamed" are almost certainly dwarfed by the billions of dollars of value obtained from pilfering U.S. technologies and the untold intelligence benefits of cultivating a massive database on American citizens.If not deterrence, what might be the purpose of these indictments instead?[           Read: The banality of the Equifax breach]Some have argued that one aim of the indictment strategy is to enforce a            norm against state-sponsored theft of intellectual property carried out to support a nation's commercial firms. The norm was articulated in President Barack Obama's September 2015            meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, with each country agreeing that it would not "conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with the intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or commercial sectors." (This commitment was later            endorsed by the G20.) The cyber agreement followed on the heels of the first ever U.S. indictment of Chinese People's Liberation Army hackers, in 2014; many at the time credited the indictments with facilitating the establishment of the norm. In hindsight, however, the fact that China and other countries have continued their theft of U.S. commercial secrets with little penalty suggests that the cybertheft norm is not much of a norm at all.Even if norm construction were the objective, the Equifax allegations do not obviously breach a standard that the United States has embraced. The 2015 U.S.-China agreement did not mention hacking for national-security purposes (as opposed to commercial benefits), and the U.S. government has hardly suggested that it would forgo stealing data to protect U.S. national security. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper illustrated this dilemma when discussing China's 2015 breach of the Office of Personnel Management, which compromised background-investigation files on 22 million Americans. Clapper            observed, "You have to kind of salute the Chinese for what they did. If we had the opportunity to do that, I don't think we'd hesitate for a minute."To be sure, the Equifax charging documents allege that customer data held by the company constituted "proprietary business information." But this does not mean that the Justice Department is treating this breach as a violation of the norm against cybertheft for commercial purposes. If anything, recent developments-including the ongoing            national-security investigation into the Chinese company that owns TikTok-demonstrate that the U.S. government is treating personal data more and more as a "dual use" item with commercial and national-security value alike. As Attorney General William Barr            put it, "This data has economic value, and these thefts can feed China's development of artificial intelligence tools as well as the creation of intelligence targeting packages."It is thus unlikely that the aim of the Equifax indictments is merely to restate the U.S. position on norms of acceptable state conduct in cyberspace. Nor is it plausible that the Justice Department would have sought this opportunity to articulate a new position that theft of personal data to this degree-in such massive quantities, with such expansive security and commercial implications-represents conduct that all countries (even the United States) should forswear.This is not to deny the legitimacy of enforcing U.S. domestic laws that prohibit "computer fraud and abuse" or "economic espionage." But given the dim chances that this approach to enforcement will succeed in curbing Chinese behavior, we are left to wonder what other purposes (aside from deterrence) the indictments are intended to serve.One            possibility is that the indictment strategy may be working in imperceptible ways in conjunction with the United States' new offensive posture in cyberspace. The unclassified            summary of the Department of Defense's 2018 cyber strategy pledges to "defend forward to disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict." This turn of phrase may signal an effort to shift from deterrence toward disrupting and degrading the capabilities of malicious actors. The "defend forward" strategy was            countenanced by Congress in a statute that authorizes "appropriate and proportional action in foreign cyberspace to disrupt, defeat, and deter" an active campaign of cyberattacks against the United States committed by one of four nations, including China.[           Read: China's spies are on the offensive]It is conceivable that Justice Department hacking indictments provide a legal predicate that aids the Pentagon (through U.S. Cyber Command) in certifying the legality of forward-defense options in response to a "campaign of attacks." Attribution of cyber operations is a notoriously complex and difficult enterprise. But if prosecutors can convince an impartial grand jury about Chinese cyber intrusions against U.S. interests, that public record could help justify the decision of defense officials to green-light disruptive operations in Chinese networks. Such an approach would align with former Assistant Attorney General John Carlin's 2016            remark that "in some cases ... a prosecution may not be the right option, but attribution [by the Justice Department] opens the door for sanctions, disruption operations and bilateral diplomacy."Even if this speculation is correct, however, it remains unclear why attribution must be done publicly, with the attendant risks that the U.S. government will appear feckless to third parties and invite further malicious activity on U.S. networks. Perhaps indictments are intended to lay the groundwork to justify future            sanctions against China should the U.S. administration choose to exercise this authority as it has in connection with cyber activity by Iran, North Korea, and Russia. But sanctions would leave U.S. companies that operate in China vulnerable to retaliation at a delicate            moment in bilateral trade relations, which may explain why they have never been triggered.Or maybe indictments serve a more precise signaling function by temporally linking U.S. "disrupt and degrade" operations to the (indicted) activities they aim to counter. The United States and China are immersed in a            cybersecurity dilemma in which all sides are at pains to distinguish acts of preemption and retaliation. Concepts of cyber offense and defense are            blurry at best. Thus, the signaling effect of an indictment followed closely by a disruptive cyberattack could potentially help avoid misperception and mitigate escalation risks. But the opposite could also be true. If perceived by China as part of a coordinated "whole of government" effort to thwart China's rise, indictment plus disruption could aggravate the dangers of an escalation spiral. Has the U.S. factored these considerations into its strategy?Ultimately, efforts to discern the calculus behind the Chinese-hacking indictments are necessarily speculative and perhaps less illuminating than the simplest version of reality: that indictments are one of the few tools a vulnerable United States is willing to employ to show the public that it is "doing something" about persistent cyberthreats. It is fair to wonder whether and when the resources being devoted to this effort will be complemented by equally energetic policies to incentivize companies to adopt the basic cyber hygiene that could have prevented the Equifax breach in the first place.Load-Date: February 13, 2020End of Document

Editorial Roundup: USAssociated Press InternationalJanuary 29, 2020 Wednesday 10:14 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: DOMESTIC NEWS; Editorial RoundupLength: 4453 wordsByline: By The Associated PressBodyExcerpts from recent editorials in the United States and abroad:___Jan. 29The Los Angeles Times on federal spending:The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office issued yet another warning Tuesday that the federal government is heading down a dangerous fiscal path, racking up debt at an alarming rate. The CBO projects that deficits will average $1.3 trillion a year over the coming decade, with the economy settling into steady but sluggish growth. That's the most disturbing thing about the report: the expectation that giant deficits will be allowed to continue even when there's no recession driving up spending on federal safety net programs and causing tax revenue to plummet.It's not inherently bad for the federal government to borrow money; extra spending by the government can help stimulate the economy during a downturn. But sustained and heavy deficit spending can have the opposite effect, raising borrowing costs and slowing GDP growth. The CBO projects that the fastest growing part of the federal budget will be interest payments on the rising debt - spending that delivers no tangible benefit for taxpayers while leaving less money for programs that do.Rising healthcare costs and an aging population are contributing to the federal budget mess. But the problem has been exacerbated by the large and irresponsible tax cuts Republicans pushed through in 2017. The cuts were sold as a way to trigger a sustained surge in economic growth; instead, GDP bumped up only briefly, held back in part by the tariffs President Trump slapped on a broad array of imports.We've seen this movie before. Some supposed fiscal conservatives will demand more tax cuts to try to jump-start faster growth (in fact, Trump and House Republicans floated just such an idea before the 2018 election and again last year). Others will blame the problem on federal spending and demand cuts - not to the military and security programs that Trump has vastly expanded, not to the vast tax giveaways and subsidies, but to the safety net programs the administration is already trying to restrain.Slashing programs such as Medicaid and food stamps to help pay for the GOP tax cuts would be redistributing wealth in the worst way - from the impoverished to the well-to-do. The right answer starts with lawmakers rolling back the tax-cut and spending excesses of the Trump administration. They can then work on a longer-term plan to bring spending and revenue back into line.Online:https://www.latimes.com/___Jan. 29The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier of Iowa on the death of basketball superstar Kobe Bryant:Kobe Bryant was a unicorn - one of those people recognized worldwide by a first name - driven to succeed in sports, business and the arts - until his life shockingly ended Sunday.Bryant, 41, and his daughter, Gianna ("Gigi"), 13, a budding basketball star, were among nine victims as his leased helicopter crashed in dense fog west of Los Angeles en route from Orange County to a game at his Mamba Academy, 80 miles away.He was named after a steak served at a Japanese restaurant. His father, Joe "Jellybean" Bryant, was a National Basketball Association journeyman. His mother's brother, Chubby Cox, played briefly in the NBA.From age 6, he grew up in Italy while his father played in Europe. He learned Italian. He did a grade-school book report in Latin.He returned home as a basketball prodigy at Lower Merion High near Philadelphia, escorting pop star Brandy to his prom. He was drafted by the Charlotte Hornets in the 13th round and traded to the Los Angeles Lakers. He then became the youngest ever to play in the NBA.In 20 years with the Lakers, Bryant scored 33,643 points - fourth all-time after being passed by LeBron James Saturday night. He won five titles, made 18 All-Star teams, won a regular-season MVP award and two in the NBA Finals. He scored 81 points in a game, 40 points or more in nine straight, and 50 or more in four straight.He was brilliant and divisive. Coach Phil Jackson called him "uncoachable." He feuded with co-star Shaquille O'Neal. After winning three titles together (2001-03), O'Neal was sent packing to Miami, winning a ring in 2006. Bryant teamed with Pau Gasol to win two titles in 2008-09.After bowing out with a record 60 points in his final game, Bryant embellished his resume in business and the arts. He called on billionaires to improve his financial acumen and the likes of author J.K. Rowling to hone his storytelling.Bryant Stibel & Co., a venture capital firm, had assets exceeding $2 billion with stakes in sports drink maker BodyArmor; Epic Games, which produces "Fortnite"; Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba and Dell. Forbes put his net worth at $680 million in 2016."The Mamba Mentality: How I Play," was a best-selling book. His children's series featured Legacy, a tenacious 12-year-old female tennis player in the magical kingdom of Nova: "For Legacy, it's the only thing getting her through the long days taking care of the other kids at the orphanage."In 2018, he was the first pro athlete to win an Oscar, turning his poem, "Dear Basketball," into an animated short film, which he wrote and narrated.Yet the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences denied him membership because of a 2003 incident at a Colorado resort when he was accused of raping a 19-year-old employee. His legal team and social media vilified her as a gold digger, although her family was wealthy.Bryant eventually apologized, claiming he thought it was a consensual act. She dropped criminal charges. A civil suit was settled for a rumored $2.5 million.Jackson wrote the allegations didn't surprise him: "Kobe can be consumed with surprising anger, which he's displayed toward me and his teammates."Then Bryant transformed himself.On the court, he adopted the Black Mamba persona, after an assassin in Quentin Tarantino's "Kill Bill" movies. "I read up on the animal and said, 'Wow, this is pretty awesome,'" Bryant said. "This is a perfect description of how I would want my game to be."Off the court, he saw himself as the angry Hulk changing into mild-mannered David Banner, devoted to his wife, Vanessa, and daughters, Natalia, 16, Gianna, 13, Bianka, 3, and Capri, 7 months.In retirement, he didn't attend many Lakers games, saying, "I have a life and I have my routine at home. It's not that I don't want to go, but I'd rather be giving B.B. a shower and sing Barney songs to her. I played 20 years and I missed those moments before."As YouTube videos attest, Gigi (aka "Mambacita"), a prodigy with UConn aspirations, emulated dad on the court. "It's a trip to see her move and some of the expressions she makes," Bryant said. "It's a trip how genetics work."Other lives lost Sunday also were filled with promise or achievement: Gigi's teammate Alyssa Altobelli and parents, Keri and John, a legendary junior college baseball coach with five state titles and more than 700 wins; teammate Payton Chester and her mother, Sarah; Christina Mauser, an assistant coach and mother of three.

Chinese authorities have said that the new coronavirus' ability to spread is getting stronger. In Japan, too, it is necessary to strengthen relevant measures, on the assumption that the number of infected patients will increase.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made clear a policy of naming the pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus as a "designated infectious disease" under the Infectious Diseases Law. This designation under the law will allow authorities to take such measures as the compulsory hospitalization of infected patients. The move is being taken in anticipation of the spread of infected patients, without waiting for a declaration by the World Health Organization that the spread of the new virus is a public health emergency of international interest.The number of patients infected with the new type of coronavirus has topped 2,800 in mainland China alone, with the death toll rising to more than 80. Cases of infection have spread to more than 10 countries and regions in addition to mainland China.In terms of the number of infected patients, the latest infections have been spreading on a larger scale than when Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) broke out in 2012. The situation is getting more serious.In Wuhan in China's Hubei Province - a city at the center of the coronavirus outbreak - outbound transport services have been shut down, virtually sealing off the city. The daily life of Japanese people living there has been hindered, and there is growing unease.The Japanese government is working to send privately chartered flights to bring back the Japanese still in Wuhan who want to return to Japan. Other countries, including the United States and South Korea, are also considering sending chartered flights there, so these measures are deemed appropriate from the viewpoint of protecting citizens.The Chinese government has started banning group tours with overseas destinations. This is aimed at preventing a large number of Chinese people from going abroad during the Lunar New Year holiday period, thus stemming the infection from spreading further.This move taken by China can be considered to indicate a sense of alarm over the spread of infections, which is faster than it initially expected. The Chinese government should take such positions as quickly disclosing information about infected patients and the virus to other countries and seeking cooperation from them.In Japan, infected patients, including a Chinese tourist, have been discovered almost on a daily basis. The number of Chinese holidaymakers who visited Japan totaled about 9.6 million last year.Hotels and other accommodations should vigorously provide guests who are in poor physical condition with health care information. Hospitals, for their part, should make arrangements to be ready to accept foreign patients.Whether infections may spread from human-to-human contact within Japan will be watched carefully in the days ahead. The possibility also remains that the virus may mutate and become stronger, or the fatality rate may rise.Early symptoms of the new type of pneumonia may include those similar to a common cold, such as fever and diarrhea. There have also been cases in which elderly people and people with chronic illnesses have become seriously ill, so attentive care is vital.At present, the percentage of those who die from the new type of pneumonia is not as high as those recorded in cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or MERS. A level-headed response should be made, based on accurate information.Online: https://the-japan-news.com/___Jan. 28The Wall Street Journal on Virginia and labor laws:Democrats in Virginia aren't wasting time with their first statehouse majority in 26 years - by repealing the state's 70-year-old right-to-work law that has helped the commonwealth thrive.Twenty-seven states including Virginia have right-to-work laws that give workers a choice of whether to belong to a union. According to the National Institute for Labor Relations Research, the rate of job growth was two times higher in right-to-work states between 2008 and 2018 than in states where workers can be compelled to join unions or pay dues as a condition of employment.This disparity is the result of a confluence of pro-growth policies including low taxes, but employers often cite right-to-work laws when deciding where to locate a new plant. Foreign automakers built factories in southern states largely because their right-to-work laws make it more difficult to conscript workers into unions.Right to work has also made Northern Virginia more attractive to businesses compared to Maryland's Washington, D.C., suburbs. Northern Virginia last year accounted for 70% of new jobs in the D.C. metro area. Only 4% of Virginia workers belong to unions compared to 11.3% in Maryland. The share of construction workers who are unionized is five times higher in Maryland than Virginia.Progressives elected in last year's statehouse sweep now hope to reward their labor supporters. Senate Majority Leader Richard Saslaw is driving legislation that would allow unions to require non-members to pay "fair share fees" to defray their costs for collective bargaining, organization and other "representation" activities.The Supreme Court's Janus decision (2018) forbids governments from requiring public workers to pay such union fees but said nothing about private workers. Under the Virginia bill, workers could be required to subsidize unions regardless of whether they join. This would repeal right-to-work in all but name.Playing coy, Gov. Ralph Northam recently told a group of businesses that "I don't want to do anything that would threaten our AAA bond rating or our status as the number one state for businesses ... such as repealing (Virginia's) right-to-work law." Don't expect a veto.Meantime, Democrats in the U.S. House are moving legislation to prohibit right-to-work laws nationwide. Liberals can't abide laws in prosperous and growing states that make Illinois and New York look bad.Online: https://www.wsj.com/___Jan. 27The New York Times on John Bolton being a witness at impeachment trial of President Donald Trump:It's just possible that common sense and reality have a shot at prying open the doors to the Senate chamber after all. After Republican senators claimed that it was perfectly reasonable to put a United States president on trial without hearing from any witnesses, a few of them are showing signs of recognizing that the truth matters. Or, at least, that the American people believe it does.What's changed? Shocking but not surprising revelations from John Bolton's book manuscript, which The New York Times reported over the weekend, have made impossible to ignore what everyone has known for months: President Trump withheld hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine to benefit himself politically, and against the strenuous objections of his top aides and both parties in Congress.On Monday morning, Mitt Romney, of Utah, said, "I think it's increasingly likely that other Republicans will join those of us who think we should hear from John Bolton."It's refreshing to hear those words. And yet the fact that such a statement is noteworthy at all tells you how far from responsible governance Republicans have strayed. They hold 53 seats in the Senate, and yet the nation is waiting on just four - four! - to do the right thing and agree to call Mr. Bolton, the former national security adviser, and other key witnesses to testify in Mr. Trump's impeachment trial.A far more representative attitude in the Republican caucus was expressed by Roy Blunt, of Missouri, who said on Monday, "Unless there's a witness that's going to change the outcome, I can't imagine why we'd want to stretch this out for weeks and months." With this tautology Senator Blunt gives away the game: All witness testimony to date - all presented as part of the House impeachment proceedings - has only strengthened the case against Mr. Trump, but Republicans will not vote to convict him under any circumstances. By definition, then, no witness in the Senate could possibly change the outcome.The reporting on Mr. Bolton's manuscript, which is scheduled for publication in March, has scrambled that strategy. Mr. Bolton's foreign-policy disagreements with Mr. Trump have been public knowledge for months. Last fall, Fiona Hill, a Russia expert and former Bolton aide, testified in the House that Mr. Bolton was alarmed by Mr. Trump's aid-for-investigations scheme, which Mr. Bolton characterized as a "drug deal."In the manuscript, detailed descriptions of which were leaked to The Times, he recounts nearly a dozen instances in which he and other top administration officials pleaded with Mr. Trump to release the aid, to no avail. He describes Mr. Trump's fixation on conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election, and about the supposed corruption of Marie Yovanovitch, the American ambassador to Ukraine. He says that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo admitted privately to him that he knew there was nothing to the theories regarding Ms. Yovanovitch, whom Mr. Trump fired last spring.Mr. Bolton, a hard-line conservative with decades of service in Republican administrations, is no anti-Trump zealot, which makes his allegations against the president that much more devastating. And his decision to tell these stories publicly nearly certainly waives any claims of executive privilege Mr. Trump might try to assert over their communications.Let's not forget the newly revealed evidence that came to light on Saturday, in the form of a tape recording released by the lawyer for Lev Parnas, who had worked for Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, in the Ukraine scheme. Mr. Trump has denied even knowing Mr. Parnas, but on the tape the two men can be heard in conversation at a dinner in April 2018. "Get rid of her," Mr. Trump said of Ms. Yovanovitch. "Get her out tomorrow. Take her out. O.K.? Do it."In a late-night tweet, Mr. Trump angrily denied Mr. Bolton's allegations. "I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens," Mr. Trump wrote.You know what would be a good way to figure out who's telling the truth? Subpoena Mr. Bolton to testify under oath.This isn't a close call. A majority of Americans of all political stripes want to hear from Mr. Bolton, at the least. They believe, as do congressional Democrats, that you can't vote on whether to remove a president from office without getting the fullest possible account of his alleged offenses.But Senate Republicans have so far refused to hear from any witnesses or to demand any documents, following the lead of Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, who has never hesitated to undermine the country's institutions if he thinks doing so will help his party. Mr. McConnell and nearly all in his caucus seem to imagine that if they block their eyes and ears and let their mouths run, the turbulence of impeachment will eventually pass.This is a risky strategy. One reason good lawyers insist on deposing witnesses and subpoenaing documentary evidence is to avoid any unwelcome surprises at trial. Mr. Bolton has now provided the latest of those surprises. It is surely not the last.The most galling part is that Republicans have already admitted how bad the president's behavior was. Back in September, Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican and one of Mr. Trump's staunchest defenders, said: "What would've been wrong is if the president had suggested to the Ukrainian government that if you don't do what I want you to do regarding the Bidens, we're not going to give you the aid. That was the accusation; that did not remotely happen."Except that it did, as Mr. Bolton is apparently willing to say under oath. Republicans don't want him to do that because they don't want Americans to exercise the simple good judgment that Mr. Graham once did.Online: https://www.nytimes.com/___Jan. 27The Washington Times on the suspension of Felicia Sonmez, a journalist from the Washington Post:Felicia Sonmez, a journalist at Washington's other newspaper, was one of the few who weighed in after Bryant's death with a discordant note. As news of the helicopter crash broke, she tweeted a link to a Daily Beast article recounting the details of a 2003 sex assault charge that was brought against the then-Laker. (The case was eventually dropped and Bryant paid an undisclosed settlement.)Was Ms. Sonmez's tweet in bad taste? Perhaps. The basketball star's body had probably not even been removed from the hillside where the helicopter crashed when she issued it.What it was not, it would seem, was cause for professional punishment. Yet that's exactly what Ms. Sonmez's employer, The Washington Post, subjected her to. Tracy Grant, the newspaper's managing editor, told the Daily Mail on Sunday that "National political reporter Felicia Sonmez was placed on administrative leave while The Post reviews whether tweets about the death of Kobe Bryant violated The Post newsroom's social media policy."So, to recap: A Washington Post journalist was suspended for the "crime" of tweeting a link to a factual article about a famous celebrity who had died recently. Since when has sharing credible news stories about important subjects been something that journalists aren't supposed to do?Online: https://www.washingtontimes.com/___Jan. 24The Chicago Tribune on remembering Auschwitz:"Why did Auschwitz happen? Why? I don't have an answer to that. How, I know."- Elie Wiesel, Nobel Peace Prize winner and Holocaust survivorFay Waldman survived Auschwitz. She survived because Josef Mengele, the depraved Nazi doctor, decided on her arrival at the concentration camp that she shouldn't die. "I will never forget his lifting his black-leather gloved hand and pointing which way we should go, to the labor camp or to the death camp," Waldman said at a Chicago-area Holocaust remembrance in 1985. "I was healthy and went to the labor camp while the rest of my family went the other way."THE VICTIMS OF NAZI HATEThe terror at Auschwitz was both systematic and indiscriminate. The Germans murdered 1.1 million people at the extermination camp in Nazi-occupied Poland. Most of the victims were Jewish. They were gassed, shot or beaten to death. Thousands of inmates survived, though barely, as slave laborers. Some worked in mines or rock quarries. Some sorted the confiscated possessions of others prisoners to be shipped back to Germany. One small group, surely the unluckiest of survivors, was assigned to the Sonderkommando, the unit ordered to move corpses from the gas chambers to the ovens.There were children at Auschwitz too. Among the murdered and brutalized were sets of twins who became the subject of Mengele's sadistic medical experiments. Most were killed afterward so their bodies could be dissected. One pair was sewn together as if to create a conjoined set. They died of gangrene. Eva Kor remembered being tied down and stuck with a needle. "They wanted to know how much blood a person can lose and still live," she said years later.On Jan. 27, 1945, the madness ended. With Germany in retreat, Soviet soldiers liberated the Auschwitz complex. "We saw emaciated, tortured, impoverished people," Ivan Martynushkin, then a 21-year-old lieutenant, told CNN in 2010. "We could tell from their eyes that they were happy to be saved from this hell." The Soviet troops found approximately 7,000 inmates. The Nazis had fled, taking 60,000 prisoners with them. Those who could not keep up were shot.DECADES LATER, WE REMEMBERFay Waldman of Lincolnwood died in 2015. Eva Kor of Terre Haute, Indiana, died last summer. Soon all the survivors of the German extermination camps will be gone, no longer bearing witness. Their testimonies will live on, though, via museums like the Illinois Holocaust Museum in Skokie, documentaries like "Shoah," books and archives. As long as those stories are shared, the lessons of the Holocaust won't be forgotten. This is what makes anniversaries crucial to commemorate: They're opportunities - excuses, if you will - to remember. The year 2020 marks the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, the largest Nazi death complex, and the end to World War II. It's a year filled with reflections.On the 40th anniversary in 1985, ABC News anchor Peter Jennings visited Auschwitz with Elie Wiesel, the Nobel laureate and Auschwitz survivor, to consider the horror of Nazi genocide. Jennings asked a logical question: How could the Jews of Europe have become victims in their own countries? How did they not recognize the German intention to exterminate the Jews? Why did they seemingly submit so easily? Wiesel had taken up this same question in his acclaimed memoir "Night," in which Moishe the Beadle returned home to warn villagers after he survived a far-off Nazi massacre. No one believed him. His tale was too fantastical. The Jews put trust in a society that reviled them. Many Jews did flee before the war, but many did not.Weisel told Jennings that the Nazi's Final Solution was too well-conceived to fail:"We came from one world into another," Wiesel said. "The killers killed and the victims died and the sky was blue and bread was bread. It worked. The Germans managed to create, beside creation, another creation. Beside human society another society, a parallel society, and that society was efficient. There were those who lit the fire, those who threw the children in the fire and it worked day after day and we had the feeling that it would never end."THE ACHING QUESTION: 'WHY?'Toward the end of his life, Wiesel spent hours in conversation with the Tribune's Howard Reich for Reich's book, "The Art of Inventing Hope: Intimate Conversations with Elie Wiesel." Wiesel suggested that the Holocaust existed as a paradox: something too terrible to happen that also happened. An inconceivable reality. "Wiesel himself had said many times to me that the scale of this genocide could not be absorbed by the human psyche," Reich wrote. To put it another way, citing Wiesel: The "How" of the Holocaust is far easier to grasp than the "Why."Peter Hayes, a Northwestern University professor emeritus, in his book "Why? Explaining the Holocaust," wrote that Nazi Germany existed in a feedback loop of hate. The regime of Adolf Hitler created "an ideological echo chamber in which leaders constantly harped on the threat the Jews supposedly constituted and the need for Germans to defend themselves against it." Again, that better explains how the Holocaust happened than why.Why Auschwitz? Because the Nazis decided. They identified a religious minority group who were contributors to European society yet outsiders, and declared them to be enemies - vermin to be eradicated because decimating a scapegoat can be advantageous. Six million European Jews died.Why Auschwitz? There is no logical explanation, so there cannot be a satisfying answer. But the more we reflect on the Holocaust - the more we ask "Why?" - the closer we may come to understanding hate and recognizing inhumanity. Then maybe one day we can eradicate it.Online: https://www.chicagotribune.com/Load-Date: January 30, 2020End of Document

Plus, Jim talks through this morning's Starbucks  trim/General Electric  buy from our Alert , and more!If you cannot see the video, please check if the ad-blocker on your internet browser is turned on. The ad-blocker will need to be turned off to watch our video player.Katherine Ross:I'm Katherine Ross, and I'm here on the floor of the NYSE with Jim Cramer. Jim, let's start by talking about Apple's revenue warning.Jim Cramer:Sure. Okay, so Apple's revenue warning is two part. One part is that the demand is slowed, and there you can imagine if you need a hall pass to get out of your house in China. China is really one of the great growth drivers. That has to be cut short. If you don't have any people shopping, they're not going to be shopping. And then the other side is can they meet the demand, because demand remains strong around the globe. They've got six or seven factories in the Hubei area. Those are offline. Those are not Apple facilities. They are subs, and those subs will be moved to other areas within China, and that means that they'll be able to meet the demand shortly.Jim Cramer:Demand has accelerated overseas. That's something that nobody seems to realize, certainly not in any of the discourse that I hear. And don't forget, this is precisely why you want the service revenue, which is doing incredibly well. So the reason why the stock's down seven and not down 20 is because there's a chance that the factories will come back online. And there is an incredible amount of hope, unlike what you read among the scare mongers, that the death rate outside of Hubei has come down dramatically and that it's under control. I read no scientist that says this is under control, but I also know that people are going back to work in China. Not many, about a third in these various factories, but the sense is that the Chinese government says, "Hey, listen, you're fine. We're not going to stop commerce."Jim Cramer:That's really the wrap. "They are not going to stop commerce and you're fine." And they've cordoned off martial law, basically. Those provinces, cordoned 58 million people and in a communist authoritarian regime, they can do it! And I think that's kind of really what nobody figured out, which is that these guys are doing something we can't do in this country. We can't say that the state of New York, nobody can do anything. Or California, we can't take California offline. We're a democracy! But there they have a military, it's a military run government. And they can say, "Hey, you know what? You're not getting out of your house." And that can put a damper and slow down the virus. Now I think we're all wondering, "Does anybody have anything on the virus?" And the answer is no. Do people think that it's going to burn out in April? 50% yes, 50% no.Jim Cramer:Does the Chinese government say, "I don't care?" Yes. The Chinese government is about commerce and they're going to meet the demands of those who need it.Katherine Ross:With all the unknowns around the coronavirus, does this just strengthen what you guys at the portfolio have been saying, which is, "Own, don't trade."Jim Cramer:Yeah. Look at what's happening with Apple. Now, we didn't get any downgrades of Apple this morning. You would think that someone would downgrade it, right? Someone would come out and say, "Listen, it's time to sell Apple. It's time to take profits." No one did. I want to know whether was it because the stock wasn't down, they didn't want to break ranks? Or tomorrow will we see people who say, "You know what? You got very lucky Apple wasn't down enough. Let's take action." How many people worked yesterday? I don't know. I certainly expected it to be down more.Katherine Ross:Let's talk about some trades that you guys were making this morning. You guys trimmed a little bit of Starbucks.Jim Cramer:Yeah, I think that eating is definitely going to slow. Eating out, getting a cup of coffee. Now Starbucks, like Apple, guided that ... We don't know what the bottom end of the range is because of China. I don't want Starbucks down the equivalent of the seven that Apple is down right now, and I do think that we're trying to get ahead of that. There's nothing wrong with that. It's a nice little profit. We'll certainly revisit it. I think there's a lot of people who believe that if they sell, the next thing you see is that they've solved the virus. I am not getting that vibe. I know Gilead can't find enough for the trial. I am over and over again hearing that none of our antivirals work, over and over again hearing that quarantine is not going to hold.Jim Cramer:Over and over again hearing that this thing is spreading like wildfire. We had a lot of people talking about 60% take rate, 6% rate in our country getting it. We had people who were making absurd claims about how many people can get it from other people. Nobody under nine has it, which is rather amazing. That's exactly where the regular flu is concentrated. The number of deaths is fewer than what you get in our country. That does not mean I want to minimize it. It's four times more lethal in our country than our flu. It's very easy to catch, but I think that there's a lot of false information about it. And that is because the Chinese have an information gap that lets you wonder about what the real numbers are, and that's what we're stuck with.Katherine Ross:And you guys also added to GE this morning?Jim Cramer:Yeah. With GE, there's a story out this morning and we added before frankly, we knew this. There was a story out this morning which says that the president says, "Listen, we're open for business and those engines are going to go." Anything's going to go to China. The president is far more sympathetic to the Chinese government than anybody thought they were. This idea that they might restrict semiconductor equipment, that's included I think in the 'we're not going to do that' camp. There are two camps in the white house. One is, "It's time to really derail China." Let's call it a Belicheck role. Okay? And then there's an Andy Reid camp, which just is, "Let's be magnanimous, malice toward none," and the malice toward none camp is certainly in charge.Jim Cramer:And I think that's another reason why things came back. We are thinking what GE was, "Let's use the weakness so people think that the president is restricting," because it would still be good because the engine that we care about is the LEAP engine. The LEAP engine wasn't apparently included in any of this anyway. So those who want to be negative have to deal with the fact that the president is simply unwilling to take a hard line on China, and is much more magnanimous right here. And I know the president Xi will never forget that. I do believe that the president should let the CDC in, let Tony Fauci in. They're being foolish not to. Tony's a genius. Maybe they'll change their mind.Katherine Ross:What else are you watching today?Jim Cramer:I'm watching the United Health's of the world. They can't quit, and I think that's because they're domestic. I'm watching the Costco, which is saying, "Look, we're better than Walmart." The stock is saying that. I mentioned that in my real money piece, that Costco is the gold standard.Jim Cramer:I'm watching the incredible performance of the cruise stocks. They're shorts! They are shorts. Because if they came out and gave you their book of business, I think you'd be surprised how weak it is. But people are oblivious. This is a very different market from what the longterm people are used to, and that's because people just feel ... You know what? Look at Starbucks. They sold some Starbucks. Did it go down? No. Maybe they should have held on to it. I have no illusions. If Starbucks were to announce what Apple announced the stocks at 85. I want to dodge that. Once they announce it, I could buy back. I typically do not play the hedge fund game, but I do know that there's no way that Starbucks can make their numbers. And the stocks unchanged? Well, let me trim! Let me trim.Jim Cramer:By the way, once again, just want to point out on Twitter that I'm done ... Jimmy Chill is done replying to the people who keep saying, "Jim, don't you understand that fossil fuels are here to stay?" China is opening up a lot more plants, Germany opened a lot more coal plants, Japan ... Well, my point of why I owned Schlumberger for the trust and why I own BP was because of that. In other words, I had done a lot of work, more work I think to the [inaudible] than a lot of people who appeared in my Twitter file who keep saying, "Jim, if you ever did any fossil fuel work, you would know that these places are being added." And it's kind of laughable. If they were subscribers to Action Alert, they would know that we had done far more work than they had, and it indicated that coal is still very much in play.Jim Cramer:But what these people are missing is we're not talking about the actual use. That's what got us into the ill-fated BP and Schlumberger positions. What we're talking about is the stocks going out of favor and maybe going out of favor for a long time, if not entirely, because divestiture. Divestiture is doesn't care whether these companies are doing well or not. So I think that people have to understand my role in life is to interpret the stock, not the demand of the product. And the demand of the product's fine, but the stocks aren't going up. I remind people that today's a long day, that don't be fooled. The sellers will come in and we're ready with capital.Katherine Ross:And with that, Jim, thank you so much for joining us today. Guys, thanks so much for tuning in. I'm Katherine Ross and we'll see you tomorrow.Load-Date: February 19, 2020End of Document

Wuhan officials face questions, anger over virus responseAssociated Press InternationalJanuary 29, 2020 Wednesday 1:12 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 1610 wordsByline: By DAKE KANG, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Last Wednesday evening, top officials in the central Chinese city of Wuhan settled into their seats at an auditorium for a Lunar New Year gala - even as a new virus that originated in their city was spreading rapidly.Dozens of actors, actresses and musicians performed, some despite having sniffles and sneezes, the Hubei Folk Song and Dance Ensemble said in a now-deleted social media post.The next morning, residents woke to news that officials had ordered the city sealed, its airport closed and its train and bus stations shut down. Thousands of people flooded Wuhan's hospitals, which pleaded for donations of masks, disinfectant and medical supplies as overworked doctors and nurses grappled with the crowds.It wasn't long before simmering anger exploded online. Hundreds fumed at a report on the festivities on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, asking why officials were enjoy gala shows instead of dealing with the epidemic or shortages of supplies.As China institutes one of the largest quarantines in modern history, locking down more than 50 million people in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province, questions are swirling about the city and provincial governments' sluggish initial response to an outbreak that has infected thousands of people and killed more than 100.For two weeks, from Jan. 5 to 16, the city reported virtually no new cases, while hundreds of officials gathered in Wuhan, the provincial capital, for Hubei's two biggest political meetings of the year. It was only after a medical team dispatched by the National Health Commission went to investigate on Jan. 19 that the severity of the situation became public."Wuhan must immediately change its chief!" Zhang Oufa, a journalist with the government-run Hubei Daily newspaper, thundered in a Weibo post. "Under these abnormal, grave circumstances that keep getting worse by the day, Wuhan's current leader just doesn't have what it takes to lead!"His comments were swiftly removed. The paper rushed out an apology, saying it was deeply sorry for "disrupting ongoing work on epidemic prevention" and "causing difficulties for leaders at various levels."Zhang has continued to post thinly veiled criticisms of city officials, and leading business magazine Caixin has published stories from the front lines, interviewing exhausted doctors and nurses and reporting long waits and supply shortages.The fact that these reports are getting through China's censors is likely a tacit sign of the central leadership's displeasure."Wuhan authorities clearly downplayed or made efforts to hide the situation for an extended period of time," said Dali Yang, a professor of Chinese politics at the University of Chicago. "It turned out to be one of the worst decisions that they'll regret all their lives."Wuhan's mayor, Zhou Xianwang, defended his actions in an unusually tough interview with state broadcaster CCTV on Monday, offering to step down over his decision to close the city - not because of any delays in reporting the epidemic. He said the city government was slow to disclose information about the virus due to national regulations."As a local government official, I could disclose information only after being authorized," Zhou said. "A lot of people didn't understand this."Phone calls to the Wuhan party committee publicity department rang unanswered Monday and Tuesday, and their fax machines were turned off.Chinese health officials informed the World Health Organization about the new virus on Dec. 31. By Jan. 8, it had been identified as a new coronavirus, a large family that causes the common cold and more serious illnesses including SARS, which also began in China. By Jan. 12, Chinese scientists had sequenced the virus' genetic makeup and shared it with WHO, drawing praise for their transparency and swift action.In contrast, the Wuhan heath commission reported no new cases from Jan. 5 to 10 and again from Jan. 12 to 16. China's Lunar New Year rush -the world's largest annual human migration - began to get underway, with millions of people passing through Wuhan, a major transit hub.A recently submitted complaint to the National Health Commission alleged that during this period, officials with the Wuhan health commission told doctors they were not allowed to report about the new virus, letting patients wander around freely instead of being isolated."We have countless medical workers who, because they weren't aware of the situation, got cut down at the front lines," said the complaint, whose author said they were a Wuhan doctor. "Because of the coverup of the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission and other leaders, they made unnecessary sacrifices!"A volunteer coordinating donations to hospitals in Wuhan heard from doctors and nurses that in early January, it became apparent that many medical workers treating patients were falling ill themselves. They raised the alarm, but with little effect.The sluggish response meant that for weeks, medical staff made do without proper protection, the volunteer said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution against the doctors and nurses. Even now, some medical staff are using garbage bags and cut-up water bottles as makeshift gowns and masks, the volunteer said."When we first discovered it could be transmitted between people, our hospital head, chairman, medical affairs department, they sat and made endless calls to the city government, the health commission," one nurse, who fell ill and was put in isolation, wrote in messages shared by the volunteer. "They said we still can't wear protective clothing, because it might stir up panic."Not all the blame can be placed on local officials, health and governance experts say. The broader issue is that local officials can be punished for reporting bad news to higher officials. The Chinese government's rigidity, and a lack of transparency and accountability to the general public means problems like the virus epidemic can fester hidden away until it is too late."There's a tendency in terms of the Chinese bureaucratic accountability system to view a governance failure as the fault of a particular government official or group of officials, as opposed to a symptom of a broader governance challenge," says John Yasuda, an Indiana University professor studying politics and regulatory failures in China. "Officials are likely to be a bit more hesitant to report simply because they don't want to be caught with the hot potato."As the National Health Commission team came to Wuhan to investigate on Jan. 19, tens of thousands of people tucked into a mass banquet of 13,986 dishes contributed from neighborhood families. Pictures in state media showed nobody wearing masks while they shared rice cakes, fish, and other Lunar New Year delicacies.Even after the head of the team announced that the virus could spread from person to person, and the number of reported cases began soaring, crowds of pedestrians thronged the streets of Wuhan early last week."I heard about it earlier this month, but I didn't pay much attention," said Helen Cao on Jan. 21, pausing after an afternoon shopping on Wuhan's busiest pedestrian street. "It should be fine. All the sick people are in hospitals, it's not really an emergency."Growing anxiety over the virus is evoking memories of the ruling Communist Party's slow response to the 2002 emergence of SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. Even after SARS had spread globally, China sought to conceal the number of cases by parking patients in hotels and obscure hospital wings, and driving them around in ambulances to avoid detection by World Health Organization experts.This time, action from the central government has been swifter. There are signs the central government in Beijing may act against city and provincial-level officials it deems responsible for the crisis.China's cabinet, the State Council, issued a public call Friday for whistleblowers, opening up channels for people to submit complaints about cover-ups or delays in reporting cases. It promised cases would be "dealt with seriously."Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for the study of global health at the Council of Foreign Relations, believes authorities are being much more responsive, now that the central government has acted. But Huang says the fact that the disease had been allowed to fester for so long shows deep-rooted problems with increasingly strict political controls under President Xi Jinping."The atmosphere is such now, we see rapid centralization of political power," Huang said "That created a political atmosphere where people are afraid to speak up... They are very reluctant to share any useful information, and that is actually becoming a challenge."A 63-year-old retiree who would be identified only his last name, Xia, said he had to stay overnight Thursday to get his feverish wife care, waiting in lines with nearly a hundred people for a doctor's check and a CT scan and staying in the hospital until 7 in the morning.Xia wondered why there were so few medical staff, and saw a nurse passed out in exhaustion. When he got home, he saw notices online telling sick people to stay home and avoid bothering overworked hospitals."I feel very helpless," he said by phone, despite warnings from a superior not to speak to media. "Who's going to give us advice or suggestions? I have no friends working in hospitals."Amid Wuhan's now-empty streets and pharmacies running low on supplies, Xia feels more and more anxious. He hopes help will soon be on the way."Ordinary people really hope the government will take action instead of make empty talk," he said. "I trust the government."Load-Date: January 29, 2020End of Document

US Indicts Four Chinese Military Officers In Equifax HackThe Daily CallerFebruary 10, 2020 Monday 04:03 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc.

Asian stocks tumble on growing concern about China virusAssociated Press InternationalJanuary 21, 2020 Tuesday 4:48 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 373 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Asian stock markets tumbled Tuesday as concern about the economic impact of a Chinese disease outbreak rose.Japan's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged and revised up its economic growth outlook.Market indexes in Shanghai, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney all retreated following the Chinese government's announcement of a fourth death from coronavirus. The outbreak, centered on the city of Wuhan, has sickened more than 200 people.Authorities said some infections were transmitted person-to-person, increasing the risk the disease might spread faster during the Lunar New Year holiday, the Chinese-speaking world's busiest travel season. Other Asian governments stepped up screening of travelers from China, highlighting the potential impact on tourism revenue.The outbreak "is developing into a major potential economic risk to the Asia-Pacific region," said Rajiv Biswas of IHS Markit in a report.The outbreak and measures to stop it have could affect tourism, retailing, restaurants, air travel and other industries, said Biswas. He pointed to the example of the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, whose economic impact was felt as far away as Canada and Australia.The Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.1% to 3,061.74 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was off 1.8% at 28,279.95. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 retreated 0.8% to 23,902.60.Seoul's Kospi sank 0.6% to 2,248.57 and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 was off 0.5% at 7,045.20. Southeast Asian markets also declined.The Bank of Japan left its policy rate at -0.1% and reaffirmed its commitment to increase holdings of government bonds. Board members raised their projection of economic growth in the year that starts in April to 0.9% from 0.7%.The European central bank also is due to make an interest rate decision this week.ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. oil fell 16 cents to $58.42 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract gained 5 cents on Monday to close at $58.58. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 30 cents to $64.90 per barrel in London. It advanced 35 cents the previous session to $65.20.CURRENCIES: The dollar declined to 110.00 yen from Monday's 110.18 yen. The euro gained to $1.1097 from $1.1094.Load-Date: January 21, 2020End of Document

US and China sign trade truceCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 15, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 416 wordsBodyAt a highly anticipated ceremony in Washington, the United States and China have just started a new phase in their trade relations with the signing of a truce that puts on hold the tariff war that has been destabilizing markets for nearly two years.The pact freezes the $156 billion tariffs that the United States intended to impose on more Chinese products as of December 2019.The fees were to affect strategic products such as mobile s, computers, toys and clothing, and would have involved all-out war, as nearly 100% of Chinese imports would become subject to new tariffs. In addition, Casa Blana has cut some of the rates already in force by half.In return, China is committed to buying US products worth $200 billion over the next two years, with a particular focus on the agricultural, energy and manufacturing sectors.In addition, it facilitates the opening up of its financial sector to foreign companies and agrees to raise the protection of intellectual property rights, although it will not change any legislation or regulations, as the White House initially intended.This is the first phase of the agreement, which has been in negotiation for months and has been about to collapse on several occasions. Finally, the pact has come forward, in large part, because the United States has managed to include a compliance clause with immediate consequences in the event that the commitments reached are not respected.The signing of the pact has been enthusiastically welcomed in the markets and, especially on Wall Street, prepared for new records. However, the agreement is fragile, as tariffs of $250 billion are still in force. Morethan, the second part of the pact is more than likely not to be resolved until after the november presidential election this year. This phase will include more sensitive topics such as cybersecurity and the status of Chinese government-controlled enterprises.Trump called the agreement a "transcendental step" for a "fair and reciprocal trade future" between the United States and China. For his part, Chinese Deputy Prime Minister Liu He read a letter from the representative, Xi Jinping, in which he stressed that the firm "is good for China, for the United States, and for the world," and expressed confidence that relations between the two countries are "mutually trusted and co-opted" era."Although Xi's sustenance stifled suspicions, Trump called the ruler "very, very friendly" of his and assured that he will meet him in the "not too distant" future.Load-Date: February 26, 2020End of Document

State Department Hosts Foreign Press Briefing on Cyber PolicyTargeted News ServiceJanuary 11, 2020 Saturday 7:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 5079 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Department of State issued the following foreign press center briefing on Jan. 10 by Robert L. Strayer, deputy assistant secretary for Cyber and International Communications and Information Policy in the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs, on the cyber policy:MODERATOR: Hi, everybody. Welcome to the Washington Foreign Press Center. Thank you for coming today. We are pleased to have with us today Robert Strayer, who is the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Cyber and International Communications and Information Policy in the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs. Deputy Assistant Secretary Strayer in this capacity leads the development of international cyber security, internet, data, and privacy policy, and related negotiations with foreign governments. He's led dozens of bilateral and multilateral dialogues with foreign governments, foreign affairs, and communications ministries.Today, he'll have some opening remarks, and then we'll turn it over to question-and-answer. At that time, I just ask that you identify yourself with your name, country, and outlet. And with that, I'll turn it over to you. Thank you.MR STRAYER: Thanks a lot for that introduction. Thank you all for coming, and those who are online, I look forward to engaging with you. I wanted to give some opening remarks about what we've done in 2019, and looking forward to in 2020.So I lead of the office of the State Department responsible for cyber policy, as well as international communications policy and securing digital technologies. As the world has seen tremendous growth from the internet and connected digital technologies, we now have increasing numbers of people having access to information they never had access to before. They're able to access this information as well as participate in commerce, ecommerce. Especially small and medium-sized businesses take tremendous advantage of that. The internet and being connected really adds trillions of dollars to the global economy every year.But with that kind of tremendous gain and tremendous potential future gains, we also have significant challenges in cyberspace. Those come in the form of cyber threats in unsecure technologies. So as we look to connect the next 3 billion people around the world, we need to face these challenges head-on. And because the internet is inherently borderless and is - and we've become more interconnected, we need to do greater work to cooperate among nations and to seek collaboration on addressing these significant challenges in cyberspace.For that reason, cyber security and cyber policy issues are very important to the State Department, and it's really becoming one of the top foreign policy imperatives of our time.In this last year, we've worked very closely following the work we've actually been undertaking for more than a decade to establish a framework of responsible state behavior in cyberspace. That is, establishing the rules of the road for how nations should interact with one another in cyberspace. We've had the UN endorse a set of 11 voluntary norms of responsible state behavior. On the sidelines of the UN General Assembly high-level week in September of this year, Deputy Secretary Sullivan, along with the foreign ministers of the Netherlands and Australia, had a statement signed - along with 26 other countries in addition to the United States - on responsible state behavior in cyberspace. Those endorsed the applicability of international law to cyberspace, so international law applies in cyberspace just as it does in the physical world. Also established that countries should adhere to these voluntary norms of responsible state behavior that have been previously endorsed by the United Nations, and key among those is the norm that one nation should not attack another nation's critical infrastructure.This joint statement also said that, unfortunately, countries will still likely act inconsistent with this framework of responsible state behavior, and therefore it's necessary that those states that are likeminded about the importance of these norms act to hold those other nations accountable for those transgressions against norms of responsible state behavior, and in some cases, impose consequences against those actors. So it was a very significant statement that we had pulled together with 27 countries in total at the - in late September.Through the State Department, we are leading the U.S. Government's efforts to establish what is known as a cyber deterrence strategy. This was previously announced in the September 2018 National Cyber Strategy. The international component referring to deterrence is something that the Department of State has been leading the interagency implementation of. Our goal there is to establish a set of consequences that are swift, costly, and transparent. Those can be used in an effort to respond to those countries who do not act in ways that are responsible, who act inconsistently with responsible norms of state behavior. We are continuing to implement those, and we will be doing so in the new year, in 2020, and we're also working closely with a number of other governments out there to find ways that we can work together to impose consequences against those state actors who are acting in malicious ways.Another major line of effort that we've undertaken for more than a year now has been to educate and discuss with other countries about the importance and the transformational nature of 5G wireless technologies. That's the fifth generation of wireless technology. Fifth - 5G is going to be so different than 4G and previous generation of wireless technology because it's going to empower the internet of things and all types of new critical infrastructure. That new critical infrastructure will ride on the backbone of 5G, the ability of devices to communicate at roughly 100 times the speeds they do today and with very low latency - that is, the time it takes to connect between a device and a server and back to the device. Those types of new applications include autonomous vehicles, telemedicine, automated manufacturing, and just massive amounts of data that were not previously carried by communications networks. Having that much data also will empower artificial intelligence and other very vital services to the government and to the public.So it's very important that the technology be secure. Our view is that you need to, of course, have the best of cyber security best practices deployed on these 5G networks, but the inherent ability of updates to networks to contain a potential compromise, a compromise to software or the firmware, which is software that rides on hardware systems, that - because it can be compromised means that there is no ability for any testing regime to be certain that these updates do not contain some type of vulnerability in millions of lines of code. So what you really need is a trust relationship between the vendors of this technology and the telecom operator and the government where that technology is going to be deployed.Over the last year we've worked very closely with a large number of countries, in particular worked closely with Europe as they're working on security measures for 5G. We saw the European Union adopt a risk assessment in early October that said that they need to be concerned about these trust factors and to look at the ability of a foreign government to influence the vendor that's providing their 5G technology; and in particular, they should also look at the ownership structure of that company and whether that company is subject to coercion, and finally, whether that company is subject to - in a legal environment where there are democratic checks and balances.The United States - we've shared this - from the United States perspective, we've shared our concern that in China the national intelligence law from 2017 requires all entities to comply with the mandates of the security intelligence services in China with - and to do so secretly, and there is no way to appeal to an independent judiciary or a rule of law system as a check on that power from those intelligence security services.So we're pleased to see that the European Union recognized that risk in their risk assessment. We also saw the European Union's Council develop a statement that was released on December 3rd that said that they also recognize the importance of looking at non-technical measures and in particular looking at the legal and policy framework of where a vendor is headquartered, so in a country where the vendor for 5G technology is headquartered.So in the next - in the new year we're likely to see a European Union security toolbox for 5G; that is, particular measures that address the security risks that they've already assessed to exist. We're going to work very closely in the new year with European allies in addition to the allies around the - partners and allies around the world that we've already been working with on 5G security measures.In July of 2018, Secretary Pompeo announced that we were going to begin a strategic down payment on digital cooperation in developing countries around the world. We call this our Digital Connectivity and Cybersecurity Partnership. It's a way of us to provide technical assistance as well as capacity building to countries as they're looking to help connect the next 3 billion people around the world. We want that to be done in a way that's going to ensure that there is sustainable development in the digital space as well as protecting the individual liberties of people in those countries, and that way they can continue to see the benefits of the internet and see even greater improvements in their standards of living and ability to access information.In 2019, we were able to commit to $50 million of technical assistance both in the form of cyber security capacity building, cyber security training, as well as regulatory and other training assistance for regulators in countries around the world.In this next year, we're looking to expand to - our previous focus having been - with our previous focus having been on the Indo-Pacific region, in the new year we're looking to expand to Latin America with at least $10 million pending approval from Congress on this new initiative to expand to Latin America as well.So we have a lot on our plate for the new year. We're very enthused about the ability for new technologies to present many new opportunities for people, improve standards of living, improve quality of life, but we know that we need to do so securely. So our overall message to the world is that we want to help them promote technologies that are open, interoperable, reliable, and secure.And with that, I'd love to take any questions you have.MODERATOR: All right, we'll start in the front here.QUESTION: Dmitry Kirsanov with TASS. Mr. Secretary, there was a boatload of speculations about Iran potentially retaliating using all sorts of cyber attacks immediately following General Soleimani's death, so I wanted to ask you if the U.S. administration, if those fears have materialized, if the U.S. administration is seeing any significant cyber attacks emanating from Iran that you can contribute to the Iranian state.MR STRAYER: So I can't comment on anything that we know from a classified sense. I will just say that as you're probably aware, senior officials, including at the Department of Homeland Security, have encouraged our private sector and individuals to be vigilant about the potential threats that would emanate potentially from Iran in recent days. But I can't today comment on what we're seeing as specific activity there.MODERATOR: For our next question we'll go here, and then we'll go to New York.QUESTION: Emel Akan, the Epoch Times. My question is about China, China's cyber security rules. China passed a new cryptographic encryption law which - that took effect on January 1. I'm wondering if you have any comments on this new rule, which has - which potentially has a lot of implications for foreign companies operating in China.MR STRAYER: Yeah. We're very concerned about laws like we're seeing, like that one in China, and in general, the requirements that are being placed on companies to share data with governments that are not based on rule-of-law protections, that don't involve the potential to go to an independent judiciary. We think it's important that there be careful - there be narrow constraints around government access to information that would be for specific purposes.I think what we're seeing in China as far as their requirement that companies provide the government access to all sorts of data on all types of companies and all - in very broad sectors of the economy should also give telecom operators in countries around the world concern about the ability for a Chinese company to then provide their telecom services and be able to actually resist a mandate from the government in Beijing to provide access to the data that's residing on the networks that would be then in a third country, say in Europe or somewhere else. That kind of extraterritorial ability for the Chinese Government to reach out is certainly in the realm of the possible. It's not something that would be, again, able to be resisted by going to an independent judiciary or appealing to rule-of-law institutions to stop that kind of extraterritorial reach to acquire data around the world.MODERATOR: Okay. For our next question we'll go to New York, and then we'll come back. Please, go ahead, New York.QUESTION: Paolo Mastrolilli, U.S. bureau chief for the Italian daily newspaper La Stampa. Thank you very much for the briefing. You were mentioning the discussion ongoing with the European allies concerning the construction of the 5G network in Europe. Some of these countries like Italy are still considering the possibility to let a Chinese company build their own 5G network. I would like to ask you if there is any update you could share in terms of the dialogue with Italy concerning the construction of its 5G network.MR STRAYER: (Inaudible) consultations with the Italian Government. We think that a lot of countries in Europe are probably looking to Brussels and the European Union security toolkit that's going to be likely released this month or in the next couple months on 5G security, but the same points that I made just a few minutes ago we're making to the Italian Government and others - that is, our concern that we not just look at technical measures of cybersecurity competence, but also look at non-technical measures that relate to a trusted vendor, that is, the ability of a vendor to be commanded by a government in a third country to take actions that are not in the interests of the citizens in Italy or in - the citizens of other parts of Europe, and that really what we're looking at is not just what's at stake in a 4G network, but with a 5G network and critical infrastructure and vast exponential increases really in the amount of personal data on those networks, we need to be that much more secure, and there will be that much more temptation for authoritarian governments to try to access the data that will be on 5G networks. So the discussions are ongoing with European countries, including Italy.MODERATOR: We'll go here and then to you, sir.QUESTION: I'm Mounzer Sleiman, Al Mayadeen TV based in Beirut, Lebanon. To follow up on the previous question, can you just, without identifying a target of cyber warfare, can you confirm that there was any cyber attacks originated from - by Iranians since the killing of Soleimani? And the other question I want to ask you is: Can you categorize or rank the adversaries of United States in cyber warfare, and also, the friends of United States? Can you rank who is on the top or give us some idea who has the capability? And what kind of international law, additional articles of international law you would like to apply to cyber security?MR STRAYER: Great questions. I'll do my best to answer them as best I can. Let me just start with our Director of National Intelligence through our Worldwide Threat Assessment annually has articulated there is four countries that we see as strategic competitors or adversaries in cyberspace, and those are China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran. We don't put any particular order on them, but there is a little bit of definition within that report about how we see the threats being posed by each one of those actors. And shortly, like later this month or early next month, there will be another threat assessment along those lines.I just can't characterize the nature of cyber attacks in general. I mean, there's all - there's always things going on in cyberspace. We make a concerted decision within the U.S. Government about whether we want to attribute an attack or activity in cyberspace and how we want to respond. So I'm not able to sort of give you the full lay of the land. That is a classified endeavor that we undertake, and I'm not able to characterize Iranian activity at that level at this time.QUESTION: Sorry, I ask about whether you can confirm without saying anything that there was an increase of Iranian activities after the killing of Soleimani.MR STRAYER: I'm just - I'm not in a position to characterize --QUESTION: Okay.MR STRAYER: -- the type of activity. Sorry.QUESTION: All right.MR STRAYER: I would say that in cyberspace, there is a lot of things happening very often, and there's a further decision not just of what's happening on private networks but what's being attributed to a government as well. So there is a lot of activity in cyberspace that requires very careful consideration, which is what we do in the U.S. Government. We are very careful before we attribute an attack or attribute activity that we don't like to see. So I'm not here going to make any announcements today and - or even to characterize in any way the Iranian activity.QUESTION: My apologies. I just want to remind you of the international law issue, and ranking the friends of United --MR STRAYER: Yeah, yeah. So I'm not going to rank friends, but I will say that - so on the international front, we think that we already have the applicability of international law to cyberspace well established at the UN. We also have these 11 norms of responsible state behavior. What we want to see is the further universal acceptance of those norms and countries to better understand how they can live by those norms, in particular that norm about one nation not attacking another nation's critical infrastructure that's providing services to the public. We've seen that norm violated multiple times. In particular, in 2018 we saw North Korea do that, we saw Russia do that through the NotPetya attack, and we also saw Russia attack the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Those violate norms of responsible state behavior.So we want to see a further understanding of - by nations of what these norms mean, and we would like to see more nations sign on to our statement that we signed - that we jointly promulgated with the Netherlands and Australia in September about advancing this framework of responsible state behavior in cyberspace.We don't need additional international tools necessarily to push forward these understandings, so we think that just having a better understanding of what the norms mean in particular countries and particular contexts is what we should be pushing for in the near term.MODERATOR: All right. For our next question we'll go to Alex.QUESTION: Yeah, Alex Raufoglu from Turan News Agency of Azerbaijan. I have two questions, but before I would like to take another chance on Iran and the U.S. issue. Just so we understand the state of alert in Washington, there are threat of, let's say, targets that Iran might target in its immediate neighborhood, in Azerbaijan, in (inaudible). Is this something that you feel that the red lights are blinking red after Soleimani's killing? And is it something that Washington is discussing with its allies in the region? And I have another question.MR STRAYER: Well, as I said earlier, we were concerned enough that we told our general public, and we share that with our international partners, that we were concerned that there could be attacks on industrial control systems, on critical infrastructure. We, of course, saw the attacks that occurred on Saudi Arabia in 2016 and into early 2017, including against Saudi Aramco, which were deletions of data that wiped out many computers at once that can be debilitating to critical infrastructure. We've also seen Iran active on media platforms seeking to influence the U.S. population.So we talked about that before and then we made that further sort of effort - effort to make sure our public and both our private sector and individuals were well aware of the threats that could emanate from Iran. But I can't characterize, again, the nature of how things - how we're seeing things change. It's an internal decision.QUESTION: My other question: We see more and more countries in the region are turning to internet blackout or digital attacks on its citizens to control domestic politics. Is this something that in your scope - are you covering this issue? Is it - has Washington been worried about this kind of behavior in the region?MR STRAYER: Sorry, in the --QUESTION: About this attacking - using in a blackout and digital attacks against their own citizens. Like in Russia, in Azerbaijan, we have heard, like, lot of social media activities, and activities have become aimed at that --MR STRAYER: Yeah, we --QUESTION: -- their profiles are being stolen or they're being attacked by government forces. Is this something in your scope and have you been raising these cases with the countries that have engaged in this kind of behavior?MR STRAYER: Absolutely, we're very concerned about any time that the internet is used or being manipulated in ways that restrict individuals' ability to speak or that interfere with their freedom of expression and their individual liberties. As you may know, when Iran recently caused the internet to be taken down for the availability of the public, we sanctioned their communications minister to show that we think that is the wrong type of thing to be doing. There is no legitimate reason for disabling the internet when it's an effort to interfere with people's ability to communicate.And so around the world we see that all the time. We don't - when we see that countries are seeking to use internet blackouts or restrictions as a way to suppress people's rights, we speak out against that.MODERATOR: All right. For our next question we'll go to New York and then we'll go to you.QUESTION: Hi, my name is Ali Cinar from Turk of America. During NATO Leaders Meeting in UK, secretary general also touched base on investment on cyber security. So is there any plan against mostly China? As an example, Huawei, since they invest and gain market share in some NATO countries, including Turkey. So we'd like to know, like, what's the role between NATO and U.S. on this issue? Thank you.MR STRAYER: So we continue to work closely with NATO and other institutions in Europe because we need to have secure communications capabilities, particularly when it relates to having the ability to do joint operations together and to do troop mobilization. So we continue to talk very closely with NATO as an institution, NATO countries about the importance of them having trusted technology vendors for their fifth generation of wireless technology.MODERATOR: Great. We'll go to here.QUESTION: Thank you for the briefing. My name is Yan Zhang from Initium Media, Hong Kong. I have a question about Huawei. So I heard Washington is trying to put some pressure on the foreign countries who use Huawei network. So can you confirm that, or is there any comments from you?MR STRAYER: So at the end of the day, we know that each country will make its own decisions about the security measures that it wants to have in place for the deployment of 5G technology - that is, the regulations it wants to have in place and the laws it will have in place. We're not seeking to put any other - any undue pressure on countries. We want to have an open dialogue at this point to share our security concerns, first of all, to understand the transformational nature and the tremendous benefits from 5G, but also understand that that also means that you need to have that technology secure because so much more is at stake than was previously at stake with regard to earlier generations of technology.So we're sharing our views about - that the supply chains need to be secured and that you can't just look at having technical tests done of the technology, that the ability to upgrade and update millions of lines of code at once is a whole new set of potential vulnerabilities to the network that need to be dealt with by only using trusted vendors - that is, vendors who are subject to a rule-of-law system and an independent judiciary. And we think it's also important to look at the trust related to the companies' long-term compliance with laws around the world, including corruption, intellectual property rights, as well as looking at the ownership of a company. Who is really in charge? Is there a role for something like the Chinese Communist Party in the company?We think that when you're not sure who's running the company, you can't really hold them accountable or know who's really calling the shots related to the security of your data.MODERATOR: All right. We'll go to the back and then to you.QUESTION: Hi, Mr. Strayer. Thank you for speaking to us. Ben Marks with NHK Japan Broadcasting. Earlier this week, Senator Tom Cotton introduced the bill that would prohibit the United States from sharing information with countries who use Huawei products - excuse me - in their 5G networks. I'd like to ask, is that something you think is necessary? And in your conversations with other countries, have you brought up that the United States might not be able to share intelligence with them if they use Huawei in their 5G network?MR STRAYER: Yeah, thanks for that question. As we talk to other countries, we're cognizant of the very robust information-sharing relationships that we have with many of them. That information-sharing relationship allows us to do military operations, allows us to do law enforcement operations, allows us to facilitate trade. We've told countries around the world that if we find it difficult to share information with them, it might impede that very robust relationship that we have of information sharing in these other vectors if we think it's subject to compromise with untrusted telecom vendors.So we're not saying that we're going to take any specific measure, but we will at least have to reassess how we're sharing information. We want to maintain that operational tempo of sharing information to facilitate all these important relationships and operations and cooperation that we have ongoing. We don't want to see that degraded by untrusted telecom vendors. So we're certainly sharing that with countries around the world.I can't specifically comment on any congressional legislation. That's something that would be decided by the entire interagency and the President, but I will say that there was something, a provision that passed into law at the end of last year that requires our Intelligence Community to at least assess the security of the communications infrastructure of countries that they're seeking to implement new agreements with. So there is some effort already underway along that line as a legal matter, but as I mentioned, we're talking to our partners about how we maintain our close relationships and not potentially degrading them because they're using untrusted telecom vendors.MODERATOR: Next to you, ma'am.QUESTION: Yeah, hi. Thanks for coming to Foreign Press Center. My name is Kanwal Abidi. I report for AZB Daily from Pakistani media. I have three questions if you are willing to allow me.In May 2018, a top DHS official, Christopher, wrote a letter to Senator Ron that nation's capital has a lot of surveillance devices. So what has State Department done about that?And like, a lot of time, New York Times have reported that President Trump's phone is not secure; Chinese spies listen to him. And so do you think - how - like, are you confident - like, what do you think about President Trump's cell phone being secure? How secure it is?And my third question is about Edward Snowden. On his website, Edward Snowden says that he - recently he has developed an app - Haven app, which he, like, refers to as, like, even police dogs can't sniff it. So do you think that Haven app is a threat to U.S. cybersecurity? And in June 2013, the - you know whatever happened, like, on the Russia airport - the U.S. Government seized his passport. So what is his current status of passport? Is he a - do you consider him to be an American? Is he a U.S. citizen? Thank you.MR STRAYER: Sorry, in the very first question, was that surveillance network in what city?QUESTION: Yeah - no - DHS official Christopher wrote a letter to Senator Ron Wyden that the nation capital has a lot of surveillance devices.MR STRAYER: Which nation? Is that the United States?QUESTION: Yeah, this - Washington, D.C. has lot of surveillance devices and spies and StingRays. So like what has State Department done on that?MR STRAYER: It's - that was a letter from --QUESTION: Christopher Krebs --MR STRAYER: Krebs.QUESTION: To Senator Ron.MR STRAYER: So --QUESTION: It's in - it's on --MR STRAYER: Yeah, and so I would just say I haven't read that letter and you'd have to talk to the Department of Homeland Security and Chris Krebs about that letter then. With regard to the President's cell phone communications, that's the responsibility of the Secret Service, and I'd have to refer you to them on that point.On whatever application that Edward Snowden's been ginning up, I can't really comment on it. I haven't seen the technology myself. He is a scofflaw from justice. Because of his actions, people died, so I think we take that matter very seriously and I can't comment on the status of his passport.QUESTION: Okay.MODERATOR: And with that, I think we're going to conclude our briefing. I want to thank Deputy Assistant Strayer and to you all for attending. Thank you.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6980624 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: January 13, 2020End of Document

Coronavirus leaves China virtually isolated after massive cancellation of flights of dozens of airlinesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 7, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 567 wordsBodyDozens of airlines have cancelled their flights to China due to coronavirus, which has already killed at least 637 people and 31,211 more are infected, leaving the Asian country virtually incommunicado with the rest of the world. Major carriers have decided to discontinue their connections to China's more than forty international airports, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu or Shenzen, the five with the highest traffic in passengers, they're practically empty these days. A simple Google search of some of these airfields and other also important ones such as those of Xian or Hangzhou confirms that they are at low minimum, as the search engine offers the real-time comparison between the usual turnout in those facilities and the Current.Numerous carriers, including Air France, KLM, Iberia, British Airways, Air Canada, Lufthansa, Swiss, Finnair, American Airlines, United Airlines, American Airlines and Delta, have suspended their flights to mainland China from the end of January to try to slow down spread of the virus. Others such as Japan Airlines no longer fly to Beijing or Shanghai, while the Japanese All Nippon Airlines also does not connect with China either. The Australian Qantas or new Zealanders also do not offer their usual service, as do others such as Korean Air, Philippine Airlines, Saudia, Air India, Egyptair or Kenya Airways.Those who continue to operate normally are Ethiopian Airlines flights, which through a statement have argued in recent hours that China is one of its "oldest and strongest markets" and have ensured that they have taken all necessary measures "to protect passengers and crews." On the other hand, Emirates and Etihad have cancelled some routes, but they are still flying normally to Beijing. Meanwhile, in Russia, all airlines have discontinued their connections to China except the national Aeroflot, which maintains its connections to Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, although all flights landing in Moscow from China are sent to a terminal separated at Sheremetyevo Airport.Chinese airlines such as China Eastern Airlines or China Southern Airlines continue to fly outside their country's borders, although many routes are affected due to the limitation of entry of travelers in countries such as the United States. Other smaller companies, mostly low cost, also operate to or from Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand, Vietnam or Laos.Airbus halts production line in TianjinAirbus has announced the temporary closure of its final A320 assembly line in Tianjin, China, due to the coronavirus outbreak in the country. The company explained that it is providing computer equipment to its Airbus China employees so that they "don't need to travel to work." It is not yet clear how closing will affect operations or when the installation will be reopened. The company says it is closely following the evolving situation of the coronavirus and the World Health Organization (WHO) travel councils that are affecting Airbus globally.The Tianjin factory, where some 600 people work, was stopping since the last week of January for the traditional New Year's holiday in China, but the European aeronautical manufacturer decided to extend the closure by following the slogans of the Chinese government. In Tianjin, in operation since 2008, single-aisle A320 family aircraft are assembled from parts arriving from other factories in Europe.Load-Date: February 26, 2020End of Document

HOW LONG CAN CHINA'S MASS QUARANTINE STAVE OFF A CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC?States News ServiceFebruary 5, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 692 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BOSTON, Mass. BodyThe following information was released by Northeastern University:The number of cases of novel coronavirus is growing rapidly in China, but the outbreak has largely been contained within the country, as a result of sweeping measures by the Chinese government.Can these measures continue to stave off the worldwide spread of the disease?Alex Vespignani is the Sternberg Family Distinguished University Professor of physics, computer science, and health sciences. Photo by Adam Glanzman/Northeastern University"We are all clinging to this hope that it can be contained in China," said Alessandro Vespignani , Sternberg Family Distinguished University Professor of physics, computer science, and health sciences. "They have done something that is so extraordinary that we still keep believing that there is some possibility to contain it."By Sunday, the number of confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in China had grown to 40,100, and the number of infections shows no signs of slowing down. More than 900 people have died.But the number of cases outside of China has risen in a trickle to more than 200 in at least 24 countries, and resulted, so far, in a single death. Chinese authorities have implemented travel restrictions and quarantines around several major areas to slow the spread of the disease."They isolated the largest bubble of infections," Vespignani said. "This is the largest mass quarantine or cordon that I have ever seen. 30 million people."Other countries, including Russia, Italy, Pakistan, Australia, and the U.S., have closed borders with China or refused to allow any visitors to enter that have come from, or passed through, China.These measures may be helping to slow the global spread of the disease, but they can't be kept in place forever, Vespignani told a large audience that attended a panel on Northeastern's Boston campus Wednesday convened to discuss the risks and concerns around the virus.International health officials have warned that closing borders can make it more difficult to move medical supplies, hinder data collection efforts, and disrupt economies."Both history teaches, and modeling, that you can't really stop a respiratory virus," said Wendy Parmet , Matthews Distinguished University Professor of law and the director of the Center for Health Policy and Law at Northeastern. "Maybe it buys some time, but it's very dangerous because it's easy to think of diseases as 'over there, them, we built a wallproblem solved.' And that's just not the way it works, especially with respiratory diseases."Countries need to be using any extra time to prepare for the virus, Parmet said, and to be assisting China.Wendy Parmet is Matthews Distinguished University Professor of law and the director of the Center for Health Policy and Law at Northeastern. Photo by Mary Knox Merrill/Northeastern UniversityBecause containing the disease to China won't be enough, if the epidemic doesn't decline there, Vespignani said."If there is no mitigation of the epidemic in China, the growth of the number of casesit's 1.5 billion people. You don't seal the country," Vespignani said. "At that point, you have to reopen the world and try a different approach."The key is disrupting the spread in the Hubei province, where Wuhan is located and where 80 percent of cases have occurred, Vespignani said. And while there is currently no vaccine or treatment for the disease, there are still things that can be done."When you isolate the person, you do prophylaxis, you do other kinds of interventions, you break this chain of transmission," Vespignani said. "Those are the things that everybody now is trying to do in China to contain the epidemic."Though the effort to head off a pandemic is centered in China now, Vespignani said that the rest of the world cannot close itself off forever."This is a global problem," Vespignani told the crowd. "This is humanity versus viruses and pathogens. It's a different war, and we have to be all united in this war."Northeastern University is actively monitoring the novel coronavirus outbreak.

House Ways & Means Committee Issues Testimony From MIT President ReifTargeted News ServiceFebruary 27, 2020 Thursday 7:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2067 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe House Ways and Means Committee issued the following testimony on Feb. 26 by L. Rafael Reif, president of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, at a hearing on U.S.-China trade and competition:I will focus my remarks on competition. My fundamental message is straightforward: Whatever else the U.S. does to counter the challenges posed by China, we must increase our investment in research in key technology areas, and we must enhance our capacity to get the most out of that investment. U.S. strategy is unlikely to succeed if it is merely defensive; to stay ahead, the U.S. needs to do more to capitalize on our own strengths.To understand the risk of failing to develop and implement such a strategy, one need look no further than the field of advanced communications, particularly 5G. The U.S. failed to invest adequately in this technology, and now we are having trouble catching up, ceding markets to Huawei and others, and fretting about the possible security consequences.We need to reorient our thinking to be sure that we do not underestimate China. Specifically, we should not lull ourselves into believing that China's rise is being fueled solely by stealth and subterfuge. Illicit and improper Chinese activities must be stopped, but we also need to recognize that China now has internal strengths in key fields, such as artificial intelligence (AI). China is making substantial investments in its own research and researchers, as well as in commercialization. The U.S. needs to plan accordingly.I believe our strategy needs to have three elements - first, a visible, focused and sustained research program targeted at technologies that are critical to future U.S. prosperity and security, like AI and quantum computing. Second, a concerted effort to ensure the U.S. has the talent we need to stay ahead. And third, policies to accelerate the U.S. capacity to get new ideas into the marketplace. Let me speak briefly about each of these.The U.S. has extraordinary research capability; we are home to most of the world's top research universities. That's why others want to steal our ideas. But our research system is not optimized for our current challenges, with other countries pouring money into select fields under programs like Made in China 2025.The Made in China 2025 program has a far broader scope than just research, but the Chinese government clearly sees research as a central element in becoming the world leader in key industries. In AI, for example, estimates of Chinese investment vary widely, but even the most conservative estimates find China at least at spending parity with the U.S. and committed to becoming a leader in the field.According to the National Science Board, overall Chinese spending on research and development (R&D) probably surpassed that of the U.S. in 2019 for the first time. That does not mean, by itself, that China's research is as good as ours or is effectively targeted, but it is a sign of trouble ahead, if we allow current trends to continue. And money is not the only disturbing indicator. A study last year of AI publications found that China is approaching parity with the U.S. in producing high-impact AI research papers. (China already surpasses the U.S. in the total number of AI papers.) Losing our technological lead would damage the U.S. militarily, as well as economically, since the military increasingly relies on technical advances in the commercial sector. Numerous studies have underscored this point, including, "Innovation and National Security: Keeping Our Edge," a report from a task force of the Council on Foreign Relations, in which I participated. (https://www.cfr.org/report/keeping-our-edge/).Simply put, federal research funding has fallen far behind what's needed to stay ahead of our competitors. Constraints on federal discretionary spending have made it impossible to invest at necessary levels. Federal non-defense R&D spending has hovered at between 10 and 12 percent of overall non-defense discretionary spending for more than 35 years, and it has declined as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product. When we felt most threatened by the Soviet Union in the early 1960s, that percentage peaked at about 25 percent.Spending figures underscore only part of the problem. The U.S. also lacks an effective, coordinated strategy to target research toward specific areas. To develop and implement such a strategy, it may be necessary to rethink how the U.S. research system is organized and focused.I just came from speaking at a National Academy of Sciences event organized to commemorate the 75th anniversary of Vannevar Bush's report, Science: The Endless Frontier, which is considered to be the founding document of the post-war U.S. science establishment. Bush, who ran U.S. scientific efforts during World War II, looked into the future and recognized that the federal role in research needed to change, if Americans were going to gain the full benefits of scientific advancement. Thanks largely to Bush, new science agencies were created after the war; existing agencies expanded and thrived. And that contributed to the postwar advances in U.S. prosperity, security and well-being.In a similar fashion, we need to think more about what kind of federal bureaucracy and policies are needed to meet today's needs and those of the future.. I believe a portion of federal research funding should be focused on addressing far-reaching questions in key technology fields, like AI. One promising proposal is to create a new directorate at the National Science Foundation with that mission - identifying key technologies and directing fundamental research to those areas - and giving that new unit the authority to be run more like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The directorate could provide funding to other agencies, as well as to universities and consortia involving industry.When witnesses were asked about this idea at a January 29 hearing of the House Science Committee, all responded positively. The witnesses were former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, National Science Board Chair Diane Souvaine and Chaouki Abdallah, the executive vice president for research at the Georgia Institute of Technology.I should emphasize that I am talking about fundamental research problems, not narrower applied research. An example would be creating AI algorithms that would enable machines to learn with less data. That fundamental advance would eliminate a Chinese advantage. Today, AI requires massive amounts of data, and that gives the Chinese an edge - both because they have a larger population and because they have fewer legal constraints. Take away the need for so much data, and that Chinese advantage vanishes. Working on such problems is different from just further perfecting the algorithms we have now. It's the kind of leap-frog research most likely to be done at universities.I know there is a growing recognition in Washington that more funding and more focus are needed to keep the U.S. ahead in key research areas. I have been delighted to see recent proposals from the Administration, and from members of both parties, on both sides of the Capitol, to increase U.S. research to advance our competitiveness. But so far this has not translated yet into real funding of the scale and scope that is needed, and funding should not come from making deep cuts in our existing scientific investments.To make research strides, the U.S. needs more than cash, it needs talented researchers. At the university level, that requires two parallel tasks -- attracting top U.S. students to key fields; and attracting and retaining the best researchers from around the world. The federal government should be offering scholarships, traineeships and fellowships aimed at drawing U.S. undergraduates, graduate students and post-docs into the fields where we need them most - the key technology areas I've been citing.But the U.S. has never succeeded solely with domestic talent; we need to reach beyond our borders. The vast majority of students who come to the U.S. for their doctorates in science and engineering remain here -- but we make that difficult, and the percentage who stay has been declining.The latest statistics from the National Science Board show that foreign students account for more than half the U.S. doctoral degrees in engineering, mathematics and computer science, with more than half of those foreign students coming from China, India and South Korea. This is not a new situation. What is new is that fewer of them are staying - although most still remain. NSF found that 84 percent of the doctoral students from China were still in the U.S. five years after receiving their degree. As I've said, we need to get more U.S.-born students into these fields, but even when we succeed at that, attracting and retaining top students from overseas will still be a necessity.To keep top talent, we need to look at changing both our policies and our rhetoric. The U.S. should be offering green cards as a matter of course to those who complete advanced studies in our country. We also need to understand that anti-immigrant rhetoric and widespread visa delays cause all students and researchers to consider taking their talents elsewhere. The federal government must appropriately vet those coming to our nation to avoid security risks, but that should not be done in a way that unduly deters those we want and need here.Leading in research is a necessary but not sufficient condition for prosperity and security. We also have to be the best and the fastest at translating ideas into products and processes. That's not something that can be accomplished by closing off our system - that just would shut down intellectual exchange that benefits us. We need instead to improve our ability to turn intellectual success into commercial success.China is becoming better than the U.S. at getting novel ideas into commerce. We cannot copy their means of doing that, which involve massive and probably wasteful government subsidies and indifference about intellectual property protection among Chinese companies, among other things. We need here, too, to capitalize on our own strengths, such as the U.S. ability to spin out companies from university labs. But more of those enterprises need to survive past infancy. That will require policy experimentation.Those experiments should be geared toward two related goals - finding additional ways to de-risk technology so it is ready for the marketplace, and making more U.S. capital available to support new ventures for long enough that they can thrive.The federal government could help foster through planning grants and pilot programs to answer questions like these: Do we need new legal entities to enable spin-off companies to stay more connected to campus for a longer period so the technology can mature to the point where it has more chance of success when venture capitalists back it? Do we need better training and mentorship so that technical people have the business acumen to get their companies through the "valley of death"? Do we need funds to help more entities like The Engine (https://www.engine.xyz/), which MIT has started to enable new companies to get access both to capital and technical expertise? Do we need supplements to research grants to enable researchers to start figuring out earlier how they would navigate the private sector? Those are just some possible approaches.This Committee may have a role to play because tax policies might be used to create more patient capital, which is needed to avoid killing promising ideas in the cradle. Could tax policies create incentives to encourage a longer-term perspective when funding new ventures? Could tax policies help make available additional U.S.-based capital for start-ups, so they don't have to look overseas for financing? Could tax incentives encourage new kinds of cooperation between universities and industry? These are the kinds of questions that need to be explored if competing with the China is truly a U.S. priority.The U.S. edge in science and technology has been a foundation for U.S. security, prosperity and quality of life. But that edge has to be regularly honed; it is not ours by right or by nature. We can best sharpen it with a strategy founded on confidence in ourselves, not fear of others.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7033563 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: February 27, 2020End of Document

Xinjiang: a genocide in the makingCommonwealth Times: Virginia Commonwealth UniversityJanuary 14, 2020 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: PRINT-EDITION; Pg. 1Length: 844 wordsBodyIllustration by Karly AndersenTagwa Shammet, Opinions EditorAs you start your first week of classes and get resituated into your college life, there is a genocide happening across the world. A genocide that isn't being discussed with the urgency it deserves. A genocide that is being silenced and hidden by its leaders. A genocide that holds an amplitude of ethnic cleansing and human rights violations. A genocide against Muslims.For the past two to three years, China has constructed a large network of detention camps - known as Xinjiang re-education camps - holding Muslims of the nation captive. BBC reported in November that Chinese authorities have rounded up hundreds of thousands of Muslims and placed them in these camps. These aren't just any camps: they're torture camps. Xinjiang camps were created under the demented ideology that Muslims are violent terrorists who need to be changed and purified. Chinese authorities seem to believe that by forcing these innocent civilians to denounce Islam, they will be denouncing their terrorist nature. I feel like this world has been singing this same "Islam promotes violence" song for as long as I can remember. I can speak for the entire Muslim community when I say we are genuinely fed up with this narrative. All true Muslims know that the religion promotes tranquility and unity. Peace and justice. Joy and humility. What it doesn't promote is: violence. Quite frankly, I don't necessarily care what others believe about my religion. However, it becomes hard to ignore the ignorance when my brothers and sisters are being eradicated in places like China. China blames Uighur Muslims for terrorist attacks in the early 2000s. Nearly 10% of Uighur Muslims have been rounded up and forced into these modern-day concentration camps, according to NBC News, because of this misconception. The Chinese Communist Party finds nothing wrong with their false claims of counterterrorism. While in these camps, Muslim captives are compelled to denounce their religion in the most horrific ways. Women are raped by their captors. Children are told to speak ill about Allah and Islam and sing hymns praising the very men and women holding them hostage. Many are made to eat pork. The Chinese Communist Party has even begun trying to change the Quran. If any captives do not oblige, they are killed.Who is promoting violence now?The Chinese government claims that Xinjiang camps are completely "voluntary." Right, because people "voluntarily" subject themselves to imprisonment, torture and cultural cleansing on a regular basis. If these camps are optional and elective, why are these internment camps operating outside of international legal grounds? Why are Muslims being captured and incarcerated without any trial? Well, a few weeks ago, data was leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists that detailed the reality of these camps. As expected, these leaked documents proved that China is brainwashing and culturally cleansing the Muslims of its nation. I'm wondering how I was able to find all of this information in the public, yet nothing has happened to stop China's modern-day genocide. Excuse my confusion, but how can the world just stay silent while China massacres an entire group of people? Let me answer my own question: It's because this group of people are all Muslim. The world has villainized the Muslim community so much, some of them might actually believe China's methods are defensible. Perhaps if the world stopped condemning innocent Muslims for the actions of radical extremists, they would be able to see that Muslims deplore those terrorists with the same swiftness as everyone else. Diplomats and world leaders have seen with their own eyes these gruesome violations of human rights, yet have quite literally done nothing to halt this catastrophe. These same leaders may have quietly condemned China but are unwilling to go public due to financial ties with China, according to the New York Times. Oh, how could I forget? People's lives and safety mean absolutely nothing in comparison to money. Who cares about a Muslim woman being kidnapped in front of her children, raped by multiple law enforcement officers and forced to abandon her religion and identity if the 1% is still making money, right? It is completely unacceptable that none of us have pushed this situation to media outlets more aggressively. It is unbelievable that we haven't twisted the arms of our government officials to get them involved. America is a powerhouse. We have more say in ending this genocide than we know. Since the Chinese government finds no error in their ways, it's on the rest of the world to make them aware. Every day those Muslims are kidnapped, tortured and killed, is on us. Until every Muslim is freed from Xinjiang, we are to blame for not doing enough. There is a difference between assimilation and eradication. China is not helping these Muslims adopt Chinese culture; they are expunging these Muslims' culture. And the world's leaders are staying completely silent. Load-Date: January 15, 2020End of Document

BOOZMAN CALLS SIGNING OF TRADE DEAL WITH CHINA A "PROMISING STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION"States News ServiceJanuary 15, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 501 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Arkansas Senator John Boozman:U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR) said the signing of the phase one deal marks a "promising step in the right direction" toward better trade relations with China.Boozman, who was among a select group of lawmakers invited to the White House for the signing ceremony, praised the efforts of the Trump administration to broker a mutually beneficial trade agreement with China."For far too long, China's one-sided trade practices have been harmful to American farmers, manufacturers and workers. President Trump set out to force a change in behavior and the phase one deal his team negotiated, when properly implemented and enforced, can achieve that goal. It is a promising step in the right direction," Boozman said.China has a long history of engaging in unfair trade practices. Among other things, the Chinese government has subsidized its steel and aluminum production, which resulted in vast global overcapacity; blocked U.S. agricultural products from entering its market; and imposed significant trade barriers to hurt American pharmaceutical companies. Its widespread theft of trade secrets and intellectual property has earned China the label of "the world's principal IP infringer."Under the terms of the agreement, China will purchase an additional $200 billion of U.S. goods and services over the next two years. The country will make structural reforms in the areas of intellectual property, technology transfer, agriculture, biotechnology, financial services and currency exchange. The agreement includes a dispute resolution system to ensure effective implementation and enforcement.The phase one deal has the potential to provide significant benefits to America's farmers and ranchers who have found themselves in the crosshairs of the U.S.-China trade dispute. By signing the agreement, China commits to buy at least $40 billion a year in U.S. farm products over the next two years and pledges to remove non-tariff barriers on a number of commodities, including American rice, poultry and beefall of which are staples of Arkansas's agriculture economy."Agriculture is Arkansas's number one industry and our farmers and ranchers have been subjected to China's unfair practices for too long. While work remains, China's commitment to increase the amount of American farm products it purchases, along with the removal of specific barriers to entering the Chinese market, should be seen as welcome developments for our agriculture community," Boozman said.Boozman highlighted the enforcement aspect of the phase one deal, saying it is the most important component to ensuring the agreement is truly mutually beneficial."The phase one deal with China, along with the US-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement and a new trade agreement with Japan, should help us build on the historic economic growth our nation has seen in recent years. The key to this deal's success will be ensuring China follows through on its promises," Boozman said.Load-Date: January 20, 2020End of Document

Iowa Caucus Chaos; Trapped in the Hot Zone; Tesla's Rise Tops Ford and GM; Trump to Deliver State of the Union; Iran Ending Ukraine Cooperation.MORNINGS WITH MARIA MORNINGS WITH MARIA 6:00 AM ESTFebruary 4, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; FinancialLength: 7495 wordsByline: Maria Bartiromo, Dagen McDowell, Cheryl Casone, Jack KeaneGuests: Lee Carter, Bob Nardelli, Stephanie Yang, Garrett Nelson, Mary Kate CaryBodyMARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR: And our top story this morning, the Iowa caucus still undetermined. The Iowa Democratic Party announcing last night that it is delaying the results, saying that there were inconsistencies in reporting. Party officials are blaming a new mobile app that was used to report results from each caucus site, saying in a statement this, we found inconsistencies in the reporting of three sets of results. This is simply a reporting issue. The app did not go down and this is not a hack or an intrusion. The underlying data and paper trail is sound and we'll simply take time to further report the results.Now, even though results were not in, some Democratic candidates were confident that the outcome will be strong.Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: So we don't know all the results. But we know by the time it's all said and done, Iowa, you have shocked the nation.By all indications, we are going on to New Hampshire victorious.SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I imagine -- have a strong feeling that at some point the results will be announced.And when those results are announced, I have a good feeling we're going to be good doing very, very well here in Iowa.JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Indications are (INAUDIBLE) indications going to close. We're going to walk out of here with a -- our share of delegates. We don't know exactly what it is yet, but we feel good about where we are. And, look, so -- so it's onto New Hampshire.SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Our union is stronger than Donald Trump. And in less than a year, our union will be stronger than ever when that one man is replaced by one very persistent woman.SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We know there's delays, but we know one thing, we are punching above our weight.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Officials have said they expect to release the results later today, but have not given a timeframe just yet.Joining the conversation is pollster and the president of Maslansky and Partners, author of "Persuasion," Lee Carter is here, Fox Business' Dagen McDowell, and former CEO of Home Depot and Chrysler, Bob Nardelli.Interesting developments this morning. I'm just going to stick my head out here for a second. I bet you Bernie is surging in Iowa and Biden is not. I'm just throwing that out there.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. I -- this was like a montage that a late night comedy show would do. It was hilarious. Joe Biden, we're going to leave Iowa with some votes.Pete Buttigieg admitting, we don't know all the results, but I'm claiming victory.BARTIROMO: Yes.LEE CARTER, POLLSTER AND PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS: Bernie Sanders, same thing.MCDOWELL: And --BARTIROMO: They're all winning.MCDOWELL: You, Iowa, you have shocked the nation. Actually, no, Iowa hasn't. We know that the Democratic Party, that these Democrats who complain and moan about election fraud, they can't even tally a vote in a - - in a state that is virtually irrelevant in the nominating process.This is the Chevy Vega of the electoral processes. Why is it still on the road?BARTIROMO: What happened?MCDOWELL: So you don't get a winner. You don't get promotion.CARTER: No.MCDOWELL: Promotion for a winner and then anybody who's a loser coming out of Iowa, it's like, we'll, let's just shove that one under the rug and we're going on to New Hampshire.BARTIROMO: Exactly.CARTER: Yes, it's totally a choose your own adventure story for these guys. They get to decide exactly what narrative they want to create coming out of -- out of Iowa.BARTIROMO: Yes.CARTER: It's unbelievable. If you think that Elizabeth Warren has been in Iowa for two years campaigning, more or less, and how insignificant that now seems because nobody's going to care what happened.Tonight's the State of the Union.BOB NARDELLI, FORMER HOME DEPOT CEO AND FORMER CHRYSLER CEO: Yes.CARTER: Tomorrow's the impeachment vote.BARTIROMO: Yes.CARTER: We're on to New Hampshire. There's a debate on Friday night. And this is going to be a big snore.BARTIROMO: But what we do know is the -- the leadership, the establishment in the Democratic Party does not want Bernie Sanders in the lead.NARDELLI: No.CARTER: Yes.BARTIROMO: They do not want him in the lead.My bet, he's in the lead in Iowa. We'll see. We'll see.NARDELLI: I would -- yes. It's amazing, you know, they couldn't blame the voting machine, so now it's an app, right?BARTIROMO: Yes.NARDELLI: Thank God we don't have that problem with the Super Bowl, right?BARTIROMO: Yes, we know.NARDELLI: Yes.BARTIROMO: All right, so --MCDOWELL: I know. I stayed up really late to see if Mahomes could pull it through and they just stopped playing with two minutes on the clock. I don't know who won. We'll find out some time in the middle of the afternoon.BARTIROMO: Well, right. We've got to find out sometime.CARTER: That's right.BARTIROMO: So later today they said that the results would be there. So -- so we'll see about that.NARDELLI: Got to be something.BARTIROMO: Some other stories that we're watching this morning, the coronavirus death toll is now at 425. More than 20,000 people are now sick. Hong Kong is reporting its first death as a result of coronavirus. The first patient diagnosed with the virus in the United States, meanwhile, is leaving a Washington state hospital, finishing his recovery at home. A couple from California, symptoms have worsened. They've been moved to a San Francisco hospital for treatment. And then thousands now are stranded on a Princess Cruise ship docked off on Japan. This boat on lockdown after it was revealed that an infected passenger spent a few days aboard.Meanwhile this, a surprise move by Google's parent Alphabet yesterday, revealing some financial information on some of its operations normally not broken out, marking the first time the technology giant has disclosed revenue results on things like YouTube and cloud computing. Operating income coming in at $9.3 billion at Google, much lower than the projected $9.9 billion in earnings. This is why the stock is down. This is the ninth time in 10 quarter that the company has missed on that metric according to Fact Set (ph). The stock is down, as you can see, better than 3 percent this morning.And then this news, sad news, talk show -- talk radio host, rather, Rush Limbaugh taking his audience by surprise yesterday with this news.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUSH LIMBAUGH, TALK RADIO HOST: I have been diagnosed with advanced lung cancer. I thought about trying to do this without anybody knowing because I don't like making things about me.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The 69-year-old saying that it was a difficult day because he knew the moment was coming. Limbaugh will be will be taking time off for treatment. And, of course, we wish him well.And 102 million people tuned in to watch the Chiefs defeat the 49ers in Super Bowl 54. That's 1.3 million more viewers than last year. This as the winners are back home for the Chiefs Kingdom Champion's Parade tomorrow. That will include a victory rally at Union Station in Kansas City, Missouri. Schools in the area are canceled, classes, so students and staff can attend to parade. And they -- should the president ask the Chief's Coach Andy Reid says, yes, he will celebrate the Super Bowl win with a trip to the White House.Well, he came out and said that. That was -- that was good. We'll see what happens if the president invites the Chiefs.MCDOWELL: And you remember the defensive tackle who was making the confetti angels on the field?CARTER: Yes.MCDOWELL: We have a story coming up that will warm everybody's heart. He's a -- from Virginia Beach, Virginia, and so hang on to that.NARDELLI: Yes. Yes, what a great --MCDOWELL: I'm teasing it.BARTIROMO: Yes. Like it.NARDELLI: Yes, it's great.You know, Troy Aikman said from the booth with Buck that, you know, six minutes, he said, this game's not over. You know, he has seen this young man perform before and it -- what an amazing -- what an amazing recovery.BARTIROMO: What -- it was great. I enjoyed it tremendously. I really did.CARTER: It was a great game.BARTIROMO: It was a great game.CARTER: I mean we've got to love it when that -- when those kinds of exciting ends happen, we -- unexpected happens. It's really nice to see it -- a new team rise.NARDELLI: A new team.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: I asked my daddy, I was like --BARTIROMO: First time in 50 years.MCDOWELL: Did you stay up late? He was like, uh, yes, I watched every minute. He was like, I knew what the Chiefs could do. I knew what Mahomes could. I wasn't turning that off.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: Two minutes. Let's do this.BARTIROMO: All right, we've got a lot getting -- to come to this morning. We are just getting started this morning. Coming up, Tesla is on a tear. Check this out. We are looking at the car company's value amid the state of the auto industry. And what happens next with the component shortages that are coming as a result of the shutdown because of coronavirus? I'm going to tell you what I'm hearing on that.And then campaigning for love. How some people use dating apps to stump for Elizabeth Warren.Plus this, Valentine's Day spending. Where consumers are putting their money now and why so many are celebrating their pets.That's all ahead.But first, coming up next, caucus craziness. We are breaking down what went wrong, why there's still no results coming out of Iowa this morning.Then, President Trump's third State of the Union tonight. We are talking to a former speech writer of George H.W. Bush on how to deliver the most successful speech. We look ahead to the president's State of the Union.Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Now the latest on the coronavirus outbreak. The death toll now stands at 427 with Hong Kong confirming its first death from this virus. There are now more than 20,000 confirmed cases across the world. Cities in the hot zone remain on lockdown.Joining me right now is "The Wall Street Journal" reporter Stephanie Yang.Now, Stephanie was on her way to Wuhan to report on the coronavirus when she got stuck -- she got stuck in Xiangyang about 186 miles outside of Wuhan. That city, of course, on lockdown. The roads are closed. No planes. No trains. She joins us now from a hotel where guests have been asked to stay and be quarantined.Stephanie, thank you so much for being here and telling us what's going on there.First off, what is life like in this hotel? Tell us what you've been faced with.STEPHANIE YANG, REPORTER, "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL": Sure. So it could definitely be worse. It's a pretty nice hotel. And luckily we have access to food. The staff's really nice.But, you know, kind of while we've been in quarantine, a lot of people across China have self -- been self-quarantining as well because a lot of people, you know, want to avoid going outside if they can help it. And, you know, the government has put out notices saying, you know, it's best if you stay indoors, stay away from people. A lot of public places have been shut down.BARTIROMO: So, staying away from people. Are you alone then? I mean tell us -- explain quarantine. Are -- have you interacted with anyone else? What's the feeling in the area in that hotel? Is there any panic?YANG: Right. No, less panic, more of a boredom really. So I'm here with my co-worker who is in the other room, although, you know, we generally tend to spend the days in the same room just to have some other human contact. Most recently we've been asked to stay within our own room, so we haven't seen any hotel guests recently.We used to, you know, kind of see people around when we first got here. And aside from that, our main contact with the outside world is, you know, looking outside the window. We can still see the street. So there are buses still running, but every day there are fewer and fewer cars and fewer and fewer people walking around.NARDELLI: Hey, Stephanie, Bob Nardelli here.You -- you've followed China for a long time and so what is your -- what's your take on this? You know, they've got the issue in Hong Kong. We've got the trade issue with China and now we have this virus. Is this a little crack in the administration over there and how do you see them, you know, handling this thing and coming back?YANG: Yes, it's -- I mean it's definitely going to be a really big challenge for them. I think it's the number one priority for everyone right now. And, you know, there's been a lot of analysis and speculation about how this will hurt China's economy, particularly, you know, happening along, you know, the lunar new year, which is traditionally a big time for spending and tourism and consumers. And now, you know, we're going to see that basically wiped out and a lot of people canceled travel plans, a lot of people, you know, staying at home and now, you know, with a lot of countries banning travelers who have been to China or to Hubei province recently, that's taking out another leg as well.BARTIROMO: So you have been on quarantine for nine days. Once the 14-day period is over, do you think you'll be able to get out of the region? And, also, do you feel that you have enough food and things that you need in the hotel?YANG: Yes, food -- food really hasn't been a problem. When we first got here, we could also still order delivery, but more and more shops are shutting down and the delivery fees are getting more and more expensive because there are less people willing to go out on the road.And, you know, as far as the 14-day quarantine goes, that is kind of the set period that people have put for, you know, the incubation for the virus. Unfortunately, after the 14 days are up, it's still certain whether the city is going to be on lockdown. So even if we can, you know, leave the room, leave the hotel, walk around, they're really encouraging people not to do that right now. And if the trains and planes and cars are still not able to get out, then we don't really have another option.CARTER: Stephanie, I'm curious, what is the messaging like over there? A lot of -- it's hard for us to imagine what it's like because we have information so free flowing. How -- how easy is it to get information? How reassuring is it? What kind of things are you hearing directly from the Chinese government there?YANG: Right. So I think that there was, you know, a lot of confusion and maybe, you know, mistrust at the very beginning of this. So I actually was in Wuhan at -- at the start of the year, around January 7th and 8th, and we actually walked around the market where it was closed, you know, the original outbreak site of the new coronavirus. And the idea that we got just from talking to people is they were very blase, very nonchalant. Like, no one thought this was anything really to be worried about.And so when the cases started climbing dramatically, and, you know, we learned that it could be transmitted human to human, you know, that sent a lot of people scrambling for supplies, really panicked, not wanting to go outside, stocking up on masks and things like that.Now we have, you know, the daily confirmed case count, the daily death count and it seems like there is more information out there. You know, other countries have been saying China is starting to share more information with us. So it seems like it's going in that direction as they try and get this under control.MCDOWELL: Stephanie, it's Dagen McDowell.Can you speak to the U.S. relationship with China after the inking of the phase one trade deal? You would seem to think it was better. But there's been a real fight about allowing the United States to come into the country and help with this coronavirus outbreak that the -- China has conceded to allowing some U.S. officials from our health agencies on that World Health Organization team to study the coronavirus.But, again, the WHO and China critical of our administration's, the Trump administration's, decision to ban foreign nationals from entering the United States if they had recently traveled to China. So, again, if you want help from kind of one of the biggest nations in the country, they're finally kind of begrudgingly accepting it.YANG: Yes, you know, I can't really speak to the relationship post signing of the trade deal and I know that the government has not been particularly happy with -- and China has not been particularly happy with, you know, these decision to ban travelers and saying that that's, you know, not really the right move. But, you know, aside from that, I don't actually know, you know, the inner workings of that relationship or where that's actually going to -- even going to go from there.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, the broader point is, I mean I'm hearing that the Chinese will not allow the CDC in. They will not allow the CDC in to properly investigate how significant, how deep the problem is. We know that, you know, some local officials in China knew about coronavirus back in December. On December 9th there was a local -- a local leader arrested. So he knew -- this was December 9th. And then, of course, in January we know that the Chinese delegation made a trip to the White House and shook everybody's hands for the Chinese signing to have phase one deal. That was on January 15th. And then China sent the largest delegation ever sent to Davos at the end of January, but they knew it in December.So I guess my -- my question is, can we trust the information coming out of China and what are Chinese officials saying there? Are they updating citizens? Are -- is the media -- do you think you're getting the right information from the media right there when you're on the ground?YANG: Yes, I think -- I think generally the agreement is that the attitude towards the virus at the very start was to cavalier, but now the messaging from the government is saying, you know, we're doing everything we can. We have it under control. And that's what they really want to put out there is that --BARTIROMO: Would you --YANG: We can -- we can take care of this.BARTIROMO: Would you like to see the CDC come in there and investigate the way the American Center for Disease Control would ordinarily do it? I mean do you think people would like to see the CDC come in there?YANG: I really --BARTIROMO: You don't know. Yes. Well, you're -- well no, you're --YANG: I don't actually have an opinion about that.BARTIROMO: You don't have an opinion. Of course, you are in China. We are sending you our best wishes. Stephanie. Thank you very much for weighing in.YANG: Yes.BARTIROMO: And we will check back soon. Stephanie Yang.YANG: Great. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Stay secure. Stay safe.Later on I want to ask you, Bob, because you're a car guy, you understand this better than most, what about parts shortages, component shortages. I was on the phone with somebody last night who said to me, we're going to see bottlenecks in the supply chain. We're going to see companies in America face massive shortages. It's going to lead to inflation. This ripples through the economy.NARDELLI: Big time.BARTIROMO: Yes.NARDELLI: Big time. It's going to impact their economic output for the quarter.BARTIROMO: Yes.NARDELLI: And it's going to affect us big time. We'll talk --BARTIROMO: All right, let's talk about that coming up --NARDELLI: Yes.BARTIROMO: Because this is an important point, that certainly hits right home to the earnings story and the economic story in the U.S.NARDELLI: Yes.BARTIROMO: Not to mention the health story.We're going to take a break. When we come back, Tesla is on a tear. Check out this stock. The company giving some American highway icons a run for their money.And then "Hamilton" on the silver screen. Disney's new plans with creator Lin-Manuel Miranda to bring the hit musical into your home.We are back right after this break.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.We are focused on automakers this morning. Tesla shares are surging since the start of the year, up, get this, 84 percent higher since the start of the year. The market cap hitting $140 billion, placing the Silicon Valley company in a valuation higher than Ford and General Motors combined.Joining us right now is CFRA research senior equity analyst Garrett Nelson.Garrett, it's good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.Wow, what a performance. Is this year to date or over the last year? The stock hit a new high yesterday, but you have a sell rating on Tesla. Is that valuation or something else?GARRETT NELSON, RESEARCH SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, CFRA: Sure, Maria. Well, thanks for having me.So we just recently went to a sell a few weeks ago and it, you know, it got to a point where the valuation was just very stretched and frothy. And, you know, at this point, Tesla's market cap exceed every global automaker with the exception of Toyota. Most recently it passed Volkswagen. And Volkswagen, last year, had 30 times the vehicle sales that Tesla had. So, you know, we think the market is giving the company plenty of credit for future growth, which hasn't happened yet. And that really raises execution risk here. So our 12 month price target is $440. We think, you know, a lot of the recent run in the stock has been due to short covering and it's overdue for a pullback.NARDELLI: Hey, Garrett, Bob Nardelli here.You've followed the auto industry for quite some time and I know when I was running Chrysler and so forth. I'm just -- I'm just aghast at the stock price for Tesla. You know, we just finished up a round of global auto shows. All of the competition has introduced their version of the electric vehicle. The consumer is still hesitant in many cases. You know, we're not seeing more than 1 to 2 percent of sales in electric vehicle. I just don't understand, you know, you mentioned the run-up on this thing and possibly the pullback to 40. What's your view of the overall market for electric vehicles?NELSON: So that's one of the biggest headwinds we see for Tesla is, we're expecting close to 20 new electric vehicle models to debut in the U.S. in 2020. So they're going to have a whole lot more competition than they've had in recent years. And a lot of those models are coming very soon. During the big game the other night, you saw a few commercials for new models which are coming out, namely the Ford Mustang Mach-E, the Porsche Taycan, and the Audi e-tron. We expect all of those models to sell very well. So, you know, Tesla is going to have a lot of competition.The other thing people aren't looking at is Tesla's federal tax credit on electric vehicles, which was previously $7,500 is now zero. And all these other -- most of these other electric vehicles will be eligible for the full $7,500 tax credit here in the U.S. So we think that gives those vehicles a competitive advantage.BARTIROMO: Let me ask -- no, go ahead.MCDOWELL: We talk about -- I just -- I have talked about these cars. The Mustang, the Taycan, because Porsche knows how to do high performance. Ford is the car for your every man and your every woman. They're installing charging stations even in rural parts of this country. The dealers are ready to sell this. They sell out the first -- sold out the first tranche of the Ford Mustang. This is, again, if you've got to make a trade, and I'm asking you this, do you look at the old school automakers, you go long them, and do you short Tesla?NELSON: Well, I'm sure there pare (ph) trades there. You know, the other automakers that we follow are the three big -- the Detroit three, GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler. We have a hold on all three of those and we have a sell on Tesla. But, you know, certainly there's compelling traits about both, you know, Ford and Fiat Chrysler, in our view. With Ford, that stock is yielding over 6 percent here.BARTIROMO: Wow.NELSON: Very compelling dividend yield.BARTIROMO: That's a nice dividend, yes.NELSON: So we think there is some value in those areas. We're just a little reluctant because we don't' see a near term catalyst here.BARTIROMO: Garrett, we've got to jump, but, real quick, let me ask you, since you're an auto analyst, what your take is on the shutdown in -- of all the factories in and around Wuhan in China? Are you worried that we're going to see component shortages? And it's not just the auto companies, but also technology companies, devices, et cetera. I mean no flights from Delta flying in until spring. A number of other airlines, no flights in and out. Bottlenecks in the supply chain is a worry out there. That leads to inflation.So what's your take in terms of car companies facing shortages of certain components that are needed in those cars as a result of the shutdown in factories in China?NELSON: Sure. So that's a major concern and we're really just seeing the tip of the iceberg. It really depends on how long this coronavirus goes on. But right now, you know, global auto demand is fairly soft. It's been down for two straight years. And we think inventories are comfortable right now.But, you know, if this goes on for an extended period of time, of weeks to months, I think you will probably see some shortages.BARTIROMO: OK. We will leave it there.Garrett, it's good to have you input. Thanks so much.NELSON: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Garrett Nelson joining us.And that component shortage leads to earnings misses. That's why it's important for the market certainly.Coming up, a luxurious deal. Details on Tiffany. Special stockholder meeting to discuss its merger with LVMH.And then President Trump delivering his State of the Union tonight. I'll be speaking with a former speech writer for George H.W. Bush about the annual address. Don't miss it.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, February 4th.Your top stories right now, 6:33 a.m. on the East Coast.Markets are higher this morning. Check out this powerful rally we've got going on this morning. We're expecting a gain of 300 points right out of the gate for the Dow Jones Industrial average, better than 1 percent. The Nasdaq's up 115 and the S&P is up 36. This after a pretty good rebound yesterday following last week's selloff. Yesterday at the close, the Dow was up 144 points, half a percent. The Nasdaq was up 122 and the S&P was up 23.Global markets this morning also looking at green across the board. European indices higher. FT 100 up 141 points. That's almost 2 percent.

Democratic officials blaming inconsistencies in reporting for a delay in announcing the caucus winner in Iowa. An app made by a company called Shadow was used for the first time to report results but it didn't work properly and that has delayed the tally. Officials say it was not a hack. They're confident the results will be counted accurately. We should get those results later today.Well, the Los Angeles Fire Department releasing 911 calls made right after Kobe Bryant's helicopter crashed.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A helicopter crashed into a mountain.

Disney reportedly paid show creator and star Lin-Manuel Miranda $75 million for the rights. This could be the most expensive acquisition ever. The movie going to be an actual performance by the original Broadway cast. Actually, they filmed three of those performance, guys, three years ago. It's coming out October 2021. So if you couldn't afford the $500 ticket, Maria, go see the movie in 2021. There you go. Although I know you saw it and so did I. But, anyway.BARTIROMO: Yes. That's a good idea.Cheryl, thank you.CASONE: You bet.BARTIROMO: Countdown to the State of the Union, meanwhile. President Trump set to promote the great American comeback during the annual speech tonight, touting a strong economy and an even stronger nation ahead of his expected impeachment acquittal. That's expected tomorrow. The president is expected to use the address to relaunch his 2020 campaign, but he will most likely not mention impeachment.Joining us right now is former White House speech writer for President George H.W. Bush, Mary Kate Cary.Mary Kate, it's good to have you this morning. Thanks so much for being here.MARY KATE CARY, FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH SPEECHWRITER: Thanks for having me back.BARTIROMO: Probably a good idea not to mention impeachment in the State of the Union, or is that the elephant in the room that he has to mention it?CARY: If I were advising him, Maria, I would tell him, say away from it with a 10 foot pole. Take Michelle Obama's advice, when they go low, we go high. And it's just too close to the vote for him to be ad-libbing or, you know, if he sees Adam Schiff, he should not respond to him. He's got a great story to tell in terms of all his accomplishments, his agenda going forward. And if I were advising him, I'd say stick with that and just act like it's no big deal.CARTER: You know, the State of the Union has been some of President Trump's actually finest moments. The -- when I've tested his speeches with voters, when he sticks to the script, when he makes his point, when he tells his story, because a lot of people don't know the full story of what he does, that's when he wins.Now, as you're saying, you'd advise him not to go off script here, not to talk about impeachment, not to go low. Sometimes we know that the president can't avoid that. How would you, if you're writing for him, how would you try to make sure that he stays exactly what you would recommend that he do?CARY: Well, you know, if you look back, the last three State of the Unions that he's done, you know, joint session address and two State of the Unions, he did stick to the script. And so he knows to do that in that situation.The -- last weekend, I think it was Thursday or Friday night, he had a big rally. That's when he goes off script and ad-libs and, you know, throws the teleprompter to the side. So I think they've gotten him to a point now where he realizes that's what's appropriate in this situation.He also likes to give a long speech, as we all know. Last year's was the longest in -- third longest, excuse me, in State of the Union history at 82 minutes. When Bill Clinton was at the height of his impeachment, he went 78 minutes. So there -- it seems to be part of the strategies, to give a long one if you're under impeachment.But I think he'll stay to the script. I think they're writing for him that way now for these speeches and he responds well to that and does well with the public.MCDOWELL: What about the body language and how Nancy Pelosi behaves? Again, you're impeached forever. So I -- what are we expected to see from her? Some of the -- some of the Democrats aren't going to show up as they -- as they, you know, sicked out last year, decided not to go. But she has to be there. What about her body language?CARY: Well, if you recall, she did that move last year that I would now call baby shark move.BARTIROMO: Yes.CARY: Where she was clapping back at him.BARTIROMO: Oh, yes.CARY: And -- but most of the time he'll have his back to her and he may not see what's going on behind him. The other thing that could add to the sort of chaos is, if you remember last year, a lot of the woman wore white for the suffragettes (ph) --BARTIROMO: Yes.CARY: But this year is actually the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th amendment. So we may see some of the women doing something like that again. They've already started announcing --BARTIROMO: I bet you they wear black. I bet you they will wear black.CARY: They might. They might. And they're also starting to announce now all their guests that they're bringing. I think somebody's bringing a Harvey Weinstein accuser. There could be all kinds of stuff going on with the guests in the gallery and people taking selfies on the floor with their guests, things like that.So this is sort of a speech writer's idea of a good time, you know. This is a -- this is the fun part of speech writing is, watch all the stuff that goes on, the shameless applause lines, you know, who's reacting on Twitter. It's fun. It's a fun night.BARTIROMO: Well, I -- probably "The New York Times" has it all written already on -- on Wednesday, you know, under a cloud of -- you know, uncertainty, the president delivers a State of the Union. I mean that's what Steve Bannon said the other day and I -- and I do think that there's something to that.CARY: Yes. I think that's right.MCDOWELL: And the toadys (ph) and the foot lickers who are clapping for the president, you can see the headlines now.BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly.CARY: Oh, yes. Oh, yes.BARTIROMO: Mary Kate, good to talk with you. Thanks so much.CARY: Thanks so much.BARTIROMO: Mary Kate Cary.Fox Business will carry the special coverage of President Trump's State of the Union live tonight. It starts at 8:00 p.m. Eastern. Don't miss us. We've got all hands on deck tonight as we cover the State of the Union.Meanwhile, coming up, Google is under pressure this morning. The technology giant disappointed on its advertising business, giving details on its YouTube business for the first time ever. We'll talk about that. The stock is down 3 percent this morning.Then, campaigning for love. Some people using dating apps to stump for Elizabeth Warren. Your morning buzz coming up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Iran-Ukraine tensions are intensifying. Tehran ending its cooperation with the country after leaked audio suggested that Iran knew it had downed a Ukrainian passenger jet last month. The audio is an exchange between an air traffic controller and an Iranian pilot who saw a flash in the sky that night thinking it was a missile.Joining us right now is Fox News senior strategic analyst, retired General Jack Keane.Sir, it's good to see you this morning. General, thank you so much for being here.GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: Yes, good to see you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Your reaction to all of this?KEANE: Well, this is kind of the Iran pathology here. I mean in the face of exposure that the -- obviously people in control knew that there was a -- what had happened, that this airliner had been shot down. Here's one of their own pilots reporting as such almost immediately as it's happening. He thinks he may be flying into a hot zone and that's why he's requesting clarification as to what's going on in terms of his own airplane being threatened.And now, because the Ukrainians put it on TV, the Iranians are shutting down cooperation with them. They've already impacted rather severely on this cooperation anyway, Maria, because they refused to give over the black box to the Iranians -- to the Ukrainians who are conducting the investigation for a number of weeks now.BARTIROMO: Yes.KEANE: But this is the Iranian playbook. This is -- this is not a transparent regime, as we are painfully aware of. They're not going to tell the truth. And if they can -- and if they can avoid dealing with adversity and exposure like this, they'll take that path every time.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, bottom line, they don't want to be questioned about it. That's it, right?KEANE: Yes. Yes, there's no doubt about it. I mean it points up to the obvious exchange here with one of their own pilots who's on approach to their international airport, why is that airport open? I mean the Iranians conducted the strike, so they knew that there's potential for a retaliation and why keep that airport open with airplanes flying. And, obviously, one of their missiles batteries made a horrific mistake, likely under some sense of pressure and fear --BARTIROMO: Right.KEANE: And mistaken an airliner for an incoming aircraft that would do damage to that missile battery.BARTIROMO: Right. Well, we'll watch that.Let me turn to Afghanistan, America's longest war. Taliban attacks in the last three months of 2019 higher than the same period in previous years. So since the U.S. started tracking this data in 2010 is the last time we saw this kind of activity. This is according to a new report.General, what would be the best outcome for the United States at this point as the U.S. holds peace talks with the Taliban now?KEANE: Well, I'm not very hopeful about peace talks with the Taliban because what has to happen is peace talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government. I think where we're at, Maria, is, we're likely to keep our forces there for the foreseeable future. It's the right call because Afghanistan, as a place in the world, for potential safe havens for al Qaeda and ISIS that threaten the United States still poses a security problems to the American people. We should take some credit that they've never been able to reattack us again because of our presence there. I know we're all frustrated by the length of time it's taken to resolve this situation. But we're not going to get something, I think, out of the Taliban now.The Taliban clearly what they want to do is get the United States out of there and topple the government and take the country over. They have never, ever given up on that objective for 18 years. That's a fact and I can -- I can speak with authority on that's where the Taliban leadership is today.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, I wouldn't so easily trust these talks either. But how is the president's Middle East peace plan playing out?KEANE: Well, I think the peace plan certainly for the president is -- I think he's completely on the mark. Objective one, contain Iran, change the policies of appeasement to confrontation and that, in my judgment, is working and eventually we'll see the Iranians come back to some kind of negotiated settlement, which will be much better than what Obama had fashioned with them.Objective number two is contain radical Islamists, particularly ISIS, make certain that there's no re-emergence of that organization and -- where they marauded over the people in the Middle East and became an iconic organization, transmitting their brutality on the Internet, which we've all seen. We don't want a repeat of that. The president's got his -- the troops have got the foot on the throat of ISIS in the region --BARTIROMO: Yes.KEANE: In both Iraq and in Syria. And when it comes to Afghanistan, we want a stable Afghanistan, move that government in the right position and don't let the radicals take over.BARTIROMO: General, thank you. Very important insights from you this morning, as always.Good to see you, sir.KEANE: Yes, good seeing you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. General Jack Keane.Coming up, Valentine's Day is coming. We're looking at the spending around it where consumers are putting their cash. Many opening their wallets for their pets. This morning's buzz is next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.It is time for the morning buzz.First up, using dating apps, but not to meet a new partner. Turns out that there are women who are going on Tinder to campaign for Elizabeth Warren.Lee, this is a whole new ballgame. This is a whole new level here.CARTER: Can you imagine how in effective this is. These poor guys are going to show up, meet these women, think they're having a date. And instead of a date, they're finding out it's somebody with a boyfriend trying to get them to vote for Elizabeth Warren.BARTIROMO: Well, yes.CARTER: I don't think this is smart.BARTIROMO: No.CARTER: Swipe left or whichever way it is. Say no.BARTIROMO: Swipe --CARTER: Just say no.BARTIROMO: How about this, celebrating the Super Bowl win with a good deed. A defensive tackle for the Chiefs has paid off adoption fees for every single adoptable dog at all of the KC Pet Project locations.I think this is what you were talking about earlier in the hour, Dagen, and this is a really good, feel-good story and I know we both are saying, yeah, go Chiefs for doing that.MCDOWELL: So you know who this was. So this is a defensive tackle Derrick Nnadi, who's from Virginia Beach, Virginia, originally. And he was the man doing the confetti angels --CARTER: Love him.MCDOWELL: On the -- on the -- on the field. And I just think that this is the best thing you can do. Somebody who's using his profile as a Super Bowl champion to make sure that these animals find homes.CARTER: Love it.MCDOWELL: Two thousand adoptable dogs and cats every day are euthanized in the country. So go rescue an animal.BARTIROMO: That's right, like we did.MCDOWELL: Yes.CARTER: Yes.BARTIROMO: And, by the way, Dusty's birthday is next week. I took her in. There she is, my little girl. I took her in on February 13th last year. She loves New York. Who would -- who would dump this bundle of joy on the streets of Dallas homeless? I mean, come on. And that's what they did to her.CARTER: Oh, the best.BARTIROMO: She loves her new home in New York. She's been with us a year. My little girl is going to have a birthday next week.MCDOWELL: Charlie's is -- his adoption anniversary is coming up in March of this year.BARTIROMO: There he is.MCDOWELL: There's Charlie and Ramon.BARTIROMO: There's Charlie and Ramon.MCDOWELL: They're both -- Charlie is -- Ramon has completely lost his hearing. Has a cataract in one eye.BARTIROMO: Awe.MCDOWELL: He's 15 and we love him. So, there's Charlie's new haircut.BARTIROMO: I like it.MCDOWELL: Charlie got a --CARTER: Sweet.MCDOWELL: Charlie got a haircut.BARTIROMO: Good haircut.MCDOWELL: Uncle Puppy Chris gave him a haircut when he was on his sleepover date during the Super Bowl. So --BARTIROMO: Well, how -- that they -- they both look gorgeous, Charlie and Ramon.How about this, it's more than poppy love. According to the National Retail Federation, 27 percent of people say they will buy Valentine's gifts to their pets. I will. A total of $1.7 billion, Bob. This is big money.NARDELLI: It is big money. You know, from a retail standpoint, we were always trying to get into the pet category. It is -- it's growing phenomenally.BARTIROMO: At Home Depot?NARDELLI: Yes, at Home Depot. And you look at all these others. It's -- again, it's one of the fastest growing segments in retail.Now, as the only guy on the panel here, I want to send my love to all my pets too. I mean we've got four dogs. We've got parrots.CARTER: Amen.MCDOWELL: Four?NARDELLI: We've got --BARTIROMO: Why don't you send us pictures of them? We would have shown your dogs.NARDELLI: My boys got them in Los Angeles, Belle and Lilly. Yes, I mean, it's -- they're a great -- they're a perfect part of our lives.BARTIROMO: Belle and Lilly.NARDELLI: We love them. Yes.BARTIROMO: Kisses to Belle and Lilly.MCDOWELL: Because you got Dusty from Petco?BARTIROMO: Yes, I did, Petco Foundation, yes.MCDOWELL: There is not -- it is brilliant what Petco does here in New York. So they have an adoption truck from -- I think it's one of the -- the Long Island rescue organizations. They have an adoption truck outside --BARTIROMO: It's so cute.MCDOWELL: Of the Petco on Union Square. And you will see lines of people literally buying five to ten thousand dollars' worth of dog stuff. The crates. The dog beds.BARTIROMO: Yes. Oh, they have so much stuff, absolutely.MCDOWELL: Yes. So, it is -- it's brilliant marketing and it saves lives, it saves animal's lives.BARTIROMO: Thank you Petco Foundation, Suzanne Cogut (ph), for finding my baby Dusty for me.Coming up, caucus craziness.

"A very important day for Colima and for Mexico with the departure of the first shipment of bananas in which 39 tons of bananas from Tabasco and Chiapas will be exported," he wrote.Mexico, according to official government data, is the twelfth banana producer in the world, with a production volume of 2.7 million tonnes per year.30% of these bananas go to 43 countries for export, with China, and the main customer is the United States.Mexico's agri-food exports reached $34,619 million in the first eleven months of 2019, an increase of 8.61% compared to the same period of the previous year, according to the Sader. *Source: https://www.economiahoy.mx/Load-Date: February 26, 2020End of Document

Breaking: Department of Education Launches Probe into Harvard's Foreign FundingThe Harvard Crimson: Harvard UniversityFebruary 12, 2020 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: UNIVERSITY NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 514 wordsBodyThe United States Department of Education has opened an investigation into Harvard over funding allegedly solicited from foreign governments.In a February 11 letter to Harvard, Department of Education officials asked the University to disclose information about contracts or gifts connected to the governments of China, Iran, Russia, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia, the Wall Street Journal first reported Wednesday afternoon.The Education Department also requested that the University disclose any records related to two Chinese telecommunications companies, Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp.; two Russian organizations, the Kaspersky Lab and Skolkovo Foundation; Iran's Alavi Foundation; and other organizations.University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.The letter to Harvard comes as part of an ongoing review by the federal government of American universities' connections to foreign governments.Federal officials have alleged schools are soliciting money from hostile foreign governments, companies, and individuals, potentially attempting to steal American universities' research. Thus far, the investigation has found that universities across the country have failed to properly report $6.5 billion in foreign funding, according to the Journal.In response to the crackdown, last fall, Harvard administrators announced the University had created two new oversight committees to prevent University researchers from taking such actions, which are known colloquially as "academic espionage."In January, Harvard Chemistry department chair Charles M. Lieber was arrested and charged with failing to disclose funding he received from the Chinese government.Federal officials are also investigating Yale University over allegations that the school did not disclose at least $375 million in foreign funding. Yale filed no reports between 2014 and 2017, according to the Journal. .css-12m1k7q{display:block;margin:0px auto;width:100%;max-width:100%;background:transparent;padding:10px 0px;}.css-12m1k7q .ad-tag{font-family:'Colaborate Light','Lucida Sans Unicode',sans-serif;color:#333333;text-align:center;font-size:0.7em;text-transform:uppercase;display:block;}.css-12m1k7q .ad-body{width:-webkit-fit-content;width:-moz-fit-content;width:fit-content;margin:0px auto;text-align:center;}AdvertisementThe Education Department can take the case to the Department of Justice to levy civil or criminal charges if the schools do not turn over the information.For over 30 years, the U.S. Department of Education has collected reports of contracts or gifts to American colleges from foreign sources valued at over $250,000 a year.-Staff writer Ellen M.

Mark Warner, D-Virginia, issued the following statement:U.S. Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-VA), Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and co-chair of the Senate Cybersecurity Caucus, issued the following statement after federal prosecutors charged four Chinese intelligence officers with hacking Equifax in one of the largest data breaches in history:"I'm glad the DOJ has moved to formally indict the Chinese intelligence officers associated with the hack of Equifax. For years, the Chinese government has targeted western commercial firms. It is disappointing that despite a lot of rhetoric President Trump's recent agreement with China does nothing to address this specific issue."That said, the indictment does not detract from the myriad of vulnerabilities and process deficiencies that we saw in Equifax's systems and response to the hack. A company in the business of collecting and retaining massive amounts of Americans' sensitive personal information must act with the utmost care - and face any consequences that arise from that failure. The legislation I have with Senator Warren would subject data brokers to a higher standard of care and is an important first step in data protection."Sen. Warner has been outspoken about the importance of protecting consumers from data theft by employing adequate cybersecurity practices. He has previously introduced legislation to hold large credit reporting agencies - including Equifax - accountable for data breaches involving sensitive consumer data.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7015479 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: February 11, 2020End of Document

REGULATION, TRANSPARENCY AND SCRUTINY KEY TO COUNTERING CHINA'S FOREIGN MEDIA CAMPAIGNS: REPORTStates News ServiceJanuary 15, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 780 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:By Joshua LipesPolicymakers in democratic nations should tighten broadcasting regulations, while increasing transparency and subjecting Chinese entities to greater scrutiny to counter the negative impact of Beijing's foreign media influence campaigns, a media watchdog said in a report Wednesday.Since 2017, leaders from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) have accelerated a decade-long expansion in the regime's ability to shape narratives about China around the world, Washington-based Freedom House said in its report "Beijing's Global Megaphone," with the use of what it called "new and more brazen tactics" by Chinese diplomats, state-owned news outlets, and CCP proxies.In a press release accompanying the report, Freedom House senior research analyst Sarah Cook said that Chinese state media content now reaches hundreds of millions of television viewers, radio listeners, and social media users abroad, "in many cases without transparency as to its origins."At the same time, she said, journalists, news consumers, and advertisers around the world are increasingly being subjected to intimidation or censorship of political content that the CCP does not want them to engage with."Beijing's media influence not only distorts the information environment in the affected settings, it also undermines international norms and fundamental features of democratic governance, including transparency, the rule of law, and fair competition," Cook said.According to Freedom House, tactics employed by the CCP combine widely accepted forms of public diplomacy with covert activities that undermine democratic norms, impact national sovereignty, weaken the financial sustainability of independent media, and violate local laws.Freedom House's report specifically points to Beijing's use of social media disinformation campaigns, efforts to influence mainstream media, and attempts to control countries' information infrastructure through Chinese tech firms building and acquiring content-dissemination platforms.Additionally, the report said, the CCP pushes politicized content favoring pro-Beijing narratives and exports its model of influence to other countries by training foreign personnel and transferring technology to foreign state-owned media outlets."Chinese state media, government officials, and affiliated companies are achieving increased influence over key nodes in the global information flow, exploiting the more sophisticated technological environment, and showing a readiness to meddle in the internal political debates and electoral contests of other countries," Cook said.While stakeholders have responded with initiatives to counter Beijing's efforts and protect the free flow of information, "the fact remains that an economically powerful authoritarian state is rapidly expanding its influence over media production and dissemination channels around the world," she warned."This has serious implications for the survival of open, democratic societies."RecommendationsAmong the measures policymakers should take to counter Beijing's foreign media influence campaigns, Freedom House recommends enforcing policies that enhance publicly available information about relevant Chinese activities in their countries, and increasing scrutiny of international censorship and surveillance by Chinese-owned companies through their content platforms, such as WeChat and TikTok.Media regulators should revise or better enforce broadcasting rules to prevent abuses by Chinese state media, such as the airing of forced confessions by prisoners of conscience, while media development funders should include exile and diaspora Chinese-language media in projects that offer assistance opportunities, while resisting pressure from Chinese diplomats to marginalize them.Freedom House also called on diplomats, media regulators, lawmakers, and other stakeholders to regularly discuss China's foreign media influence tactics and best-practice responses at bilateral and multilateral meetings between democratic governments.The report noted that undertaking its recommendations will not only address Beijing's encroachments, but also strengthen democratic institutions and independent media against other domestic and international threats."Such action may require considerable political will, as certain measures designed to uphold media freedom and fair competition in the long term will be opposed by Beijing and could hinder Chinese investment in the short term," the report said."But it is increasingly clear that allowing the authoritarian dimensions of CCP media influence campaigns to expand unchecked carries its own costs."Load-Date: January 20, 2020End of Document

AP Explains: CFO of China's Huawei facing extradition to USAssociated Press InternationalJanuary 19, 2020 Sunday 4:16 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 452 wordsByline: By ROB GILLIES, Associated PressDateline: TORONTO BodyTORONTO (AP) - An extradition hearing begins Monday in a Vancouver courtroom for Huawei top executive Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of the company's founder. Canada arrested Meng while she was changing planes at Vancouver's airport in late 2018. The U.S. wants her extradited to face fraud charges. Her arrest arrest infuriated Beijing, which sees her case as a political move designed to prevent China's rise.WHAT'S HAPPENINGThe first phase of Meng's extradition hearing will last about five days. U.S. authorities allege Huawei used a Hong Kong shell company to evade U.S. trade sanctions on Iran. The initial stage of the hearing will deal with the issue of whether the crime she's accused of in the U.S. is also a crime in Canada. Canada does not have similar sanctions on Iran but fraud is a crime in both countries. Meng is free on bail of and is living in one of the two Vancouver mansions she owns.WHY HUAWEI?Huawei has become a focus of attention of U.S. law enforcement and Washington. Huawei is the biggest global supplier of network gear for phone and internet companies and some analysts say Chinese companies have flouted international rules and norms amid allegations of technology theft. Washington also has security concerns because of Huawei's ties to the Chinese government. The U.S. has pressured other countries to limit use of its technology, warning they could be opening themselves up to surveillance and theft of information. Huawei is also viewed as a commercial competitor.WHAT'S NEXTThe second phase of Meng's case, scheduled for June, will consider defense allegations that Canada Border Services, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the FBI violated her rights while she was detained by collecting evidence before she was arrested and told of her alleged crimes. The extradition case could take years to resolve if there are appeals. Nearly 90 percent of those arrested in Canada on extradition requests from the U.S. were surrendered to U.S. authorities between 2008 and 2018.THE BACKDROPMeng's arrest set off a diplomatic furor between Canada and China and complicated high-stakes trade talks between the U.S and China. Beijing is demanding her release and has detained two Canadians in apparent retaliation. She was arrested the same day U.S. President Donald Trump met Chinese President Xi Jinping for talks. China and the U.S. just reached a "Phase 1" trade agreement last week, but most analysts say any meaningful resolution of the main U.S. allegation - that Beijing uses predatory tactics in its drive to supplant America's technological supremacy - could require years of contentious talks. Some analysts see the trade war as only a symptom of a long term US-China competition.Load-Date: January 20, 2020End of Document

NBA still unknown stun of China's futureCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 16, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 453 wordsBody15 Feb.- Adam Silver, commissioner of the NBA, estimated that the league will lose hundreds of millions in revenue for having no connection to the Chinese government, but believes that "the situation will soon normalize."But he acknowledged that he could not commit to hosting pre-season games there next October.With Chinese companies pausing or canceling sponsorship deals, the league recently cut its pay cap projections for next season.The commissioner considered the losses to be "probably less than $400 million."Trade deals began with a tweet from Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey, who supported protesters in Hong Kong last October and the NBA response.In addition to the loss of money from the sponsor, matches have been removed from open television (CCTV) in China, reducing the number of fans by millions.The parties that are broadcast on the Internet were also reduced, and the outbreak of the coronavirus has delayed many business issues.At his annual press conference to the All-Star Party, Silver said that "they took us off the air in China for a period, and caused our trading partners in China to feel that it was inappropriate to have ongoing relations with us."He stated that "but I don't get the feeling that there's permanent damage to our business there. We accept the consequences of our system and our values. It's not a position any business wants to be in, but those are the results."Silver said there are talks about whether the U.S. team will play pre-Olympic exhibition games in July or whether the NBA will return for the Chinese Games in October.The U.S. team is scheduled to spend a week in Shanghai before going to Tokyo and playing at least one exhibition match most likely against France.He added that "we're not pressuring them. It's a decision that's beyond our control, and I'll say I'm not even sure where exactly that decision is. I think our vision as the league is that we must continue to do the things we have done in the past."He considered that "from the data we see, there is still a huge interest for the NBA in China, and I think there will be a return to normality very soon, but I can't say exactly when."The commissioner addressed the proposed schedule changes. The league spent months talking to teams and the players' association about creating a seasonal tournament and a postseason tournament.But the league decided to vote among the owners on the issue that was set for April, so it is unlikely that changes could be made for the 75th anniversary season in 2021-22 as expected.But at the same time Silver dismissed the problem and reaffirmed his intention to find a way to change the 82-game regular season that the NBA has used for more than 50 years.Load-Date: February 17, 2020End of Document

How the Hong Kong protests are affecting your life in the U.S.The Forum: Westminster CollegeJanuary 18, 2020 SaturdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: CAMPUS; Pg. 1Length: 1126 wordsByline: Marina McTeeBodyDaryl Morey, general manager for the Houston Rockets, tweeted support for the Hong Kong protestors Oct. 4. The NBA forced Morey to delete the tweet and apologize in order to protect the NBA's business relations with China.(Marina McTee)While protests in Hong Kong have largely stayed within its borders, they have had far-reaching effects on the world - including the United States.Many U.S. businesses and organizations are not allowing members to openly support the protesters in fear of endangering business relations with China. Also, certain social media platforms with Chinese parent companies are censoring any content about the Hong Kong protests keeping users of those platforms from seeing what is happening.The U.S. is also staying largely silent even though protesters have called for the government to intervene.Cliff Hurst, a professor of management and entrepreneurship at Westminster College, said he is disappointed in the U.S. government for being silent on the issue."Usually we are supposed to be a beacon of democracy in the world and we're supporting the strong many here in silence," Hurst said.Protests have been nearly constant in Hong Kong for the last five months. It all started with a proposed bill that would allow people charged with crimes to be extradited to mainland China for trial. It has become a fight for independence, freedom and democracy.Social Media CensorshipWhen searching #hongkong on the social media platform TikTok, little comes up about the Hong Kong protests. The platform is censoring content about the Hong Kong protests because they are owned by a Chinese based company. (Marina McTee)The main social media platform where content is being censored is TikTok, which allows users to post short videos of themselves.TikTok is owned by the Chinese based company ByteDance and must follow Chinese censorship laws. Because of this, there is next to no content about the Hong Kong protests on the platform other than people who are not from Hong Kong discussing it.Michael Popich, a philosophy professor at Westminster, said any form of censorship needs considerable justification."[Censorship] seems incompatible with this idea of platforms being available for free speech and the exchange of ideas," Popich said. "Many of these media platforms are supposed to promote [and] expand the idea of people being able to express themselves and have their ideas out there."Sydnee Funk, a junior psychology major, said content being censored could affect people outside of Hong Kong and the world tends to learn about major protests no matter what."Once we find out about an issue it's well known throughout the world," said Funk, who watches TikTok videos but doesn't actively post. "So people finding out it's being censored and not allowing other people to see it will upset people."Funk also said she wasn't really aware of what was happening with the protests and thinks the censorship is concerning."I think it's unfair because nobody else is able to see that kind of stuff," Funk said. "And if you're protesting something it usually gets known so it's not like it should be hidden."Because of the censorship, some U.S. senators are calling for an intelligence probe into ByteDance to determine whether or not TiKToK poses a national security threat.Corporate SilenceEven though the company ByteDance may be in the spotlight with the Hong Kong protests, the majority of U.S.-based companies are staying silent on the issue and not allowing individual members to express support either.Cliff Hurst, a professor for Westminster's business program, said he doesn't agree with the decisions large American corporations are making.The logo for the social media platform TikTok which allows users to post and share short videos of themselves. The platform is censoring content about the protests in Hong Kong because they are owned by a Chinese based company. "I'm disappointed and disturbed by those who put their commercial interests first," Hurst said.On Oct. 4, Daryl Morey, general manager of the Houston Rockets, tweeted an image that said, "Fight for Freedom, Stand With Hong Kong." The tweet was quickly deleted and NBA spokespeople said his actions were regrettable. Morey was made to apologize and clarify that his opinion does not reflect that of the NBA.Decisions like this are most likely made out of the need to preserve income, according to Hurst."I believe not only the NBA but also companies like Apple are being very silent about the protests because of not willing to risk their own riches," Hurst said.Hurst also said even if a large corporation expressed support for people in Hong Kong, there likely wouldn't be any consequences."I doubt China would do much because they need Apple as much as Apple needs them," Hurst said.There would probably be more backlash from consumers if there was more coverage of the protests, according to Hurst."I haven't seen any backlash [...] from consumers," Hurst said. "Partly because [the news] is totally consumed by the corruption scandals and the impeachment proceedings of Donald Trump. I think in normal times, the Hong Kong protests would get a lot more coverage than they're getting now."Lack of outside supportCorporations are not the only ones staying silent about the Hong Kong protests - the U.S. government is largely staying silent as well.The silence is most likely due to the administration of President Trump because the protests are something the U.S. would have been supportive of in the past, according to philosophy professor Michael Popich."We've certainly been willing to advocate for democratic movements," Popich said.There is also a lack of support from people outside of Hong Kong in general, Popich said."Why isn't there more widespread support? I don't know," Popich said. "It's not clear whether the Chinese government is open for any kind of negotiation."Popich said he suspects people are more concerned with issues closer to home like climate change."A lot of people outside of Hong Kong are so caught up with their own interests that maybe the Hong Kong protests seem prevential," Popich said.Popich also said the people that are supportive don't know how to be effective with their support.The protests do show a real movement toward democracy, but if the Chinese government continues to refuse to negotiate it could end badly like Tiananmen Square, according to Popich."I have a fear that this could result in some severe bloodshed," he said.What is happening in Hong Kong right now is something that should be affecting the wider world, according to Cliff Hurst."I believe there are forces in this world right now that are leading toward dictatorships," Hurst said. "That should be a concern for all of us."REQUEST CORRECTIONLoad-Date: January 18, 2020End of Document

Top 10 Biggest Banks in the WorldTheStreet.comFebruary 11, 2020 Tuesday 2:40 PM EDTCopyright 2020 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1482 wordsByline: Eric ReedHighlight: Want to buy a house? Want to start a business? Then you'll need a bank, and by the numbers, it will be one of these.BodyLike every other industry, banks are getting bigger.While the local bank isn't quite long gone, it's becoming far more rare in an era dominated by major institutions such as Chase,  TD Bank  and Bank of America . As the Federal Reserve found in one study, between 2000 and 2014 more than 3,000 small banks closed (those handling assets of less than $100 million.) In that same period, the overall amount of money held by the U.S. banking system increased, with almost all growth among institutions holding more than $10 billion in assets.If that doesn't drive the point home,  by the Institute for Local Self Reliance should do the job. In 1980 the U.S. had more than 20,000 registered banks. That number has declined every single year since.Customers are increasingly likely to rely on the large banks that can provide national or even global services, and which can offer more competitive interest rates. Meanwhile, from the perspective of banks, consolidation has become a major asset as well. Today's banks focus on big-budget items such as digital banking, mobile apps and tech security. These programs cost substantial amounts of money to get right, but they're also expenses that tend to scale well. An app can serve 1 million consumers almost as easily as it can serve 1,000, after all, making  an increasingly essential part of modern banking.That said, economies only scale so far. Larger banks do make more money, but they aren't necessarily any more efficient. As economists from the Kansas City Federal Reserve found, "while the smallest banks can benefit significantly from growth, the advantages of growth become progressively smaller until they are exhausted. For most midsized community banks, the increase in returns relative to size is modest; these banks would need large increases in size to realize significantly higher returns."In other words, at a certain point big banks make more money not because they necessarily have a better business model but because they are, well, just plain bigger. And here are the 10 biggest in the world as measured by total assets. (Data as measured by the industry reporting magazine   .)Top 10 Biggest Banks in the World 10. Credit Agricole Group Nation: FranceAssets: $2.12 trillionFor a nation approximately the size of Texas, France is surprisingly well represented on this list. In no small part this is thanks to the success of the European Union. For all of the currency zone's flaws, it has succeeded in creating the second largest economy in the world after the U.S. France has profited well off of this relationship. As one of the largest economies in the EU, France and French banks have capitalized on their already strong global standing. This brings Credit Agricole, a bank which has its origins extending agricultural loans, onto our list.9. BNP Paribas SA Nation: FranceAssets: $2.33 trillionThis bank was formed from a merger of two large institutions in France, the Banque Nationale de Paris, or BNP, and Paribas. This is the second of three European institutions on our list, a major bank that operates on most continents and offers retail and depositor banking services.8. Bank of America Nation: U.S.Assets: $2.35 trillionFor many U.S. consumers, Bank of America  might be the single most recognizable name on our list. While all of the entries here are depositor and retail institutions, B of A has made a particularly aggressive push for consumer-level business. They have carved out a significant retail presence where other banks have begun focusing more on deregulated investments and business lending. Combined with the fact that this is only one of two U.S. banks on our list, this has made B of A one of the largest banks to be a household name.7. HSBC Holdings Nation: United KingdomAssets: $2.55 trillionIn a more fair and just world, HSBC would stand for Her majesty's Secret Banking Corporation. This institution would exclusively fund suave espionage services, it would only ever need to employ Daniel Craig and Idris Elba (with Scarlett Johansson on secondment), and its board of directors would comprise Sean Connery and three martinis.Alas, we live in a fallen world. In fact, HSBC stands for the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. It has its origins in the British trade with China and its East Asian colonies, and today the company operates in more than 60 countries around the world. 6. JP Morgan Chase Nation: U.S.Assets: $2.62 trillionIf you would like to understand why every serious economist and politician in the U.S. has at least one eye on China, here's a data point. Fifty years ago, American institutions would have dominated a list like this. Today, JP Morgan Chase is the last American entry and it doesn't even merit the top five. All but one of the rest are based in China.Does that mean America's era has ended? Probably not. After all, no matter what country you're in, when someone conducts research like this, they measure each bank in U.S. dollars. America's economy and money is still the standard by which the rest of the world is judged, and there are far more reasons for that than simple size.5. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Nation: JapanAssets: $2.81 trillionThe Mitsubishi bank  comes from another merger. In fact this institution was formed relatively recently out of the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and UFJ Bank. For a brief period in the 1990s this was even the largest bank in the world.Mitsubishi bank works mostly in Japan, but almost 40% of its business does come from outside the country. This gives it a prominent place on the world stage, while keeping most of its assets much closer to home.4. Bank of China Ltd Nation: ChinaAssets: $3.09 trillionThe remaining four entries on this list are all based out of China, and the majority of their holdings are Chinese assets. There are two things to understand about this.First, this unambiguously represents the modern success of the Chinese economy. In a single generation China grew from an agrarian nation struggling to feed its own people into the world's third largest economy (behind the U.S. and the European Union).Second, this represents the difference between assets on deposit and size of an economy. Chinese banks hold more assets on deposit than American banks. By some measures, Chinese banks hold approximately $27 trillion on deposit compared ( to roughly $13 trillion in U.S. institutions. This is true despite the fact that the American economy is still about 40% larger by  than China's.3. Agricultural Bank of China Nation: ChinaAssets: $3.28 trillionAny lists of the 10 largest banks in the world will note the presence of the Agricultural Bank of China, one of the country's Big Four. These institutions, all four of which occupy the top slots of our list, are the state-owned banks of the Chinese economy.This makes them somewhat asymmetrical to western institutions. While the Big Four Chinese banks are the largest in the world by assets on deposit, in large part this is because they are given special roles in that country's economy. This has led to a hyper-concentration in banking assets. Each of the Big Four banks is worth three or four times as much as the next largest institution, and each (very roughly) corresponds to an assigned role in the economy. This has generally led China to have fewer, but larger, banks than the west overall. It also makes lists like this something of an inaccurate comparison. In part, JP Morgan and Bank of America serve customers who tend to keep less money on deposit. However in equal measure, these banks don't have the advantage of government ownership and subsidy.2. China Construction Bank Nation: ChinaAssets: $3.37 trillionThe China Construction Bank, as its name suggests, is generally intended to finance new construction, municipal works, infrastructure and other forms of capital-level projects. As with the other Chinese entries on this list, it is state owned and sponsored.1. Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Nation: ChinaAssets: $4.02 trillionHere we have it, the largest bank in the world.The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China is the largest of the Big Four. It is the largest financial institution by volume of deposits and assets, and also one of the biggest companies in the world. As with the other Big Four, this is a state-owned and subsidized company, meaning that it is difficult to disentangle the assets of the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China from those of the Chinese government overall. Calling this the world's largest bank is a little bit like listing the U.S. Army as the world's largest security operation; accurate, but somewhat unfair to the Pinkertons.This bank opened its doors in 1984. It plays a role closer to that of a general lender in the Chinese economy although, as the name suggests, its focus was originally on financing industrial, manufacturing and other commercial enterprises.Load-Date: February 11, 2020End of Document

With tariff slowers, China and the U.S. move forward in their trade truceCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 7, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 491 wordsBodyChina announced yesterday that it will halve its tariffs on US products, worth US$75 billion in annual imports.  This measure, which will enter into force on 14 February, will apply to customs surcharges imposed since 1 September last, the Chinese government's Customs Tariff Commission specified.  Under this agreement, Washington will halve its current customs tariffs since September 1 by $120 billion in Chinese products.  This announcement comes a month after the signing of a truce in the trade war fought for almost two years by both countries, the two major world economies.  Tariffs of 10% and 5% on over 1,700 products will be halved. They are mostly seafood, poultry, soybeans, as well as some types of aircraft or tungsten lamps used in medical research.  This reduction aims to "promote a healthy and stable development of Sino-American economic and trade relations," according to the commission.  Under the preliminary agreement signed on January 15 with Washington, China undertook to purchase additional US products worth US$200 billion, mainly agricultural and manufacturing, over the next two years.  The Trump administration had already suspended a new rate hike that was originally planned for late December.  Influence of the virus However, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow stated Tuesday that the coronavirus epidemic affecting China and crippling the country's economy will surely delay the purchase of American products.  China had already announced last Saturday the cancellation of surcharges applied to the importation of certain US medical products, to improve the fight against viral pneumonia. These are disinfectants, protective suits and emergency vehicles.  "To reduce economic and commercial friction (...) China also made adjustments. We aspire to work with the United States to finally eliminate all customs surcharges," said the Asian giant's Customs Tariff Commission.  For its part, the U.S. has no intention of eliminating any more tariffs for now, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stressed that they continue to be a lever to encourage Beijing to sign the second phase of the agreement.  But, the recent viral pneumonia epidemic in China is crippling the country's economy, and could become something permanently since almost all companies have ceased their activities since January 24, which will run until January 10 February at best.  "However, based on current projections of the virus, we are not concerned" that Beijing may not be able to meet its commitments," Mnuchin reacted. In this context, the announcement can be interpreted as a gesture of goodwill towards Washington, experts say. The reduction in customs tariffs "is moderate, but it is still quite an attractive carrot" for negotiations between the two," said Stephen Innes, analyst at AxiCorp.  For his part, Xu Xiaochun, an economist at Moody's Analytics, believes that tariff reduction is also "an important signal to markets."Load-Date: February 26, 2020End of Document

Equifax Data Breach: U.S. Indicts 4 China Military MembersTheStreet.comFebruary 10, 2020 Monday 12:08 PM EDTCopyright 2020 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 322 wordsByline: Tony OwusuHighlight: U.S. authorities have indicted four members of China's military, charging that they hacked into credit-reporting company Equifax and stole trade secrets and Americans' personal data.Body U.S. authorities have indicted four members of China's military, charging that they hacked into credit-reporting company Equifax and stole trade secrets and Americans' personal data.In a nine-count indictment, Wu Zhiyong, Wang Qian, Xu Ke and Liu Lei of the Chinese People's Liberation Army were charged with hacking into the Atlanta company."This was a deliberate and sweeping intrusion into the private information of the American people," said Attorney General William Barr said in a statement. "Today, we hold PLA hackers accountable for their criminal actions, and we remind the Chinese government that we have the capability to remove the Internet's cloak of anonymity and find the hackers that nation repeatedly deploys against us."Barr went on to say that the hack represents a "disturbing and unacceptable pattern" of China engaging in state-sponsored cyberespionage against American companies. The indictment says that the defendants exploited a vulnerability in software used by Equifax's online dispute portal to penetrate the system. They then used that access to spy on the company's online dispute portal and obtain login credentials that could be used to further navigate the company's network, the indictment says.To hide their efforts, the defendants allegedly used a tor router to redirect their digital footprint through 34 servers located in nearly 20 countries. They also used encrypted communication channels within Equifax's network to obfuscate their activities while within the network, the charges say."In short, this was an organized and remarkably brazen criminal heist of sensitive information of nearly half of all Americans, as well as the hard work and intellectual property of an American company, by a unit of the Chinese military," said Barr.The hack, which was disclosed in 2017, resulted in the compromise of nearly 150 million credit reports. At last check Equifax shares were off 0.5% at $154.90.Load-Date: February 10, 2020End of Document

"Such an ill-conceived concession would only embolden (President) Xi (Jinping), as it undermines democratic values, human rights, economic independence and national security," he added.FILE PHOTO: The Huawei Technologies logo in front of the chinese telecoms giant's headquarters in Dusseldorf, Germany, February 18, 2019.  REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay (WOLFGANG RATTAY/)China's domination of the 5G "would be to choose autocracy over democracy," Pelosi continued.Pelosi's remarks underscored Huawei's bi-party suspicion in the United States. The Trump administration has raised national security concerns about Huawei, the world's largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment, and is pressuring Western allies to ban the company from high-end wireless networks Speed.Trump administration officials, including cabinet secretaries, say Huawei can give the Chinese government access to the data, allegations the company rejects.The United States has tried to get European nations to ban the equipment of state-of-the-art cellular networks, but countries are reluctant to ban it altogether. The Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo; and Secretary of Defense Mark Esper are also at the Munich conference.(With AP information)MORE ON THESE THEMES:New charges were filed against Huawei in New York over theft of intellectual property from American companiesLoad-Date: February 15, 2020End of Document

Chinese national sentenced to prison for trade secrets theftAssociated Press Financial WireFebruary 28, 2020 Friday 3:16 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 222 wordsDateline: TULSA, Okla. BodyTULSA, Okla. (AP) - A Chinese national who admitted stealing trade secrets from a U.S. petroleum company has been sentenced to two years in federal prison.Hongjin Tan, 36, pleaded guilty in November to theft of a trade secret in connection to his work as a scientist at a Phillips 66 research facility in Bartlesville, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) north of Tulsa. Prosecutors said Tan used a thumb drive to copy hundreds of files containing information about "next generation battery technologies" for use in the energy industry.Tan was sentenced Thursday in Tulsa and also ordered to pay $150,000 in restitution.In his plea deal, Tan admitted copying and downloading the information without authorization. Prosecutors said Tan quit his job the day after downloading the information and told Phillips 66 he planned to return to China.Assistant U.S. Attorney Joel-Lyn McCormick said that prosecutors were unable to determine whether a third party or the Chinese government benefited from the information, the Tulsa World reported.In court filings, Tan's attorney noted he had no prior convictions and that Tan has "long-time and substantial ties to the academic community.""This is a serious offense, and Mr. Tan acknowledges that and accepts responsibility for his role in it," his attorney, Ryan Ray, wrote in a sentencing memorandum.Load-Date: February 29, 2020End of Document

Fear of coronavirus expansion impacts bags around the worldCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 23, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 720 wordsBodyAndthe new coronavirus detected in China and its rapid global spread is hitting stock exchanges around the world, as the Chinese government today announced that among its new measures to contain the outbreak it set up the quarantine of another city and cancelled the biggest public festivities for the Lunar New Year.As Asian markets closed with sharp declines,Wall Street opened in low as well as most Latin American currency and stock markets, basically because of investors' caution over the uncertainty over the evolution of the viral outbreak that caused 17 deaths and a figure of 600 people infected, which keeps climbing."The main narrative in forex markets is fear," wrote Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades.Global expectation by WHO adMeanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) is expected to decide today whether it will declare a global health emergency. "If that were the case, there will be more upside risk to shelter assets," the analyst said.The impact also shifted to oil prices, which fell because the possibility of an epidemic could reduce demand for fuels.Peak of the outbreak in March?Economics professor Yu Xiaohua of the University of Gottingen in Germany said the virus was likely to peak about 90 days after the initial outbreak, which would be in early March.If so, the epidemic would not end until early May,Yu said based on a mathematical model that used information about the Sars outbreak in 2002-03. In any case, the expert told Chinese newspaper 21st Century Business Herald that its forecast did not address the Chinese government's efforts to curb the virus's expansion and assessed that with the quarantine of Hubei city, the outbreak will stop.The number of people infected rises steadily but so far, there are 628 cases declared in mainland China, 2 in Hong Kong, 2 in Macau, 1 in Taiwan, 4 in Thailand, 1 in Japan, 1 in South Korea, 1 in the United States and 1 in Sinagpur.Source: SCMP Chinese New Year no partyJust hours after the start of the Lunar New Year next Saturday,which traditionally constitutes the highest celebration in China, the Beijing authorities today canceled all "large-scale" celebrations,as a preventative measure to prevent the spread of the virus.The Beijing Palace Museum, also known as the Forbidden City,will be closed to tourists from Saturday, the official People's Daily reported.In fact, hundreds of millions of Chinese have already traveled in the last 10 days to meet friends and family for this party, the main one on the calendarof the Asian giant, and now many also returned home early for fear of the virus.Isolate more Chinese citiesIn addition, the Chinese government imposed restrictions on two more cities in Hubei province, where the outbreak of the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) had been detected, as well as on Wednesday with the city of Wuhan (capital of Hubei).Road passenger traffic for epidemic control was suspended in the cities of Huanggang and Ezhou- in addition to Wuhan; railway stations were closed and long-distance buses were suspended."The mood is relatively heavy. We are trapped in Wuhan and we cannot leave," said Zhang Lin, a professor at Wuhan University. He explained that his older parents had come to Wuhan from a different province to see doctors for their chronic conditions, but now they could not go to the hospital as they are considered pockets of infection.Wuhan authorities this week installed infrared thermometers at airports, train stations and buses and said public transport vehicles were disinfected daily.Japan on alert to OlympicsThe virus outbreak also leads Japan to address the possibility of massive contagion and serious problems as it prepares to host the Olympic games.Although there has been only one case in Japan so far, the outbreak highlights the risk of contagion given the millions of visitors expected for the Tokyo Games."In such mass meetings, the risks of infectious diseases and resistant bacteria can be transmitted increase," said Kazuhiro Tateda, president of the Japanese Association of Infectious Diseases.Japan faces a similar situation to what was experienced four years ago,when the Zika virus led some health experts to request the postponement or relocation of the Rio de Janeiro Games,although the Olympic event was eventually carried out as scheduled.Load-Date: January 24, 2020End of Document

Welcome back -- everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.I'm Maria Bartiromo, coming to you live this morning from the World Economic Forum here in Davos, Switzerland where the biggest and the brightest minds from across the political and business world are in Davos.It is Friday, January 24. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.The coronavirus is spreading. The death toll is now up to 26. Now travel is restricted for 35 million people. We have the very latest on the lockdown for certain cities in China.Rising tensions over impeachment, scorching testimony, renewed calls for the Bidens to take the stand. We have the very latest from Capitol Hill.Markets are higher this morning, ahead of the open. We are expecting a firmer tone for the averages this morning. Take a look, we are once again near record territory. Dow Industrials up 83 points, quarter of a percent. Nasdaq up 28. And the S&P up 7.5 right now after the markets finished the day mixed yesterday closing well off of the lows of the day, but nonetheless, we had the Dow negative, 26 points lower. The Nasdaq was up 18. And the S&P 500 was up 3.5.Global markets this morning look like this, European indices are higher across the board, plus we heard from the European Central Bank yesterday. The FT 100 right now is up 123 points, one and two-thirds percent. The CAC 40 in Paris up is up 70 points -- that's better than 1 percent. And the DAX index in Germany up 1.5 percent.We did have Purchasing Managers Index out of Germany this morning and that is helping this market certainly strengthen better than expected showings there on manufacturing.In Asia overnight, only Japan and Hong Kong were open. Markets in China are closed for the lunar new year. And as you can see it was very much a fractional move in Japan and Hong Kong.Cracking down on counterfeit. The Trump administration laying out new plans to combat fakes.All those stories coming up. Joining me to break it all down: Fox Business' Dagen McDowell and the "Wall Street Journal's" wealth management reporter, host of the podcast "Secrets of Wealthy Women" Veronica Dagher.Good to see you -- ladies.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good to see you.VERONICA DAGHER, WEALTH MGMG REPORTER, "WALL STREET JOURNAL": Good to be here.BARTIROMO: You know, I promised our audience that I would tell everybody what conversations I had off the record with certain CEOs. What I want to tell you is what I heard about the focus on Donald Trump. How it was different -- a different tone.So I am going to tell you what certain CEOs told me, what they feel about the President today versus the first time he came to Davos which was two years ago. And I know that our audience is going to want to hear that. So I will get to that when we talk with Ian Bremmer in just a moment coming up.But we are focused, of course, on the coronavirus. 26 people are dead, more than 800 people have been infected by this mysterious respiratory illness. Cases confirmed in several Asian countries and now the United States, one person infected in Washington State.Chinese officials are restricting travel for 35 million people. Residents say they are not receiving proper treatment in hospitals, if they're able to even see a doctor at all.The World Health Organization not yet calling the outbreak a global health emergency. But let's talk about where this is going and what kind of unknown this represents for the world with one of the leaders in terms of predicting these kinds of things. Eurasia Group president, "G-Zero" media Ian Bremmer is here. And Ian -- it is always great to see you.IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT, EURASIA GROUP: Hey -- good to see you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for being here once again in Davos.When you see the coronavirus, I know you obviously do not know where this is going, but you have a keen sense of what these kinds of things mean for the economy globally. How do you see it?BREMMER: I wouldn't be going to China right now, right. I mean the problem is that the Chinese government has a lack of transparency. There are a lot of incentives for leaders inside the Communist Party to not provide the full extent of bad news to the hierarchy. And as a consequence they under count.Now they have more experience now than they did with SARS and they have a lot more hospitals now than they did before. But still, you know the fact that the World Health Organization was divided a couple days of ago on whether or not this was a disaster and now they're saying it is a disaster, you know, the news is moving very quickly.I wouldn't panic if you are living outside of China but inside of China, this is going to scare you. Because you don't really know if you can trust what your government is actually saying.BARTIROMO: One of the issues is that hundreds of millions of people are going to be traveling --BREMMER: Right.BARTIROMO: -- tomorrow, for the new year holiday in China. Should people be afraid to get on planes right now? That this is going to go airborne?BREMMER: I don't think that they should be afraid it h is going to go airborne. I think they should be afraid that if they go to China, it is possible that the city they are in could get locked down and then movements could be made more challenging, right.I mean that is the point is that this was -- a few days ago, this was you know, news item number 7, number 8 for most of the Chinese networks. It should have been number one.Today they're taking it more seriously. But I just don't feel comfortable that we have transparency around how far this virus has actually spread.BARTIROMO: Ian -- let me switch gears here because you and I have been coming to Davos for a lot of years. The last two years -- two years ago, President Trump came here as president for the first time.BREMMER: Right.BARTIROMO: And two years later I'm feeling a different tone. I want to share with our audience what I have heard --BREMMER: Sure.BARTIROMO: -- from CEOs off the record. So a couple of comments, I wrote them down as soon as I got them.One major CEO in technology. "I don't know how he did it but he did it. I love his policies."Another one. "Things feel great. 2020 looks strong. The economic policies in place are working.""We have adapted to his approach," says another. "The way he says things, fine, we know how he is going to say it. The bottom line is the policies are paramount."I have not had the negativity that I saw two years ago. CEOs today are saying I may not agree with some things that the President says, but I agree with what he has been able to do. And I love his policies. I do not want them reversed.I've gotten an incredibly positive feeling from executives about this president, on this trip. What do you say?BREMMER: I generally agree with that. Let me break it down for a second.Number one on trade. Two years ago there was much greater concern that Trump was only focused on deficits. He's going to break trade relationships. He just pulled out of the trans-Pacific partnership. Every CEO here hated that.Today, you've got USMCA, you've got phase-one deal on U.S.-China. You actually say both sides have moved back from the brink on U.S.-Europe. So the company executives feel pretty good that trade is working with their interests, as opposed to working against their interests.Number two -- climate. WEF was all about climate this year and there's no question a couple of CEOs made some big and meaningful steps to make a difference. But the average CEO behind-the-scenes, is much closer to Trump's agenda on climate than they are Greta Thunberg's. They may not want to say that publicly but that is the reality.That maybe bad for our planet and most of the world may disagree with it but certainly when you come to Davos, different story.Number three, people are very concerned about what Trump would represent to the United States long term a couple of years ago. Nobody really thought that the U.S. economy would be growing as strongly as it is right now three years after Obama. You can't say it's all Obama hangover.Now, the rejoinder to that is 2 percent growth, with trillion dollar deficit and tax benefits that have gone to the country and to the corporates. You'd like to see growth a littler higher.Now most economists say the U.S. is underperforming given all of that. But still the corporates here feel pretty good.BARTIROMO: Yes.BREMMER: Final point, the average attendee here thinks Trump is going to win in 2020.BARTIROMO: That is the bottom line.BREMMER: No question. And I would say that they are less uncomfortable with that than they would have been. This particularly -- they're more comfortable with it than they would be with any of the Democrats on the progressive side. I heard that across the board.BARTIROMO: Me too.BREMMER: I was a little surprised by it --BARTIROMO: Yes.BREMMER: -- but you have to understand that that is where business community presently is.BARTIROMO: There were CEOs two years ago who were outraged. They did not know what was going to happen with Donald Trump running the largest economy in the world, the most important. And today, they are telling me we cannot have this policies reversed.Look, let me get to Dagen McDowell in New York for a second because she termed this spot-on a while ago when she said this is personality versus policy. And that is the bottom line -- Dagen because, here you've got CEOs, saying you know what? I don't want these policies going away.That is why they are all thinking it is working and we want him to get reelected. These are people who are Democrats, who were against him two years ago.MCDOWELL: Lowering corporate taxes, lowering individual taxes, massive deregulation, making sure that we have a safe and sound energy policy that has made the United States the number one petroleum producer in the world, the swing producer. We now control prices. So again that changes the safety and security of where, not just countries but companies get their energy supplies.And then he has reordered world trade. He's giving companies cover to look at China and say, maybe I need to move my production somewhere else. He is doing deals with China, Canada, Mexico, Japan, and now he's focused on Europe. And again, they know that as a CEO that the President has your back.He might -- they don't care what he says on Twitter. They care about what flows right to their bottom lines and what creates prosperity.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: Again, we go back to the rising -- this rising tide is lifting all boats. Gallup came out with this economic confidence, it hit plus 40 -- that is the highest reading in two decades.BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes. That is bottom line. These policies and the impact cannot be denied -- Ian.BREMMER: Yes. Again -- I mean want to focus on the fact that on the United States is actually losing some ground vis-a-vis the Chinese globally. They have a strategy to how to export, in infrastructure and technology that is moving more countries towards China --BARTIROMO: Are they ahead of us on A.I.?(CROSSTALKING)BREMMER: -- away from the U.S.They are ahead of us in a lot of parts there. They certainly are a superpower.But the United States is becoming much more powerful than our allies -- there's asymmetry.Dagen just mentioned that we're largest energy producer in world that was growing under Obama, that's growing even faster under Trump. We are the biggest food producer in the world.We have tech companies. The Europeans don't have any. So Macron can say there's a third way. You don't have a third way unless you have companies. Merkel can say that. They want to build -- they can't build companies.BARTIROMO: And I haven't seen the latest -- you know, creator of Instagram in China and in Europe I have not seen, you know, the Google creation --BREMMER: In Europe.BARTIROMO: -- in Europe.BREMMER: No, it doesn't exist.And so, you know, the interesting things at the same time that the Chinese are doing a long-term strategy, and are really investing in security for their people long term, the American allies are not.And so for the Europeans to point to the U.S. and say we're mad at Trump, they think that things are going to get better somehow when a Democratic president comes in, the reality is that there is still going to be American unilateralism. The power balance is still going to be shifting towards the United States.And that reality is playing into a lot of CEO confidence about the United States.BARTIROMO: That's right. That's right.BREMMER: That's where it's happened.The Europeans just don't feel as confident about their economy today as the Americans do. And there are many just basic reasons for that, that aren't going to go away in the next year or two years.BARTIROMO: Yes. You make so many great points -- Ian. It's always great to get you, talk with you. Please come back soon.BREMMER: Yes. Good to be with you.BARTIROMO: It is good to see you. Ian Bremmer joining us.Quick break. And then when we come back the deadly coronavirus. Eurasia Group president Ian Bremmer just told us moments ago he would not go to China right now hearing we do not actually know how far this virus has actually spread.We will bring you live updates all morning long on that.And then banned from banking, former Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf hit with a lifetime ban from the banking industry -- a massive fine in the aftermath of the fake account scandal.All that next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Monday -- we are one week from the first votes being cast in the 2020 presidential election cycle.

Ten cities, including the epicenter of the crisis Wuhan, are on lockdown while travel in several other areas has been restricted.These efforts coming just ahead of the lunar new year, one of most traveled days in China -- that is tomorrow. 26 people are dead from this virus, more than 800 cases have been confirmed in seven countries including the United States.Well, John Kapoor, he is the founder of Insys Therapeutics. He's been sentenced to five and a half years in prison for his role to illegally boost sales of his company's fentanyl drug. Kapoor was convicted last year of bribing doctors, defrauding health insurance companies.He apologized to the victims who spoke out during his sentencing but he does plan now to appeal. Nonetheless, his conviction.Well, afraid for her life -- the words of actress Annabella Sciorra, who took the stand at the Harvey Weinstein sex assault trial here in New York. She describes in graphic detail how he allegedly sexually assaulted her in the early 1990s. She claimed that Weinstein forced himself on her inside her own apartment. Weinstein continues to maintain his innocence.And finally while the San Francisco 49ers and the Kansas City Chiefs battle it out in the Super Bowl, pizza companies are trying to claim their own victories already. Pizza Hut is estimating they're going to see about 1.5 million pies sold during the big game. Dominos is saying it's going to sell nearly two million pizzas. At least 37 percent, Maria -- of viewers ate pizza during last year's game. That's according to market research firm (INAUDIBLE).Now Maria -- if I can get you some New York pizza down in Miami, I will do my best.BARTIROMO: We're going to the Super Bowl -- Cheryl. Dagen -- get ready for pizza and J.Lo and Shakira and the game, right.CASONE: Can't wait.MCDOWELL: Yes. I think I will end up watching it on television. I'm excited to be down in Miami, because you know I spend a lot of time down there. And I was just looking -- I know exactly where you can get the best pizza -- Maria Bartiromo. And it's New York style. It's thin crust.BARTIROMO: Well, listen. We all know where the best pizza comes from -- in New York, in Brooklyn.MCDOWELL: Brooklyn, yes.BARTIROMO: But we try it. We tried pizza --(CROSSTALKING)BARTIROMO: -- Miami we'll give it a shot, I guess.MCDOWELL: There're probably more Brooklynites in south Beach nowadays than there are actually in people born in Brooklyn living in Brooklyn. I'll just add that.DAGHER: That is true -- yes. One thing out there -- multimillion dollar homes in Brooklyn.BARTIROMO: All right.I am ready to party down with you girls in Miami at the Super Bowl.MCDOWELL: Don't -- here is my advice.(CROSSTALKING)MCDOWELL: I have advice -- I have advice. Don't order mojitos. The people who work in bars hate making mojitos. Don't order them. They're a huge pain in the tuchus. Don't order them. Just drink like --BARTIROMO: What?(CROSSTALKING)BARTIROMO: I love mojitos.DAGHER: Yes, they're fun.MCDOWELL: They don't like making them because you have to muddle the mint and sugar and it's just -- don't order them because it's probably not going to be made right.BARTIROMO: All right -- ok. Good advice. We'll have to figure out a different drink. But we will have fun.And please join us, live from the Super Bowl next weekend, right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.But first, we're going to speak with National Trade Council director Peter Navarro and U.S. Customs and Border Protection acting commissioner Mark Morgan next as the Homeland Security Department is announcing a major counterfeit bust. Wait until you see what they busted up at the airport.Plus this, buckle up, we are taking a looking at this year's Monster Jam Truck competition. We're live, taking you there when we come back.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.The Department of Homeland Security announcing a major counterfeit bust today. Customs and Border Protection along with ICE seized nearly 28,000 different shipments full of counterfeit goods over the last year. We are getting an exclusive look at this, this morning before their press conference to discuss this.U.S. Customs and Border Protection acting commissioner Mark Morgan joins me, along with assistant to the president for trade Peter Navarro. Gentlemen -- it's great to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL: Hey -- Maria.MARK MORGAN, ACTING COMMMISSIONER, U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION: You bet.BARTIROMO: So Mark Morgan -- let me kick it off with you. Explain what has taken place in terms of this bust. What are some of the things that you saw? And what is coming into our country in terms of counterfeits?MORGAN: You know, Maria -- let me start off by first saying look, the American people need to understand that exploitation of counterfeit goods, it endangers our economic prosperity, it also threatens the health and safety of American consumers as well as our national security.The number you just put up, almost 28,000 different shipments that we see that contain counterfeit goods is just a drop in the bucket of what is going out there, currently on the e-commerce platform.We estimated the market value of those shipments was $1.5 billion to the economy. 90 percent of those shipments that had counterfeit goods came from overseas, international mail and consignment. It's absolutely an incredible issue.BARTIROMO: But what are some of the things. I mean are these handbags? Are these, you know, pills? Is this iPhones? Is it, you know, ear buds. What are the products?MORGAN: Yes. It is all that -- Maria. It's across the board. If it's out there --BARTIROMO: It's all of that.MORGAN: -- if it's being produced, you bet. Anyone is exploiting all of that.And you know it is not just counterfeit goods. We're also seeing, you know, there is criminal organizations that are out there. They're exploiting this as well on the counterfeit prescription.A lot of this is laced with fentanyl, legal doses of fentanyl. That's why we say it's a health and safety risk. Airbags, for example.BARTIROMO: Yes.MORGAN: Counterfeit airbags. And of course, you don't know they are counterfeit and they're not effective until you need it.So it really runs the gamut. If it's being manufactured, it is being counterfeited.BARTIROMO: This is really important -- Peter. You just spent two and a half years working on a new deal with China. And one of the key things was IP theft. I don't know if I'm naive in saying this but I feel like you're counterfeiting and creating a bag and saying that it is a Chanel bag or saying that it's Michael Kors bag or a Ralph Lauren bag -- an American designer, and it's really not it is counterfeit. That is sort of like stealing intellectual property, isn't it? Connect dots to the trade deal you just did.NAVARRO: Sure. Counterfeiting is the purest expression of intellectual property theft. There's a couple of things going on here. What is happening today with DHS is the culmination of an executive order President Trump gave it back in April and told DHS to tackle this counterfeit tracking problem.And I've got to give kudos both to Secretary Wolf and Commissioner Morgan. They not only have a historic report coming out today, it is a historic action plan a la the Trump culture which is to get it done.The problem we have is that there is just a flood of counterfeits coming, a lot of it is enabled by e-commerce platforms like Alibaba, Amazon, JD.com, Shopify. When you go on those e-commerce hubs they connect you to online sellers and places like China where most of the counterfeits come from and people get ripped off or as Commissioner Morgan said they can actually get hurt or even killed by, you know, whether it's fentanyl or fake airbags.What we've been doing is working with CBP closely on this Operation Megaflex going back to July. Once a month we're looking under the hood of what is coming in with China. We're finding an unbelievably high rate of discrepancies.And in terms of the phase one deal and enforcing that it's going to be easy now to do because we're going to see, once a month whether China continues to flood us with counterfeits.So this is a big picture thing. It's a kitchen table issue for Americans around this country who shop online and who are getting ripped off.And I can tell you this, Commissioner Morgan and director -- Secretary Wolf are doing a heck of a job on this. They're hitting the ground running with an action plan. And we are going to give -- President Trump is going to get this done for the American people.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean Mark -- if you order, for example, what you think are Apple ear buds but you don't order them from Apple, they may not be Apple and you don't even know it.MORGAN: That is exactly right. So the consumer can do a couple of things -- Maria. One is they can make sure that they're using trusted legitimate sites. And if they still have caution they should really know where this product is being shipped from. They can go to the manufacturer's Web site and they can learn where they recommend legitimate places they can go to purchase that.So there are some things they can do.BARTIROMO: Yes.MORGAN: But let me give you an example of the volume we're talking about. Last year FY -- fiscal year 2019, CBP 600 million shipments overseas that came into, that is $1.8 million per day. That is the level of volume we are talking about that's coming into this country.NAVARRO: And Maria --BARTIROMO: Before you go Peter -- the President is going to go -- yes, go ahead.NAVARRO: Yes. Well, we are finding hit rates when we do the Operation Megaflex -- upwards of 10 percent. In other words, 10 percent of the stuff coming in from China has something wrong with it. So if you are getting a million packages a day from China, that is 100,000 Americans being affected every day by this counterfeit and contraband flood. And it's everything from fentanyl to baby formula and things that can hurt you.So DHS and CBP are on the case and ICE -- they're going to handle this on behalf of President Trump. It's all good.BARTIROMO: All right. Yes, and we are happy to bring this to our audience ahead of the press conference. Thank you for giving it to us first.Peter -- real quick. The President is going to sign USMCA this week?NAVARRO: Yes, I -- it should be this week. It's got to be within 10 days. Great victory for the American people, farmers, ranchers, workers, manufacturers. It's a beautiful thing, what President Trump's doing.BARTIROMO: All right, guys. Thanks very much, Mark Morgan, Peter Navarro, we appreciate it, and we will see you soon gentlemen.Coming up, Senator John Barrasso is with me as House impeachment managers pressed their case against President Trump before the president's defense team has its turn. That's going to happen this weekend.And then, banned from banking. Former Wells Fargo CEO, John Stumpf, hit with a lifetime ban from the banking industry, and a massive fine to go with it following the fake account scandal at Wells Fargo. Back in a minute.ANNOUNCER: Here again is Maria Bartiromo with a special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA, live from Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic Forum.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, everybody. Thanks for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, coming to you live from the World Economic Forum here in Davos, Switzerland.It is Friday, January 24th. Take a look at markets right now. 8:33 a.m. on the East Coast. We are looking at another gain at the start of trading in about an hour on Wall Street with the open, we've got Futures up 90 points, on the Dow Industrials a third of a percent. NASDAQ Futures at 24, and the S&P Futures off right now, seven points.Global markets this morning, also with the firmer tone. European indices are higher across the board as you see the FT-100, up 123 points, 1-2/3 percent. The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 70, better than one percent. And the -- and the DAX Index in Germany with better than expected for the purchasing managers' data this morning on manufacturing up 1-1/2 percent on the DAX Index in Germany.German PMI rose to a five-month high showing that the eurozone's largest economy could be picking up some strength. In Asia overnight, only Japan and Hong Kong were open. Markets in China are closed for the Lunar New Year. That is why we are expecting so much travel going into the Chinese New Year. Hundreds of millions of people traveling.Our top story this half an hour is the Senate impeachment trial. It is the last day for House impeachments managers to make their case against President Trump. Today's arguments are expected to focus on the second article of impeachment, and that is obstruction of Congress.Democrats tackled abuse of power yesterday. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. JERROLD NADLER (D-NY): That puts even President Nixon to shame. President Trump has placed his own personal political interests first. He has placed them above our national security, above our free and fair elections, and above our system of checks and balances. This conduct is not America first, it is Donald Trump first.REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): If right doesn't matter, we're lost. You can't trust this president, do what's right for this country.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Senate Republican Conference chairman and Senate Foreign Relations Committee member, John Barrasso. And it is great to see you, Senator. Thank you so much for joining me.SEN. JOHN BARRASSO (R-WY): Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Take us behind the curtain, sir. What went on?BARRASSO: Well, first, you said you can't -- he -- Adam Schiff just said, you can't trust the president to do what's right for the country. Maria, look at the economy, It is booming under President Trump. The stock market is on all-time high under his -- this administration, 7 million new jobs.Yesterday, the consumer confidence was the highest it's been for America in 20 years. The president has been doing all the right things for this country. But yet, he is being impeached.You know, and your viewers do as well, this is something that started the day he was elected. Elizabeth Warren had a press conference in December of 2016 about how he was -- they were going to impeach President Trump.So now, here we are in the trial and they want to drag it on forever. They start by saying they have overwhelming evidence, a mountain of evidence, rock, solid evidence. But yet, they want more witnesses, more documents.So, imagine -- I think today in the Senate is going to be Groundhog's Day again. The same thing we heard yesterday and the day before, and the day before. That tomorrow, the president's defense starts, we're also going to have time for senators to ask questions, and then, we will ultimately make the decision. Do we need even more information or do we have enough information to go to a final judgment?BARTIROMO: So, you will have a vote in terms of whether or not to bring witnesses in. You've got a 51-vote threshold here. Democratic senators need four Republican senators to vote with them to get witnesses.Do you see four votes on the Republican side to hear witnesses that's going to be critical in terms of where this goes next, right?BARRASSO: It is going to be critical. And you're right, Maria because it's interesting. Because it sounds like every Democrat wants more witnesses. And it's not about more evidence, it's about dragging this on. It's about the 2020 election.You heard Adam shift say that the 2016 election wasn't fair when any saying the 2020 election, can't be trusted.He thinks he ought to be the judge in the jury and he ought to decide who should be president of the United States. I mean, it is astonishing that I would say, let the voters decide.They're going to be voting starting next Monday in Iowa, New Hampshire, the week after that. Let the voters decide. This shouldn't be up to 100 members of the United States Senate.I've heard enough. I think most Americans have heard enough, T.V. ratings are dropping. What we do see is that Americans believe that what's happening in the Senate is a fair trial. Whereas, what happened behind closed doors in the House, where -- and the president having no due process, only one in three Americans believe what happened in the House was fair.BARTIROMO: Yes, I know, but Senator, when I look at the -- at the jury, "jury", all of the senators, four of those senators want the president's job. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar, Michael Bennet. So, how are they, independent jurors? There's supposed to be jurors, but they're running for president.Two other senators just dropped out. And they were also running for president. So, you've got six senators who we know what their motives are. How is this a fair jury?BARRASSO: Well, they ought to recuse themselves. Some of our other Senate members have suggested that they remove themselves because they've many of the Democrats have already said, they've made up their mind and they know how they're going to vote, then they shouldn't need additional evidence to do it.The other thing, Maria that many of us hadn't focused on is it's not just about removing President Trump from the White House, it is also about removing him from the ballot in 2020. So, the Democrats who were bringing forth these articles of impeachment are also saying, don't let President Trump run for reelection in 2020, because they know there is a really good chance that the president will be reelected.When you look at what he has done, these recent trade agreements in -- with between -- with Canada, with Mexico, with Japan, with China, the impact of this economy that is booming.Every day we spend, Maria on impeachment, we're not spending on doing things to lower the costs of insulin for people who are diabetic. We're not spending our time when focused on the issue that I chair in the -- in the Senate, which is highways, roads, bridges, tunnels, all of those things need to be worked on.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Well, your --BARRASSO: But as long as the Democrats continue to try to drag out this process, the longer it's going to take for us to get to the important work to the American people.BARTIROMO: Yes, well, you're also not spending any time on the true wrongdoing that took place in 2016. And how his campaign was framed and spied on, we heard from the FISA judge today. That two of the FISA warrants to surveil Carter Page were unlawful.BARRASSO: Yes, that's getting worse.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: NO, no words from your colleagues on the left on that at all.BARRASSO: The more that when -- and a number of senators were talking about that new information we're talking about that last night on the Senate floor, real concern about the way in the abuses of then.The other issue that was interesting yesterday that came out in the New York Times front-page talks about it today is the risky turn that the case is taken because they spent so much time yesterday talking about Joe and Hunter Biden.You know, the fact, Hunter Biden's gotten all this money from Ukraine from a company that was under investigation for corruption. Joe Biden then has, you know, had threatened to withhold a billion dollars from Ukraine unless they fire the prosecutor who was looking into his son's behavior.BARTIROMO: Yes.BARRASSO: And Maria, that was a lot more money than what President Trump had temporarily delayed. But that was for the money from President Trump that, that got paid.They got -- he got nothing as a result of it. Ukraine has done much better in terms of the weapons that they need and the funding that they need under President Trump than ever happened under the Biden-Obama administration.BARTIROMO: All right, we will be watching certainly today. And then, we will watch tomorrow this weekend when the president's defense team gets at the wheel. Senator, it's always a pleasure. Thanks so much.BARRASSO: Thank, thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: Senator John Barrasso there. American Express, meanwhile, set to add some gains to the Dow this morning. Gerri Willis on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Looking for a rally at the start of trading, Gerri.GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK PERSONAL FINANCE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right. And the Dow Maria being held here by American Express, they're reporting a double beat on earnings.Look at this stock. It's poised open higher here. They say spending by Amex, customers rose six percent in the U.S. You can see the results here on the bottom line, coming into $2.03 a share versus $2.01.Revenue also better. Good news there. As I said, porter held by higher spending by customers. Meanwhile, let's take a look at Wells Fargo. The former CEO John Stumpf banned from banking industry for life.This is virtually unprecedented. The last time it happened in the 1990s, Angelo Mozilo banned from the mortgage business for his role in the mortgage crisis. Stumpf has been fined $17.5 million over the fake account scandal, the aggressive sales culture that led to literally millions of fake accounts being set up.He worked in the business for three decades. You can see the stocks going to open higher here. Stumpf is gone. He has left the company. So, it's not affecting the stock today.Maria, back to you.BARTIROMO: Gerri, thank you. We will take a break. When we come back, pedal to the metal. We're taking you for a ride at the Monster Jam truck competition. We'll go to the live.But first, a special update from the "TENNIS CHANNEL".ERIN COSCARELLI, HOST, NFL NETWORK: Welcome back to another "TENNIS CHANNEL" court reporter for Fox Business. I'm Erin Coscarelli.Serena Williams is out at the Australian Open. The 23-time major champ went down to China's Wang Shang in the biggest upset of the tournament so far.Serena's quest to equal Margaret Court new time list at the slams will have to wait after the number 27 seed clinch a biggest win of her career. 56 unforced errors for Williams in a loss.SERENA WILLIAMS, PROFESSIONAL TENNIS PLAYER: It's not even about the slams. It's about just me playing good tennis and I didn't do that today. And that is more disappointing. So, it's not even about the win or it's just more about, I'm better. I'm better than that.COSCARELLI: And tennis said goodbye to Caroline Wozniacki who heads into retirement after her lost to Ons Jabeur. The Dane 130 WTA titles during her career.And don't forget, tennis channel's live coverage of the Aussie Open hits the air daily at 6:00 p.m. Eastern.MCDOWELL: It's a big day for Maria Bartiromo. We are celebrating her sixth anniversary here at Fox, Fox Business Network, Fox News Channel, "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES", I can't miss the show.Number one, every weekend. There you go. And I think -- I think it's safe to say --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.MCDOWELL: You enjoy today even more than you did yesterday. And yesterday, even more than you did Wednesday, right?BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. Dagen, I'm so grateful to have you in my life. I can tell you, I'm so happy to be here, and to be celebrating six years. I always say I'm grateful to be having the most intellectually stimulating conversation that I've ever had.The conversations that you and I have with our phenomenal guests are not only a joy but an incredible privilege. So, I thank you for marketing my anniversary here at Fox. I just love it. And I have to give a huge shout out to our audience because I love our viewers so much.You know, every time we say something, we do something on the show, we get their feedback, and they feed us and they make us better. So, I'm grateful to the audience, grateful to Fox, and certainly, grateful to you Dagen to have the most intellectually stimulating conversation every morning right here.MCDOWELL: Well, I will say, we say this to each other privately all the time, but you're an icon and I feel lucky every single day that I get to sit next to you and in talk about what we -- what we're passionate about, what is important to the viewers. But also, you know, we share a very similar background and that how we were supported by our parents.And, I know, I can say this. I don't work as hard as you, but I try.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Nobody works as hard as Maria.MCDOWELL: I never were -- I've never --BARTIROMO: You do -- you do.MCDOWELL: Again, it paid your -- hard work pays off, and you are a testament to that every single day.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much and right back at you, thank you so much. And Happy anniversary, everybody. I'm so happy that it's six years today. Exactly today, six years.Let's set over to Studio B. "VARNEY & COMPANY" host, Stuart Varney is preparing for his show. Stuart, when I first started, you had me on your show. I remember six years ago. Tell me who's on deck this morning on "VARNEY & COMPANY".STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Well, OK, I'm going to deal with Xi Jinping, China's leader. I think he's in crisis mode. He's got to deal with this virus and he's got to deal successfully with it. Otherwise, his power is rather brittle, some of it could break off. That's a big deal, I think.We get a deal with Elizabeth Warren being schooled by rather angry parent, who had saved money and paid for his daughter's college education. He now feels he's been "screwed" because of the giveaway that Warren proposes.And yes, on this program, on this set, right next to me, Derek Jeter's jersey. It's up for auction, and we'll find out how much it's going for. How about that?Congratulations on the anniversary, Maria.BARTIROMO: Awesome.VARNEY: Congratulations. Good stuff.BARTIROMO: Thank you. Thank you so much. They will see you in about 10 minutes. Top of the hour.VARNEY: You will.BARTIROMO: Stuart Varney will be right back. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. It is time to jam. Monster Jam that is drivers pushing their skills to wow the crowds with some crazy stunts. Kristina Partsinevelos, live from the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey.

And I've got one of the drivers, Mark here, who's going to be riding the El Toro Loco. You started out building tracks first, how did you transition from building tracks to becoming a driver?MARK LIST, DRIVER, EL TORO LOCO: I mean it just a long story short, I was always a passionate person about motorsports and start building tracks. Every time I was building a track, I was dreaming about building -- sorry we can't hear over here.As you guys can see, that's Chris and doing them fantastic -- doing that better. Well, I started building the tracks. And every time I was building track, I was dreaming that one day I was going to be behind the wheel for Monster Jam truck.PARTSINEVELOS: Yes.LIST: And four years ago, that opportunity came true when I went to Master Jam University in Paxton Illinois, I had the opportunity to drive my first ever Monster Jam truck. And here I am, living my dream, traveling the world, representing the Latino culture. And I couldn't be any happier to be where I am.PARTSINEVELOS: Yes, just so our viewers heard. So, you are literally watching this. In Costa Rica, you're acting as a translator, and your mom is a rally driver.LIST: She was the first female rally car racer in Costa Rica. So, that's basically where the passion for motorsport was born on me.PARTSINEVELOS: OK, and just to end, so, this weekend, it's going to be happening all of viewers can coming up, come and see the show in New Jersey or they can go to Long Island next weekend.

How to Misinform Yourself About the CoronavirusAtlantic OnlineJanuary 28, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1936 wordsByline: Alexis C. MadrigalBodyA few minutes before 11 p.m. on January 20, Eric Feigl-Ding was pretty much just another guy on the internet. Sure, he is a Harvard-affiliated public-health researcher who lives in Washington, D.C., and has multiple degrees, but his Twitter account was nothing special. He had about 2,000 followers-a modest count on a scale that reaches into the millions-and his average tweet got about one retweet and five likes.That all changed when Feigl-Ding read a paper about the new coronavirus spreading out of Wuhan, China, and spotted an eye-popping stat. The paper estimated that the virus's contagiousness, which is captured in            a variable called R0, was 3.8-meaning that every person who caught the disease would give it to almost 4 other people. The paper cautioned that there was "considerable uncertainty associated with the outbreak," but Feigl-Ding still worried that such a highly transmissible disease would be a key ingredient in the recipe for a major pandemic. "I read that 3.8 value and I was like: 'Oh my gosh!'" he told me. "I tweeted it out."That's an understatement. "HOLY MOTHER OF GOD-the new coronavirus is a 3.8!!!" Feigl-Ding's            tweet read. "How bad is that reproductive R0 value? It is thermonuclear pandemic level bad-never seen an actual virality coefficient outside of Twitter in my entire career. I'm not exaggerating." During the next five minutes, Feigl-Ding put together a thread on Twitter, mostly quoting the paper itself, that declared we were "faced with the most virulent virus epidemic the world has ever seen."[           Read: The deceptively simple number sparking coronavirus fears]Twitter ate it up. Many people seemed to be experiencing the outbreak, especially from afar,            as           some           kind           of           distributed           movie, watched in grainy cellphone videos sent out of China and populated by Twitter heads filling in the backstory. The thread soon had thousands of retweets. Feigl-Ding's account was flooded with new followers. Here was a Harvard epidemiologist naming the world's darkest fear about the new disease and confirming it.Yet there were issues with Feigl-Ding's analysis, even if they were not immediately apparent to the people simply scrolling through Twitter. The thread exemplified a deep problem on Twitter: The most extreme statements can be far more amplified than more measured messages. In the information sphere, while public-health researchers are doing their best to distribute scientific evidence, viral Twitter threads, context-free videos, and even conspiracy theories are reaching far more people.The coronavirus outbreak is a serious public-health problem. Although reports began to surface in early January, the Chinese government            massively escalated its response last week, calling for an unprecedented quarantine of tens of millions of people. The outbreak struck within a fraught set of geopolitical circumstances. There is the            history of the respiratory illness SARS. There is the            uncertainty about how transparent the factions of the Chinese government are being about the severity of the outbreak. There is the sheer size of China-and the appearance of the disease in the weeks leading up to            the new year, which sends hundreds of millions of people traveling across the country. And, of course, there is global            competition between the U.S. and China, which provides a little extra incentive (and prospective attention) for Americans on Twitter trying to garner an audience.Most Americans cannot read Chinese, nor are they present in large numbers on Chinese social-media sites such as Weibo and WeChat. The internet has fractured over the past decade, with American and Chinese social-media companies carving up distinct parts of the world. While that makes it difficult for many Americans to parse what's happening on Chinese social media, it also creates an opportunity for people who are tapped in on both sides. They can arbitrage from the Chinese to the American internet, turning WeChat videos into Twitter gold. Accounts big and small have whipped up quite an apocalyptic fervor in the past weeks, posting            scary videos of dubious provenance and veracity. The mainstream media has proceeded carefully, and reporters' stories have seemingly been unable to satiate the rising hunger for more information about coronavirus.This was the ecosystem in which Feigl-Ding's thread landed. No wonder it took off. Unfortunately, there were some mistakes. While Feigl-Ding included quotes and screenshots of the paper, which was preliminary and not peer-reviewed, he omitted some context, primarily that other infectious diseases such as measles also have very high R0 numbers. He also made a clear error: "Ding claimed that the new virus was eight times as infectious as SARS, when in fact SARS had an R0 ranging from 2 to 5, very comparable with these estimates for the new coronavirus," the science journalist Ferris Jabr, who watched Feigl-Ding's thread wing around the internet that Friday night, told me. Feigl-Ding            deleted the SARS tweet once he realized the mistake.    [           Read: The dangerous myth of America's ebola panic]The problems didn't end there, though. Feigl-Ding hadn't known that by the time he tweeted about the paper, the researchers had already lowered their estimate to 2.5. And R0, for that matter, is            not the be-all and end-all of the danger of a virus. Some highly transmissible diseases are not actually that dangerous. Other experts chimed in to chide his characterizations (and some of his Harvard colleagues talked directly to him, he told me). One epidemiologist, Michael Bazaco, quote-tweeted Feigl-Ding and            proclaimed, "This is fearmongering hyperbole, and borderline public health malpractice." The tone was clearly not straight out of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nor was the form of the tweets.When Jabr began to add up all the issues, he realized that he should create his own corrective thread. "I decided to counter with a thread that filled in the missing context and collated some of the known facts at the time, along with their sources," he said. "By the next morning, both our threads had been amplified, but his had still been RTed and liked at least twice as many times."By the time of this writing, Feigl-Ding's thread has roughly triple the likes and retweets of Jabr's. This is one of the realities of the current information ecosystem: While out-and-out conspiracies and hoaxes will draw some attention, it's really the stuff that's close to the boundaries of discourse that grabs the most eyeballs. That is, the information that's plausible, and that fits into a narrative mounting outside the mainstream, gets the most clicks, likes, and retweets. Bonus points if it's sensational or something that someone might want to censor. After all, which is more interesting: "HOLY MOTHER OF GOD," or "the essential data are still being collected and assessed," as Jabr ended his thread?In 2018, after years of research into the trouble Facebook was having moderating material on its platform, the company's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, identified a dark pattern in Facebook's data concerning what he called "           borderline content"-stuff that was almost prohibited by Facebook, but not quite. He made this chart.FacebookFeigl-Ding's tweets seem to approach the line of what professional ethics would permit public-health authorities to say. He certainly wasn't endorsing full-on conspiracy theories about            bioweapons and            zombies, as some people have suggested during the coronavirus outbreak. But he also was far from the calm, slow-down-there stance of the majority of other officials. And, of course, that's what made his message so irresistible.Twitter has made some effort to            slow the spread of misinformation on its platform. Searches for coronavirus now produce a link to the CDC with the message "Know the facts."Feigl-Ding, for his part, admits that he wishes he'd worded things a little differently. "I really wish Twitter was like Facebook and you could edit," he told me. Since his thread went big, he's moderated the tone of his tweets considerably and hewed closer to the public-health consensus on how to describe the situation.Still, Feigl-Ding is just one guy on the internet. Many people have been tweeting into the borderline space, and not everyone shows signs of remorse.Misinformation has always been an element of people's response to disease; we didn't have to wait around for social media to be invented            to spread rumors or            contest facts. But the fundamental difference today is the scope and speed by which social-media platforms enable this to happen-and the strangeness of the information networks that are formed in crisis.One user in particular, @howroute, has had tremendously viral tweets about the terrible danger the world faces. These have drawn more likes and retweets than anything from Feigl-Ding or Jabr. One shows people in hazmat suits on an airplane. "BREAKING NEWS: This is not a scene from some apocalyptic horror movie, this is a #coronavirus outbreak in China," @howroute posted. The tweet has been retweeted and liked about 50,000 times. "The SARS like virus has already spread to four countries and infected more than 1700 people. US airports are monitored. Be on alert, stay safe!"[           Read: The grim conclusions of the largest-ever study of fake news]The account has also posted videos            supposedly showing people dead in the hallways of hospitals and someone            twitching under a hospital sheet. Most of the videos seem to be real, but the context is missing. Within the apocalyptic frame that they've been given, they are terrifying.The name on the account is Max Howroute, but I've been unable to find any person by that name in public-records searches. There's no record of Max Howroute working at a publication or producing work other than some            satirical YouTube videos, yet the account describes Howroute as a "journalist." Before the Wuhan crisis, @howroute had mostly posted anti-Trump memes. Since the viral hit, the account has gone all in, tweeting completely context-free videos and charging its critics with being Chinese Communist Party trolls. "You're liar and I will report you to Twitter," @howroute tweeted at the            Hong Kong dissident artist Badiucao. "You're obviously new here. I'm one of the most trusted sources on coronavirus reporting on Twitter. How dare are you to question my reporting!!"It's not clear what @howroute is doing, or who is responsible. The account-it often posts using we-has not responded to my requests for an interview, and studiously maintains that everything it has posted has been verified. According to fact-checking by BuzzFeed's Jane Lytvynenko,            that is not true.Is @howroute someone seeking global attention, someone who believes what they are doing is righteous, someone who's simply an exploitative grifter? Perhaps the only clear thing about the account is that it has shaped the online conversation about the coronavirus outbreak, regardless of its intentions. It may be that @howroute is "one of the most trusted sources on coronavirus reporting on Twitter," which is exactly the problem. Some entity with no discernible knowledge about China, epidemiology, or infectious disease, working from a pseudonymous account, has become a leading source for people across the world about a global pandemic.Load-Date: January 29, 2020End of Document

Good Wednesday morning everybody.Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, February 19th.Your top stories right now just before 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.A new case of coronavirus confirmed in California as the global death toll rises and it now tops 2,000 people dead. The passengers on that Diamond Princess ship finally allowed to disembark, meanwhile.Plus tonight, showdown in Sin City. Six 2020 Democratic hopefuls are looking to get lucky in Vegas for the 9th debate as Michael Bloomberg takes the stage for the very first-time.Presidential pardoning spree yesterday -- 11 people pardoned or had sentences commuted by President Trump. We are breaking the high-profile pardons, coming up.And no plans to resign -- Attorney General Bill Barr is staying put despite a report that the president's tweets are making his job quote "impossible to do".Groupon shares are down this morning, falling more than 20 percent in the premarket. Take a look at this stock, down 25 percent right now, down to $2.27 a share.Plus this, turning your cash into trash? Millions of Americans have unused money hiding in their wallets. Could you be one of them.MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.We kick it off with markets -- futures indicating a gain at the start of trading this morning. We're at the highs of the morning right now. The Dow futures are up 93 points. The Nasdaq futures up 47. And the S&P futures up 10.25.We will get the Federal Reserve minutes at the end of today. We're going to find out what the fed was talking about at their last meeting. There is some optimism as China has pledged to support businesses as they reopen in Wuhan.Yesterday's close meanwhile. Stocks finished mixed. The Nasdaq edged higher for a second straight record high. With the Dow and the S&P 500 lower yesterday. Dow industrials down 165 points at the close yesterday. A lot of people are expecting China to cut interest rates.Let's check global markets right here. European indices right now are higher across the board. As you can see, the FT 100 has been back and forth positive, negative. It is now up 2.5 points. The CAC 40 in Paris was up 37. And the DAX index in Germany is up 66.In Asia overnight, markets mostly higher, except the Shanghai composite, although there is a wide belief that the central bank in China, will lower interest rates perhaps this week, and government is planning to assist give cold cash to the airlines who, of course, have seen a shock as a result of coronavirus.Some of the stories that we are watching this morning.The coronavirus death toll is now topping 2,000. The number of confirmed cases more than 75,000 across the world. Passengers trapped aboard the Diamond Princess Cruise ship who tested negative for the virus are now getting off of the ship in Japan."The New York Times" is reporting new cases of the virus appear to be slowing however in China. More than two dozen countries have confirmed cases of the coronavirus including the United States.Alabama now under a state of emergency this morning. The declaration coming ahead of massive flooding recovery efforts. the state bracing for more heavy rain. Mississippi, Georgia, and Louisiana also preparing for the downpours.NASCAR driver Ryan Newman is awake and talking, we are told, following his terrifying wreck at the Daytona 500. Newman hit a wall, flipped and crashed during the final lap of the annual race. He remains in the hospital this morning.In a statement his team said quote, "Ryan and his family have expressed their appreciation for the concern heart felt messages from across the country.Our top story this hour: President Trump on a clemency and pardon spree. The president commuting the sentence of former Illinois Democratic governor, Rod Blagojevich. He also pardoned former NYPD commissioner Bernie Kerik and banker Michael Milken. Milken known in the 80s as the junk bond king, convicted of securities fraud. But he has become known much more for philanthropy since being released from prison especially in medical research.Here's a clip of my interview with Milken back in 2018.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHAEL MILKEN: We used to think, of all these cancers being different but now these mutations appear. And it seemed very naive to assume that you would have a mutation but can only go to your breast or it could only go to your prostate, or your colon.Now we see that, for example, in prostate cancer the mutations appear in 81 other forms of cancer. So when you solve them, for prostate cancer, this mutation you will solve them and for other cancers also.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: I can't think -- I can't think of another single individual who has done more for cancer research than Michael Milken and specifically prostate cancer. He came out with his faster cures.And when I first met Michael Milken -- Dagen, it was when he had a prostate cancer event at his home in Lake Tahoe. And I went there, he had leading doctors from across the world there and he told them all the same thing. Unless you share your research with your competitor another doctor I'm not giving you any money. They all wanted his money to help fund their research, they shared their science and they shared their research. And what happened? He actually changed the trajectory of prostate cancer. He's done a lot of good, Mike Milken.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: And even in his in career at Drexel Burnham Lambert, he changed the way that you raise money and corporate finance, with his -- with his use of high yield -- they call it junk bonds back then, which is pejorative -- but high yield debt. It's just been a really incredible career. And I think in hindsight this was an unwarranted prosecution, of anybody, certainly deserved.BARTIROMO: Well, and by the way, he did his time. He was in prison and once came out of prison he focused all of his energies on philanthropy and medical research as well as education, by the way, but the Milken Institute is another institute that he runs which hosts globalists and zeroes in to subjects like health care as well as education -- Kelly.KELLY JANE TORRANCE, "NEW YORK POST": Yes, you have to -- I keep thinking of the Democrats, people like Bernie Sanders, AOC. They talk about people with money as if they are evil and as if there's something wrong with making money.But look what he has done with so much of his wealth as you say Maria. So much good. I mean, imagine -- this is cancer research, how many lives it has saved, how many families it has touched.And this idea that making a lot of money is just bad I mean people can do a lot of good with money. And you know, you got someone like Michael Bloomberg, he's spending you know half a billion dollars on television ads. I think someone like Michael Milken has done a lot more good with his money.BARTIROMO: Yes. He does -- he continues to focus on life-threatening diseases.TORRANCE: Yes.MCDOWELL: People forget how famous Mike Milken was though, in the 80s. I was because I'm older I remember it. He was the highest paid man on Wall Street. He was making hundreds like $180 million in a single year just on Wall Street. Back then that -- those sums were just unheard of.BARTIROMO: Well, I was honored to offer my support to the president when asked, I agree that he should have been pardoned and I think it's a great thing because he is going to continue doing what he has been doing.I just want to point out on the coronavirus situation. The Chinese communist government according to Larry Lindsey in the Lindsey Group, they have reported that Major General Chen Wei (ph) has been deployed to Wuhan to oversee activities there. Until recently General Chen Wei was listed as a researcher at the Medical Institute of the Academy of Military Sciences.Turns out she was China's top person in biochemical warfare. Just pointing that out that she has been sent to Wuhan to oversee the activities there. So we're still trying to figure out where the coronavirus started and originated.TORRANCE: I mean this was is one of the reasons that we don't know is that, as you pointed out many times Maria, the Chinese government will not let anyone from the CDC here from America in. And you have to wonder why. Why don't they want the help of the greatest experts in the world?BARTIROMO: There are members of the CDC with the World Health Organization but you're right. CDC independently is being told no, we don't need your help. And this is the leading institution in terms of disease across the world, the CDC.MCDOWELL: I wonder if this is going to be China Chernobyl.BARTIROMO: Yes. Repeat what Senator Cotton said.MCDOWELL: I say this again and again. Communism -- we either kill our people intentionally or accidentally.BARTIROMO: And we'll see what this does to President Xi Jinping because he's facing a lot of pressure not just from coronavirus but you also get the Hong Kong protesters which you don't hear about at all anymore.We're talking about all of that this morning. We've got a lot coming up.The coronavirus economic casualties is also something to discuss. New warning signals China's GDP could plunge as low as 3.5 percent. Last check it was at 6 percent, if the outbreak is not contained.We are going to take a look at that.And then President Trump on the road again. He is kicking off a four-day western swing this week, distracting Democrats going head-to-head in Nevada.Plus this, is your cash becoming trash. Millions of Americans have unused money hiding in their wallets. Could you be one of them.Don't miss that. It's all coming up.But first, squashing rumors -- the Justice Department confirms Attorney General Bill Barr will not resign. He's not going anywhere just days after saying President Trump's tweets make it quote "impossible for him to do his job".And then the Sin City showdown tonight. Six 2020 Democrats look to get lucky in Las Vegas for tonight's ninth presidential debate. Michael Bloomberg takes the 2020 stage for the very first time.Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Attorney General Bill Barr has no plans to resign according to the Department of Justice. This is days after saying that President Trump's tweets make it quote "impossible for him to do his job".The Department of Justice denied the report Barr was considering resigning if President Trump keeps tweeting. The president weighed in on this yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I do make his job harder. I do agree with that. I think you have to agree with that. He is a very straight shooter.Social media -- has been very important, because it gives me a voice. Because I don't get that voice in the press.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Former presidential associate Roger Stone is set to be sentenced tomorrow.Joining me right now is Tennessee senator, member of the Senate Armed Services, Commerce, Judiciary and Veterans Affairs Committees, Marsha Blackburn.Senator, it's good to have you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.SEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R-TN): It's good to be with you. Yes, thank you.BARTIROMO: So let's first talk about Bill Barr. How is he doing? Any -- what are your thoughts going into what has been really a whirlwind of speculation about Bill Barr ever since he made those comments to ABC?BLACKBURN: I -- my hope is that Bill Barr is going to stay. He is doing a wonderful job. He has the trust of so many of us in Washington.We know that he has brought an incredible amount of experience to this job. He is cleaning up the DOJ. He is making certain that the FBI refocuses their efforts, and I'm certainly one of those that wants to see him stay.BARTIROMO: Yes. But is he cleaning up the DOJ, Senator? I mean, you know -- look what is going on in terms of all of these people who we know lied to Congress and leaked information to media.BLACKBURN: That's right.BARTIROMO: And tried to frame Donald Trump in the 2016 election. They are getting off right? Just the other a day we hear that Andrew McCabe will not be charged, Jim Comey is still out and about trashing the president. Same with John Brennan. Where is accountability here?BLACKBURN: Well, we know that he has a very full plate, if you will. And you're expressing some of the frustration I hear every single day from Tennesseans. And Maria, I think this is the president's frustration.The American people look at what is happening in Washington, and they feel like there is a two-tiered justice system. And they want to see people pay for the things that they have done wrong and for the violations of law.And people every day will bring up things to me about Jim Comey, or Andrew McCabe, or Loretta Lynch.BARTIROMO: Yes.BLACKBURN: You know, and they're saying, how can people get by with this. We can't get by with things like this. And the recent (ph) -- what the federal government is doing to them through these federal agencies.And Donald Trump understands that.BARTIROMO: Yes.BLACKBURN: The president has done a great job of trying to get government off your back and out of your pocketbook. Now, Attorney General Barr has to feel like he is playing whack-a-mole every single day that he goes into his job because there is so much to clean up.When you look at the fact that the FISA abuse took place and we still don't see that reconciled --BARTIROMO: Well, that is what I'm saying.BLACKBURN: And we still do not have the Durham report.And there is a lot to deal with both on at the personnel and the procedural end. I think let's have him stay, I want him to stay. I think the president wants him to stay.BARTIROMO: Yes. there's no question. The Department of Justice came out yesterday and said this is absolutely not true, but, you know, the president also went on a bit of a tweetstorm yesterday, threatening lawsuits over the two year long Mueller probe FISA abuse. The president said, if I wasn't president I would be suing everyone all over the place. But maybe I still will, he said -- Senator.Because he knows and we know, as our audience knows, that there is a cabal of individuals who used the tools that we use against terrorists against then-candidate Donald Trump - informants to leaks to wiretapping to lies.BLACKBURN: You are exactly right. And this is why at the Judiciary Committee we are going to continue to look at this. It's why we are going to hold hearings on the Durham report.BARTIROMO: When? When are you going to hold the hearings -- Senator because that's the follow-up question --(CROSSTALKING)BLACKBURN: We've got to get the report first.BARTIROMO: When are you going to hold the hearing?BLACKBURN: After we get the report and hopefully we'll get that report early this spring. The point is --BARTIROMO: The John Durham report?BLACKBURN: Correct. That is correct. And people want to make certain that those who have been working outside of the law are held to account.BARTIROMO: OK.BLACKBURN: The McCabe decision is disappointing. I'll agree with you on that. And -- but look at it, you've got DOJ with their violations. You've got the IRS that has overstepped its bounds, you've got the EPA that has shut down different industries.BARTIROMO: Yes. All these agencies have been politicized -- Senator.BLACKBURN: Yes.BARTIROMO: All these agencies have been politicized.BLACKBURN: You're right.(CROSSTALKING)BARTIROMO: Real quick -- before you go --BLACKBURN: You're right. They've been weaponized.BARTIROMO: Knowing and weaponized -- yes, good word. Knowing all of the vitriol that's going on, on both sides how are you going to get anything done? Do you expect anything done legislatively this year -- Senator?BLACKBURN: We are going to continue judges' confirmations. Legislatively I do think you will see us move forward with something on online privacy. Online data security. We are continuing to work on that.We would very much like for the House to agree to work on the transportation bill. But we have some that are not that interested in transportation over there.I don't know if Speaker Pelosi is going to be able to get her House members focused on anything other than impeachment.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Senator -- it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much.BLACKBURN: Good to see you -- thank you..BARTIROMO: Marsha Blackburn joining us there.Coming up the coronavirus economic casualties -- new warnings signals China's GDP could plunge as low as 3.5 percent if the outbreak is not contained soon.Trump on the road again this week. He landed in Las Vegas overnight for West Coast campaign blitz distracting Democrats going head to head in Nevada he is hoping. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.The impact of the coronavirus on the Chinese economy. Morgan Stanley is revealing this morning, "Beijing's economic growth could fall as low as 3.5 percent growth for the first quarter. That due to the deadly illness. The report says the Chinese factories only at 30 to 50 percent of normal levels as of last week and will only reach 60 to 80 percent capacity by the end of the month.Joining us right now is Brandywine Global Fixed Income portfolio manager Jack McIntyre. And Jack -- it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks for being here.JACK MCINTYRE, BRANDYWINE, GLOBAL FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO MANAGER: Good morning.BARTIROMO: What's your expectation on the impact to China and its economy given its large percentage of the global economy? All the flights in and out have been stalled. You got businesses closing shop, left and right even though Xi Jinping is now encouraging businesses to open once again, even though the coronavirus is still there.MCINTYRE: Yes. So you know forecasting how this is going to ultimately impact China is certainly more an art than a science. The 3.5 percent decline in growth or to that level is certainly reasonable. But it could be zero percent to 4 percent.To me, what I'm focusing on is not necessarily the severity in Q1, but the duration of this slowdown because that is -- you're right, that is the linkage to how it's going to impact companies in the U.S. I mean companies globally and the U.S. in particular have been running very lean inventories.And it is the supply chain impact that first is initially going to hit the U.S. So it's interesting. U.S. equities are ignoring it but if this thing drags on another couple of weeks, I don't think they will.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's the duration for sure. But I don't know where Morgan Stanley gets 3.5 percent -- Kelly, anyway because if the activity -- I mean no one is on the streets. You know, they got mad at the U.S. for limiting travel to China. They've got people locked up in their homes.TORRANCE: And let's face it, they're not getting out of their homes to go on trips to the United States --BARTIROMO: Right. That's what I'm saying.TORRANCE: -- or Russia which also now has banned travelers from China.But Jack -- I was wondering what are you looking at in China to figure out -- you talked about the whole question is the duration. I mean what -- how do know how long it's going to be, how big it's going to get and how well China is dealing with it. Are there signs, things we could be looking at?MCINTYRE: So one of the things I'm looking at and again going back to the U.S. equity market. I think it's kind of focused on this is actually just the stimulus that is in response to this. You know, China certainly stepping it up from this standpoint. And the other thing I think President Xi realized that hey, this crackdown on the virus it's doing more economic harm than probably the virus itself. So they have got to pull back on that.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCINTYRE: So I'm looking for more signs of that to say hey that maybe we are starting to see a little bit more economic activity uptick in China.BARTIROMO: Look -- Jack, real quick before you go, given your focus on fixed income, are you expecting anything out of the minutes from the Fed? Do you think the Fed's on hold this year or what might we see it cut? Real quick.MCINTYRE: I think everything is kind of irrelevant from this standpoints. It's more important going forward because of what's the impact of the virus.BARTIROMO: All right. Thank you so much -- Jack McIntyre.And we'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. It is Wednesday, February 19th. Your top stories right now, 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast. We are -- 0.5-tenths of a percent is the gain this morning on the PPI, this is much higher than expectations. The January Producer Price Index is out and the Housing Starts and Building Permits are also out.PPI is up half of one percent, the estimate on the PPI was a gain of one- tenth of a percent, this breaking news happening right now and we are waiting for any market reaction. We've got to look further into this because this is a big number. Given the estimate, the January year-over- year PPI 2.1 percent, versus an estimate of 1.6 percent. This is a lot hotter than anybody expected. Annual-wise rate in terms of Housing Starts and Building Permits, 1.425 million and 1.45 million respectively, those are the estimates.We have been looking at a situation, Dagen McDowell, with zero inflation. We have not seen inflation. We know that there has been inflation in China, given the surge in food prices, but this PPI number at first glance, to me, looks worrisome.MCDOWELL: Yes, it's very hot. Of course, we got to wait and see how much of these cost increases are passed along to consumers and the overall consumer prices because the core PCE, the Personal Consumption Expenditures that the fed watches, has been running well. The core number there has been running well below two percent, I think 1.6 percent on the most recent reading, but this is very hot. North of two percent on wholesale prices.The core number was also up half of one percent. But 2.1 percent year-over- year? You got to watch -- can we put up the 10-year treasury because money has been pouring into treasuries. Yesterday, the 10-year closed 1.55 percent, the 10-year yield that is. Money has been pouring into treasuries. Can we take a look at the 10-year yield? It's at 1.57, so not really much of a movement of money out and the treasuries at this point --BARTIROMO: And no movement in stocks. I'm surprised at this. I'm surprised that there's no reaction. There's got to be more here because there's not a big reaction to the fact that this PPI, this inflation number, is much hotter than we have seen in a long time. Building Permits, by the way, near a 13-year high. The Building Permits is a different story, but the PPI and the inflation data is much worse than anybody expected.MCDOWELL: People are still worried about economic growth, though, that's why. Economic growth because in part of the coronavirus, and that's why -- one of the reasons that you have seen money flooding into U.S. treasuries, U.S. fixed income.BARTIROMO: Now, we've seen real inflation in China, we, of course, have been reporting about the swine flu, that sent prices for pork soaring, food prices have been soaring pretty much across the board in China and there's real inflation there. It had not been exported to the United States because for the most part, you've been seeing one-tenth, two-tenths of a percent moves in the PPI and the CPI. We haven't seen this passed on to the consumer because the Consumer Price Index so far has been pretty muted. But this five-tenths of a percent number makes you wonder.MCDOWELL: But I'll point out that the Housing Starts and Permits Number came in for January, well above expectations.BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: And so, that goes to the health of our economy and that would offset concerns, potentially, so people are more positive than they are negative about the implications.BARTIROMO: For sure. But you -- but when was the last time we saw a number so outsized versus the estimate. One-tenth of a percent is what we were expecting.MCDOWELL: Right.BARTIROMO: This PPI is five-tenths of a percent.MCDOWELL: The core PPI was up year-over-year, 1.7 percent year-over-year. So, that's still relatively contained although above expectations. Expectations there was from 1.3 percent growth.BARTIROMO: All right. We are not seeing much of a reaction in markets. Dow Industrials holding on to a gain of 84 points, as you saw rates holding steady as well.Let's get to the other news of the morning, and that is the coronavirus, reportedly not delaying all Apple production. Cheryl Casone with those details now. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That's right, Maria. Coronavirus may be taking a bite out of Apple sales target for the current quarter. But the outbreak apparently not going to delay the launch of the iPhone SE 2. The new phone set to debut next month. It's reportedly going to look like an iPhone 8, it's going to be $399.Now, Bloomberg is reporting the release of the new iPad Pro could actually be pushed back, again, watching coronavirus, watching Apple stock up almost half a percent in the premarket.Well, the European Union unveiling the plan today aimed at placing more restrictions on machine-learning technology, A.I. Think of surveillance cameras, self-driving cars, cancer scans. Now, these rules come with restrictions for U.S. and Chinese companies that develop the tech and how they handle sensitive data such as facial recognition or even medical records.Finally, ladies, a dog in Toronto achieving something pretty amazing, Percy the Cockapoo, going viral after a video of him playing Connect 4 was posted on Instagram. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Good boy. You got it. You got it. Yes! Good job!(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: OK, as impressed as the internet seems to be, Percy's owner says, Maria, he's actually not that good at the game. The dog is playing Connect 4. I'll leave it --BARTIROMO: I love that.CASONE: -- with you at that. Wow.BARTIROMO: It is so sweet.CASONE: So great.BARTIROMO: We love that. Going to teach Dusty how to play Connect 4.CASONE: Please do.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Cheryl. All right. A Sin City showdown tonight, six democratic candidates getting ready for tonight's debate in Las Vegas. Michael Bloomberg making his first disappearance on the 2020 debate stage, despite not being on Saturday' Nevada caucus ballot.Joining us right now is radio host, New Leaders Senior Fellow, FOX News Contributor, Richard Fowler, along with Republican strategist, Pinion Enterprises Founder and CEO, Joseph Pinion. Great to see you guys. Thank you so much for being here.JOSEPH PINION, FOUNDER AND CEO, PINION ENTERPRISES: Good to see you.RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good to be here.BARTIROMO: All right. So, what should we expect? Richard, kick us off.FOWLER: It's going to be an interesting debate. I think you're going to see a lot of people throwing blows at Michael Bloomberg. And you know, to be frank with you, I'm not sure why. Michael Bloomberg has no delegates and he's not on the ballot for two more states. He's not on North Carolina ballot -- I mean, not on the South Carolina ballot and on the Nevada ballot. So, it's going to be a very interesting debate to watch indeed, as they figure out who's the fronted runner, right?And I think the reason why the frontrunner is up in debate is because Mayor Pete has more delegates even though Bernie is leading in polls. And so, there's going to be a very interesting debate to watch.BARTIROMO: You say you don't know why. I know why. It's because he's got all this money and he got himself on the debate stage. He gave the Democrats more than $100 million last year and it worked. They won the majority back. What do you think, Joseph?PINION: Look, I think money talks, and fourth place finishes and fifth place finishes walk. I mean, you have somebody like Michael Bloomberg who, again, God bless him, is running the best funded art project in the history of American politics. I think there still needs to be somebody with all that money he's spending to drag him into a broom closet and tell him not to get on that debate stage because I think that it might actually burst the bubble.So, I think -- look, I think you have to acknowledge that Bernie Sanders right now is the frontrunner. The Sanders revolution has arrived. And I think, again, to not talk about that. We focus so much on how well Buttigieg has done in Iowa, and also in New Hampshire. We neglect the fact to say when does he win again?And so now, you're looking at Nevada, you're looking at South Carolina, and Democrats with their proportional delegates, you know, participation trophies for everybody have actually crippled the ability of their nominee to get a critical mass of delegates.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, that's one question I wanted to ask is when are we going to start seeing people dropout? I mean, obviously, we've had dropouts already, people that really never had a shot. But, you know, given the mess that was Iowa, nobody dropped out because it was so inconclusive. When do you think we're going to start seeing that?PINION: Well, look, I mean, for me, personally, I think again, Democrats faced a prisoners dilemma much worse than Republicans faced in 2016. Again, when you look at somebody like Amy Klobuchar, who I kind of think is akin to somebody like a John Kasich, somebody who overperformed in a place like New Hampshire, but at the same time, doesn't have the time or the resources to build up that infrastructure, nationwide.Somebody again who, you know, who's like Elizabeth Warren who believes that she can make a last stand on super Tuesday, which happens to include her home state, akin to somebody like Marco Rubio.FOWLER: I mean, to write -- to write obituaries to primaries in, it seems to be a little -- there seems to be an overstatement. Here's what's -- here's what's happening, right, we do give up a portion of delegates because we believe that we -- our party is a huge party, it's a big tent. But to sit here and say that Bernie Sanders and Pete are the frontrunners in the race, where both Bernie and Pete have parliament black voters and not a large population of black voters haven't cast a ballot.A large population of Latin ex-voters have not cast a ballot yet. It's very hard to say that either of these candidates are a frontrunner. Not to mention the fact that there is a Bloomberg factor here. Bloomberg has to get in this race. Bloomberg doesn't get on the ballot unli super Tuesday.MCDOWELL: Here's a note --BARTIROMO: Richard, when you said there's a big tent here, what's the big tent? I mean, I feel like they all have the same policies. They want to raise taxes. They want big government programs. They want the green deal. They want to give illegals drivers' licenses. I mean, what's the big tent? Where is this tent that I keep hearing about? I don't see it.FOWLER: So, the -- there's a 10 and 2-fold. One, I think there's a time when it comes to ideas. Yes, we all believe in somehow expanding everybody's access to healthcare. There's different methodologies to do it. You have Pete Buttigieg who wants to expand the Affordable Care Act. You have Bernie Sanders who wants to give you Medicare for All.You have folks who believe that the best way to solve our economic woes are -- excuse me, our environmental woes, is by working in the system, working with businesses to get it done. That's, sort of, the plan that Mayor Pete as well as Joe Biden, as well as Bloomberg is giving you versus a Green New Deal that Bernie Sanders is giving you. Beyond that, we are a part of diversity in people, right? We have African-Americans, LGBTQ folks, Latino voters.BARTIROMO: Well, we want to ask you about the black vote, but first, Dagen. Go ahead. You jump in here.MCDOWELL: Well, I'm going to bring up this new ABC poll in terms of black voters and people of color and how it's -- and Sanders is really picking up steam, and Joe Biden's losing. But I just need to correct you on something. Amy Klobuchar is not John Kasich. Amy Klobuchar is a very positive candidate and it's one of the reasons that she performed well in New Hampshire, meaning just her appearance when she was on the debate stage. John Kasich is more like Bloomberg because he's a big old grump.FOWLER: Well, yes.MCDOWELL: And that was -- and that was a huge problem for him. He just had this look on his face. Like, what is wrong? But, really quickly, Richard, this is the ABC poll that Langer Research did for the television network. And it found that Biden's support among blacks, and I fully con cede that states with people of color in them have not gone to the polls yet. But his support among black voters has declined from 51 percent last month, to 32 percent now.Overall, nonwhite voters that accounts for half of all Democrats and democratic leaning independents. They have gone from 35 to 28 percent, Biden-Sanders, last month, to 35 percent, 22 percent Sanders-Biden, so it's flipped.FOWLER: Oh, I think it has split. And I think one of the reasons that it flipped is the fact that everybody sees Bernie as having this momentum. With that being said, I think your point is right, to point out that none of these voters have went to the polls and none of them have voted. And if you've noticed, if you look at endorsements, right, and endorsements actually do matter in the Democratic primary. Biden -- Bernie has very few endorsements from black-elected officials, right?You could -- I think there's three or there's a handful of them, right, when it comes to a larger elected official. And so, this race is very, very, very early.BARTIROMO: You talk about endorsements. Is Barack Obama endorsing Michael Bloomberg, because he is all over his commercials?FOWLER: I think Michael Bloomberg is just using some sound from the president. And here's the thing --BARTIROMO: But, I mean, Barack Obama had to bless that. You can't just use sound bites of Barack Obama without checking on him, right?FOWLER: I think people use sound bites of Barack Obama all the time. But here's the truth --BARTIROMO: Nobody else has used Barack Obama the way that Michael Bloomberg has used Barack Obama in his ads --FOWLER: There's a --BARTIROMO: -- all over the ads.FOWLER: Listen, I think that's a good -- that's something that you should - - you have to ask the president about it. I think if you're going to talk - - if you talk to the Obamas, what they'll tell you is this, Barack Obama is the de facto leader of this party. He's a last popular-elected president, the most admired in the world.BARTIROMO: How come he's not endorsing anybody then?FOWLER: Because he's a leader of the party. He's going to wait until we get closer to the primaries. He's going to do what he's going to have to do to ensure the Democrats take the White House.BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, the black vote for President Trump has being gone up. We and somebody on the other day on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES," since 36 percent in some polls.PINION: Well, look, I mean, I think if you are really talking about what's going on with the African-American community, I mean, you've had democratic pundits for years, almost two years telling us that, you know, Joe Biden has this firewall in South Carolina, and they forget that the Clintons had nearly two decades of good will with the African-American community. And all it took was third place finish in Iowa for that fire wall to, you know, basically melts.So, I think when you start looking at something, what happened with Joe Biden, I think, again, we have a Fourth Place finish, followed by a fifth place finish. The number one -- you know, black voters are not a monolith. When you look at the overwhelming majority of older African American voters, not the new one woke crowd. They are looking -- their number one criteria, obviously, their only criterion is who can go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump.MCDOWELL: What happened with black voters and the Clintons, though, was what was being said, by Bill Clinton and even Hillary Clinton during 2008 when she was running for the nomination against Barack Obama.PINION: Well, that's what I'm talking about.MCDOWELL: She -- because remember when she sat down. They asked why she wouldn't drop out and she essentially alluded to do Robert Kennedy's assassination, that's her reason.PINION: Well, I'm --MCDOWELL: That was -- that sticks in the memory of many people in this country.FOWLER: When I'm talking about Hillary Clinton's collapse, I'm actually talking about 2008. I'm talking about how she finishes third place in Iowa when she is the prohibitor frontrunner. And then, again, by the time she gets to South Carolina, Barack Obama is blowing her out. And I think that is because, again, when you look at those older African-American voters, they are looking for somebody who can win. I think that's why you see the air coming out of the --FOWLER: But that's the reason why in South Carolina, Bernie is not leading. In South Carolina, when you see black voters -- black voters are from a dawn of time, they are the conscious of this country and they have been the conscious of the Democratic party. And they're going to look at every voter.They're going to look them over once, they're going to look them over twice, they're going to look them over three times. They're going to think about which candidate is most likely to win this primary, which candidate is most likely to commit independence, which candidate is most likely to give Donald Trump the best run --(CROSSTALK)FOWLER: I could -- I could tell you right now, I could almost guarantee that Bernie Sanders will have a hard time in South Carolina.PINION: But that's not the point. The point is, you have so many proportional delegates. And again, what you see over to the window is very large for African-Americans. But what it doesn't include is socialism.FOWLER: I'm glad you're a proportional delegate, because proportional delegates prove my point. As much as you guys are that Bernie is the frontrunner, what you have in this -- in this delegate race is that Pete Buttigieg is the head in delegates.PINION: That point is -- that isn't -- the point is --FOWLER: And so now it doesn't matter?PINION: No, it does matter because what we're talking about right now is a doomsday scenario for Democrats where they face a scenario --FOWLER: You want to do the scenario --PINION: For me, it could be great because again, you're sitting here looking in the scenario where Bernie Sanders walks into the - walks -- If talking about right now of Democrats faith a scenario.FOWLER: How?PINION: Because Bernie Sanders walks into the --FOWLER: How do Bernie Sanders do --PINION: Hold on. Don't interrupt.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Hold on. Hold on. Go ahead -- go ahead, Joseph.PINION: Bernie Sanders walks into a convention with the most delegates, but hasn't cleared the threshold and he walks out of convention without the nomination which is quite possible because in the same that -- how soon we forget that there are Republicans even up until before President Trump- Clinton nomination, who are trying to find ways to make sure he was not the nominee. If Bernie walks into a convention without a nomination and walks out -- and walks out clearing the threshold and walks out without the nomination, all heck is going to break lose.BARTIROMO: And by the way, some people believe the markets -- because the markets are at record highs and we keep seeing this rally underway. He just wrote a J.P. Morgan report this morning. Part of the reason is because Bernie is in the lead and they feel Bernie there's no way he can beat Donald Trump. And so, that's why the markets are rallying. That these policies stay in place of Donald Trump. What is your characterization of the African-American vote for President Trump?PINION: Well, I think if you look it right now, I think President Trump, he doesn't have to get 50 percent, doesn't have to get 99 percent. We talk about that in hyperbolic terms. But at the end of the day, if you can shave off a few points with African-American males, I mean, again I think it's twofold.Because not only is we are talking about African-American votes, we're also talking about the fact that you have soccer mothers who are not black mothers who are going to their, you know, going to their, you know, book club meetings, saying that look, look at what I -- look at African-American unemployment. He is giving nonblack voters ammunition to go out there and talk about record low -- record low --BARTIROMO: Unemployment.PINION: He's talking about all these different things as well.BARTIROMO: Go ahead, Dagen.MCDOWELL: No, I just want to hear what Richard --BARTIROMO: Richard, final word here.FOWLER: Look, I think that -- I think that there is some opportunity and I think what you see the Trump campaign doing 50 percent digital buy is going after African-American men. And I think part of the -- one of the deficits of the democratic party has, is our outreach towards African-American men we've got to do better with that.Now, with that being said, I think for the Trump campaign to win Africa -- to win this election, they have to take off two to three percent of American Americans. I think they won 10 percent in the last election. So, we're going have to see them. He has to do some work. And has to be more than look at unemployment rate is going to actually go to African-American voters --BARTIROMO: No, but when you say it's more than unemployment, what they are reacting to, in my view, are his policies.FOWLER: Yes. I also think --BARTIROMO: It is the policies of creating opportunities for different --FOWLER: I think.BARTIROMO: -- community, then there's the prison reform, with all this stuff.PINION: Democrats still have not put together an answer to these 6 million jobs are real. They pretend they're not real. Those are real families. There were two Porter Bank (ph) four years ago, then now actually can put food on their tables. And as long as they refuse to acknowledge that reality.BARTIROMO: He won't acknowledge.PINION: You know, keep talking about this fact that somehow, it is the -- it's the Obama economy. And I'm still old enough to remember, you know, it was the Clinton surplus. No one ever called it the Bush surplus.BARTIROMO: And you can't have it both ways, right? If you say the economy is not going well, then you can't have Barack Obama saying the economy is going well because of me.FOWLER: Oh no, I give -- I give -- I give the president high marks on the economy. I just think for black voters, they are voting on more than just economy. I think they're voting on issues of what's happening in their local communities. I think they are voting on what's happening in the criminal justice system.BARTIROMO: Those two things is exactly what the president is doing --FOWLER: Well, but I think it goes far beyond just -- it goes far beyond the president's bill. I think it has to do with communities of color and how they do with policing. I think there's a lot of -- the black vote is not a planning voter is not a monolithic vote and it's a very complex vote, and it's a very complex formula to get that vote. And I think if the president wants this vote, it's up -- he can get it but he has to really understand the formula and he has to go after it more than just saying the unemployment rate.MCDOWELL: And Pete Buttigieg is going to have to talk about that in his --FOWLER: I agree.MCDOWELL: His mayorship in South Bend.FOWLER: Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders both have a problem with the black vote because it's the same. They're throwing this policy prescription of the black voters like the president and not having -- not having a real conversation.PINION: He got Bloomberg in the aftermath of his very own access Hollywood meltdown. Again, when you talk about throwing him up against the wall, turns out when you have all these individuals who are offended by the locker room talk of President Trump and now suddenly they have gone mute when it comes to the accusations against Mike Bloomberg.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Nobody's talking about that too.FOWLER: I've talked about it in --PINION: I'm not talking about you, personally, but I mean, when you look at --(CROSSTALK)FOWLER: It was a very, very disgusting program.BARTIROMO: Xerox, we know the comments.PINION: And yet the polling numbers suggest that there are many African- American voters who are willing to hold their nose if they believe that he can deliver a victory.BARTIROMO: Yes. We will see. Gentlemen, great conversation.FOWLER: Good to see you.BARTIROMO: Lively there. We appreciate it. Richard Fowler, Richard Pinion, please come back soon, gentlemen. Thank you. Coming up, Groupon, is on sale for sure, the stock taking a big hit on weak earnings announcing plans to drop a slew of promotions for goods from toys to clothes. Groupon shares down to $2.15 a share, with a 30 percent sell-off this morning.Give a share for Tesla, shares of speeding, higher this morning, take a look. It is up this morning, 27 percent. We'll tell you why right after this.This week on MORNINGS WITH MARIA, tomorrow, Federal Reserve Chairman Powell says no recession on the horizon. His legendary predecessor, Alan Greenspan, offers his take. And Friday, you turn the tables on me, it's time for the audience to Ask Maria, the questions that matter the most to you. That's all right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.BARTIROMO: Welcome at Groupon, one of the big losers of the morning, down 29 percent right now. Disappointing quarterly results. Jackie DeAngelis on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with more. Jackie?JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning to you, Maria. Yes, that's a pretty ugly board when you look at it, $2.15. This is after Groupon reported fourth-quarter earnings that missed expectation, revenue missed, as well. It was an $0.08 miss. And actually, the CEO, Rich Williams, said this, he said, quote, "We did not deliver the financial performance we expected during the fourth quarter, and we recognize that we must move swiftly to put Groupon back on growth trajectory." So, all eyes on how and when they could do that.One of their big plans is to ditch providing coupons on actual things and provide them on more experiences and services. That seems to be the trend going forward. Interim CFO Melissa Thomas, she is going to take over permanently. Also, I want to draw your attention to shares of Tesla this morning, because they are trading higher. We've got an upgrade from Piper Sandler. Actually, a hike on the price target to $928 over where Tesla is trading. Bernstein hiked to 730 yesterday, Morgan Stanley to 500, still well under where we are right now, Maria.BARTIROMO: Jackie, thank you so much. Jackie DeAngelis on Wall Street. Still ahead, is your cash becoming trash? Millions of Americans have unused money hiding in their wallets. Are you one of them? We're going to check it out, next up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Hidden treasure could be right in your wallet. A new survey from Bankrate.com finds Americans are ignoring free money. The reporter reveals half of carrying around unused gift cards or store credits, with more than half holding on to cards for more than a year. Joining us right now is Bankrate.com Industry Analyst, Ted Rossman. Ted, tell us about it. I'm one of those people. I have a ton of gift cards that I never use.TED ROSSMAN, INDUSTRY ANALYST, BANKRATE.COM: I'm one of those people, too. Of those half of Americans who have unused gift cards, the average value is $167. This is real money; take advantage of it. Buy something for yourself or a family member, a friend. You can even sell it, or give it away to charity. Do something with it. It does no good if it's just gathering dust in a drawer.BARTIROMO: You do the same thing, right, Dagen? You have gift cards you never use.MCDOWELL: I don't know what it is. Just in the future, give people cash in an envelope.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: I've got a Barney's gift card in my -- it's not -- it didn't have that much money on it, but --TORRANCE: That's a lot of (INAUDIBLE)(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: -- that's not going to do any good now, is it, because --TORRANCE: I like now that you can send them via e-mail because then I can search, I can find it. A card, I mean, I can't keep all of that in my wallet and it's already truth that I'm going to lose it. But e-mail it's search --BARTIROMO: So, what should we be doing with these unused gift cards?ROSSMAN: Definitely put them to work. If you don't want to use it and you can't buy a gift for a family member or friend at that store, consider selling it. There are sites like card pool. You can get $0.70 to $0.80 on the dollar. I've done this. Do something with it.BARTIROMO: All right. Well, we will try to find them now. But Ted, thank you.ROSSMAN: Thank you.BARTIROMO: That's great advice. Ted Rossman joining us there. And I want to thank Michael Lee, Dagen, as always, Kelly Torrance, thank you. Ladies, great to see you.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: Gift cards forget about it.BARTIROMO: Right to Stuart Varney we go and "VARNEY & COMPANY".

At 52-week highs. For the quarter, organic orders declined 3% in total -- organic declines in Power and Renewable Energy of 28% and 10%, respectively, were partially countered by organic gains of +23% in Aviation and +3% in Healthcare. Ended the year with a backlog of $405 bln, up +15% yr/yr. In the quarter, co achieved Industrial free cash flow of $3.9 bln; co sees Industrial free cash flow of $2-4 bln for FY20. At 52-week highs.NSC (215.86 +5.42%): Reported upside Q4 EPS; revs fell 7.1% yr/yr to $2.69 bln, about in line with consensus. For the year, co produced a record operating ratio -- 64.7% -- amid headwinds from a 5% decline in carload volumes. For the quarter, railway operating ratio was 64.2%. Railway operating expenses decreased by $90 mln during the quarter in connection with lower compensation and benefits, fuel costs, equipment rents, and materials usage. At all-time highs.DOW (49.57 +5.11%): Topped expectations for Q4 EPS and revs. Among other results, co's largest segment, Packaging & Specialty Plastics, reported a net sales decline in connection with reduced polyethylene product prices, though volumes grew +4%, increasing in all regions but Latin America, where volume was flat; the business noted double-digit demand gains in Asia Pacific. Stranded cost removal was more than $35 mln in the quarter; free cash flow was $1.3 bln.Large Cap LosersXLNX (88.44 -10.32%): Reported Q3 results; co posted upside EPS and revs while guiding Q4 revs below consensus, citing a slowdown in 5G and wired infrastructure deployments, which creates headwinds in co's wired and wireless business that co expects to be "persistent," resulting in lower-than-expected revenue growth. Co announced cost-saving measures intended to drive structural operating efficiencies; it expects to cut its global workforce by approx. 7%, amid other measures to reduce operating expenses. Drops to its lowest levels since early December. TXG (98.83 -7.31%): Pulls back after running to a new record high during yesterday's session. The stock continues to trade higher by circa +30% month-to-date. HES (58.08 -6.5%): Missed consensus for Q4 EPS while topping expectations for revs (+0.5% yr/yr to $1.7 bln). The yr/yr decrease in co's after-tax adjusted results, said co, primarily reflects lower natural gas and natural gas liquids realized selling prices, partially offset by higher production volumes and improved Midstream earnings. Guided for oil and gas production, ex. Libya, of 330,000-335,000 boepd for 2020. At five-month lows.15:41SUMRX Earnings Out This Afternoon/Tomorrow MorningThis Afternoon: AGNC ALGN ALGT AMP ADM AZPN AXS AX BDN CACI CLS CMPR CRUS CNMD CLB CREE DLB DRE ENVA ESS EZPW FB FBHS HOLX IEX ILMN ISBC KLIC LRCX LSTR LVS LM LLNW MLNX MTH MEOH MSFT MAA MDLZ MUSA EGOV PKG PYPL QRVO SEIC NOW TSLA TTEK URI VARTomorrow Morning: FLWS ALXN ADS MO ABC APO APTV AXTA BIIB BX BGG BC CRS CMS CNXM CNX KO CTVA CFR DHR DOV DD LLY EPD BEN GWW HSY IP KIM KEX LAZ MMP MMC MDC MTOR MIXT MNRO MSCI MUR NTCT OSB NOC PH DGX RTN RFP ROP RDS.A SHW SPB SF TMO TSCO TFC UPS VLO VLY VZ WEC WCC WRK WRLD XEL15:25ECONX Fed Chair Powell Press Conference ends15:21ECONX Fed Chair Powell Conference Call- Asked about risks to financial stability; Vulnerabilities to financial system are moderate overall; Sees asset prices as 'somewhat elevated'There isn't any one financial condition that we look at, and when we look at financial conditions, what matters for the real economy is substantial changes in or material changes in financial conditions that are sustained over a period of time. financial system and that is at a comfortable level, our particular large banks have high levels of capital. The second is financial sector divided to households and businesses. Household debt to GDP is coming down since the financial crisis, it's not moving up, it's at low levels compared to what it was before the crisis, so not every household in the aggregate household debt is in a good place, a very good place. Business debt is moving up. We've been calling that out for more than a year, substantially more than a year, and it's something that we're focused on and taken appropriate measures and are monitoring carefully, but we think it's not something that will threaten financial stability but be more an amplifier. The other is asset prices. We do see asset valuations as being somewhat elevated. If you look at risk spreads they're narrow and PEs are high. The way I think about -- a good way or one way to think about equity prices though is what's the premium you're getting paid to own equities rather than risk-free debt? And that's also at fairly low level, but not extremely low level, so valuations are high but not at extremes. The final factor is funding risk or big financial institutions and other players in the financial system funded with stable funding or is there a lot of run risk? And the answer is very stable funding for the most part. So if you look at overall what you see, in my view, is vulnerabilities to the financial -- to financial stability are moderate overall15:11SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Penn Natl Gaming (PENN) gains after taking stake in Barstool Sports -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersPENN (29.62 +13.01%): Co today announced that it has agreed to acquire a 36% interest in digital sports media company Barstool Sports for approx. $163 mln in cash and convertible preferred stock; the agreement will make co Barstool Sports' exclusive gaming partner for up to 40 years, among other terms. Co believes that access to its brand will help co to "attract a new, younger demographic" to complement its existing base. After three years, co will increase its ownership to approx. 50% with an incremental investment of approx. $62 mln. At 52-week highs.LB (23.14 +12.52%): Sees volatility following reports from The Wall Street Journal that co is in discussions with Sycamore Partners to explore a full or partial sale of Victoria's Secret; long-time CEO Leslie Wexner is reportedly in talks to step aside amid the push for strategic alternatives.

At four-month highs.Mid Cap LosersSKY (31.53 -12.88%): Missed consensus for Q3 revs, which fell 3.5% yr/yr to $342.2 mln, while beating expectations slightly on the bottom line. Co sees the revenue decline as a result of its Canadian and Trucking operations and US product mix changes; US factory-built homes increased +0.3% to 5,033, but that growth was offset by a 2% decrease in average selling price per home sold, primarily due to a shift between single and multiple wide units. Sinks from yesterday's multi-year highs. SLAB (104.46 -11.85%): Reported downside Q4 EPS and revs; guided Q1 in-line with consensus. In co's largest categories, IoT and Infrastructure, which together now represent 80% of co's total revenue mix, IoT revs grew +7% yr/yr while declining 1% sequentially to $128 mln in the quarter while Infrastructure revs grew +5% yr/yr and +7% sequentially to $48 mln. Broadcast revs slid 20% yr/yr and 17% sequentially.

Touched down to two-month lows.15:09BONDX Treasury Market SummaryTreasuries Hit Fresh Highs for the WeekU.S. Treasuries rebounded from their Tuesday dip, rallying to fresh highs for the week. Treasuries started the cash session with modest gains, backtracking from their opening highs amid an upbeat start in the stock market. However, a rally to fresh highs took place after the Pending Home Sales report for December (actual -4.9%; Briefing.com consensus 1.0%) showed a sharp contraction against expectations for a solid increase. Treasuries hovered just below their mid-morning highs into the afternoon, but enjoyed another upward thrust when Fed Chairman, Jay Powell, delivered his post-FOMC remarks. The FOMC Statement itself was essentially a carbon copy of the release from December, so the market's initial response was minimal. The FOMC also announced that repurchase operations will continue through April while Chairman Powell made dovish comments, allowing Treasuries to overtake their morning highs. The 2s10s spread tightened by three basis points to 17 bps while the spread between the 3-month bill yield and the 10-yr note yield was cut in half to 3 bps. The U.S. Dollar Index returned to little changed at 98.05 in the afternoon after surrendering a slim gain. Yield Check: 2-yr: -4 bps to 1.42% 3-yr: -4 bps to 1.40% 5-yr: -5 bps to 1.42% 10-yr: -5 bps to 1.59% 30-yr: -4 bps to 2.05%News: The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in China approached 6,000 with total deaths reaching 132. European Central Bank policymaker Olli Rehn said that the eurozone GDP could grow up to 1.5% in 2020 if negative risks don't materialize. Greece sold six-month debt at a negative yield. Japan's January Household Confidence remained at 39.1 (expected 40.8). South Korea's January Consumer Confidence rose to 104.2 from 100.5 (expected 97.5). Australia's Q4 CPI increased 0.7% qtr/qtr (expected 0.6%; last 0.5%), rising 1.8% yr/yr (expected 1.7%; last 1.7%). Germany's December Import Price Index increased 0.2% m/m (expected 0.3%; last 0.5%) but was down 0.7% yr/yr (expected -0.6%; last -2.1%). February GfK Consumer Climate rose to 9.9 from 9.7 (expected 9.6). France's January Consumer Confidence rose to 104 from 102 (expected 102). Italy's December PPI was unchanged m/m (expected -0.1%; last -0.3%), falling 2.1% yr/yr (expected -2.4%; last -2.6%). January Business Confidence rose to 99.9 from 99.3 (expected 99.3) while Consumer Confidence rose to 111.8 from 110.8 (expected 110.5). Spain's December Retail Sales rose 1.7% yr/yr (expected 2.2%; last 2.5%). Today's Data: Pending Home Sales fell 4.9% in December (Briefing.com consensus 1.0%) after increasing 1.2% in November.

Secondly, a flat Phillips curve by which I means low levels of sensitivity of inflation to resource utilization, for example, low unemployment. And thirdly, a much lower neutral real interest rate here and around the world. So, those are challenging conditions for monetary policy to deliver on our statutory goals of maximum employment and stable prices; although, I would say that under our existing framework, we've been able to succeed or get close to succeeding most of the time lately to achieve those goals, although we do struggle as other central banks do with the inflation goal.Coronavirus- There is likely to be some disruption to activity in China and possibly globally based on the spread of the virus to date in travel restrictions and business closures that have already been imposed. Of course, the situation is really in its early stages and it's very uncertain about how far it will spread and what the macro economic effects will be in China and immediate trading partners and neighbors and around the world. In light of that uncertainty, I'm not going to speculate about it at this point. I will just tell you that, of course, we are very carefully monitoring the situation and, you know, as you suggested, our framework ultimately is what are the potential ramifications for the U.S. economy and for the achievement of our dual mandate.Climate Issues- Says it is an important issue but it is an issue assigned to other agencies. Says it will probably join in with the other 40 central banks involved in the greening of the financial system. Trade policy uncertainty remains elevated; Business continue to identify it as an issue; The issue 'has not gone away'; says positive developments but in a wait and see mode to see if this can be maintained.14:47ECONX Fed Chair Powell Conference Call- $1.5 trl will be bottom end of the range for reserves -Technical-Says that it is not trying to remove volatility from the repo market.Reserve commentary- 'need reserves at all times to be no lower than they were in early September, and I would say around 1.5 trillion, subject to learning more. Reserves are going to move in a broad range as I mentioned, and we want to be clear that that will be the bottom end of the range. We want 1.5 trillion or there abouts to be the bottom end of the range, so most of the time reserves will be moving in a range substantially higher than that, but not going below 1.5 trillion, so it's not something that we're aiming at all the time'.14:41ECONX Fed Chair Powell Conference Call- Reiterates Fed not comfortable with inflation running below 2%"As bill purchases continue to purchase reserves toward levels that maintain ample conditions, the role paid by active repo operations will recede. Over the first half of this year, we intend to adjust the size and pricing of repo pricing as we transition away from active use in supplying reserves.""Intend to slow the pace of repos as it expects to reach an ample level in Q."Asked about the small change in language around inflation ("inflation returning to the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective")- "December Minutes, we noted that a few Committee Members stated the language that supported monetary policy would support inflation near 2% could be misinterpreted as suggesting that policymakers were comfortable with inflation running below that level. So, we thought about that in the intervening period, and concluded that it would be appropriate to adjust that language to send a clearer signal that we're not comfortable with inflation rising or running persistently below our 2% symmetric objective, so yes, there is something in that."14:35ECONX Fed Chair Powell Conference CallGrowth in household spending moderated toward the end of last year, but with a healthy job market, rising incomes, and upbeat consumer confidence, the fundamental supporting household spending are solid. In contrast, business investment and exports remain weak and manufacturing output has declined over the past year. Sluggish growth abroad and trade developments have been weighing on activity in these sectors. However, some of the uncertainties around the trade have diminished recently and there are some signs that global growth may be stabilizing after declining since mid-2018. Nonetheless, uncertainties about the outlook remain, including those posed by the new coronavirus. Overall, with monetary and financial conditions supportive, we expect moderate economic growth to continue.Available data suggests similar inflation readings for December, though we expect inflation to move closer to 2% over the next few months as unusually low readings from early 2019 drop out of the calculation. While lowand stable inflation is a good thing, below our objective can have longer term inflation objectives to drift down and pulling actual inflation even lower. In turn, interest rates would be lower as well, closer to their effective lower bound. As a result, we would have less room to reduce interest rates to support the economy in a future downturn to the detriment of American families and businesses. We have seen this dynamic play out in other economies around the world and we're determined to avoid it here in the United States.In light of the stability in the Federal Funds Rate and money market conditions generally we decided to make a small technical upward adjustment to administered funds to ensure the federal funds rate trades well within the target range.14:32COMDX Energy Settlement PricesMar Crude Oil futures fell $0.35 (-0.65%) to $53.27/barrel Mar Natural Gas $0.04 lower (-2.04%) at $1.869/MMBtu Mar RBOB Gasoline settled $0.02 higher (1.5%) at $1.5402/gallon Mar Heating oil futures settled $0.02 lower (-0.96%) at $1.7035/gallon14:31ECONX Fed Chair Powell conference call under way14:21PNM PNM Resources says request for a stay of the ETA case was denied; Court granted the joint petition, confirming the applicability of the ETA and requiring the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (NMPRC) to apply the ETA to all of PNM's application (stock remains halted) (54.47 +0.15)Today the New Mexico Supreme Court ruled on a joint Emergency Verified Petition from New Mexico Governor Lujan Grisham, Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez, Speaker of the New Mexico House of Representatives Brian Egolf and other New Mexico lawmakers to provide clarification about the applicability of the Energy Transition Act (ETA) to PNM's application for San Juan Generating Station abandonment, securitization and replacement power.The Court granted the joint petition, confirming the applicability of the ETA and requiring the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (NMPRC) to apply the ETA to all of PNM's application. The Court further noted that any previous NMPRC orders inconsistent with today's order should be vacated. The request for a stay of the case was denied.The NMPRC is expected to provide a final order on the abandonment and securitization portion of PNM's filing by April 1, 2020.14:09ECONX Implementation Note Changes- Fed will remain in the repo market until April of 2020 (Previous was January 2020)The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to set the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances at 1.60 percent, effective January 30, 2020... Dec 11- The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances at 1.55 percent, effective December 12, 2019.Reaffirms- In light of recent and expected increases in the Federal Reserve's non-reserve liabilities, the Committee directs the Desk to continue purchasing Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of 2020 to maintain over time ample reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September 2019. The Committee also directs the Desk to continue conducting term and overnight repurchase agreement operations at least through April 2020 to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample even during periods of sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation... Dec 11- The Committee also directs the Desk to continue conducting term and overnight repurchase agreement operations at least through January 2020 to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample even during periods of sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation. In addition, the Committee directs the Desk to conduct overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 1.50 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day... Dec 11- In addition, the Committee directs the Desk to conduct overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 1.45 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day.Reaffirms- Principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities up to $20 billion per month will continue to be reinvested in Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding; principal payments in excess of $20 billion per month will continue to be reinvested in agency mortgage-backed securities.14:00ECONX FOMC leaves rates unchanged at 1.50-1.75% as widely expected"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Although household spending has been rising at a moderate pace, business fixed investment and exports remain weak. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.""Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. The Committee judges that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation returning to the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective. The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including global developments and muted inflation pressures, as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate.""In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.""Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michelle W. Bowman; Lael Brainard; Richard H. Clarida; Patrick Harker; Robert S. Kaplan; Neel Kashkari; Loretta J. Mester; and Randal K. Quarles."14:00ECONX FOMC leaves rates unchanged as widely expected; Economic activity has been rising at a moderate rateJan 15 Beige Book- Economic activity generally continued to expand modestly in the final six weeks of 2019.December 11 Statement- economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate.13:49COMDX Metals Settlement PricesFeb gold settled today's session down $0.20 (0.01%) at $1569.8/oz Mar silver settled today's session $0.02 higher (0.09%) at $17.465/oz Mar copper settled $0.02 lower (0.97%) at $2.557/lb13:49LVS Las Vegas Sands Q4 earnings preview (65.13 +0.72)Las Vegas Sands (LVS) will report fourth quarter earnings tonight after the close at approximately 16:05 ET.There is a conference call scheduled for 16:30 ET. Q4 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $0.78 (+3% yr/yr) on revenue of $3.37 bln (-2.6% yr/yr). The company typically does not provide EPS or revenue guidance. LVS gets 65% of its revenue of Macau, while its Las Vegas operations only make up 12% of revenues. The first item of interest will be any commentary on impact from the coronavirus outbreak in China. October Macau gross gaming revenues fell 3.2% yr/yr, November gaming revenues fell 8.5% yr/yr, and December gaming revenues fell 13.7% yr/yr. The decline in gross revenues in December was deemed to be primarily a function of increased security for President Xi's visit to Macau to mark the anniversary of its handover to China, which impeded normal casino traffic.Looking back, the company beat EPS and revenues once out of the last four quarters. LVS has a $51 bln valuation and trades at 19x 2020 versus Wynn Resorts (WYNN) which trades at 22 times earnings.Based on the LVS Jan31 $65 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~5% in either direction by weekly expiration (Friday, January 31).13:48XLI Sector Briefing: Industrials (83.45 +0.95)Apple (AAPL 326.61, +8.92, +2.8%) has commanded a lot of attention as a key driver of today's market action. That is an accurate characterization, yet it is the S&P industrials sector (+1.2%) that is the top-performing sector today.The strength in the industrials sector isn't rooted so much in optimism about the economic outlook so much as it is rooted in the trading responses to earnings results from several companies in the sector. In brief, it is a bottom-up bounce today, fueled by some better-than-expected results and/or some better-than-feared results/guidance. It hasn't been all good, however.Notable Movers:Boeing (BA 324.59, +8.03, +2.5%): Reported a huge Q4 loss of ($2.33) per share, which was worse than expected; however, analysts citing some relief that charges were not as large as expected and that the mid-2020 737 MAX service target date was maintained.General Electric (GE 12.92, +1.19, +10.1%): Posted better-than-expected Q4 EPS result, but issued downside EPS guidance for FY20. Analysts and investors, however, applauding improved cash flow generation in quarter and pleasing FY20 free cash flow guidance range of $2-4 billion.Norfolk Southern (NSC 217.69, +12.93, +6.4%): Railroad operator easily exceeded Q4 EPS estimate. Revenues were down 7.1% yr/yr, but analysts highlighting better-than-expected railway operating ratio of 64.2%.Alaska Airlines (ALK 66.99, +1.45, +2.2%): Topped Q4 consensus EPS estimate on a 7.9% increase in revenue; company also raised its dividend by 7% to $0.375 per share.Ingersoll-Rand (IR 134.33, +3.55, +2.7%): Fell short of Q4 consensus EPS estimate with operating margin slipping to 12.5% from 12.9% in same period a year ago.C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW 73.06, -4.82, -6.2%): Came up well short of Q4 consensus EPS estimate with higher expenses hurting; company also announced acquisition of Prime Distribution Services for ~$225 million in cash.General Dynamics (GD 183.65, +0.01, +0.01%): Traded lower after exceeding revenue and EPS estimates for Q4, but found support at its 200-day moving average (179.86) and has recovered all of its earlier losses.Stanley Black & Decker (SWK 162.81, -3.54, -2.1%): Came up shy of consensus Q4 revenue and EPS estimates. FY20 adjusted EPS guidance of $8.80-9.00 was shy of analysts' average estimate.13:12OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:APT Feb 7.5 calls (volume: 1500, open int: 33601, implied vol: ~182%, prev day implied vol: 173%).

The S&P 500 (+0.3%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%), and Nasdaq Composite (+0.3%) sport modest gains in this earnings-driven session.Besides Apple, which is the Dow's highest-priced component, the blue-chip average can credit its slight advantage to positive earnings reactions in Boeing (BA 323.68, +7.12, +2.3%), McDonald's (MCD 312.94, +3.65, +2.3%), and Dow Inc (DOW 49.59, +2.43, +5.1%). Former Dow component General Electric (GE 12.97, +1.23) is up 10.5% following its results.Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are trading higher, led by the industrials (+1.0%), materials (+0.6%), and information technology (+0.6%) sectors. The communication services sector (-0.4%) is among the laggards amid a poor response to AT&T's (T 37.17, -1.41, -3.6%) earnings results.Transports, meanwhile, are rallying around an earnings beat from Norfolk Southern (NSC 217.66, +12.90, +6.3%), while the semiconductor space is succumbing to profit taking after AMD (AMD 46.92, -3.61, -7.2%) and Xilinx (XLNX 89.11, -9.50, -9.6%) provided disappointing quarterly revenue guidance.Earnings have been the focus so far, but attention will start to divert toward the Fed when it releases its policy directive at 2:00 p.m. ET. The fed funds rate is widely expected to remain unchanged, and investors will presumably be listening intently during Fed Chair Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET.Separately, there appears to be lingering concerns about the coronavirus and its impact on corporate earnings growth, especially after Starbucks (SBUX 86.02, -3.58, -2.9%) said it will temporarily close half of its stores in China amid the outbreak. Shares are trading lower, while an uptick in Treasury demand has the 10-yr yield down two basis points to 1.62%.In other corporate news, Facebook (FB 223.38, +5.64, +2.6%) was upgraded to Strong Buy from Outperform at Raymond James ahead of its earnings after the close. Shares of L Brands (LB 23.18, +2.62, +12.8%) are up 13% after The Wall Street Journal reported that CEO Leslie Wexner is aiming to step down amid a push for strategic alternatives.Reviewing today's economic data:Pending Home Sales unexpectedly fell 4.9% in December (Briefing.com consensus +1.0%).

EBITDA outlook to $49-53 mln from prior guidance for $38-46 mln. The update results from lower input costs, timing of certain expenses, and strong business execution. Also appointed Arsen S. Kitch, co's SVP and general manager for its consumer products division, as its next CEO, effective at the start of April; Mr. Kitch succeeds Linda K. Massman, who will retire after having served as CEO since 2013. At ten-month highs.MTSI (30.58 +16.41%): Reaches its new highest levels in close to two years after reporting Q1 results. Co topped consensus for Q1 EPS and revs and issued upside guidance for Q2. Revs fell 21.0% yr/yr to $119.1 mln, which represents a +6.1% increase sequentially. Adj. gross margin also increased sequentially, reaching 53.5% vs 53.0% in the prior fiscal quarter, down from 56.3% in the year ago quarter. During its call, co credited demand for 5G products among motivators for sequential growth in its Telecom end market.ARAY (4.28 +13.53%): Announced Q2 results. Co reported net orders growth of +30% yr/yr to $89.9 mln and gross orders of $98.6 mln, including 11 orders from China; total backlog increased +12% yr/yr to $539.4 mln. Co expects revenue growth to improve in the second half of the year, as it believes that revenue recognition of China Type A systems will begin in co's fiscal Q4. Raised FY20 adj. EBITDA guidance. Reaches nine-month highs.Small Cap LosersI (4.15 -23.66%): Sees weakness after the Senate introduced bipartisan legislation pertaining to an auction for C-band satellite spectrum airwaves; the bill would reportedly offer limited payout to co and other satellite operators and C-Band Alliance peers. Bloomberg Law also points to reports that the FCC chairman's office is in favor of a set incentive payment structure, with the set payment floated at $5 bln, as further cause for today's weakness. The C-Band Alliance's stance, as of a letter addressed to the FCC earlier this week, includes the argument that it "simply [does] not have the flexibility to proceed" in assisting spectrum transition and adopting accelerated clearing "unless [it is] offered the opportunity to share fairly and appropriately in the value being created through [its] tremendous [...] efforts," and it believes, favoring a variable payment, that "such sharing is most easily expressed through a formula directly tied to the actual realized proceeds of any C-band auction." The stock, which had traded in a relatively narrow range since plunging lower on C-band developments in November, now reaches its new lowest levels in more than a year. CMTL (29.9 -19.41%): To acquire Gilat Satellite (GILT) in a transaction with an enterprise value of approx. $532.5 mln -- the total consideration amounts to $10.25/share, or $7.18/share in cash and 0.08425 of a share of co's common stock per GILT share held. The consideration represents a premium of approx. +14.52% to Gilat's 90-day weighted average trading price. Co believes that the transaction positions it to capitalize on growing demand for satellite connectivity and long-term opportunities emerging in the secure wireless communications market. Co is not revising its previously announced FY financial outlook but will provide combined guidance in a future announcement once the transaction closes. At three-month lows. EXTR (6.51 -10.4%): Reported in-line Q2 EPS and downside revs (+5.9% yr/yr to $267.5 mln). Co attributes its Q2 revenue shortfall to weakness in the US public sector and Asia Pacific. Guided Q3 EPS and revs below consensus. Impacting co's revenue guidance are limits to near-term visibility to US public sector funding, certain areas of weakness in US service provider and retail verticals, and co's outlook in the Asia Pacific region, noted co during its call. Touched down to two-month lows.11:38BLK BlackRock increases quarterly dividend to $3.63/share from $3.30/share (537.12 +7.15)11:38SMH Industry Briefing: Chipmakers (142.93 -2.32)The PHLX Semiconductor Index (-1.9%) trades behind the broader market, widening this week's loss to 3.4%.

The former was better than expected while the latter was basically better than feared. Still, the follow through from the broader market has been lacking.Some other factors at work that have kept the broader market in check include:Weakness in the semiconductor space after Adv.

The company has cancelled three sailings through Feb 8, on the high yielding Spectrum of the Seas, currently its only ship homeported in China. Co estimates that this (which included the Chinese new year's cruises) will impact 2020 financial results by approximately $0.10 per share. If the travel restrictions in China continue until the end of February, the company estimates that this would further impact its results by an additional $0.10 per share. There are still too many variables and uncertainties regarding this outbreak to calculate the overall impact on the business. For example, co expects an erosion of consumer confidence in China could have an additional impact on load factor and rate in the region until the market normalizes. If these travel restrictions continue for an extended period of time, they could have a material impact on overall financial performance.

CytoSorb is the only approved therapy to remove ticagrelor in the EU, and it is intended to address a major unmet medical need of potentially life-threatening postoperative bleeding in cardiothoracic surgery patients on the drug.COO Vincent Capponi said, "With the approval of CytoSorb for this indication, it may encourage a preference in the selection of ticagrelor [...] as a first-line therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome, given that roughly 10-15% of these patients, or approximately 110,000-165,000 patients in the U.S., and approximately 70,000-100,000 patients in Europe each year will require emergent or urgent cardiac surgery and will be at high risk of bleeding. Now that we can officially market this application on-label internationally, we plan to drive CytoSorb as standard of care for the removal of ticagrelor during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures in every country we serve [...]. In addition, we are aggressively pursuing an approval path for this application in the United States as well."Ticagrelor is marketed by Astra Zeneca (AZN) and sold under the tradenames Brilique in the EU and Brilinta in the US, with projected worldwide sales of more than $1.5 bln in 2019, with more than half of sales coming from Europe, emerging markets, and rest of world.07:33HES Hess misses by $0.12, beats on revs (62.12 )Reports Q4 (Dec) loss of $0.60 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.12 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.48); revenues rose 0.5% year/year to $1.69 bln vs the $1.54 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.07:31PTC PTC to offer $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2025 and senior notes due 2028 in a private offering that is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (84.41 )PTC expects to use $530 million of the net proceeds of the offering of the notes to redeem all $500 million of its outstanding 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024, including the payment of premium and accrued and unpaid interest thereon, on or about May 15, 2020.

The Nasdaq Composite led the rebound with a 1.4% gain, while the S&P 500 (+1.0%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), and Russell 2000 (+0.9%) followed behind.The day began with modest gains, as the market looked past disappointing earnings reports from 3M (MMM 165.56, -10.07, -5.7%) and Pfizer (PFE 38.14, -2.02, -5.0%), then stocks climbed higher soon after the Conference Board released its Consumer Confidence Index for January. That index rose to 131.6 (Briefing.com consensus 128.0) from 128.2 in December.All 11 S&P 500 sectors contributed to the rally, including five that rose at least 1.0%. The information technology sector (+1.9%) led the charge on the back of Apple (AAPL 317.69, +8.74, +2.8%), which was set to release its earnings report after the close.

STS101 is currently being evaluated as an acute treatment for migraine in an ongoing Phase 3 efficacy trial (the EMERGE trial), for which Satsuma expects to report top-line data in the second half of this year.16:08OSIS OSI Systems beats by $0.04, misses on revs; guides FY20 EPS in-line, revs below consensus (96.30 +1.58)Reports Q2 (Dec) earnings of $1.27 per share, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.23; revenues rose 0.7% year/year to $305.34 mln vs the $316.75 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Book-to-bill ratio was 1.1x.Co's backlog at the end of 2019 was $886 mln compared to $911 mln as of June 30, 2019.Co issues guidance for FY20, raises EPS guidance to $4.63 to $4.85 from $4.61 to $4.83 vs. $4.71 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; lowers FY20 revs guidance to $1.205 bln to $1.240 bln from $1.238 bln to $1.273 vs. $1.25 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.16:07SBUX Starbucks beats by $0.03, reports revs in-line; reaffirms FY20 EPS guidance, revs guidance (88.60 -0.13)Reports Q1 (Dec) earnings of $0.79 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.76; revenues rose 7.0% year/year to $7.1 bln vs the $7.11 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Global comparable store sales up 5% (vs 4.3% estimate), driven by a 3% increase in average ticket and a 2% increase in comparable transactions Americas comparable store sales up 6%, driven by a 3% increase in average ticket and a 2% increase in comparable transactions; U.S. comparable store sales up 6%, with comparable transactions up 3% International comparable store sales up 1%, driven by a 2% increase in average ticket and a 1% decrease in comparable transactions; China comparable store sales up 3%, with comparable transactions up 1% Co reaffirms guidance for FY20, sees EPS of $3.00-3.05, excluding non-recurring items, vs. $3.05 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees FY20 revs +6-8% (implying $28.1-28.6 bln) vs. $28.41 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Co also reaffirmed guidance for comps +3-4%Co states, "Currently, we have closed more than half of our stores in China and continue to monitor and modify the operating hours of all of our stores in the market in response to the outbreak of the coronavirus.

On the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, the information technology sector rose 1% in afternoon trade, and the financials group moved up nearly 1%.Wall Street appeared to take its cue from Asian markets, which advanced overnight as investors hunted for bargains among shares beaten down in the wake of the virus outbreak. As well, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said it will link factories with technology companies that can help them identify problems in their supply chains, according to the Wall Street Journal. Factories in the country have been hard hit in part as the Chinese government ordered them to close to limit the spread of the respiratory illness.Apple (AAPL) shares rose 5%. The Dow component this week said a slowdown in Chinese sales and production would lead it to miss its fiscal second-quarter revenue forecast. Among other tech risers, chipmaker Intel (INTC) rose 0.7% and Amazon.com (AMZN) picked up 1%.Meanwhile, Hong Kong is set to roll out a HK$30 billion ($3.86 billion) relief program to aid all industries, according to the South China Morning Post, citing a document released to lawmakers late Wednesday local time.The global coronavirus death toll has surpassed 2,000 and more than 75,000 people have been infected.Among corporate movers, Tesla (TSLA) climbed 9% after Piper Sandler raised its price target on the electric car maker to $928 from $729 and reiterated its overweight rating.

US Stocks Reach Session Lows in Midday Trade as Facebook Drops, Coronavirus China Infections Outpace SARS CasesMT Newswires Live Briefs PROJanuary 30, 2020 Thursday 1:16 PM ESTCopyright 2020 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 354 wordsBody US stocks fell Thursday afternoon, hurt as investors consider the worsening impact of coronavirus developments on the Chinese economy while a fall in Facebook (FB) shares dragged on technology. All of Wall Street's major indexes were in the red during midday trade. Eight of 11 sectors on the Standard & Poor's 500 fell, with the communications services group pacing decliners with a 1.7% drop. The utilities sector, considered a defensive group, gained some ground.The Nasdaq Composite fell nearly 1%, with Facebook shares down more than 6% as investors appeared to be disappointed by sequential revenue growth at the social media heavyweight.The broader market was weighed down by China's update on Thursday that it raised the coronavirus death toll to 170. That marked a jump of 38 deaths in 24 hours, according to the Associated Press, which also said more than 7,700 cases have been reported in China. Now, more people have contracted the coronavirus than the tally from the SARS virus in 2002 and 2003. In that outbreak, more than 8,000 people were infected globally, killing 774, according to the World Health Organization."In our view, the worst is yet to come," said economists at Nomura in a note. "Based on our study of the coronavirus' characteristics and the Chinese government's responses thus far, we reckon the coronavirus could deal a more severe blow to China's economy in the near term relative to SARS in 2003."WHO officials are expected on Thursday to decide whether to declare the coronavirus a global health emergency. Last week, the organization declined to make such a declaration. The spreading virus has now reached 20 countries, according to ABC News.Among corporate movers, Eli Lilly (LLY) shares gained about 2% after the drug maker's fourth-quarter results came in ahead of Wall Street's expectations.Altria Group (MO) fell 6% as the tobacco company's fourth-quarter revenue of $4.8 billion fell short of expectations and the company booked a charge related to its investment in e-cigarette maker Juul.In midday action, the Nasdaq dropped 0.7% and the S&P 500 lost 0.7%.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, January 28th.Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.The coronavirus outbreak is spreading. At least 106 people killed in China. Now people are being monitored in 26 states here in the U.S. We're taking a look at the impact on business as many corporations are making major changes to their operations in and around China.Markets this morning are higher, set for a higher opening for the broader averages after yesterday's big selloff. Take a look, we're at the highs of the morning right now. Dow Industrials up 119 points, almost one half of 1 percent. The Nasdaq up 62 and the S&P up 15.5. This is due to some better than expected earnings that we just saw coming out.Intensifying fears over coronavirus sparked a selloff yesterday. All three major indices down about 1.5 percent apiece. The Dow is now negative for 2020.Global markets this morning look like this. European indices are higher. The FT 100 up 22 points. The CAC in Paris is up 17. The DAX index in Germany higher by 10.5.In Asia overnight, markets finished like this. You know that markets in China and Hong Kong remain closed. The People's Bank of China announcing earlier that it is extending the lunar new year market holiday until Monday.Earnings are in focus this morning. We have already heard from three Dow components so far this morning. United Technologies shares this morning are flat. It had better than expected results.3M missed analyst expectations. As you can see there, the stock is down. It announced 1,500 job cuts as well. That stock right now down, as you can see on 3M, almost 2 percent, better than 2 percent.Pfizer reporting moments ago. It beat analyst expectations on revenue but missed on earnings. And that stock is also down 1.5 percent.The one everybody is watching tonight is Apple. Everything you need to know ahead of its first quarter report, especially for the stock after it doubled over the past year. That stock is up 1 percent this morning, better than $3 a share higher.All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.And joining me to break it all down, "New York Post" editorial board member Kelly Torrance is here, Fox Business' Dagen McDowell and Forbes Media chairman, former Republican presidential candidate, Steve Forbes.Great to see everybody this morning.STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Good to be with you.KELLY TORRANCE, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER, "THE NEW YORK POST": Thank you.BARTIROMO: We have a lot to talk about today.Here are some of the top stories that we are watching right now.The investigation into the chopper crash that killed Kobe Bryant and eight others is underway. Officials say that it appears the pilot may have plunged into the California hillside in an attempt to avoid heavy fog. Kobe's death sparking tributes across the country, with the NBA Hall of Fame inducting him as part of its 2020 class. And the Empire State Building honoring the fallen legend with gold and purple lights.Federal prosecutors, meanwhile, in New York are looking to investigate Prince Andrew as part of their investigation into disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEOFFREY BERMAN, U.S. ATTORNEY: He publicly offered, indeed in a press release, offered to cooperate with law enforcement investigating the crimes committed by Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators.Prince Andrew has provided zero cooperation.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: You remember that Prince Andrew has since stepped back from his royal duties. He's denied any wrongdoing in this case.Britain reportedly expected to allow Huawei to build parts of its 5G network. The decision will likely disappoint the Trump administration which has said Huawei spies on the U.S. Washington has threatened to stop sharing intelligence with Britain if the U.K. government approve that deal. Secretary Pompeo told us that about a year ago.Finally this morning, Mattel expanding its iconic Barbie dolls. These dolls are part of the company's Fashionista's line. One of the Barbie's has a prosthetic limb, while another one has no hair. Mattel says it hopes that these will represent global diversity and inclusivity.Well, the coronavirus spreading worldwide with over 4,500 diagnosed.Grady Trimble is live in Chicago this morning with the very latest on that.Grady, good morning to you.GRADY TRIMBLE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria.The CDC and State Department are urging Americans to reconsider non- essential travel to China and they're telling people not to travel at all to the Hube (ph) province where the outbreak started.This comes as the death toll in China rises overnight to 106 people with more than 4,500 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the country. Hong Kong and Russia also putting travel restrictions to China in place and people in Wuhan, they're still quarantined and required to stay there to try to contain the virus.Still, the CDC says the virus has now spread to 16 countries, that's up from 13 over the weekend. Here in the United States, five people have the virus. That hasn't changed since over the weekend. All five patients contracted the virus while traveling in China, not here in the U.S. The CDC is monitoring a total of 110 people for the virus and they say the chances of catching it here in the states is still low, but we're not out of the woods.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. NANCY MESSONNIER, DIRECTOR, NCIRD: I do think we're going to have additional cases. We may have cases among close contacts. And we may have some human to human transmission. But the risk right now to the American public is low. And so I don't think people need to be ordering those masks.(END VIDEO CLIP)TRIMBLE: In just a few hours, the secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, will hold a press conference with CDC officials where they will address the public health response here in the United States to the coronavirus.Maria.BARTIROMO: All right, Grady, thank you. We'll, of course, be watching that.Grady Trimble joining us there.Meanwhile, the coronavirus also having an effect on business in a big way. The Walt Disney Company, McDonald's, Starbucks, Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises all suspending some operations in the affected areas in China due to this outbreak. Then you've got Delta Airlines offering travel waivers for anybody traveling to Beijing or China from the United States.This is precisely why the market sold off yesterday, Steve Forbes, because if you see business come to a halt in China, that's going to affect the global economy.FORBES: It does affect the global economy. We are integrated, even though we have these trade spats from time to time. And -- but that's actually a good thing longer term for the economy because these are preventative measures, making sure this thing doesn't spread. China was a little slow off the mark. Now it's realized it's got a big problems on their hands.What's different between this and the Ebola thing is, this is easier to get, this virus, than the Ebola virus was. And so that's the real threat. And so the very fact people are taking preventative measures now, yes, the Chinese economy will take a big hit. I don't know if they're going to fully reveal it. But the fact of the matter is, this is good for later this year when this thing finally tapers off.MCDOWELL: Well, "The Wall Street Journal" editorial talks about the danger of a draconian lockdown, those are "The Journal's" words, by China if they can't get this under control, that would trigger a recession, which would completely offset the reason for doing the trade deal with the United States.And in terms of the infection, there's one report that one patient infected 14 hospital staff members in Wuhan. Epidemiologists estimate that each infected individual would transmit the illness to two or three others, but doctors, they're called super spreaders. This is in "The Journal" editorial, can pass the virus to more than a dozen people.So, again, it's trying to get -- get your arms around it.And this is a company that still has a tuberculosis rate that's three times higher than Mexico, even though it's fallen in recent years. And there are -- there is a desperate shortage of general practitioners. We talk about all these advancements in health in China, but they haven't focused on the basic necessities of the Chinese people in some of these more rural areas.FORBES: Well, we --BARTIROMO: And we knew that from the swine flu.MCDOWELL: Exactly.BARTIROMO: You know, I reported there were 250 million sick pigs in China because of the swine flu. In some cases, they just went ahead and sent those pigs to the slaughterhouse and made meat because apparently they said you can't get sick from a diseased pig.MCDOWELL: But also they ordered Beijing -- this is the problem with a centrally planned communist government -- Beijing was compensating farmers to cull these hogs out of their herds, get rid of the culled -- the sick pigs out of the herds. But the -- the -- what they were giving the farmers was so little, they would make a lot more money selling these sick hogs into the market.BARTIROMO: Yes. Exactly. So they just sold them into the market.MCDOWELL: Right.BARTIROMO: Well, that's just extraordinary.TORRANCE: And one of the problems I think is that there's no -- there's no -- you know, the government has no accountability.BARTIROMO: That's right.TORRANCE: And people cannot vote it out and they can basically get away with this. We even heard the mayor of Wuhan admitting that officials did not do a good job in letting people know what was going on.BARTIROMO: Yes, that was certainly the case with SARS, for sure. But I think they -- they're a little more transparent this time. But, who knows, you're right.MCDOWELL: But they still had these wild animal markets wide open.BARTIROMO: That's right.MCDOWELL: And the -- SARS originated with, what, bats and rodents.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: And this is the same problem. But they didn't want to shut them down because it might make the people angry.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's right. And these open spaces, these open markets is the issue here. It's just really -- it's hard to think about.We have this breaking news, though, I've got to switch gears.The U.K. says Huawei will have a limited role in the country's 5G network. Officials are saying that the technology can be used but will be excluded from all safety related and safety critical networks. It will also be excluded from sensitive locations, such as nuclear sites and military bases.So Huawei is allowing -- I'm sorry, the U.K. is allowing Huawei in on a limited basis. We'll see how the Trump administration reacts to this. Remember when Secretary Pompeo was in this studio a year ago and he said to us -- I sat down with him on a one-on-one and he said, look, Huawei has opened back doors. The back doors meaning all of the data that your -- is in a Huawei product, like a phone or their infrastructure, is going right back to the Chinese government and we will be forced to share less information with any European country that does business with Huawei.They're saying it's a limited space here but --TORRANCE: Can you limit it? I mean that's, I think, the real question. And I've heard experts say that you can try, but once they're in the network, you can't limit it basically. So --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: You're not -- you're no longer in control once that technology is in your -- in your technological framework.FORBES: Like half pregnant. You're either in or you're out.BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes. That's right.Well, we'll see. We're probably going to get a response from the administration. The U.K. says Huawei will have a limited role in 5G.Coming up this morning, Apple earnings are in focus. The company reporting later this afternoon. What to expect. How is that going to impact markets?And then this from Cover Girl to boss. How supermodel Kathy Ireland found success in the business world. She is here.And we are previewing the big game. We're looking at the Kansas City Chiefs' ownership ahead of my interview with the 9er's CEO Jed York. That's tomorrow. Don't miss that special interview coming up tomorrow.But first, defending the president. How the commander in chief's defense team is arguing their case.And then honoring rescue animals. One state makes them their official pet, ahead.Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Well, the impeachment trial turning to the Bidens. President Trump's defense team took the offensive yesterday, calling out the former vice president and his son for alleged misconduct in Ukraine.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ALAN DERSHOWITZ, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DEFENSE TEAM: Nothing in the Bolton revelations, even if true, would rise to the level of an abuse of power or an impeachable offense.ERIC HERSCHMANN, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DEFENSE TEAM: Why did Burisma want Hunter Biden on its board? Why did they want to pay him millions of dollars? Well, he did have one qualification, he was the son of the vice president of the United States. He was the son of the man in charge of the Ukrainian portfolio for the prior administration.KEN STARR, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DEFENSE TEAM: Instead of a once in a century phenomenon, which it had been, presidential impeachment has become a weapon to be wielded against one's political opponent.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Colorado Congressman, House Judiciary Committee member, along with Foreign Affairs Committee member, Ken Buck.Congressman, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.REP. KEN BUCK, (R-CO): Good morning.BARTIROMO: Characterize the defense team yesterday. What did you hear?BUCK: Well, I heard a very clear case that if the Senate calls witnesses, Joe Biden is going to be embarrassed and the Obama administration is going to be embarrassed for their role in this whole Ukrainian episode.BARTIROMO: Do you think that's the right tack here in terms of the president's defense? This -- look, you want witnesses, fine, we'll have these witnesses and then we want those witnesses. I mean this opens up a whole can of worms and it possibly, as you suggest, could be bad for the prosecution.BUCK: Well, I think the real problem here is the House Democrats didn't do their job. They didn't go to court. They didn't force witnesses into the House. And so we don't know exactly what's going to be said, if Senate witnesses are called.The House Democrats called 18 different witnesses. The House Republicans got zero. No chance to call a witness. If the Senate does call witnesses, they should not do a one for one trade on witnesses because it is already so lopsided that I think the president and Republicans should have an opportunity to be heard.TORRANCE: Congressman, Kelly Torrance here.You know, of course the House didn't even subpoena or try to subpoena John Bolton. What do you -- what do you and your fellow Republicans make of some of the arguments we heard yesterday that if there were allowed to be witnesses that weren't called by the House, which is the body that's supposed to do the investigating, that it sets a bad precedent, that in the future a House could send impeachment articles and make the Senate do its work for it?BUCK: Yes, I think it's a terrible precedent. The House should be the investigating arm of the impeachment process. It didn't do its job. It rushed through the job and then Speaker Pelosi held on to those articles of impeachment and didn't send them over. There was -- there was this terrible rush that somehow the president was a threat to our republic and we had to get rid of him right away and then they held onto these articles of impeachment. So they were inconsistent in their actions and I think that if they call witnesses, you've got a lot of senators that are going to end up on both sides of that.Think about Joe Biden doesn't want witnesses called. Senator Sanders wants to get back on the campaign trail on the one hand but he'd love to have Hunter Biden testifying in the Senate. So I think there's a conflict on the Democrats' side, as well as the Republicans' side.TORRANCE: Yes, Congressman, do you think it was -- the Democrats might come to regret giving President Trump's team a chance on national television to go through what they call Joe Biden's corruption? We saw Hunter Biden, in his own words, talking about how he was hired because of his last name.BUCK: Right. I think it is. I think you're seeing a three or four-day campaign commercial for the Republicans, just as you saw a three or four- day campaign commercial for the Democrats before. And I think now the real questions is, does the American public even care?BARTIROMO: Yes.BUCK: Because I think people are tuning out and moving on to the Super Bowl, moving on to other things, and I'm not sure that they're really paying attention at this point.BARTIROMO: So, Congressman, do you think we're going to see witnesses? Are some GOP senators saying that they want to see witnesses at this point, following the memoir from John Bolton and the revelations there?BUCK: I think we -- I think we may see one or two witnesses. I think that the -- ultimately there will be a group of Republican senators that come together and I think the argument really is what Professor Dershowitz said, and that is, if all of these facts are true, it still doesn't rise to the level of an impeachable offense. And that's the argument that I think will hold sway with most, if not all of the Republican senators.BARTIROMO: All right. We will see. We will be watching.Thank you so much, Congressman Ken Buck. Good to see you, sir.BUCK: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We'll take a break.When we come back, Apple is in focus this morning. The technology giant reporting later this afternoon. What to expect from Apple and its guidance. The stock is up 1 percent going into the numbers.Then this, made in America. One couple turning their love of country into a thriving business. Their story, next.Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.An American made apparel company founded by two high school sweethearts. What a great story. Love of Country Clothing showcasing t-shirts and hoodies that display pride in America. Family owned and operated, the company is planning to expand to outerwear and jeans.Joining me right now, Love of Country Clothing founders Joe and Kristen Knoetgen.Joe, great to have you. Kristen, welcome.JOSEPH KNOETGEN, FOUNDER, LOVE OF COUNTRY AND AIR FORCE MEDIC: Thank you.BARTIROMO: This is such a nice story.KRISTEN KNOETGEN, LOVE OF COUNTRY FOUNDER: Thank you.BARTIROMO: You are an Air Force medic.J. KNOETGEN: Yes, ma'am.BARTIROMO: Kristen, you are an elementary school teacher.K. KNOETGEN: Correct.BARTIROMO: What prompted you to start this business?J. KNOETGEN: It was back several years ago when I was away with the Air Force. I was away for about eight months. It was actually during training. And we saw a little bit of turmoil going on in the company, a little bit of a big -- in the country, rather. There was a big shift left and right. And what we wanted to try to do is take our pride and our love of country and try to put it out there where we could take people of different backgrounds, different political view, and try to ground them a little bit where there was just one common theme, which is our love of country.BARTIROMO: I love that.And thank you for your service, Joe.J. KNOETGEN: Oh, my pleasure. Thank you, ma'am, for your support.BARTIROMO: We so appreciate what you do for our great country.J. KNOETGEN: Thank you.BARTIROMO: You work out of your home and a mobile trailer.J. KNOETGEN: We do.BARTIROMO: Tell us about that. That's got to be tough, Kristen.K. KNOETGEN: Well, you know, we started in our garage printing with one single machine. After he got home from boot camp, he had this idea to start this. And we, like I said, started in the garage and now it has grown to being in our basement. So it has grown a bit.BARTIROMO: That's great.K. KNOETGEN: Right. But after a long day of teaching second graders and him helping the people on his base, then we turn into Love of Country mode and we get going.BARTIROMO: Well, this is -- and you want it that way because you love -- you love it, you love our country, and that's -- as the name suggests.K. KNOETGEN: Yes. Yes.J. KNOETGEN: Yes.BARTIROMO: Did you get hit with tariffs in any way? Did you have an impact -- did you see an impact on any of your products? Where do you produce?J. KNOETGEN: No, ma'am. So everything that Love of Country Clothing offers is 100 percent made exclusively in the United States. So from cotton that's grown in California, to produced and milled in Pennsylvania, and screen printed on Long Island at our house, exclusively in the United States. So, no, we didn't feel anything with the tariffs. We're strong running. This is our foundation of Love of Country Clothing is everything is exclusively United States.BARTIROMO: I -- the fabric feels really soft.J. KNOETGEN: It is. It is.BARTIROMO: It's very nice.J. KNOETGEN: It's a premium line.K. KNOETGEN: Yes.J. KNOETGEN: It's not like an inexpensive shirt that somebody would import from another country. We put a lot of pride in. We did a lot of research and development for a couple of years prior to launching that we wanted a premium line that was just going to be timeless. Something like a classic, vintage Americana type style.BARTIROMO: And who doesn't love having the great American flag on your t- shirt.J. KNOETGEN: That's it.K. KNOETGEN: Uh-huh.BARTIROMO: What are the bestsellers here? Give us the price points as well.K. KNOETGEN: You guessed it, you said it, the flag.J. KNOETGEN: Yes.K. KNOETGEN: The flag is really the most --BARTIROMO: Yes.K. KNOETGEN: Yes, the bestseller. We go to a lot of local things by our home, country concerts, and we get to interact with our customers, which is really nice. We get to tell them our story. And that is really a bestseller. We -- you know, we have been coming out with some new ones, the don't tread on me is really popular, Betsy Ross is popular, the Betsy Ross --BARTIROMO: That's the one you've got on.J. KNOETGEN: No, you've got to debut -- the debut (INAUDIBLE).K. KNOETGEN: I do.J. KNOETGEN: Yes.K. KNOETGEN: Oh, no. I thought I had my Betsy Ross on.BARTIROMO: Yes, Betsy Ross is here on set, yes.K. KNOETGEN: Betsy Ross, yes. Yes.BARTIROMO: That's a Betsy Ross.J. KNOETGEN: Basically our designs are all -- we have our trademark logo on the front left chest, it's the 13 stars from our original colonies, the American bald eagle. All of our shirts have the flag on the left sleeve and then our specific design with Love of Country under it.BARTIROMO: I love it.J. KNOETGEN: So they all sell very well. But our hoodies are just loved. Their price point is $58.95, again, 100 percent USA made, very comfortable, very soft. They wear very well.BARTIROMO: Yes, and really nice -- and really nice fabric. Yes, comfortable.J. KNOETGEN: Yes. So this one here is actually organic. So we have some organic products that are -- this is 100 percent organic cotton. So what that means is, in California, it's grown in a field without pesticides, without fertilizers, without chemicals.BARTIROMO: All right.J. KNOETGEN: So if you're environmentally conscious or you want just a product that's kind of on that cutting edge, very, very comfortable, that's -- that's it right there.BARTIROMO: Rock on. Congratulations, you guys.J. KNOETGEN: Yes. Thank you.K. KNOETGEN: Thank you. Thank you so much.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Thanks for joining us.J. KNOETGEN: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Joe and Kristen Knoetgen. Check it out. Love of Country.We'll be right back.J.

That's all right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Good morning. It is Tuesday, January 28th. Your top stories right now, 07:30 a.m. on the East Coast.Markets are higher, we're expecting a gain at the start of trading this morning. A bit of a recovery after yesterday's big selloff. Dow Industrials at the high of the morning now, given better than expected earnings this morning a couple of Dow components. Dow Futures are up 117 points, the NASDAQ Futures up 71 and the S&P Futures right now up 18-1/2.Of course, yesterday a different story. Intensifying fears over the coronavirus sparked a selloff yesterday, all three major indices down about 1-1/2 percent apiece. The Dow it is now negative for 2020.Global markets this morning look like this, European indices higher across the board, the FT-100 up 30 points, half a percent. CAC Quarante in Paris up 23 and the DAX Index in Germany higher by 31, a quarter of a percent.In Asia overnight, mixed story there. Mostly lower. Markets in China and Hong Kong are closed. You know, the People's Bank of China announcing earlier that it is extending the Lunar New Year market holiday until Monday. Look at what happened in Korea, down better than three percent on the KOSPI Index.A deadly fire at an Alabama marina, Cheryl Casone with the details now, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That's right, Maria. At least eight people are dead following a fire at a marina in Scottsboro, Alabama. Fast-moving flames fueled by high winds consumed the wooden dock, destroying 35 vessels, most of them houseboats.Officials are warning the death toll could rise. It's unclear how many people were on boats when the flames broke out. That cause under investigation.Well, a bombshell in the case against celebrity Attorney Michael Avenatti. Government attorneys claim Avenatti searched insider trading before allegedly trying to extort millions of dollars from Nike. The judge ruled that prosecutors can't mention the search in opening arguments but would rule later if it can be used as evidence. Avenatti denies those charges.Meanwhile, it could be a while before his trial starts. Dozens of prospective jurors have already been dismissed. Many had harsh words for Avenatti according to a report in the New York Post this morning.Well, G.M. is charging up jobs in the Detroit area. The automaker says it's investing $2.2 billion in the Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly plant in creating 2200 jobs. It's all to rev up production of electric and self-driving cars. G.M. expecting production of an all-electric pickup truck in late 2021.And Maria, Dagen, this is for you. A bill unanimously approved by a Florida Senate Committee to make animals adopted from shelters the official state pet. The hope is that more Floridians will be encouraged to adopt. It still has to get through one more committee before it goes to the full Senate. I think we can all kind of get behind that, right, guys?BARTIROMO: Yes, do it. Do it.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: More than 2,000 or roughly 2,000 pets, cats and dogs, that would make perfect family animals are euthanized every day in this country. That's how many animals are in shelters. And go rescue a dog, it will change your life.BARTIROMO: Adopt.KELLY JANE TORRANCE, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER, NEW YORK POST: Or cat.BARTIROMO: Or cat.TORRANCE: I have a shelter cat. I love my cat.BARTIROMO: Adopt, don't shop.STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN AND EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, FORBES MEDIA: I hope my wife's listening. She's resisting a dog still. She used to take care of them. We used to have dogs and she ended up taking care of them. She says you bring them home, and then I'm left with them.BARTIROMO: Well, that's --MCDOWELL: Best wise advice, there has to be room and you're in your -- in your home for an animal.BARTIROMO: Yes. And fair share of taking care of that baby.Meanwhile, Apple, big story in earnings this morning and tonight. It will be reporting earnings after the close tonight. Analysts are expecting strong results and they are also watching for the impact of Apple T.V. Plus, subscriptions and significant wearable sales including $6 billion worth of AirPod sales in the last fiscal year alone.Joining us right now, the Wall Street Journal's technology and autos reporter, Tim Higgins. Tim, good to see you. Give us your expectations on Apple and what's most important in this report tonight?TIM HIGGINS, TECHNOLOGY AND AUTOS REPORTER, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes, oftentimes what's most important is how the current quarter is going to shape up, the forecast number there. And analysts are always looking for kind of results for the Lunar New Year in China, that a big shopping period.So lots of questions probably expected regarding how Apple's operations are being affected right now in China with that coronavirus going on there.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, that's certainly something we want to hear from Tim Cook, right? What is the expectation for the coronavirus and how they're making changes in China as a result of this outbreak?China's Nikkei newspaper says that Apple plans to boost iPhone production though by 10 percent in the first half of the year, pushing for about 80 million units including the iPhone 11 and the yet to be released low cost model set to debut in March. How closely are you looking at the product lineup?HIGGINS: Well, there's going to be two issues here. A, it's going to be production, will the coronavirus affect production? That gets into the Apple suppliers who build that phone, are they affected and what about the suppliers to the suppliers, there's a hundreds of ways that things can go wrong there.And the second thing that will be looked at is what about the consumer, how is that being affected. I've seen some analysts, some estimate that perhaps this could affect a million sales in the current quarter, maybe pushing it into the summer quarter. Those are things that investors are going to want to know.You have you to remember last year, the cloudy thing that was over Apple was the concerns about Chinese sales, iPhones slowed in that country, helped, however, by wearables such as the watch.And so, if Apple's business is yet again disrupted in China because of this virus and people not shopping, that would be a challenge.FORBES: Tim, do you think this whole thing with the -- with the virus is maybe make China more amenable to being open to allowing foreigners more access to their market, less restrictions when they get there, realizing how tightly tied they are to the global economy?In other words, nationalism is fine but when it affects the economy as it has with China, slow growth in recent years, that might bring about change that political pressure hasn't done so far?HIGGINS: Well, I think that the challenge there is that those factories and those regions are huge employers and if you start moving that out of -- out of the country, then that would be a challenge for the --FORBES: No, not out of the country but China being more welcoming in the genuine sense to foreign direct investment instead of trying to figure out ways of putting shackles on you or forcing for transfers of technology. Now there's a little bit of liberalization, they need the business.HIGGINS: It's -- I don't see that happening because of this. But we've seen it somewhat with Tesla's factory in Shanghai, willing to allow them to come in and not have a joint venture partner there.So, you know, I see what you're saying. But broadly speaking, this is probably not changing anything in the near term.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, we know that as a result of these phase one deal, U.S. financial services companies are going to be giving greater access to China. They'll be able to own their own bank 100 percent. J.P. Morgan, Jamie Dimon just got his license. But other sectors not so much. We don't see the opening of markets beyond that. So we'll see that.But you know, we're trying to understand the real impact of this coronavirus there and what -- and what Tim Cook and the leadership team of Apple is going to say, bracing for a potential disruption in the supply chain.So how do you see that? Virtually all iPhones are made in China, primarily at the Foxconn facilities, several located near the epicenter of the outbreak and that is of course Wuhan.HIGGINS: Well, the challenge here is that Apple has been preparing for a cheaper iPhone for the spring. You could see some -- there'd be some potential danger there, some threat.The big money maker, the more expensive iPhone, however, comes in the fall. Presumably that's months away and they'll have this under control by then.So the near term issue that people are going to be looking for is that cheaper iPhone that's expected in the March period. As you look at some of the response by the government, places like Shanghai, they're extending that Lunar holiday, having people stay home. If that continues or spreads, then that could be an issue.BARTIROMO: Yes, by the way, there are other reports this week, Tesla, Microsoft, Facebook, any others that you think is a must focus on? What's the most important company there that you think we could be -- could be seeing a big impact?HIGGINS: Well, I think one of the big ones is going to be Tesla, just a massive run in the last few months. The shares just skyrocketing, looking for their results there, may be a potential profit. Then the real question is how are they going to do in 2020. They've never been profitable on an annual basis. Can they keep the growth story going is the big question.BARTIROMO: That is the big question, we'll see. And then a couple of those companies, Microsoft in the trillion dollar club too, we'll be watching that one with these market valuations.Tim, it's good to see you this morning, thank you, sir.HIGGINS: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Tim Higgins.We are headed into Super Bowl weekend. We are taking a look at the billionaires behind the teams now. Lauren Simonetti covering this story and she is here on set. Hi, Lauren.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: When we think of America's richest families you think of the Waltons or the Hearsts or the Kochs, but what about the Hunt family? Not only are they the name, the dynasty behind the Kansas City Chiefs, but the Super Bowl specifically. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)SIMONETTI: Not only are the Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl, they also named it. Legendary Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt coins the term back in 1966 after overseeing the creation of today's NFL.But the Hunt family hasn't been always about football, their initial claim to fame was oil and to the empire eventually expanded hotels, real estate, even basketball.The family was so iconic, it's widely believed the Hunts were the inspiration behind the 1980s T.V. drama, "Dallas". Today the Hunt family is one of the richest in the world, a fortune valued at nearly $14 billion.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I want to thank Lamar Hunt, and Norma Hunt, and Clark (INAUDIBLE) for taking a chance on me. I really appreciate you guys.SIMONETTI: Lamar left legendary shoes to fill when he died in 2006 but his son Clark has been up to the challenge.TONY RICHARDSON, PLAYED 11 SEASONS FOR CHIEFS: For Clark, it's not a asset, it's a family. And that's the way they treat everyone from the person that is the highest paid in the organization to the person that, you know, may - - you know, clean up the -- clean up around the building.MIKE OZANIAN, MANAGING EDITOR, FORBES SPORTSMONEY: He is very influential on the league. He is one of the brightest guys I've ever spoken to but he's also one of the most humble people that I've ever spoken to.SIMONETTI: The Chiefs are now set to play in their first Super Bowl in 50 years. The last one was Super Bowl IV, their one and only title and Lamar's wife Norma was there.RICHARDSON: Believe it or not, she's actually been to every last single Super Bowl and she's going to keep her streak alive. So it's pretty amazing.SIMONETTI: But while the Hunts clearly love football, they also love their community, opening a chapel inside the Arrowhead Stadium so fans can attend Sunday's service without missing a game.RICHARDSON: Kansas City is a -- is a family atmosphere, and the organization has a family atmosphere. And so the Hunt family, they're engrained in Kansas City through and through.(END VIDEOTAPE)SIMONETTI: Does it come full circle for the Hunts and the Chiefs this year? Their last and only Super Bowl win, they beat the Vikings back in 1970.Norma, the owner, the CEO's mother, has been to every single Super Bowl, only 16 people in the world have been to every single Super Bowl and she was the woman in the piece that was touching -- kissing the trophy, that was named after her late husband, Lamar.TORRANCE: Do they get to win it this year?FORBES: -- family that started the original American Football League and been a contrast to the NFL, challenged the NFL. And that's how we got the NFL today.MCDOWELL: Right, the AFC champion --FORBES: They broke the monopoly -- they broke the monopoly, even in the financial troubles, that league, they broke the monopoly, got the merger and here we are today.BARTIROMO: I love it. That was a great piece, Lauren.SIMONETTI: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Lauren Simonetti. And be sure to tune in tomorrow for my interview with the CEO of the 49ers, CEO Jed York here in a special interview. Do join us for that tomorrow as we look at the San Francisco 49ers.And then this Friday I will be in Miami, previewing Sunday's big game. Don't miss it. We will be live from Miami Friday and then again on Monday for the big game.Coming up, celebrating romance, Valentine's Day just over two weeks away. Sandals creating the perfect get-away and we are checking it out.And then, anything to beat traffic, one person using a skinny decoy to merge into the fast lane, we'll tell you how. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. So are you ready for a romantic rendezvous? Valentine's Day just over two weeks away right around the corner. Nothing says romance like an exotic resort get-away.Our nest guest has the inside scoop on the top vacation spots for couples. Joining us right now is Sandals Resorts director of romance, Marsha Ann Brown. Marsha Ann, it's great to have you. Thank you so much for joining us.MARSHA ANN BROWN, DIRECTOR OF ROMANCE, SANDALS RESORTS: Oh, it's delightful to be here.BARTIROMO: Director of romance. What a title. Tell us why --BROWN: Isn't it the most enviable title?BARTIROMO: Yes, it is. Why is Sandals the place to go for love?BROWN: Well, one of the things that we've established is that since 1981 our chairman and founder had one concept in mind and that's really love is all you need.And year over year, love does not change. Does it? And being romantic, we believe that we have chosen the best resorts that are nestled on the most beautiful beaches from sun rise to sunset and love goes in between every weave of that.BARTIROMO: I'll tell you, I love your commercials. I -- it just takes me there. Tell us about some of the top resorts that Sandals has for each age and why you think these are the most beautiful, whether it's millennials, baby boomers, whatever generation.BROWN: Great. So of course, it's all about choices, and you know, your love is as unique at the actual couple that's choosing to have this romantic rendezvous.But one of the things that we've identified is that we've got such diverse choices. So there are 15 resorts, there has to be one with your name on it.So if I were to think of the millennials, they want something that's jazzy and sassy with a lot of fun but also understated elegance. We have the newest jewel in our crown, Sandals Barbados.When you think of yourself, you should envision that you're on a roof top, enjoying the roof top pool or those who would never think of coming to the Caribbean and enjoying bowling, well, you could do that. We've got our four-lane bowling that takes place there. So millennial would love that.Or those who think of Jamaica, and you think of Sandals South Coast, you think over water bungalows within the Caribbean. You think of those who might want to retie the knot or have their wedding ceremony and that's with our overwater chapel and overwater bar. Now, who would not want a sling that's nestled over the Caribbean Sea, right?And a then a baby boomer who would say I want to go to your founding resort, Sandals Montego Bay where the beach just goes on and on. An incredible beach, a tremendous amount of fun and fire pits that are nestled everywhere. We weave romance into everything.FORBES: Do you think you can get Congress to go to one of these --BARTIROMO: I love that. Good idea.BROWN: We sprinkle the pixie dust of love everybody -- for everybody.MCDOWELL: How instrumental -- I'm going to start using the word delightful because that's how you start. I'm going to start using it over and over again.BARTIROMO: Lovely.MCDOWELL: How instrumental are you in creating the marketing and the messaging or are you just a reflection of the campaign or how --BROWN: I tell you that we really do have such an engaging team. We all work together. We collaborate. And what we really do look for is the architecture, the personality, all -- each resort has its own DNA but then the setting.So whether it's the design team that talks about hammocks made for two, cabanas for two, anything that nestles around love.And then when it comes on to destination weddings or retying the knot, that I'm an interval part along with the team to say how we can make that romance and that wedding dream a reality.TORRANCE: Any romance tips for we single ladies?BROWN: Oh, absolutely. So always remember -- what's that finger?MCDOWELL: No, are you -- which of the resorts is where you go to meet people?(CROSSTALK)BROWN: If you want to know --MCDOWELL: Which resort is not for couples only for singles?BROWN: Fantastic, so we do have beaches resorts which is for everyone, singles, couples and families.But I also say to my singles, don't deprive yourself. Go on down, do a beaches experience with us and remember, treat yourself to what you deserve. Because listen, you've got to love yourself first, right?BARTIROMO: Absolutely.MCDOWELL: My mom would be so angry that I used my finger. But it was a play -- but it was a --BROWN: You had to get your point in and that's all that matters.BARTIROMO: I do think this story needs further investigation. I do believe MORNINGS WITH MARIA needs to go there, Barbados.TORRANCE: The whole panel.BROWN: I say come to Barbados. I'm flying back to Jamaica where -- when I left yesterday it was 85 degrees.BARTIROMO: Take us away.BROWN: I mean, I'm like flipping the coin today to here that it is 38, I'm like 83, 38, I'll take that any day.BARTIROMO: Bingo. Marsha, thank you so much.BROWN: It's been a pleasure.BARTIROMO: Marsha Ann Brown joining us. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Time for the stories making buzz this morning. Here's a headline that will hit your funny bone. One Arizona man disguising a fake skeleton as a passenger in his car so that he could drive in the HOV lane. He thought he could get away with it but he was dead wrong. An Arizona state trooper pulled the driver over, gave him a ticket. Imagine going through the trouble of that every day.FORBES: Well then you make no bones about it. The way -- the way traffic goes these days, you feel like you're going to turn into a skeleton before you get there. It's so slow. So he's making a statement as well as trying to game the system.BARTIROMO: Well, he was busted.Meanwhile this, game on, arcade game company Atari laying the blueprint for a one of a kind vacation experience, announcing the opening of video game themed hotels in eight cities across the country.Construction will begin later this year with plans to open the first in Phoenix, Arizona. The hotels will reportedly feature e-sports studios, gaming playgrounds, restaurants, bars, bakeries and movie theaters with experiences for every age and gaming ability.TORRANCE: I have to say, I'm mixed feelings about this, Maria. I was an Atari girl growing up, really bonded with my dad over playing.MCDOWELL: Space Invader -- over Space Invaders and Pong.TORRANCE: Joust, I love Joust. But at the same time, I mean, if you're leaving, you're going on a vacation somewhere, shouldn't you get outside and experience the outdoors where you are once in a while?BARTIROMO: Good point.MCDOWELL: Now people are all -- people always have their phones with them anyways, so this is just delivering the obvious. I play -- I stopped into a bowling alley the other day and played some -- played some video games.FORBES: -- my 4-year-old grandson, game room, that's it, even more than the beach.BARTIROMO: Well, it's probably the most popular form of entertainment, right?FORBES: Sure.BARTIROMO: Gaming right now. All right, we will take a break. When we come back, she's gone from super model to super mogul, Kathy Ireland on how she's conquered the business world, next hour, right here MORNINGS WITH MARIA, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, January 28th. Your top stories right now, just before 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.The coronavirus outbreak is spreading. At least 106 people have now been killed in China. Now people are being monitored in 26 states here in the U.S. We are looking at the impact on business as well as many corporations are making major changes to their operations.Markets are higher this morning. We are looking at a bit of a recovery after yesterday's sharp selloff. Dow Industrials at the high of the morning right now, up 136 points, one-half of one percent.Load-Date: January 28, 2020End of Document

The former was better than expected while the latter was basically better than feared. Still, the follow through from the broader market has been lacking.Some other factors at work that have kept the broader market in check include:Weakness in the semiconductor space after Adv.

In these studies, either rabbits or mice were inoculated with rabbitpox or ectromelia virus, respectively, to determine the survival benefit of BCV in animals acutely infected with these orthopoxviruses. These animal models are being studied in connection with the FDA Animal Rule to determine the utility of BCV as a medical countermeasure against the human orthopoxvirus disease, smallpox. Animals were randomized to receive either placebo or BCV treatment at varying intervals post infection. In both studies, animals that received BCV, regardless of time post-infection, demonstrated a statistically significant survival advantage relative to placebo.The company looks forward to conducting a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA and to its planned submission of applications for approval of BCV in mid-2020.08:03SILC Silicom Limited beats by $0.08, beats on revs (36.25 )Reports Q4 (Dec) earnings of $0.41 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.08 better than the single analyst estimate of $0.33; revenues fell 44.0% year/year to $25.5 mln vs the $25.14 mln single analyst estimate.

"For affected patients, despite current treatment options, there is an urgent unmet need for more effective and durable therapies that can provide reliable, complete, and persistent remission from the disease beyond general immune suppression and B cell depletion provided by current treatment options. Orphan Drug Designation is an important recognition for investigational therapies for rare diseases and provides us with potentially valuable benefits as we prepare to initiate the DesCAARTes trial to generate and then report acute safety data from the first cohort of patients by the end of 2020."08:01SUMRX Gapping up/down: GE +6%, GLW +5%, DOW +3% and BA +1% after earnings, FB +1.6% after upgrade; XLNX -8%, AMD -5%, EAT -2% and SBUX -1% after earningsGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:MTSI +12.7%, GE +6.2%, MSTR +5.6%, SC +5.5%, DT +5%, GLW +5%, MINI +4.9%, MXIM +4.2%, CMRE +2.8%, DOW +2.6%, WRB +2.1%, SYK +1.8%, AAPL +1.6%, MKSI +1.4%, MPC +1.3%, NDAQ +1.2%, BA +1.2%, SMG +1.1%, SWK +1%, RES +0.9%, NVR +0.7%, NYCB +0.6%, EXTR +0.6%, NVS +0.5%, TXT +0.5%, GD +0.5%Other news:CTSO +13.6% (announces approval and availability of CytoSorb for the removal of ticagrelor during surgery requiring CPB in the EU) LB +11% (CEO Leslie Wexner aims to step aside amid push for strategic alternatives at Victoria's Secret, according to WSJ) ORTX +7.8% (receives orphan drug designation from the FDA for OTL-102) SRNE +6.7% (announces manufacturing collaboration with Celularity to initiate emergency allogeneic NK cell therapy development for coronavirus infection) TEVA +2.9% (FDA approval for AJOVY injection autoinjector device)Analyst comments:FB +1.6% (upgraded to Strong Buy from Outperform at Raymond James)HOG +0.9% (upgraded to Sector Weight from Underweight at KeyBanc Capital Markets)Gapping downIn reaction to disappointing earnings/guidance:XLNX -8.2% (also announces 7% global workforce reduction), CHRW -8.2% (also will acquire Prime Distribution for $225 mln), EBAY -5.2%, AMD -4.7%, ADP -3.4%, ANTM -2.9%, SLAB -2.1%, EAT -2%, TRMK -1.8%, RXN -1.6%, ALK -1.4%, IR -1.3%, MKTX -1.3%, LFUS -1.2%, SBUX -1%, BXP -0.7%, SKY -0.6%, BXP -0.6%, T -0.6%, MCD -0.5%Other news:BHVN -11% (prices underwritten public offering of 4,830,917 of its common shares at a price to the public of $51.75 per share)CERS -3.6% (commences $50 mln public offering)DNLI -3.6% (prices offering of 7,826,087 shares of common stock at $23.00 per share) AMPH -3.4% (FDA issued a "MINOR" Complete Response Letter for its ANDA for Epinephrine Injection)ESTA -3.4% (commences $55 mln stock offering)Analyst comments:GLP -2.1% (downgraded to Underweight from Neutral at JP Morgan)CPRI -2.1% (downgraded to Hold at Needham on low visibility)CAL -1.2% (downgraded to Hold at Needham on low visibility for 2020)NUE -1% (downgraded to Underweight from Neutral at JP Morgan)08:00WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +13.90.

CytoSorb is the only approved therapy to remove ticagrelor in the EU, and it is intended to address a major unmet medical need of potentially life-threatening postoperative bleeding in cardiothoracic surgery patients on the drug.COO Vincent Capponi said, "With the approval of CytoSorb for this indication, it may encourage a preference in the selection of ticagrelor [...] as a first-line therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome, given that roughly 10-15% of these patients, or approximately 110,000-165,000 patients in the U.S., and approximately 70,000-100,000 patients in Europe each year will require emergent or urgent cardiac surgery and will be at high risk of bleeding. Now that we can officially market this application on-label internationally, we plan to drive CytoSorb as standard of care for the removal of ticagrelor during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures in every country we serve [...]. In addition, we are aggressively pursuing an approval path for this application in the United States as well."Ticagrelor is marketed by Astra Zeneca (AZN) and sold under the tradenames Brilique in the EU and Brilinta in the US, with projected worldwide sales of more than $1.5 bln in 2019, with more than half of sales coming from Europe, emerging markets, and rest of world.07:33HES Hess misses by $0.12, beats on revs (62.12 )Reports Q4 (Dec) loss of $0.60 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.12 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.48); revenues rose 0.5% year/year to $1.69 bln vs the $1.54 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.07:31PTC PTC to offer $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2025 and senior notes due 2028 in a private offering that is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (84.41 )PTC expects to use $530 million of the net proceeds of the offering of the notes to redeem all $500 million of its outstanding 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024, including the payment of premium and accrued and unpaid interest thereon, on or about May 15, 2020.

The Nasdaq Composite led the rebound with a 1.4% gain, while the S&P 500 (+1.0%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), and Russell 2000 (+0.9%) followed behind.The day began with modest gains, as the market looked past disappointing earnings reports from 3M (MMM 165.56, -10.07, -5.7%) and Pfizer (PFE 38.14, -2.02, -5.0%), then stocks climbed higher soon after the Conference Board released its Consumer Confidence Index for January.

The company has cancelled three sailings through Feb 8, on the high yielding Spectrum of the Seas, currently its only ship homeported in China. Co estimates that this (which included the Chinese new year's cruises) will impact 2020 financial results by approximately $0.10 per share.

CytoSorb is the only approved therapy to remove ticagrelor in the EU, and it is intended to address a major unmet medical need of potentially life-threatening postoperative bleeding in cardiothoracic surgery patients on the drug.COO Vincent Capponi said, "With the approval of CytoSorb for this indication, it may encourage a preference in the selection of ticagrelor [...] as a first-line therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome, given that roughly 10-15% of these patients, or approximately 110,000-165,000 patients in the U.S., and approximately 70,000-100,000 patients in Europe each year will require emergent or urgent cardiac surgery and will be at high risk of bleeding. Now that we can officially market this application on-label internationally, we plan to drive CytoSorb as standard of care for the removal of ticagrelor during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures in every country we serve [...]. In addition, we are aggressively pursuing an approval path for this application in the United States as well."Ticagrelor is marketed by Astra Zeneca (AZN) and sold under the tradenames Brilique in the EU and Brilinta in the US, with projected worldwide sales of more than $1.5 bln in 2019, with more than half of sales coming from Europe, emerging markets, and rest of world.07:33HES Hess misses by $0.12, beats on revs (62.12 )Reports Q4 (Dec) loss of $0.60 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.12 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.48); revenues rose 0.5% year/year to $1.69 bln vs the $1.54 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.07:31PTC PTC to offer $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2025 and senior notes due 2028 in a private offering that is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (84.41 )PTC expects to use $530 million of the net proceeds of the offering of the notes to redeem all $500 million of its outstanding 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024, including the payment of premium and accrued and unpaid interest thereon, on or about May 15, 2020.

The Nasdaq Composite led the rebound with a 1.4% gain, while the S&P 500 (+1.0%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), and Russell 2000 (+0.9%) followed behind.The day began with modest gains, as the market looked past disappointing earnings reports from 3M (MMM 165.56, -10.07, -5.7%) and Pfizer (PFE 38.14, -2.02, -5.0%), then stocks climbed higher soon after the Conference Board released its Consumer Confidence Index for January. That index rose to 131.6 (Briefing.com consensus 128.0) from 128.2 in December.All 11 S&P 500 sectors contributed to the rally, including five that rose at least 1.0%. The information technology sector (+1.9%) led the charge on the back of Apple (AAPL 317.69, +8.74, +2.8%), which was set to release its earnings report after the close.

STS101 is currently being evaluated as an acute treatment for migraine in an ongoing Phase 3 efficacy trial (the EMERGE trial), for which Satsuma expects to report top-line data in the second half of this year.16:08OSIS OSI Systems beats by $0.04, misses on revs; guides FY20 EPS in-line, revs below consensus (96.30 +1.58)Reports Q2 (Dec) earnings of $1.27 per share, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.23; revenues rose 0.7% year/year to $305.34 mln vs the $316.75 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Book-to-bill ratio was 1.1x.Co's backlog at the end of 2019 was $886 mln compared to $911 mln as of June 30, 2019.Co issues guidance for FY20, raises EPS guidance to $4.63 to $4.85 from $4.61 to $4.83 vs. $4.71 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; lowers FY20 revs guidance to $1.205 bln to $1.240 bln from $1.238 bln to $1.273 vs. $1.25 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.16:07SBUX Starbucks beats by $0.03, reports revs in-line; reaffirms FY20 EPS guidance, revs guidance (88.60 -0.13)Reports Q1 (Dec) earnings of $0.79 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.76; revenues rose 7.0% year/year to $7.1 bln vs the $7.11 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Global comparable store sales up 5% (vs 4.3% estimate), driven by a 3% increase in average ticket and a 2% increase in comparable transactions Americas comparable store sales up 6%, driven by a 3% increase in average ticket and a 2% increase in comparable transactions; U.S. comparable store sales up 6%, with comparable transactions up 3% International comparable store sales up 1%, driven by a 2% increase in average ticket and a 1% decrease in comparable transactions; China comparable store sales up 3%, with comparable transactions up 1% Co reaffirms guidance for FY20, sees EPS of $3.00-3.05, excluding non-recurring items, vs. $3.05 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees FY20 revs +6-8% (implying $28.1-28.6 bln) vs. $28.41 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Co also reaffirmed guidance for comps +3-4%Co states, "Currently, we have closed more than half of our stores in China and continue to monitor and modify the operating hours of all of our stores in the market in response to the outbreak of the coronavirus.

The study met the primary endpoint of significant triglyceride lowering and multiple secondary endpoints with a favorable safety and tolerability profile. The objective of the dose-ranging Phase 2 study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx. The study included 105 patients. Participants were administered AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx or placebo via subcutaneous injection for six months. Weekly and monthly dosing was explored in three cohorts with doses ranging from 40 mg to 80 mg of total monthly dose. Observations from the AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx study included: Statistically significant dose-dependent reductions in fasting triglycerides compared to placebo at all dose levels.Dose-dependent reductions in ANGPTL3, apoC-III, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL-C), non-HDL cholesterol and total cholesterol compared to placebo.No reductions in liver fat or hemoglobin A1C compared to placebo.AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx was generally well-tolerated and demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile.

The S&P 500 (+0.3%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%), and Nasdaq Composite (+0.3%) sport modest gains in this earnings-driven session.Besides Apple, which is the Dow's highest-priced component, the blue-chip average can credit its slight advantage to positive earnings reactions in Boeing (BA 323.68, +7.12, +2.3%), McDonald's (MCD 312.94, +3.65, +2.3%), and Dow Inc (DOW 49.59, +2.43, +5.1%). Former Dow component General Electric (GE 12.97, +1.23) is up 10.5% following its results.Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are trading higher, led by the industrials (+1.0%), materials (+0.6%), and information technology (+0.6%) sectors. The communication services sector (-0.4%) is among the laggards amid a poor response to AT&T's (T 37.17, -1.41, -3.6%) earnings results.Transports, meanwhile, are rallying around an earnings beat from Norfolk Southern (NSC 217.66, +12.90, +6.3%), while the semiconductor space is succumbing to profit taking after AMD (AMD 46.92, -3.61, -7.2%) and Xilinx (XLNX 89.11, -9.50, -9.6%) provided disappointing quarterly revenue guidance.Earnings have been the focus so far, but attention will start to divert toward the Fed when it releases its policy directive at 2:00 p.m. ET. The fed funds rate is widely expected to remain unchanged, and investors will presumably be listening intently during Fed Chair Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET.Separately, there appears to be lingering concerns about the coronavirus and its impact on corporate earnings growth, especially after Starbucks (SBUX 86.02, -3.58, -2.9%) said it will temporarily close half of its stores in China amid the outbreak. Shares are trading lower, while an uptick in Treasury demand has the 10-yr yield down two basis points to 1.62%.In other corporate news, Facebook (FB 223.38, +5.64, +2.6%) was upgraded to Strong Buy from Outperform at Raymond James ahead of its earnings after the close. Shares of L Brands (LB 23.18, +2.62, +12.8%) are up 13% after The Wall Street Journal reported that CEO Leslie Wexner is aiming to step down amid a push for strategic alternatives.Reviewing today's economic data:Pending Home Sales unexpectedly fell 4.9% in December (Briefing.com consensus +1.0%). Today's reading follows an unrevised 1.2% increase in November.The Advance report for International Trade in Goods for December showed a deficit of $68.3 billion versus $63.2 billion in November. Meanwhile, the Advance report for Retail Inventories for December was unchanged, and the Advance report for Wholesale Inventories for December declined 0.1%.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index rose 7.2% following a 1.2% decline in the prior week.12:57SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: CLVS (9.08 +8.22%), TNDM (75.88 +7.49%), ADAP (4.21 +6.31%), IMGN (4.99 +5.83%), ENDP (5.96 +5.49%)Materials: AVY (136.52 +5.66%), SMG (115.28 +5.47%)Industrials: GE (12.94 +10.32%), NSC (216.61 +5.79%)Consumer Discretionary: LB (23.17 +12.69%), PENN (29.3 +11.78%)Information Technology: MTSI (30.63 +16.6%), RMBS (16.5 +9.84%), CVLT (48.18 +8.12%)Financials: SC (26.01 +12.21%), EVR (80.72 +9.84%)Energy: CHK (0.57 +9.4%), BCEI (18.51 +8.12%), RES (4.85 +5.56%)Consumer Staples: DF (0.16 +24.48%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: BHVN (51.57 -8.63%)Materials: RFP (3.83 -7.04%)Industrials: MAXR (17.15 -7.55%), CHRW (72.15 -7.36%)Consumer Discretionary: SKY (31.65 -12.54%)Information Technology: CMTL (29.95 -19.27%), SLAB (104 -12.24%), EXTR (6.48 -10.71%), INSG (7.54 -10.34%), XLNX (89.11 -9.64%), AMD (46.92 -7.14%)Financials: HAFC (16.92 -9.81%)Energy: MMLP (2.68 -25.76%), SMLP (3.05 -10.34%), NE (0.81 -9.68%), AR (1.77 -7.59%), MDR (0.07 -7.23%), HES (58.03 -6.59%)12:24SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (119) outpacing new lows (51) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: AAON, AAPL, AB, ADBE, ADSK, AEE, AGNC, AGR, AGYS, AJG, ALLE, AMH, ANSS, AON, ATRC, AVY, BCPC, BKI, BRMK, BRO, BXMT, BXP, CCI, CDAY, CGEN, CHDN, CIM, CRI, CTLT, D, DAR, DGX, DHR, DOCU, DRE, DT, EFX, ELVT, EPRT, ES, EVRG, FATE, FB, FCPT, FE, FHB, FLT, FR, GE, GGG, GLOB, GNL, GNRC, HOLX, HR, HRL, HTA, HTGC, ICE, ILPT, IVR, JHG, JNJ, JOE, KLIC, KNSL, KNX, KSU, LAMR, LAUR, LH, LHX, LXP, MCO, MINI, MMC, MSA, MSCI, MTSI, NDAQ, NDSN, NSC, NVRO, OUT, PAR, PAYC, PBH, PDM, PENN, PMT, PNM, PODD, PRFT, RDNT, RMBS, RMD, RNG, ROCK, RXN, SAFE, SHOP, SITE, SMG, SPGI, SRC, SSD, STAR, STWD, TEAM, TNDM, TPX, TREX, TRNO, TROW, USAT, WLTW, XAN, YNDX, ZBHStocks that traded to 52 week lows: AA, APTS, AR, ARCH, AVNS, BNFT, BSM, BTU, CALM, CEIX, CHRW, CVGI, CVI, DO, EGLE, ENTA, EPC, EQT, FRBK, FTSI, GMLP, GTX, HAFC, HRTG, I, IMAX, IMXI, KELYA, LKCO, LRN, MGPI, MNOV, MOV, NE, NFG, NGVT, NUS, OIS, PRA, S, SFM, SPG, TCO, THS, TISI, TUP, UAL, VIAC, WSBC, XOM, XPERThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: APPF, CAC, CHE, CRMT, MSTRThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week lows on High Volume: MG, SPOKETFs that traded to 52 week highs: CSJ, FAN, LQD, MUB, PFF, TIP, XHBETFs that traded to 52 week lows: DBB, UNG, USCI12:21WWD Woodward increases quarterly dividend to $0.28 from $0.1625/share (117.80 +0.51)12:14SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- MACOM Tech (MTSI) gains following first quarter results -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersCLW (27.58 +23.73%): Raised its Q4 adj. EBITDA outlook to $49-53 mln from prior guidance for $38-46 mln. The update results from lower input costs, timing of certain expenses, and strong business execution. Also appointed Arsen S. Kitch, co's SVP and general manager for its consumer products division, as its next CEO, effective at the start of April; Mr. Kitch succeeds Linda K. Massman, who will retire after having served as CEO since 2013. At ten-month highs.MTSI (30.58 +16.41%): Reaches its new highest levels in close to two years after reporting Q1 results. Co topped consensus for Q1 EPS and revs and issued upside guidance for Q2. Revs fell 21.0% yr/yr to $119.1 mln, which represents a +6.1% increase sequentially. Adj. gross margin also increased sequentially, reaching 53.5% vs 53.0% in the prior fiscal quarter, down from 56.3% in the year ago quarter. During its call, co credited demand for 5G products among motivators for sequential growth in its Telecom end market.ARAY (4.28 +13.53%): Announced Q2 results. Co reported net orders growth of +30% yr/yr to $89.9 mln and gross orders of $98.6 mln, including 11 orders from China; total backlog increased +12% yr/yr to $539.4 mln. Co expects revenue growth to improve in the second half of the year, as it believes that revenue recognition of China Type A systems will begin in co's fiscal Q4. Raised FY20 adj. EBITDA guidance. Reaches nine-month highs.Small Cap LosersI (4.15 -23.66%): Sees weakness after the Senate introduced bipartisan legislation pertaining to an auction for C-band satellite spectrum airwaves; the bill would reportedly offer limited payout to co and other satellite operators and C-Band Alliance peers. Bloomberg Law also points to reports that the FCC chairman's office is in favor of a set incentive payment structure, with the set payment floated at $5 bln, as further cause for today's weakness. The C-Band Alliance's stance, as of a letter addressed to the FCC earlier this week, includes the argument that it "simply [does] not have the flexibility to proceed" in assisting spectrum transition and adopting accelerated clearing "unless [it is] offered the opportunity to share fairly and appropriately in the value being created through [its] tremendous [...] efforts," and it believes, favoring a variable payment, that "such sharing is most easily expressed through a formula directly tied to the actual realized proceeds of any C-band auction." The stock, which had traded in a relatively narrow range since plunging lower on C-band developments in November, now reaches its new lowest levels in more than a year. CMTL (29.9 -19.41%): To acquire Gilat Satellite (GILT) in a transaction with an enterprise value of approx. $532.5 mln -- the total consideration amounts to $10.25/share, or $7.18/share in cash and 0.08425 of a share of co's common stock per GILT share held. The consideration represents a premium of approx. +14.52% to Gilat's 90-day weighted average trading price. Co believes that the transaction positions it to capitalize on growing demand for satellite connectivity and long-term opportunities emerging in the secure wireless communications market. Co is not revising its previously announced FY financial outlook but will provide combined guidance in a future announcement once the transaction closes. At three-month lows. EXTR (6.51 -10.4%): Reported in-line Q2 EPS and downside revs (+5.9% yr/yr to $267.5 mln). Co attributes its Q2 revenue shortfall to weakness in the US public sector and Asia Pacific. Guided Q3 EPS and revs below consensus. Impacting co's revenue guidance are limits to near-term visibility to US public sector funding, certain areas of weakness in US service provider and retail verticals, and co's outlook in the Asia Pacific region, noted co during its call. Touched down to two-month lows.11:38BLK BlackRock increases quarterly dividend to $3.63/share from $3.30/share (537.12 +7.15)11:38SMH Industry Briefing: Chipmakers (142.93 -2.32)The PHLX Semiconductor Index (-1.9%) trades behind the broader market, widening this week's loss to 3.4%.

The former was better than expected while the latter was basically better than feared. Still, the follow through from the broader market has been lacking.Some other factors at work that have kept the broader market in check include:Weakness in the semiconductor space after Adv. Micro Devices (AMD 46.81, -3.72, -7.4%) and Xilinx (XLNX 90.00, -8.61, -8.7%) issued relatively disappointing guidance for the March quarter.Festering concerns involving the adverse impact on growth posed by the coronavirus.

In these studies, either rabbits or mice were inoculated with rabbitpox or ectromelia virus, respectively, to determine the survival benefit of BCV in animals acutely infected with these orthopoxviruses. These animal models are being studied in connection with the FDA Animal Rule to determine the utility of BCV as a medical countermeasure against the human orthopoxvirus disease, smallpox. Animals were randomized to receive either placebo or BCV treatment at varying intervals post infection. In both studies, animals that received BCV, regardless of time post-infection, demonstrated a statistically significant survival advantage relative to placebo.The company looks forward to conducting a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA and to its planned submission of applications for approval of BCV in mid-2020.08:03SILC Silicom Limited beats by $0.08, beats on revs (36.25 )Reports Q4 (Dec) earnings of $0.41 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.08 better than the single analyst estimate of $0.33; revenues fell 44.0% year/year to $25.5 mln vs the $25.14 mln single analyst estimate.

"For affected patients, despite current treatment options, there is an urgent unmet need for more effective and durable therapies that can provide reliable, complete, and persistent remission from the disease beyond general immune suppression and B cell depletion provided by current treatment options. Orphan Drug Designation is an important recognition for investigational therapies for rare diseases and provides us with potentially valuable benefits as we prepare to initiate the DesCAARTes trial to generate and then report acute safety data from the first cohort of patients by the end of 2020."08:01SUMRX Gapping up/down: GE +6%, GLW +5%, DOW +3% and BA +1% after earnings, FB +1.6% after upgrade; XLNX -8%, AMD -5%, EAT -2% and SBUX -1% after earningsGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:MTSI +12.7%, GE +6.2%, MSTR +5.6%, SC +5.5%, DT +5%, GLW +5%, MINI +4.9%, MXIM +4.2%, CMRE +2.8%, DOW +2.6%, WRB +2.1%, SYK +1.8%, AAPL +1.6%, MKSI +1.4%, MPC +1.3%, NDAQ +1.2%, BA +1.2%, SMG +1.1%, SWK +1%, RES +0.9%, NVR +0.7%, NYCB +0.6%, EXTR +0.6%, NVS +0.5%, TXT +0.5%, GD +0.5%Other news:CTSO +13.6% (announces approval and availability of CytoSorb for the removal of ticagrelor during surgery requiring CPB in the EU) LB +11% (CEO Leslie Wexner aims to step aside amid push for strategic alternatives at Victoria's Secret, according to WSJ) ORTX +7.8% (receives orphan drug designation from the FDA for OTL-102) SRNE +6.7% (announces manufacturing collaboration with Celularity to initiate emergency allogeneic NK cell therapy development for coronavirus infection) TEVA +2.9% (FDA approval for AJOVY injection autoinjector device)Analyst comments:FB +1.6% (upgraded to Strong Buy from Outperform at Raymond James)HOG +0.9% (upgraded to Sector Weight from Underweight at KeyBanc Capital Markets)Gapping downIn reaction to disappointing earnings/guidance:XLNX -8.2% (also announces 7% global workforce reduction), CHRW -8.2% (also will acquire Prime Distribution for $225 mln), EBAY -5.2%, AMD -4.7%, ADP -3.4%, ANTM -2.9%, SLAB -2.1%, EAT -2%, TRMK -1.8%, RXN -1.6%, ALK -1.4%, IR -1.3%, MKTX -1.3%, LFUS -1.2%, SBUX -1%, BXP -0.7%, SKY -0.6%, BXP -0.6%, T -0.6%, MCD -0.5%Other news:BHVN -11% (prices underwritten public offering of 4,830,917 of its common shares at a price to the public of $51.75 per share)CERS -3.6% (commences $50 mln public offering)DNLI -3.6% (prices offering of 7,826,087 shares of common stock at $23.00 per share) AMPH -3.4% (FDA issued a "MINOR" Complete Response Letter for its ANDA for Epinephrine Injection)ESTA -3.4% (commences $55 mln stock offering)Analyst comments:GLP -2.1% (downgraded to Underweight from Neutral at JP Morgan)CPRI -2.1% (downgraded to Hold at Needham on low visibility)CAL -1.2% (downgraded to Hold at Needham on low visibility for 2020)NUE -1% (downgraded to Underweight from Neutral at JP Morgan)08:00WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +13.90.

CytoSorb is the only approved therapy to remove ticagrelor in the EU, and it is intended to address a major unmet medical need of potentially life-threatening postoperative bleeding in cardiothoracic surgery patients on the drug.COO Vincent Capponi said, "With the approval of CytoSorb for this indication, it may encourage a preference in the selection of ticagrelor [...] as a first-line therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome, given that roughly 10-15% of these patients, or approximately 110,000-165,000 patients in the U.S., and approximately 70,000-100,000 patients in Europe each year will require emergent or urgent cardiac surgery and will be at high risk of bleeding. Now that we can officially market this application on-label internationally, we plan to drive CytoSorb as standard of care for the removal of ticagrelor during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures in every country we serve [...]. In addition, we are aggressively pursuing an approval path for this application in the United States as well."Ticagrelor is marketed by Astra Zeneca (AZN) and sold under the tradenames Brilique in the EU and Brilinta in the US, with projected worldwide sales of more than $1.5 bln in 2019, with more than half of sales coming from Europe, emerging markets, and rest of world.07:33HES Hess misses by $0.12, beats on revs (62.12 )Reports Q4 (Dec) loss of $0.60 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.12 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.48); revenues rose 0.5% year/year to $1.69 bln vs the $1.54 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.07:31PTC PTC to offer $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2025 and senior notes due 2028 in a private offering that is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (84.41 )PTC expects to use $530 million of the net proceeds of the offering of the notes to redeem all $500 million of its outstanding 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024, including the payment of premium and accrued and unpaid interest thereon, on or about May 15, 2020.

The Nasdaq Composite led the rebound with a 1.4% gain, while the S&P 500 (+1.0%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), and Russell 2000 (+0.9%) followed behind.The day began with modest gains, as the market looked past disappointing earnings reports from 3M (MMM 165.56, -10.07, -5.7%) and Pfizer (PFE 38.14, -2.02, -5.0%), then stocks climbed higher soon after the Conference Board released its Consumer Confidence Index for January.

Based on data from this study and the results from other clinical studies with DHE (including injected, liquid nasal spray, and orally inhaled DHE dosage forms), the authors posited that STS101 is anticipated to demonstrate rapid pain relief, improvement in functionality, and excellent 2-hour and sustained pain freedom rates.

Q4 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $0.78 (+3% yr/yr) on revenue of $3.37 bln (-2.6% yr/yr). The company typically does not provide EPS or revenue guidance. LVS gets 65% of its revenue of Macau, while its Las Vegas operations only make up 12% of revenues. The first item of interest will be any commentary on impact from the coronavirus outbreak in China. October Macau gross gaming revenues fell 3.2% yr/yr, November gaming revenues fell 8.5% yr/yr, and December gaming revenues fell 13.7% yr/yr. The decline in gross revenues in December was deemed to be primarily a function of increased security for President Xi's visit to Macau to mark the anniversary of its handover to China, which impeded normal casino traffic.Looking back, the company beat EPS and revenues once out of the last four quarters. LVS has a $51 bln valuation and trades at 19x 2020 versus Wynn Resorts (WYNN) which trades at 22 times earnings.Based on the LVS Jan31 $65 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~5% in either direction by weekly expiration (Friday, January 31).13:48XLI Sector Briefing: Industrials (83.45 +0.95)Apple (AAPL 326.61, +8.92, +2.8%) has commanded a lot of attention as a key driver of today's market action. That is an accurate characterization, yet it is the S&P industrials sector (+1.2%) that is the top-performing sector today.The strength in the industrials sector isn't rooted so much in optimism about the economic outlook so much as it is rooted in the trading responses to earnings results from several companies in the sector. In brief, it is a bottom-up bounce today, fueled by some better-than-expected results and/or some better-than-feared results/guidance. It hasn't been all good, however.Notable Movers:Boeing (BA 324.59, +8.03, +2.5%): Reported a huge Q4 loss of ($2.33) per share, which was worse than expected; however, analysts citing some relief that charges were not as large as expected and that the mid-2020 737 MAX service target date was maintained.General Electric (GE 12.92, +1.19, +10.1%): Posted better-than-expected Q4 EPS result, but issued downside EPS guidance for FY20. Analysts and investors, however, applauding improved cash flow generation in quarter and pleasing FY20 free cash flow guidance range of $2-4 billion.Norfolk Southern (NSC 217.69, +12.93, +6.4%): Railroad operator easily exceeded Q4 EPS estimate. Revenues were down 7.1% yr/yr, but analysts highlighting better-than-expected railway operating ratio of 64.2%.Alaska Airlines (ALK 66.99, +1.45, +2.2%): Topped Q4 consensus EPS estimate on a 7.9% increase in revenue; company also raised its dividend by 7% to $0.375 per shareIngersoll-Rand (IR 134.33, +3.55, +2.7%): Fell short of Q4 consensus EPS estimate with operating margin slipping to 12.5% from 12.9% in same period a year agoC.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW 73.06, -4.82, -6.2%): Came up well short of Q4 consensus EPS estimate with higher expenses hurting; company also announced acquisition of Prime Distribution Services for ~$225 million in cash.General Dynamics (GD 183.65, +0.01, +0.01%): Traded lower after exceeding revenue and EPS estimates for Q4, but found support at its 200-day moving average (179.86) and has recovered all of its earlier losses.Stanley Black & Decker (SWK 162.81, -3.54, -2.1%): Came up shy of consensus Q4 revenue and EPS estimates. FY20 adjusted EPS guidance of $8.80-9.00 was shy of analysts' average estimate.13:12OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:APT Feb 7.5 calls (volume: 1500, open int: 33601, implied vol: ~182%, prev day implied vol: 173%).

The S&P 500 (+0.3%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%), and Nasdaq Composite (+0.3%) sport modest gains in this earnings-driven session.Besides Apple, which is the Dow's highest-priced component, the blue-chip average can credit its slight advantage to positive earnings reactions in Boeing (BA 323.68, +7.12, +2.3%), McDonald's (MCD 312.94, +3.65, +2.3%), and Dow Inc (DOW 49.59, +2.43, +5.1%). Former Dow component General Electric (GE 12.97, +1.23) is up 10.5% following its results.Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are trading higher, led by the industrials (+1.0%), materials (+0.6%), and information technology (+0.6%) sectors. The communication services sector (-0.4%) is among the laggards amid a poor response to AT&T's (T 37.17, -1.41, -3.6%) earnings results.Transports, meanwhile, are rallying around an earnings beat from Norfolk Southern (NSC 217.66, +12.90, +6.3%), while the semiconductor space is succumbing to profit taking after AMD (AMD 46.92, -3.61, -7.2%) and Xilinx (XLNX 89.11, -9.50, -9.6%) provided disappointing quarterly revenue guidance.Earnings have been the focus so far, but attention will start to divert toward the Fed when it releases its policy directive at 2:00 p.m. ET. The fed funds rate is widely expected to remain unchanged, and investors will presumably be listening intently during Fed Chair Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET.Separately, there appears to be lingering concerns about the coronavirus and its impact on corporate earnings growth, especially after Starbucks (SBUX 86.02, -3.58, -2.9%) said it will temporarily close half of its stores in China amid the outbreak. Shares are trading lower, while an uptick in Treasury demand has the 10-yr yield down two basis points to 1.62%.In other corporate news, Facebook (FB 223.38, +5.64, +2.6%) was upgraded to Strong Buy from Outperform at Raymond James ahead of its earnings after the close.

EBITDA outlook to $49-53 mln from prior guidance for $38-46 mln. The update results from lower input costs, timing of certain expenses, and strong business execution. Also appointed Arsen S. Kitch, co's SVP and general manager for its consumer products division, as its next CEO, effective at the start of April; Mr. Kitch succeeds Linda K. Massman, who will retire after having served as CEO since 2013. At ten-month highs.MTSI (30.58 +16.41%): Reaches its new highest levels in close to two years after reporting Q1 results. Co topped consensus for Q1 EPS and revs and issued upside guidance for Q2. Revs fell 21.0% yr/yr to $119.1 mln, which represents a +6.1% increase sequentially. Adj. gross margin also increased sequentially, reaching 53.5% vs 53.0% in the prior fiscal quarter, down from 56.3% in the year ago quarter. During its call, co credited demand for 5G products among motivators for sequential growth in its Telecom end market.ARAY (4.28 +13.53%): Announced Q2 results. Co reported net orders growth of +30% yr/yr to $89.9 mln and gross orders of $98.6 mln, including 11 orders from China; total backlog increased +12% yr/yr to $539.4 mln. Co expects revenue growth to improve in the second half of the year, as it believes that revenue recognition of China Type A systems will begin in co's fiscal Q4. Raised FY20 adj. EBITDA guidance. Reaches nine-month highs.Small Cap LosersI (4.15 -23.66%): Sees weakness after the Senate introduced bipartisan legislation pertaining to an auction for C-band satellite spectrum airwaves; the bill would reportedly offer limited payout to co and other satellite operators and C-Band Alliance peers. Bloomberg Law also points to reports that the FCC chairman's office is in favor of a set incentive payment structure, with the set payment floated at $5 bln, as further cause for today's weakness. The C-Band Alliance's stance, as of a letter addressed to the FCC earlier this week, includes the argument that it "simply [does] not have the flexibility to proceed" in assisting spectrum transition and adopting accelerated clearing "unless [it is] offered the opportunity to share fairly and appropriately in the value being created through [its] tremendous [...] efforts," and it believes, favoring a variable payment, that "such sharing is most easily expressed through a formula directly tied to the actual realized proceeds of any C-band auction." The stock, which had traded in a relatively narrow range since plunging lower on C-band developments in November, now reaches its new lowest levels in more than a year. CMTL (29.9 -19.41%): To acquire Gilat Satellite (GILT) in a transaction with an enterprise value of approx. $532.5 mln -- the total consideration amounts to $10.25/share, or $7.18/share in cash and 0.08425 of a share of co's common stock per GILT share held. The consideration represents a premium of approx. +14.52% to Gilat's 90-day weighted average trading price. Co believes that the transaction positions it to capitalize on growing demand for satellite connectivity and long-term opportunities emerging in the secure wireless communications market. Co is not revising its previously announced FY financial outlook but will provide combined guidance in a future announcement once the transaction closes. At three-month lows. EXTR (6.51 -10.4%): Reported in-line Q2 EPS and downside revs (+5.9% yr/yr to $267.5 mln). Co attributes its Q2 revenue shortfall to weakness in the US public sector and Asia Pacific. Guided Q3 EPS and revs below consensus. Impacting co's revenue guidance are limits to near-term visibility to US public sector funding, certain areas of weakness in US service provider and retail verticals, and co's outlook in the Asia Pacific region, noted co during its call. Touched down to two-month lows.11:38BLK BlackRock increases quarterly dividend to $3.63/share from $3.30/share (537.12 +7.15)11:38SMH Industry Briefing: Chipmakers (142.93 -2.32)The PHLX Semiconductor Index (-1.9%) trades behind the broader market, widening this week's loss to 3.4%.

The company has cancelled three sailings through Feb 8, on the high yielding Spectrum of the Seas, currently its only ship homeported in China. Co estimates that this (which included the Chinese new year's cruises) will impact 2020 financial results by approximately $0.10 per share. If the travel restrictions in China continue until the end of February, the company estimates that this would further impact its results by an additional $0.10 per share. There are still too many variables and uncertainties regarding this outbreak to calculate the overall impact on the business. For example, co expects an erosion of consumer confidence in China could have an additional impact on load factor and rate in the region until the market normalizes. If these travel restrictions continue for an extended period of time, they could have a material impact on overall financial performance.

"For affected patients, despite current treatment options, there is an urgent unmet need for more effective and durable therapies that can provide reliable, complete, and persistent remission from the disease beyond general immune suppression and B cell depletion provided by current treatment options. Orphan Drug Designation is an important recognition for investigational therapies for rare diseases and provides us with potentially valuable benefits as we prepare to initiate the DesCAARTes trial to generate and then report acute safety data from the first cohort of patients by the end of 2020."08:01SUMRX Gapping up/down: GE +6%, GLW +5%, DOW +3% and BA +1% after earnings, FB +1.6% after upgrade; XLNX -8%, AMD -5%, EAT -2% and SBUX -1% after earningsGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:MTSI +12.7%, GE +6.2%, MSTR +5.6%, SC +5.5%, DT +5%, GLW +5%, MINI +4.9%, MXIM +4.2%, CMRE +2.8%, DOW +2.6%, WRB +2.1%, SYK +1.8%, AAPL +1.6%, MKSI +1.4%, MPC +1.3%, NDAQ +1.2%, BA +1.2%, SMG +1.1%, SWK +1%, RES +0.9%, NVR +0.7%, NYCB +0.6%, EXTR +0.6%, NVS +0.5%, TXT +0.5%, GD +0.5%Other news:CTSO +13.6% (announces approval and availability of CytoSorb for the removal of ticagrelor during surgery requiring CPB in the EU) LB +11% (CEO Leslie Wexner aims to step aside amid push for strategic alternatives at Victoria's Secret, according to WSJ) ORTX +7.8% (receives orphan drug designation from the FDA for OTL-102) SRNE +6.7% (announces manufacturing collaboration with Celularity to initiate emergency allogeneic NK cell therapy development for coronavirus infection) TEVA +2.9% (FDA approval for AJOVY injection autoinjector device)Analyst comments:FB +1.6% (upgraded to Strong Buy from Outperform at Raymond James)HOG +0.9% (upgraded to Sector Weight from Underweight at KeyBanc Capital Markets)Gapping downIn reaction to disappointing earnings/guidance:XLNX -8.2% (also announces 7% global workforce reduction), CHRW -8.2% (also will acquire Prime Distribution for $225 mln), EBAY -5.2%, AMD -4.7%, ADP -3.4%, ANTM -2.9%, SLAB -2.1%, EAT -2%, TRMK -1.8%, RXN -1.6%, ALK -1.4%, IR -1.3%, MKTX -1.3%, LFUS -1.2%, SBUX -1%, BXP -0.7%, SKY -0.6%, BXP -0.6%, T -0.6%, MCD -0.5%Other news:BHVN -11% (prices underwritten public offering of 4,830,917 of its common shares at a price to the public of $51.75 per share)CERS -3.6% (commences $50 mln public offering)DNLI -3.6% (prices offering of 7,826,087 shares of common stock at $23.00 per share) AMPH -3.4% (FDA issued a "MINOR" Complete Response Letter for its ANDA for Epinephrine Injection)ESTA -3.4% (commences $55 mln stock offering)Analyst comments:GLP -2.1% (downgraded to Underweight from Neutral at JP Morgan)CPRI -2.1% (downgraded to Hold at Needham on low visibility)CAL -1.2% (downgraded to Hold at Needham on low visibility for 2020)NUE -1% (downgraded to Underweight from Neutral at JP Morgan)08:00WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +13.90.

CytoSorb is the only approved therapy to remove ticagrelor in the EU, and it is intended to address a major unmet medical need of potentially life-threatening postoperative bleeding in cardiothoracic surgery patients on the drug.COO Vincent Capponi said, "With the approval of CytoSorb for this indication, it may encourage a preference in the selection of ticagrelor [...] as a first-line therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome, given that roughly 10-15% of these patients, or approximately 110,000-165,000 patients in the U.S., and approximately 70,000-100,000 patients in Europe each year will require emergent or urgent cardiac surgery and will be at high risk of bleeding. Now that we can officially market this application on-label internationally, we plan to drive CytoSorb as standard of care for the removal of ticagrelor during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures in every country we serve [...]. In addition, we are aggressively pursuing an approval path for this application in the United States as well."Ticagrelor is marketed by Astra Zeneca (AZN) and sold under the tradenames Brilique in the EU and Brilinta in the US, with projected worldwide sales of more than $1.5 bln in 2019, with more than half of sales coming from Europe, emerging markets, and rest of world.07:33HES Hess misses by $0.12, beats on revs (62.12 )Reports Q4 (Dec) loss of $0.60 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.12 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.48); revenues rose 0.5% year/year to $1.69 bln vs the $1.54 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.07:31PTC PTC to offer $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2025 and senior notes due 2028 in a private offering that is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (84.41 )PTC expects to use $530 million of the net proceeds of the offering of the notes to redeem all $500 million of its outstanding 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024, including the payment of premium and accrued and unpaid interest thereon, on or about May 15, 2020.

The Nasdaq Composite led the rebound with a 1.4% gain, while the S&P 500 (+1.0%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), and Russell 2000 (+0.9%) followed behind.The day began with modest gains, as the market looked past disappointing earnings reports from 3M (MMM 165.56, -10.07, -5.7%) and Pfizer (PFE 38.14, -2.02, -5.0%), then stocks climbed higher soon after the Conference Board released its Consumer Confidence Index for January. That index rose to 131.6 (Briefing.com consensus 128.0) from 128.2 in December.All 11 S&P 500 sectors contributed to the rally, including five that rose at least 1.0%.

STS101 is currently being evaluated as an acute treatment for migraine in an ongoing Phase 3 efficacy trial (the EMERGE trial), for which Satsuma expects to report top-line data in the second half of this year.16:08OSIS OSI Systems beats by $0.04, misses on revs; guides FY20 EPS in-line, revs below consensus (96.30 +1.58)Reports Q2 (Dec) earnings of $1.27 per share, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.23; revenues rose 0.7% year/year to $305.34 mln vs the $316.75 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Book-to-bill ratio was 1.1x.Co's backlog at the end of 2019 was $886 mln compared to $911 mln as of June 30, 2019.Co issues guidance for FY20, raises EPS guidance to $4.63 to $4.85 from $4.61 to $4.83 vs. $4.71 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; lowers FY20 revs guidance to $1.205 bln to $1.240 bln from $1.238 bln to $1.273 vs. $1.25 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.16:07SBUX Starbucks beats by $0.03, reports revs in-line; reaffirms FY20 EPS guidance, revs guidance (88.60 -0.13)Reports Q1 (Dec) earnings of $0.79 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.76; revenues rose 7.0% year/year to $7.1 bln vs the $7.11 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Global comparable store sales up 5% (vs 4.3% estimate), driven by a 3% increase in average ticket and a 2% increase in comparable transactions Americas comparable store sales up 6%, driven by a 3% increase in average ticket and a 2% increase in comparable transactions; U.S. comparable store sales up 6%, with comparable transactions up 3% International comparable store sales up 1%, driven by a 2% increase in average ticket and a 1% decrease in comparable transactions; China comparable store sales up 3%, with comparable transactions up 1% Co reaffirms guidance for FY20, sees EPS of $3.00-3.05, excluding non-recurring items, vs. $3.05 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees FY20 revs +6-8% (implying $28.1-28.6 bln) vs. $28.41 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Co also reaffirmed guidance for comps +3-4%Co states, "Currently, we have closed more than half of our stores in China and continue to monitor and modify the operating hours of all of our stores in the market in response to the outbreak of the coronavirus.

The study met the primary endpoint of significant triglyceride lowering and multiple secondary endpoints with a favorable safety and tolerability profile. The objective of the dose-ranging Phase 2 study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx. The study included 105 patients. Participants were administered AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx or placebo via subcutaneous injection for six months. Weekly and monthly dosing was explored in three cohorts with doses ranging from 40 mg to 80 mg of total monthly dose. Observations from the AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx study included: Statistically significant dose-dependent reductions in fasting triglycerides compared to placebo at all dose levels.Dose-dependent reductions in ANGPTL3, apoC-III, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL-C), non-HDL cholesterol and total cholesterol compared to placebo.No reductions in liver fat or hemoglobin A1C compared to placebo.AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx was generally well-tolerated and demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile.

Reserves are going to move in a broad range as I mentioned, and we want to be clear that that will be the bottom end of the range. We want 1.5 trillion or there abouts to be the bottom end of the range, so most of the time reserves will be moving in a range substantially higher than that, but not going below 1.5 trillion, so it's not something that we're aiming at all the time'.14:41ECONX Fed Chair Powell Conference Call- Reiterates Fed not comfortable with inflation running below 2%'As bill purchases continue to purchase reserves toward levels that maintain ample conditions, the role paid by active repo operations will recede. Over the first half of this year, we intend to adjust the size and pricing of repo pricing as we transition away from active use in supplying reserves'.'Intend to slow the pace of repos as it expects to reach an ample level in Q'.Asked about the small change in language around inflation ('inflation returning to the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective')- 'December Minutes, we noted that a few Committee Members stated the language that supported monetary policy would support inflation near 2% could be misinterpreted as suggesting that policymakers were comfortable with inflation running below that level. So, we thought about that in the intervening period, and concluded that it would be appropriate to adjust that language to send a clearer signal that we're not comfortable with inflation rising or running persistently below our 2% symmetric objective, so yes, there is something in that'.14:35ECONX Fed Chair Powell Conference CallGrowth in household spending moderated toward the end of last year, but with a healthy job market, rising incomes, and upbeat consumer confidence, the fundamental supporting household spending are solid. In contrast, business investment and exports remain weak and manufacturing output has declined over the past year. Sluggish growth abroad and trade developments have been weighing on activity in these sectors. However, some of the uncertainties around the trade have diminished recently and there are some signs that global growth may be stabilizing after declining since mid-2018. Nonetheless, uncertainties about the outlook remain, including those posed by the new coronavirus. Overall, with monetary and financial conditions supportive, we expect moderate economic growth to continue.Available data suggests similar inflation readings for December, though we expect inflation to move closer to 2% over the next few months as unusually low readings from early 2019 drop out of the calculation. While lowand stable inflation is a good thing, below our objective can have longer term inflation objectives to drift down and pulling actual inflation even lower. In turn, interest rates would be lower as well, closer to their effective lower bound. As a result, we would have less room to reduce interest rates to support the economy in a future downturn to the detriment of American families and businesses. We have seen this dynamic play out in other economies around the world and we're determined to avoid it here in the United States.In light of the stability in the Federal Funds Rate and money market conditions generally we decided to make a small technical upward adjustment to administered funds to ensure the federal funds rate trades well within the target range.14:32COMDX Energy Settlement PricesMar Crude Oil futures fell $0.35 (-0.65%) to $53.27/barrel Mar Natural Gas $0.04 lower (-2.04%) at $1.869/MMBtu Mar RBOB Gasoline settled $0.02 higher (1.5%) at $1.5402/gallon Mar Heating oil futures settled $0.02 lower (-0.96%) at $1.7035/gallon14:31ECONX Fed Chair Powell conference call under way14:21PNM PNM Resources says request for a stay of the ETA case was denied; Court granted the joint petition, confirming the applicability of the ETA and requiring the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (NMPRC) to apply the ETA to all of PNM's application (stock remains halted) (54.47 +0.15)Today the New Mexico Supreme Court ruled on a joint Emergency Verified Petition from New Mexico Governor Lujan Grisham, Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez, Speaker of the New Mexico House of Representatives Brian Egolf and other New Mexico lawmakers to provide clarification about the applicability of the Energy Transition Act (ETA) to PNM's application for San Juan Generating Station abandonment, securitization and replacement power.The Court granted the joint petition, confirming the applicability of the ETA and requiring the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (NMPRC) to apply the ETA to all of PNM's application. The Court further noted that any previous NMPRC orders inconsistent with today's order should be vacated.

Dec 11- The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances at 1.55 percent, effective December 12, 2019.Reaffirms- In light of recent and expected increases in the Federal Reserve's non-reserve liabilities, the Committee directs the Desk to continue purchasing Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of 2020 to maintain over time ample reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September 2019. The Committee also directs the Desk to continue conducting term and overnight repurchase agreement operations at least through April 2020 to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample even during periods of sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation... Dec 11- The Committee also directs the Desk to continue conducting term and overnight repurchase agreement operations at least through January 2020 to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample even during periods of sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation. In addition, the Committee directs the Desk to conduct overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 1.50 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day... Dec 11- In addition, the Committee directs the Desk to conduct overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 1.45 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day.Reaffirms- Principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities up to $20 billion per month will continue to be reinvested in Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding; principal payments in excess of $20 billion per month will continue to be reinvested in agency mortgage-backed securities.14:00ECONX FOMC leaves rates unchanged at 1.50-1.75% as widely expected"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Although household spending has been rising at a moderate pace, business fixed investment and exports remain weak. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.""Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. The Committee judges that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation returning to the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective. The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including global developments and muted inflation pressures, as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate.""In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.""Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michelle W. Bowman; Lael Brainard; Richard H. Clarida; Patrick Harker; Robert S. Kaplan; Neel Kashkari; Loretta J. Mester; and Randal K. Quarles."14:00ECONX FOMC leaves rates unchanged as widely expected; Economic activity has been rising at a moderate rateJan 15 Beige Book- Economic activity generally continued to expand modestly in the final six weeks of 2019.December 11 Statement- economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate.13:49COMDX Metals Settlement PricesFeb gold settled today's session down $0.20 (0.01%) at $1569.8/oz Mar silver settled today's session $0.02 higher (0.09%) at $17.465/oz Mar copper settled $0.02 lower (0.97%) at $2.557/lb13:49LVS Las Vegas Sands Q4 earnings preview (65.13 +0.72)Las Vegas Sands (LVS) will report fourth quarter earnings tonight after the close at approximately 16:05 ETThere is a conference call scheduled for 16:30 ET. Q4 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $0.78 (+3% yr/yr) on revenue of $3.37 bln (-2.6% yr/yr). The company typically does not provide EPS or revenue guidance. LVS gets 65% of its revenue of Macau, while its Las Vegas operations only make up 12% of revenues. The first item of interest will be any commentary on impact from the coronavirus outbreak in China. October Macau gross gaming revenues fell 3.2% yr/yr, November gaming revenues fell 8.5% yr/yr, and December gaming revenues fell 13.7% yr/yr. The decline in gross revenues in December was deemed to be primarily a function of increased security for President Xi's visit to Macau to mark the anniversary of its handover to China, which impeded normal casino traffic.Looking back, the company beat EPS and revenues once out of the last four quarters. LVS has a $51 bln valuation and trades at 19x 2020 versus Wynn Resorts (WYNN) which trades at 22 times earnings.Based on the LVS Jan31 $65 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~5% in either direction by weekly expiration (Friday, January 31).13:48XLI Sector Briefing: Industrials (83.45 +0.95)Apple (AAPL 326.61, +8.92, +2.8%) has commanded a lot of attention as a key driver of today's market action. That is an accurate characterization, yet it is the S&P industrials sector (+1.2%) that is the top-performing sector today.The strength in the industrials sector isn't rooted so much in optimism about the economic outlook so much as it is rooted in the trading responses to earnings results from several companies in the sector. In brief, it is a bottom-up bounce today, fueled by some better-than-expected results and/or some better-than-feared results/guidance. It hasn't been all good, however.Notable Movers:Boeing (BA 324.59, +8.03, +2.5%): Reported a huge Q4 loss of ($2.33) per share, which was worse than expected; however, analysts citing some relief that charges were not as large as expected and that the mid-2020 737 MAX service target date was maintained.General Electric (GE 12.92, +1.19, +10.1%): Posted better-than-expected Q4 EPS result, but issued downside EPS guidance for FY20. Analysts and investors, however, applauding improved cash flow generation in quarter and pleasing FY20 free cash flow guidance range of $2-4 billion.Norfolk Southern (NSC 217.69, +12.93, +6.4%): Railroad operator easily exceeded Q4 EPS estimate. Revenues were down 7.1% yr/yr, but analysts highlighting better-than-expected railway operating ratio of 64.2%.Alaska Airlines (ALK 66.99, +1.45, +2.2%): Topped Q4 consensus EPS estimate on a 7.9% increase in revenue; company also raised its dividend by 7% to $0.375 per shareIngersoll-Rand (IR 134.33, +3.55, +2.7%): Fell short of Q4 consensus EPS estimate with operating margin slipping to 12.5% from 12.9% in same period a year agoC.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW 73.06, -4.82, -6.2%): Came up well short of Q4 consensus EPS estimate with higher expenses hurting; company also announced acquisition of Prime Distribution Services for ~$225 million in cash.General Dynamics (GD 183.65, +0.01, +0.01%): Traded lower after exceeding revenue and EPS estimates for Q4, but found support at its 200-day moving average (179.86) and has recovered all of its earlier losses.Stanley Black & Decker (SWK 162.81, -3.54, -2.1%): Came up shy of consensus Q4 revenue and EPS estimates. FY20 adjusted EPS guidance of $8.80-9.00 was shy of analysts' average estimate.13:12OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:APT Feb 7.5 calls (volume: 1500, open int: 33601, implied vol: ~182%, prev day implied vol: 173%).

The S&P 500 (+0.3%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%), and Nasdaq Composite (+0.3%) sport modest gains in this earnings-driven session.Besides Apple, which is the Dow's highest-priced component, the blue-chip average can credit its slight advantage to positive earnings reactions in Boeing (BA 323.68, +7.12, +2.3%), McDonald's (MCD 312.94, +3.65, +2.3%), and Dow Inc (DOW 49.59, +2.43, +5.1%). Former Dow component General Electric (GE 12.97, +1.23) is up 10.5% following its results.Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are trading higher, led by the industrials (+1.0%), materials (+0.6%), and information technology (+0.6%) sectors. The communication services sector (-0.4%) is among the laggards amid a poor response to AT&T's (T 37.17, -1.41, -3.6%) earnings results.Transports, meanwhile, are rallying around an earnings beat from Norfolk Southern (NSC 217.66, +12.90, +6.3%), while the semiconductor space is succumbing to profit taking after AMD (AMD 46.92, -3.61, -7.2%) and Xilinx (XLNX 89.11, -9.50, -9.6%) provided disappointing quarterly revenue guidance.Earnings have been the focus so far, but attention will start to divert toward the Fed when it releases its policy directive at 2:00 p.m. ET. The fed funds rate is widely expected to remain unchanged, and investors will presumably be listening intently during Fed Chair Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET.Separately, there appears to be lingering concerns about the coronavirus and its impact on corporate earnings growth, especially after Starbucks (SBUX 86.02, -3.58, -2.9%) said it will temporarily close half of its stores in China amid the outbreak.

EBITDA outlook to $49-53 mln from prior guidance for $38-46 mln. The update results from lower input costs, timing of certain expenses, and strong business execution. Also appointed Arsen S. Kitch, co's SVP and general manager for its consumer products division, as its next CEO, effective at the start of April; Mr. Kitch succeeds Linda K. Massman, who will retire after having served as CEO since 2013. At ten-month highs.MTSI (30.58 +16.41%): Reaches its new highest levels in close to two years after reporting Q1 results. Co topped consensus for Q1 EPS and revs and issued upside guidance for Q2. Revs fell 21.0% yr/yr to $119.1 mln, which represents a +6.1% increase sequentially. Adj. gross margin also increased sequentially, reaching 53.5% vs 53.0% in the prior fiscal quarter, down from 56.3% in the year ago quarter. During its call, co credited demand for 5G products among motivators for sequential growth in its Telecom end market.ARAY (4.28 +13.53%): Announced Q2 results. Co reported net orders growth of +30% yr/yr to $89.9 mln and gross orders of $98.6 mln, including 11 orders from China; total backlog increased +12% yr/yr to $539.4 mln. Co expects revenue growth to improve in the second half of the year, as it believes that revenue recognition of China Type A systems will begin in co's fiscal Q4. Raised FY20 adj. EBITDA guidance. Reaches nine-month highs.Small Cap LosersI (4.15 -23.66%): Sees weakness after the Senate introduced bipartisan legislation pertaining to an auction for C-band satellite spectrum airwaves; the bill would reportedly offer limited payout to co and other satellite operators and C-Band Alliance peers. Bloomberg Law also points to reports that the FCC chairman's office is in favor of a set incentive payment structure, with the set payment floated at $5 bln, as further cause for today's weakness. The C-Band Alliance's stance, as of a letter addressed to the FCC earlier this week, includes the argument that it "simply [does] not have the flexibility to proceed" in assisting spectrum transition and adopting accelerated clearing "unless [it is] offered the opportunity to share fairly and appropriately in the value being created through [its] tremendous [...] efforts," and it believes, favoring a variable payment, that "such sharing is most easily expressed through a formula directly tied to the actual realized proceeds of any C-band auction." The stock, which had traded in a relatively narrow range since plunging lower on C-band developments in November, now reaches its new lowest levels in more than a year. CMTL (29.9 -19.41%): To acquire Gilat Satellite (GILT) in a transaction with an enterprise value of approx. $532.5 mln -- the total consideration amounts to $10.25/share, or $7.18/share in cash and 0.08425 of a share of co's common stock per GILT share held. The consideration represents a premium of approx. +14.52% to Gilat's 90-day weighted average trading price. Co believes that the transaction positions it to capitalize on growing demand for satellite connectivity and long-term opportunities emerging in the secure wireless communications market. Co is not revising its previously announced FY financial outlook but will provide combined guidance in a future announcement once the transaction closes. At three-month lows. EXTR (6.51 -10.4%): Reported in-line Q2 EPS and downside revs (+5.9% yr/yr to $267.5 mln). Co attributes its Q2 revenue shortfall to weakness in the US public sector and Asia Pacific. Guided Q3 EPS and revs below consensus. Impacting co's revenue guidance are limits to near-term visibility to US public sector funding, certain areas of weakness in US service provider and retail verticals, and co's outlook in the Asia Pacific region, noted co during its call. Touched down to two-month lows.11:38BLK BlackRock increases quarterly dividend to $3.63/share from $3.30/share (537.12 +7.15)11:38SMH Industry Briefing: Chipmakers (142.93 -2.32)The PHLX Semiconductor Index (-1.9%) trades behind the broader market, widening this week's loss to 3.4%.

The company has cancelled three sailings through Feb 8, on the high yielding Spectrum of the Seas, currently its only ship homeported in China. Co estimates that this (which included the Chinese new year's cruises) will impact 2020 financial results by approximately $0.10 per share. If the travel restrictions in China continue until the end of February, the company estimates that this would further impact its results by an additional $0.10 per share. There are still too many variables and uncertainties regarding this outbreak to calculate the overall impact on the business. For example, co expects an erosion of consumer confidence in China could have an additional impact on load factor and rate in the region until the market normalizes. If these travel restrictions continue for an extended period of time, they could have a material impact on overall financial performance.

"For affected patients, despite current treatment options, there is an urgent unmet need for more effective and durable therapies that can provide reliable, complete, and persistent remission from the disease beyond general immune suppression and B cell depletion provided by current treatment options. Orphan Drug Designation is an important recognition for investigational therapies for rare diseases and provides us with potentially valuable benefits as we prepare to initiate the DesCAARTes trial to generate and then report acute safety data from the first cohort of patients by the end of 2020."08:01SUMRX Gapping up/down: GE +6%, GLW +5%, DOW +3% and BA +1% after earnings, FB +1.6% after upgrade; XLNX -8%, AMD -5%, EAT -2% and SBUX -1% after earningsGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:MTSI +12.7%, GE +6.2%, MSTR +5.6%, SC +5.5%, DT +5%, GLW +5%, MINI +4.9%, MXIM +4.2%, CMRE +2.8%, DOW +2.6%, WRB +2.1%, SYK +1.8%, AAPL +1.6%, MKSI +1.4%, MPC +1.3%, NDAQ +1.2%, BA +1.2%, SMG +1.1%, SWK +1%, RES +0.9%, NVR +0.7%, NYCB +0.6%, EXTR +0.6%, NVS +0.5%, TXT +0.5%, GD +0.5%Other news:CTSO +13.6% (announces approval and availability of CytoSorb for the removal of ticagrelor during surgery requiring CPB in the EU) LB +11% (CEO Leslie Wexner aims to step aside amid push for strategic alternatives at Victoria's Secret, according to WSJ) ORTX +7.8% (receives orphan drug designation from the FDA for OTL-102) SRNE +6.7% (announces manufacturing collaboration with Celularity to initiate emergency allogeneic NK cell therapy development for coronavirus infection) TEVA +2.9% (FDA approval for AJOVY injection autoinjector device)Analyst comments:FB +1.6% (upgraded to Strong Buy from Outperform at Raymond James)HOG +0.9% (upgraded to Sector Weight from Underweight at KeyBanc Capital Markets)Gapping downIn reaction to disappointing earnings/guidance:XLNX -8.2% (also announces 7% global workforce reduction), CHRW -8.2% (also will acquire Prime Distribution for $225 mln), EBAY -5.2%, AMD -4.7%, ADP -3.4%, ANTM -2.9%, SLAB -2.1%, EAT -2%, TRMK -1.8%, RXN -1.6%, ALK -1.4%, IR -1.3%, MKTX -1.3%, LFUS -1.2%, SBUX -1%, BXP -0.7%, SKY -0.6%, BXP -0.6%, T -0.6%, MCD -0.5%Other news:BHVN -11% (prices underwritten public offering of 4,830,917 of its common shares at a price to the public of $51.75 per share)CERS -3.6% (commences $50 mln public offering)DNLI -3.6% (prices offering of 7,826,087 shares of common stock at $23.00 per share) AMPH -3.4% (FDA issued a "MINOR" Complete Response Letter for its ANDA for Epinephrine Injection)ESTA -3.4% (commences $55 mln stock offering)Analyst comments:GLP -2.1% (downgraded to Underweight from Neutral at JP Morgan)CPRI -2.1% (downgraded to Hold at Needham on low visibility)CAL -1.2% (downgraded to Hold at Needham on low visibility for 2020)NUE -1% (downgraded to Underweight from Neutral at JP Morgan)08:00WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +13.90.

CytoSorb is the only approved therapy to remove ticagrelor in the EU, and it is intended to address a major unmet medical need of potentially life-threatening postoperative bleeding in cardiothoracic surgery patients on the drug.COO Vincent Capponi said, "With the approval of CytoSorb for this indication, it may encourage a preference in the selection of ticagrelor [...] as a first-line therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome, given that roughly 10-15% of these patients, or approximately 110,000-165,000 patients in the U.S., and approximately 70,000-100,000 patients in Europe each year will require emergent or urgent cardiac surgery and will be at high risk of bleeding. Now that we can officially market this application on-label internationally, we plan to drive CytoSorb as standard of care for the removal of ticagrelor during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures in every country we serve [...]. In addition, we are aggressively pursuing an approval path for this application in the United States as well."Ticagrelor is marketed by Astra Zeneca (AZN) and sold under the tradenames Brilique in the EU and Brilinta in the US, with projected worldwide sales of more than $1.5 bln in 2019, with more than half of sales coming from Europe, emerging markets, and rest of world.07:33HES Hess misses by $0.12, beats on revs (62.12 )Reports Q4 (Dec) loss of $0.60 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.12 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.48); revenues rose 0.5% year/year to $1.69 bln vs the $1.54 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.07:31PTC PTC to offer $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2025 and senior notes due 2028 in a private offering that is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (84.41 )PTC expects to use $530 million of the net proceeds of the offering of the notes to redeem all $500 million of its outstanding 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024, including the payment of premium and accrued and unpaid interest thereon, on or about May 15, 2020.

The Nasdaq Composite led the rebound with a 1.4% gain, while the S&P 500 (+1.0%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), and Russell 2000 (+0.9%) followed behind.The day began with modest gains, as the market looked past disappointing earnings reports from 3M (MMM 165.56, -10.07, -5.7%) and Pfizer (PFE 38.14, -2.02, -5.0%), then stocks climbed higher soon after the Conference Board released its Consumer Confidence Index for January. That index rose to 131.6 (Briefing.com consensus 128.0) from 128.2 in December.All 11 S&P 500 sectors contributed to the rally, including five that rose at least 1.0%.

Small businesses drive China's economy. The coronavirus outbreak could be fatal for manyCNN WireFebruary 14, 2020 Friday 12:08 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1240 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  The small companies that drive China's economy are worried about how much damage the novel coronavirus outbreak will cause. Without more help or a reprieve from the disease, many may have only weeks to survive. While some larger companies are reopening their doors after weeks of lockdowns designed to contain the epidemic, small businesses often can't comply with the strict health rules now required in many regions and many don't have the option of letting employees work from home.A survey of 163 companies of all sizes across China found that less than half were able to get back to work this week, according to investment bank China International Capital Corp, which published the results. Even more alarming: A third of roughly 1,000 small and medium-sized companies surveyed by academics from Tsinghua University and Peking University last week said they could only survive for a month with the cash they have. That could spell terrible news for China's entrepreneurs --- and an even worse reality for the country's economy. About 30 million small and medium-sized businesses contribute more than 60% of the country's GDP, according to government statistics published last September. The taxes they pay account for more than half of government revenue, and they employ more than 80% of China's workers.It's not clear how many of those companies will ultimately feel the full impact of the virus. Surveys cover only a tiny slice of the sector, and the full extent of the outbreak's consequences are still impossible to determine. But many small companies were already struggling before the coronavirus began infecting tens of thousands across the country. The world's second largest economy has been slowing down due to a combination of rising debt, a slump in domestic demand and a trade war with the United States. Now they face going without business for weeks on end. "The coronavirus could be the straw that breaks the camel's back," wrote Zhao Jian, director of the Shandong province-based Atlantis Research Institute in a research note earlier this month. He warned that if the outbreak doesn't end soon, unemployment will likely rise as businesses shut down --- a problem Beijing had been fighting hard this year to prevent. Job losses could spur a tide of housing foreclosures, Zhao added, compounding the country's economic woes.'We will die' without more moneySome business owners have gone public with their plight. Beijing entrepreneur Wu Hai wrote on social media app WeChat this week that the outbreak could destroy more than 50 karaoke bars he runs across the country. The pastime has been halted as the government maintains a shutdown of popular entertainment spots where "cross infection risks" are high.In the post, Wu lamented the closures and said the lack of business puts his 1,500 workers at risk of losing their jobs. He wrote that his company, MeiKTV, has about 12 million yuan ($1.7 million) in cash on hand, giving it about two months to survive if he's unable to reopen for business. "That means we will die in April unless investors continue to give us money," he wrote.Shu Congxuan, chairman of Home Original Chicken, said last Saturday that his fast food chain has shut more than 400 stores since the outbreak began. In a Weibo post, he warned that his company is in danger of running out of cash, since it still needs to pay rent and employees. But he said he would try to make sure his employees keep their jobs, even if he needs to sell his houses and cars.Other companies appear to be taking desperate measures to recoup at least some of their losses. Beijing-based Meizhou Dongpo Restaurant said on Weibo that its employees have set up stalls to sell fresh vegetables on the street. While the company did not elaborate on the reason for its decision, a local government-run newspaper reported that the restaurant had purchased fresh produce for the Lunar New Year holiday season, but was unable to use it because of the outbreak. The outcome for many businesses could be dire if the situation does not improve rapidly. According to the Tsinghua University and Peking University survey of firms, 85% of respondents said they would go out of business if the outbreak lasts three months. By the six month mark, 90% of the companies would collapse. Even a recovery in the near future may not come soon enough for some. Before the outbreak, Chinese companies were preparing to pay back or refinance a lot of debt this year, according to analysts at S&P Global Ratings. Given the rising risk to the economy, they may find it harder to borrow.The S&P researchers warned in a note this week that if the public health crisis stabilizes next month, liquidity will still be under pressure through at least the first half of the year. They added that the outbreak will also heighten the risk of default for Chinese companies. Government may need to do more Beijing already knows that it has a major problem on its hands. Before the outbreak, senior officials had characterized the prevention of mass unemployment as their top priority for 2020. Now that the likelihood of mass job losses is increasing, the country is going all out to stop it from happening.Some of the most prominent companies in China, for example, are taking in workers displaced by the outbreak. JD.com, one of China's largest e-commerce firms, earlier this week promised to open up more than 20,000 new positions. Alibaba announced a similar plan.The government is also stepping in. Last week, the People's Bank of China pumped billions of dollars into the money market to shore up banks' ability to lend money. The central bank also set up a 300 billion yuan ($43 billion) special fund to provide cheap loans to key companies in epidemic prevention. Meanwhile, the finance ministry announced government subsidies to make those loans even cheaper.Local governments in Beijing, Shanghai and several provinces have also rolled out targeted measures to help small businesses, including offering subsidies to landlords so they can reduce rents, and allowing small companies to delay the payment of social security contributions or taxes.But it's not clear how helpful some of those policies will be.Wu, the karaoke bar owner, wrote in his WeChat post that he felt his company was still at a "dead end" even with the policies offered to him. Social security, for example, is still a major expense for employers. Wu suggested that simply delaying those payments would not really help. "Social Security Bureau, how generous you are," Wu commented sarcastically. "Our employees are going to lose jobs. The company is going to collapse. You not only don't want to take some money out, but you still want to collect money from us --- not even a penny less!"Wu did not respond to a request for comment from CNN Business. But in his WeChat post he also criticized the usefulness of giving subsidies to landlords. While he said the policy is "well intended," he questioned whether landlords would actually reduce the amount their tenants pay. He also doubted the effectiveness of preferential loans set up by the central bank. "We have no fixed assets as collateral. We have no operating cash flows --- because we can't open for business --- as collateral," Wu wrote. "Tell me, which small and medium-sized company can get the bank funding?"TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Democracies Are Better at Fighting OutbreaksAtlantic OnlineFebruary 24, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1853 wordsByline: Ariana A. BerengautBodyWhen Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, declared late last month that the outbreak of the novel coronavirus was an international public-health emergency, he took pains to commend China for its response to the pathogen. "In many ways, China actually is setting a new standard for outbreak response, and it's not an exaggeration," he said. As the new disease, now called COVID-19, grew into a health crisis, Chinese officials had quarantined entire cities in a matter of days, suspended travel, closed schools and businesses, and imposed severe restrictions on who could leave their homes. Local researchers rapidly sequenced and shared the virus's genome, allowing labs around the world to work on their own diagnostic tools. Authorities built two new "specialized hospitals" in 10 days, footage of which China's state-owned media pumped out to the world on social media. They leveraged their formidable surveillance powers to scale up contact tracing, an essential measure in stopping an outbreak. President Donald Trump tweeted in praise of China's "great discipline."Even after subsequent reports indicated that the Chinese government's secrecy and hostility to dissent had helped the outbreak spread, WHO officials have continued to laud Beijing's response. At a conference in Munich earlier this month, Michael Ryan, the executive director of the organization's Health Emergencies Programme, maintained that people in China feel protected. "They feel like their government has stepped in aggressively and quickly to protect them," he said. "That is the ultimate social contract between any government and its people."During a public-health crisis, governments in the United States and the rest of the world are forced to consider measures-such as requiring health checks, limiting movement, and instituting quarantines-that infringe on individual liberties. The crisis now unfolding in China raises an uncomfortable question: Are authoritarian governments better equipped than democracies to meet the challenge of an epidemic?[Read: How the coronavirus revealed authoritarianism's fatal flaw]A decade into a global backlash against liberal democracy, that question is urgent. Aspiring autocrats, from Hungary's Viktor OrbÃ¡n to Uganda's Yoweri Museveni, cherry-pick from a menu of repressive tactics and technologies-from building surveillance systems to banning independent media outlets-to exert control and retain power. The "China model" is alluring to democracy's critics, for whom China's firm handling of the COVID-19 outbreak looks like another proof point for authoritarianism.Yet good public-health practice doesn't just require control. It also requires transparency, public trust, and collaboration-habits of mind that allow free societies to better respond to pandemics. Democracies' ability to cope with COVID-19 will soon be tested; after a proliferation of cases in South Korea, Japan, and Italy in recent days, officials are weighing how to respond. But citizens of democratic nations can reasonably expect a higher level of candor and accountability from their governments.American citizens, for example, can count on the objectivity and accuracy of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose weekly morbidity and mortality report has been a fixture of critical communication between the government and the public in one form or another since the late 1800s. Reliable reporting enables epidemiologists to predict a disease's trajectory, researchers to develop treatments and vaccines, responders to trace transmission, and the public to protect itself.In contrast, China actively hid the 2003 SARS outbreak from the international community, and, especially in the initial stages of COVID-19, it            appears to have done so again. Local authorities deliberately suppressed early reports of the unknown virus, missing an early window responders had to stop the infectious disease before it spread. Although researchers released the virus's genetic sequence in record time, local officials underreported cases, downplayed the risk of human-to-human transmission, and detained doctors who discussed the disease.When one of those doctors, Li Wenliang, tried to warn friends on the social-media service WeChat, he was summoned before authorities and required to disavow his concerns. He later died of complications from COVID-19. When asked during a BBC interview about Li's treatment, the Chinese diplomat Liu Ziaoming            shrugged it off as the handiwork of overzealous local officials. But that is precisely the point. China's cover-up of the virus was not the result of a system malfunction. In an authoritarian state, cover-ups happen by design. The language of authoritarianism-the language of fear and force-is one that every low-ranked apparatchik from Pripyat to Wuhan understands when acting on his or her own initiative to bury bad news.Two months into the crisis, international researchers continue to            warn of missing information from China. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, diplomatically            referred to this gap recently as the difference between "numbers that are given to you in a press conference as opposed to numbers [where] you can actually look at the data."Full transparency is impossible without public trust, something authoritarian regimes have a steady deficit of. China's Communist Party now says it wants to hear the truth. But public trust-the freedom citizens enjoy to think critically, the safety they feel to speak out, the confidence they require to overcome fearful or difficult circumstances-is not a resource a government can turn on and off like tap water. It is a habit forged over time.Today, rampant fear and mistrust are perhaps the greatest barriers health-care workers face in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for example, where an Ebola outbreak is continuing into its 18th month. During the 2014 Ebola response, community trust, not intimidation, was the key component in persuading people to adopt proven solutions-such as surrendering the infected bodies of deceased loved ones-that run counter to human instinct. In China, the lack of trust was precisely what forced discussion of a previously unknown coronavirus deep into the bowels of supposedly private-messenger programs.[           Nahid Bhadelia: The best defense against disturbing new diseases]China's reliance on coercion will only intensify as officials become more desperate to restart the country's economic engine and reestablish normal ties with the world. There is no doubt that China can efficiently compel certain behavior changes in the short term. But the longer the crisis lasts, the less effective these tactics will be.Democracies do not get everything right. In 2014, a returning Ebola nurse named Kaci Hickox was forced into quarantine at the Newark airport without clear medical cause and initially prohibited from seeing a lawyer or receiving visitors. But unlike in authoritarian systems, citizens in democracies have established channels through which they can reassert their rights and seek accountability for abuse. Although American courts typically defer to a state's authority to enact necessary quarantine orders, Hickox's suit against New Jersey state officials led to important changes to the law, including guaranteeing those in quarantine the right to legal counsel and privacy. Instead of undermining public trust, the incident helped replenish it.The ease with which an infectious disease spreads around the world demands international collaboration to contain it, and democracies cooperate more than non-democracies. (The popular board game Pandemic, in which players must work together in order to win, isn't far from the truth.) Historically, from the United Nations charter to the Paris climate accords, the nations that have had the wherewithal to identify shared problems and build partnerships behind common solutions have been democracies. In 2014, the United States led 62 countries to stop a major Ebola outbreak. Although nations like China and Cuba contributed to the response, it was the United States that also led the effort to prevent the next disaster. (At the time, I was working on the Ebola crisis response at the U.S. Agency for International Development.) At the height of the Ebola crisis, President Barack Obama convened 44 nations in Washington to advance the Global Health Security Agenda, a community that now includes 67 nations.Unsurprisingly, China's political system is incompatible with this approach. Recently, after weeks of negotiating, China finally agreed to allow in a senior WHO team, which            includes two Americans. But Beijing continues to ignore the CDC's offers to send its own expert team. Even in a public-health crisis, the Communist Party comes first. As cases of the virus first popped up around the world and nations started suspending flights, Taiwan-which Beijing views as a breakaway province-was            excluded from fast-moving discussions. Barred from international organizations at Beijing's behest, Taiwan struggled to gain access to timely information and technical meetings of the WHO and the International Civil Aviation Organization.Members of the global community cannot stop new outbreaks, but they can work together to build systems that quickly detect and effectively respond to them, especially by protecting the most vulnerable. Democratic societies tend to have better health and human development indicators, and not just because democratic societies are wealthier. A            study published in The Lancet in April 2019 found that a government responsive to voters is more likely to invest in durable health-care systems and asserted that policy makers concerned with health outcomes, particularly chronic conditions, "should also be concerned with democratic experience."[           Read: The coronavirus outbreak could bring out the worst in Trump]Yet the very advantages that a democracy has in a public-health emergency are also those under greatest threat today from Trump and like-minded populists and nationalists around the world. In the United States, Trump has eviscerated traditional sources of public trust and trampled on almost every form of international cooperation. He            drove away science-policy advisers,            dismantled the White House office tasked with preventing pandemics, and            ousted its well-respected chief. Even as the number of COVID-19 cases multiplied, Trump            proposed slashing more than $3 billion in overall funding for global health.If and when the coronavirus is finally brought to heel, China will rightly celebrate its success but wrongly view it as validation of its system. The world may never know how many lives could have been saved if nations embraced democratic norms of transparency and collaboration. But as China expands its quarantine restrictions ever further, it offers a glimpse of the future should the world continue to lean away.Load-Date: February 25, 2020End of Document

Co's Austrian subsidiary, Laudamotion, continues to underperform as a result of intense price competition with Lufthansa subsidiaries, though it has seen "strong traffic growth and high load factors." Raised its FY PAT guidance range to 950-1,050 mln (prior 800-900 mln); co currently expects to finish close to the mid-point of that new range. MELI (669.28 +3.53%): Continues to make steady gains; the stock has advanced by circa +10% over the last week and trades higher by about +17% month-to-date, at five-month highs. LEN (59.54 +3.21%): Raised its annual cash dividend by +213% -- to $0.50/share from $0.16/share -- commenting that its focus on "operational excellence, land strategy and cash flow" make a "diversified program" of shareholder returns, including a dividend increase, appropriate. Continued volatility following Q4 earnings.Large Cap LosersROKU (128.45 -3.99%): Continued volatility. The stock now trades with a loss month-to-date.ARNC (28.8 -3.28%): Continued underperformance. The stock has now reached two-month lows, down circa 8% through the most recent three sessions. Industrials sector generally lags.LYG (3.13 -3.23%): Drops to multi-week lows, lagging moderately alongside various UK financial peers. (Related: RBS, BCS)15:49TALKX Market Briefing: Late-day profit takingMajor indices are succumbing to late-day selling interest. Some rumors have swirled about "heavy jet activity in Iraq," yet the selling is probably (and most likely) tied up in the notion that it is overdue.The selling has been orderly, and steady, since about 2:00 p.m. ET, which is not the typical response from a market that gets spooked by an exogenous event.Most sectors are down, but none are down more than 1.0%, so, again, nothing panicky in the retreat that is also probably some position squaring going into the weekend. Two sectors -- real estate (+1.0%) and utilities (+0.2%) -- are up, as they are rate sensitive and are benefiting from the continued drop in market rates.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 are down 0.3%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000 are down 0.5%15:17BONDX Treasury Market SummarySoft Employment Report Boosts TreasuriesU.S. Treasuries ended the week on a higher note with most tenors enjoying their second consecutive day of gains. Treasury futures faced some pressure during the Asian session, which saw gains in most equity indices, but the dip in Treasury futures was reversed during the European session, which was not as upbeat. Longer tenors began the day just above their flat lines, but they surged to fresh highs after the release of the Employment Situation report for December. The report was not bad, but it was underwhelming, as nonfarm payrolls missed expectations (actual 145,000; Briefing.com consensus 160,000), average hourly earnings growth was shy of estimates (actual 0.1%; Briefing.com consensus 0.3%), and average workweek was unchanged from its downwardly revised November level (actual 34.3; Briefing.com consensus 34.4). As a result, average weekly earnings increased by just over a dollar (or 0.1%) to $971.38. On a yr/yr basis, average weekly earnings are up 2.3%. Longer-dated Treasuries overtook their opening highs in mid-morning trade and remained near their highs into the close while shorter tenors settled closer to the midpoint of today's range. The U.S. Dollar Index approached its 50-day moving average (97.60) in early-morning trade but retreated throughout the day. The Index slipped 0.1% to 97.35, narrowing this week's gain to 0.5%. Yield Check: 2-yr: -1 bp to 1.56% 3-yr: -1 bp to 1.58% 5-yr: -2 bps to 1.64% 10-yr: -3 bps to 1.83% 30-yr: -5 bps to 2.28%News: Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, announced new sanctions against Iran, targeting the country's aluminum, copper, iron, and steel manufacturers. Eight senior Iranian officials were also sanctioned. House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said that articles of impeachment will be sent to the Senate next week. Taiwan will hold a presidential election tomorrow. The Chinese government is reportedly making a strong effort to prevent incumbent Tsai Ing-wen from winning another term. Japan's November Leading Index decreased 0.7% m/m (last -0.3%) while November Coincident Indicator dipped 0.2% m/m (last -5.1%). November Household Spending rose 2.0% m/m (expected -9.8%; last -11.5%) but was down 2.0% yr/yr (expected 2.5%; last -5.1%). Australia's November Retail Sales rose 0.9% m/m (expected 0.4%; last 0.1%) while December AIG Services Index decreased to 48.7 from 53.7. Bloomberg reported that Italy could hold an early election ahead of a planned referendum on reducing the number of parliamentary seats to 600 from 945. The referendum is expected in May or June. Italy's non-performing loans have been reduced to their lowest level in a decade. France's November Industrial Production rose 0.3% m/m (expected 0.1%; last 0.5%). Italy's November Industrial Production ticked up 0.1% m/m, as expected (last -0.3%) but decreased 0.6% yr/yr, as expected (last -2.4%). Spain's November Industrial Production increased 2.1% yr/yr (expected -0.5%; last -1.3%). Today's Data: December nonfarm payrolls increased by 145,000 (Briefing.com consensus 160,000). Job gains have averaged 184,000 over the last three months. November nonfarm payrolls revised to 256,000 from 266,000. December private sector payrolls increased by 139,000 (Briefing.com consensus 157,000). November private sector payrolls revised to 243,000 from 254,000. December unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%), unchanged from November. Persons unemployed for 27 weeks or more accounted for 20.5% of the unemployed versus 20.8% in November. The U6 unemployment rate, which accounts for unemployed and underemployed workers, was 6.7%, versus 6.9% in November. December average hourly earnings were up 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.3% (from 0.2%) in November. Over the last 12 months, average hourly earnings have risen 2.9%, versus 3.1% for the 12 months ending in November. The average workweek in December was 34.3 hours (Briefing.com consensus 34.4) versus a downwardly revised 34.3 hours (from 34.4) in November. Wholesale inventories decreased 0.1% m/m in November (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing 0.1% in October. Wholesale sales surged 1.5% after declining 0.9% in October. The key takeaway from the report is that sales activity was strong in November, but it will still prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.

In Cohort 3 (n=3), there were two confirmed female responders and a third potential male responder; in Cohort 2, one female patient has newly demonstrated a response starting at Week 52, which was confirmed at Week 78, and two previously disclosed responders in Cohorts 1 and 2 also remain clinically and metabolically stable at 104 and 78 weeks, respectively. Up to six of all nine patients dosed in the study have demonstrated a response. Co expects to enroll the first patient in its fourth cohort, using prophylactic steroids, in the first half of 2020. Co is continuing discussions with the FDA regarding the potential Phase 3 study design. Hearing price target raised at SunTrust. Extends to its highest levels since August. NKTR (26.19 +21.32%): Co and Bristol-Myers (BMY) agreed to a new joint development plan to advance bempegaldesleukin plus Opdivo into multiple new registrational trials; the costs for studies to be expanded or initiated under the agreement will be shared based upon the companies' cost-sharing terms outlined in their original collaboration agreement. The collaboration includes the addition of an "important" Phase 3 study in adjuvant melanoma. At five-month highs. SNX (146.18 +13.46%): Reported upside Q4 EPS and revs (+18.7% yr/yr to $6.58 bln), raised its dividend, and announced plans to separate its businesses into two separate publicly-traded companies: 1) SYNNEX Technology Solutions, with approx. $19 bln in annual revenue, continuing as a "top three Americas and Japan IT distribution company," and 2) technology-infused CX solutions provider Concentrix, with approx. $4.7 bln in annual revs -- the segment saw revs grow +24.7% in Q4 due primarily to the Convergys acquisition. At all-time highs.Mid Cap LosersSIX (35.59 -18.68%): Disclosed that development of Six Flags-branded parks in China has been hampered by "severe challenges" faced due to macroeconomic conditions and China's declining real estate market. Co's partner in China, Riverside, has defaulted on certain payment obligations to co, and while co continues to work with Riverside, co notes that the "eventual outcome" of their agreement "is unknown and could range from the continuation of one or more projects to the termination of all the Six Flags-branded projects in China." For Q4, co will realize no revs from the China international agreements and expects a negative $1 mln rev adjustment related to China, as well as further one-time charges. Separately, co's North America parks also experienced lower attendance yr/yr in Q4 in connection with soft season pass and membership sales; co thus guided for total Q4 revs to fall by $8-10 mln yr/yr. Downgraded at Wells Fargo, Janney, and SunTrust. At multi-year lows. TPTX (57.55 -11.94%): Sinks from yesterday's all-time high on above average volume. In recent press, co announced the departure of its Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Jean Cui, who co-founded the company in 2013; Dr. Cui will depart on January 31 for family reasons, though she will serve as a consultant and support co during a transition period through the end of June. ACB (1.67 -10.47%): Downgraded at BofA Merrill -- to Underperform from Neutral -- and at Piper Sandler, which lowers co's rating to Neutral, anticipating that near-term balance sheet constraints will pressure co's production capacity. At two-year lows.14:33COMDX Energy Settlement PricesMar Crude Oil futures fell $0.43 (-0.72%) to $59.13/barrel Feb Natural Gas $0.03 higher (1.45%) at $2.169/MMBtu Feb RBOB Gasoline settled $0.01 higher (0.52%) at $1.6717/gallon Feb Heating oil futures settled $0.02 lower (-0.88%) at $1.9341/gallon13:58COMDX Metals Settlement PricesFeb gold settled today's session up $5.50 (0.35%) at $1559.7/oz Mar silver settled today's session $0.17 higher (0.95%) at $18.105/oz Mar copper settled $0.02 higher (0.75%) at $2.8175/lb13:31SUMRX Earnings Out Next WeekMonday (Jan 13)Morning: SJRTuesday (Jan 14)Morning: APHA C DAL FRC INFO JPM WFC WITAfternoon: OGI WAFDWednesday (Jan 15)Morning: BAC BLK GS PNC USB UNHAfternoon: AA EGBN HWC KMIThursday (Jan 16)Morning: BK HOMB IIIN MS PPG TSM WNSAfternoon: OZK BEDU CSX PBCT PRGSFriday (Jan 17) Morning: CFG FAST FHN JBHT KSU RF SLB STT13:23SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: DERM (24.07 mln +4.47%), ACB (23.37 mln -9.41%), PTLA (15.42 mln -42.12%)Industrials: GE (34.9 mln -1.18%)Consumer Discretionary: NIO (24.21 mln +0.58%), F (19.95 mln +0.7%), BBBY (12.58 mln +5.84%), SIX (12 mln -18.6%)Information Technology: AMD (27.98 mln -1.09%), INFY (23.14 mln +2.24%), AAPL (22.96 mln +0.16%), NOK (14.32 mln +0.5%), MU (11.71 mln -0.84%)Financials: BAC (22.58 mln -0.53%), QQQ (12.16 mln +0.06%)Energy: CHK (42.3 mln -6.14%), SWN (12.06 mln +0.24%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: PTLA (16.05x -42.12%), DERM (15.27x +4.47%), ACRS (13.1x +15.02%), CYRX (4.27x -7.17%), RARE (4.2x +32.08%), MRTX (3.2x +1.31%), ELAN (2.74x +2.73%), NKTR (2.63x +18.16%)Consumer Discretionary: SIX (10.73x -18.6%), KBH (2.13x -2.4%)Information Technology: SNX (5.12x +13.25%), INFY (2.56x +2.24%), APPN (2.44x +3.57%)Financials: PDBC (5.16x +0%), KB (3.2x +0.06%), OCFC (2.45x -1.61%)Energy: KRP (20.09x -9.44%)Consumer Staples: SMPL (2.53x -1.97%)13:23SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: RARE (57.76 +32.08%), NKTR (25.51 +18.16%), ACRS (2.14 +15.02%), RVNC (18.57 +12.65%), MRNA (19.75 +7.34%), VYGR (14.68 +5.92%), APLS (39.25 +5.8%), BPMC (85.41 +5.67%), SLP (33.42 +5.49%), TGTX (13.7 +5.14%)Materials: NG (8.93 +8.31%), NGD (0.99 +6.3%), MUX (1.23 +5.13%)Industrials: RYAAY (96.13 +6.81%), MAXR (20.03 +6.2%)Consumer Discretionary: GTX (9.2 +5.99%), BBBY (14.24 +5.84%), PRTY (2.65 +5.38%)Information Technology: SNX (145.91 +13.25%), MITK (8.47 +6.01%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: PTLA (14.32 -42.12%), ACB (1.69 -9.41%), FLXN (19.6 -7.24%), CYRX (16.56 -7.17%)Industrials: TGI (24.16 -6.79%)Consumer Discretionary: SIX (35.62 -18.6%), NEW (9.64 -7.07%), ASNA (6.86 -6.67%), GRUB (52.21 -6.32%)Information Technology: XELA (0.36 -9.18%), TWOU (21.53 -7.72%), HIMX (3.8 -7.09%)Financials: TRUP (32.07 -6.99%)Energy: KRP (15.73 -9.44%), NE (1.16 -7.94%), ENLC (5.17 -6.68%), MDR (0.7 -6.51%), GPOR (2.33 -6.25%)Consumer Staples: UNFI (8.84 -6.46%)13:22OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:SUPN Feb 25 calls (volume: 1900, open int: 0, implied vol: ~69%, prev day implied vol: 45%).

The S&P 500 is flat, the Nasdaq Composite is flat, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.Nonfarm payrolls grew by 145,000 in December, which was less than the Briefing.com consensus of 160,000 and less than the readings for November and October. Overall not a bad report, but it may have tempered some growth expectations for the fourth quarter.The market isn't overly reacting to the data, cognizant that the economy is still in good shape, but selling pressure has been kept in check despite calls for a pullback. Buying efforts, however, have shifted to the defensive-oriented real estate (+0.7%), utilities (+0.4%), and health care (+0.3%) sectors.Conversely, the financials sector (-0.4%) is being pressured by some curve-flattening action in the Treasury market while the industrials sector (-0.4%) is being dragged lower by shares of top-weighted Boeing (BA 332.48, -3.86, -1.2%). The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.82%.Boeing shares are back on the retreat after disparaging employee memos about the 737 MAX were released. On a related, Boeing supplier Spirit Aerosystems (SPR 70.85, -1.94, -2.7%) said it will eliminate 2,800 jobs, according to CNBC.In other corporate news, Six Flags (SIX 35.36, -8.41, -19.2%) issued disappointing Q4 guidance, KB Home (KBH 35.96, -1.10, -3.0%) missed revenue estimates, and GrubHub (GRUB 51.80, -3.93, -7.1%) denied prior rumors about a sale. Dermira (DERM 19.25, +0.91, +5.0%) has agreed to be acquired by Eli Lilly (LLY 137.98, +2.06, +1.5%) for $1.1 billion in cash.Reviewing today's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for December:December nonfarm payrolls increased by 145,000 (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), private sector payrolls increased by 139,000 (Briefing.com consensus 157,000), the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%), and average hourly earnings were up 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The key takeaway from the report, which included updates to the seasonal adjustment factors for the labor force series derived from the household survey, was that average hourly earnings and the average workweek were both weaker than expected. That may temper any inflation concerns, but at the same time it is apt to temper consumer spending activity and overall GDP growth expectations for the fourth quarter.Wholesale inventories decreased 0.1% m/m in November (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing 0.1% in October. Wholesale sales surged 1.5% after declining 0.9% in October.The key takeaway from the report is that sales activity was strong in November, but it will still prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.12:38SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Portola Pharma (PTLA) slumps on fourth quarter Andexxa revenue expectations -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersSRNE (4.71 +38.12%): Received a non-binding proposal from a private equity fund offering to acquire a majority or all of co's issued and outstanding shares for up to $7.00/share. The stock closed yesterday at $3.41, meaning that the cap price indicated in the proposal would represent a more than +100% premium to recent levels. The stock last traded above $7.00 in July of 2018. At nine-month highs.RVNC (18.66 +13.18%): Signed a US distribution agreement with TEOXANE SA that makes co the exclusive commercialization partner of TEOXANE's Resilient Hyaluronic Acid technology, including the FDA-approved RHA 2, RHA 3, and RHA 4 products, which include lidocaine. The agreement also includes RHA 1, currently in clinical trials, as well as an ongoing collaboration for other pipeline candidates and a right of first negotiation to access TEOXANE's "novel cosmeceutical line" incorporating RHA technology. The deal and the RHA line give co "access to the fast-growing, billion-dollar U.S. dermal filler market," further positioning co to be the "innovation leader" in the US market for facial injectables. Co, now building out a US commercial organization, targets introduction of TEOXANE RHA fillers in Q2 of 2020. Co has agreed to issue 2.5 mln of its common shares to TEOXANE SA in consideration for the US distribution rights factored into the transaction. ZYXI (10.75 +10.04%): Continued strength following co's Q4 orders update, which was released yesterday morning; orders grew +129% yr/yr in the quarter and +31% sequentially, leading co to raise its outlook for Q4 revs and adj. EBITDA. At one-month highs.Small Cap LosersPTLA (13.98 -43.49%): Announced preliminary Q4 global net revs for Andexxa of $28 mln, including $4 mln from sales of Ondexxya in Europe. Andexxa/Ondexxya had achieved net product revs of $35.7 mln in Q3. Approx. 90 new accounts ordered Andexxa in the US in Q4. Andexxa's US performance was impacted by a $5 mln gross to net adjustment due to a return reserve for short-dated product and flat demand sequentially due to a decrease in utilization, primarily in tier 1 accounts -- co believes that in certain accounts, hospital pharmacies curtailed Andexxa use following drug utilization reviews to manage budgets. Co anticipates "continued strong demand" for Andexxa in 2020 in connection with Factor Xa inhibitor market growth. Oppenheimer cut co's rating to Perform; the firm had expected Q4 Andexxa revs of approx. $39 mln. At all-time lows. MTNB (1.47 -23.04%): Announced a public offering of 32.26 mln shares of its common stock, priced at $1.55/share, for expected gross proceeds of approx. $50.0 mln, which will be put toward purposes including developing co's product candidates, primarily MAT9001. At one-month lows. SPWH (6.63 -16.98%): Lowered its Q4 revenue and earnings guidance below consensus; the quarter's same store sales are expected to decline by 6-7% yr/yr. Results were impacted by "temporary headwinds," driven by competitors discounting firearm and ammunition inventory while exiting those categories as well as difficult yr/yr comparisons connected to certain legislative changes, all of which, exacerbated by the shorter holiday season, hurt traffic and sales more than co had originally projected. Co emphasizes "outsized growth" in its online channel and normalized store traffic trends noted in January, and it believes that competitive changes and industry consolidation will ultimately bode well for co over the long term, despite the short-term headwinds that they have engendered. At two-month lows.12:24SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (123) outpacing new lows (14) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: A, AAPL, AB, ACGL, ACIA, ACM, ADBE, ADSK, ADUS, AGN, AIZ, AKAM, ALL, AMRC, ANSS, APO, APPF, ARD, ATH, ATRC, AXE, AY, B, BBY, BDX, BIO, BKNG, BLDR, BLK, BMY, BRKR, BRO, CACI, CDAY, CNNE, COLL, COUP, CRL, CRM, CROX, CTXS, DERM, DOV, DXCM, EL, EMR, ENTG, EPAM, EQH, FB, FICO, FIS, FISV, FIVN, FRTA, GBT, GOOGL, GPN, GWW, HESM, HII, HRC, INFO, ISRG, JELD, KMI, KO, KRNT, LAMR, LAZ, LDOS, LLY, LMAT, LVS, MA, MASI, MCO, MDT, MIC, MS, MSA, MSFT, MTN, NLOK, NOW, NUVA, NVDA, PAYC, PCTY, PEGA, POWI, PRFT, RMD, RPAY, SAIC, SEDG, SHOP, SNPS, SNX, SPGI, SPNS, SYNH, TDG, TGTX, TJX, TKR, TMO, TREX, TROW, TRU, V, VAR, VEC, WCG, WLTW, WSC, WSM, XENE, XLRN, YNDX, YUMC, ZNGA, ZYMEStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ASIX, CEIX, CNK, CONN, DD, GCI, GOSS, GPOR, HRTG, MAC, PTLA, S, SIX, WETFThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: CABO, CSWI, HURN, SARETFs that traded to 52 week highs: BKF, DIA, EEB, EWC, EWG, GXC, HYG, IGV, IHI, IOO, IWF, IYF, IYH, IYJ, JNK, OEF, PBD, PFF, PHO, PPA, PSK, QQQ, RSX, RTH, SKYY, SOCL, SPY, UYG, VTI, XLI, XLK, XLVETFs that traded to 52 week lows: VXX, VXZ11:54ENDP Endo Intl subsidiaries settle opioid investigation with the State of Oklahoma for $8.75 mln (4.49 +0.08)The Settlement Agreement fully and finally resolves Oklahoma's investigation of the Settling Parties in connection with the opioid abuse crisis in Oklahoma and includes a release of all associated claims by Oklahoma to the Settling Parties and all of their affiliated entities.

Instead, the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed the 29,000 line earlier, continuing its record-setting run.Today's action has been mixed so far, however, partly on a sense that some exhaustion might be setting in after a busy week filled with a lot of headline angst.The latter point notwithstanding, the S&P 500 is up 1.4% for the week, following through on a great fourth quarter rally to end 2019. So, the idea that it is overbought on a short-term basis and due for a pullback continues to hang out there and has participants on close watch for a reversal trade.Today has had a little more guarded feel to it. The information technology sector (+0.2%) has remained an important leadership group, yet some of the more defensive-oriented areas of the market -- real estate (+0.6%), utilities (+0.5%), health care (+0.3%), and consumer staples (+0.1%) -- are stepping up. Also, long-term yields continue to come down.The 10-yr note yield is down four basis points to 1.82% following the December employment report, which was a bit light on job growth, but noticeably light on average hourly earnings growth and the length of the average workweek, and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin announcing new sanctions on Iran.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is flat; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%; and the Russell 2000 is down 0.3%.11:31NLSN Nielsen acquires Precima from Alliance Data Systems (ADS); terms not disclosed (20.04 -0.05)Nielsen Global Connect has completed its acquisition of Precima, an industry-leading, SaaS-based provider of powerful retail and customer data applications and analytics, from Alliance Data Systems. By bringing Precima into its measurement framework, Nielsen Global Connect will achieve a heightened advantage in the loyalty and personalization space, furthering its ability to help brands plan and measure the impact and success of personalized consumer offerings.10:40XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (60.01 -0.14)The major averages started the Friday session on a modestly higher note, but there are a few soft spots in the market. Three cyclical sectors (financials, consumer discretionary, and energy) trade in the red with energy (-0.3%) sitting at the bottom of the leaderboard.The energy sector outperformed earlier this week when concerns about an escalating conflict with Iran led to a spike in the price of oil. However, these concerns have waned in recent days, which has pressured oil, and, in turn, the energy sector. WTI crude is down $0.36, or 0.6%, at $59.20/bbl. The price of oil is now just above its 50-day moving average (58.70) and it is on track to end the week lower by $3.85 or 6.1%. The energy sector, for its part, is now down 0.7% for the week versus a 1.4% gain in the S&P 500.On a side note, Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, are scheduled to hold a press conference at 10:45 ET, when new sanctions against Iran are likely to be announced.Notable movers:Noble Energy (NBL 21.89, -0.56, -2.5%): weakest sector component, falling below its 50-day moving average (21.93) after slipping below its 200-day moving average (22.46) yesterday. Devon Energy (DVN 25.40, -0.45, -1.7%): sliding below its 200-day moving average (25.80). Cabot Oil & Gas (COG 17.15, -0.12, -0.7%): trying to remain above its 50-day moving average (17.10). Valero Energy (VLO 96.58, +1.40, +1.5%): refining name boosted by lower price of crude, rising to its 50-day moving average (96.31). Marathon Petroleum (MPC 60.12, +0.73, +1.2%): refining stock benefiting from lower price of crude. HollyFrontier (HFC 48.45, +0.29, +0.6%): outperforming alongside other refiners.10:23OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:HD Jan 225 calls are seeing interest with 2730 contracts trading vs. open int of 2730, pushing implied vol up around 12 points to ~28%.

The S&P 500 is flat, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the health care (+0.4%) and utilities (+0.4%) sectors outperforming the broader market, while the energy (-0.3%), financials (-0.3%), and consumer discretionary (-0.2%) sectors underperform.U.S. Treasuries have edged higher, pushing yields lower. The 2-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.56%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index is little changed at 97.48. WTI crude is down 0.8% to $59.07/bbl.09:21WIRES On The WiresParsley Energy (PE) has completed its acquisition of Jagged Peak Energy (JAG).

In addition, the Company expects aggregate one-time charges of approximately $10 mln related to the China international agreements and certain unrelated litigation matters in the fourth quarter. For 2020, while the Company does not foresee any significant additional one-time costs or expenses irrespective of the outcome of the Six Flags-branded projects in China, the loss of all the China projects would result in no revenue for that market if Riverside does not cure the default and the Company is not able to engage other partners to complete any of the projects. Separately, the Company's North America parks experienced lower attendance in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus the same period in 2018 due to softer than expected season pass and membership sales, primarily during the holiday sales periods. As a result, the Company expects total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 to be less than prior year by $8-$10 mln which would translate to revenues of $259.5-261.5 mln vs $285.6 mln Capital IQ consensus.07:47PCRX Pacira Pharma Chief Medical Officer Richard Scranton resigned effective January 24, 2020 (42.90 )Dr. Scranton has decided to pursue an opportunity at a private, early-stage biotechnology company.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.8%) also closed at record highs, while the Russell 2000 increased just 0.1%.The ease in tensions with Iran remained conducive for risk sentiment, even as President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau echoed a Newsweek report that Iranian missiles shot down the Boeing (BA 336.34, +4.97, +1.5%) 737-800 jetliner earlier this week. There was no indication the U.S. would reconsider its de-escalation strategy, though.Other positive factors included 1) upbeat holiday sales results, 2) several analyst upgrades, 3) weekly jobless claims returning to lower levels, and 4) China confirming Vice Premier Liu He will visit Washington from Jan. 13-15 to sign the Phase One trade deal.Apple (AAPL 309.63, +6.44, +2.1%) led the information technology sector (+1.1%) higher after Reuters reported that iPhone sales increased 18% yr/yr in China last month.

The persistent bullish momentum in the market exacerbated a fear of missing out on further gains amid a lack of detrimental developments.It's worth noting, though, that Kohl's (KSS 46.15, -3.23, -6.5%) did issue an earnings warning and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY 13.45, -3.20, -19.2%) withdrew its full-year guidance on top of reporting disappointing results.

The Company expects this to be mitigated going forward by its current longer-dated, 36-month product, which began shipping in November 2019. Flat quarter over quarter demand due to a decrease in utilization, primarily in tier 1 accounts. While physician demand remains strong, the Company believes that in certain of these accounts, hospital pharmacies curtailed use of Andexxa following drug utilization reviews in an effort to manage pharmacy budgets.

The findings build on the previously reported three-month interim analysis, after two vaccinations, announced at the company's R&D Day in September 2019. mRNA-1647 is a wholly owned program in Moderna's prophylactic vaccines portfolio.The second interim analysis of the Phase 1 trial reports safety and immunogenicity of the first three dose levels (30, 90 and 180 g) through seven months (one month after the third vaccination) and the highest dose level (300 g) through three months (one month after the second vaccination). Neutralizing antibody titers were assessed in two assays utilizing epithelial cells and fibroblasts, which measure immune response to pentamer and gB antigens, respectively.Safety data were consistent with those reported at the three-month interim analysis. The vaccine was generally well-tolerated and there were no vaccine-related serious adverse events. As reported in the previous interim analysis, one related Grade 4 adverse event (AE) has been observed, which was an isolated lab finding of elevated partial thromboplastin time, which was elevated at baseline (Grade 1) and self-resolved on the next lab test with no associated clinical findings. Additionally, the company announced that the first participant was dosed in the Phase 2 dose-confirmation study.With the seven-month Phase 1 data and the launch of the Phase 2 study, the company is actively preparing for a global randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy of mRNA-1647 against primary CMV infection. Moderna has solicited and received Type C meeting feedback from the FDA on the preliminary design of the pivotal trial, which will evaluate prevention of primary CMV infection in a population that includes women of childbearing age.16:04EPRT Essential Properties Realty Trust has commenced 6.25 mln share common stock offering (25.48 +0.24)16:03RARE Ultragenyx Pharma reports "positive topline cohort 3 results" and "improved cohort 2" results from Phase 1/2 study of DTX301 (53.76 -0.27)Co announces topline positive safety and efficacy data from Cohort 3 and longer-term data from Cohort 2 of the ongoing Phase 1/2 study of DTX301, an investigational adeno-associated virus gene therapy for the treatment of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency.In Cohort 3, there were two confirmed female responders as well a third potential male responder who requires longer-term follow-up to confirm response status.In Cohort 2, one female patient has newly demonstrated a response starting at Week 52 which was confirmed at Week 78.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.5%) hit 29,000 for the first time early in the session before finishing slightly lower with the S&P 500 (-0.3%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.5%), and Russell 2000 (-0.4%).Briefly, nonfarm payrolls grew by 145,000 (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), average hourly earnings increased just 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), and the average workweek was reported at 34.3 hours (Briefing.com consensus 34.4). Overall it wasn't a bad report, but the softer-than-expected numbers likely tempered growth expectations for the fourth quarter.In turn, the momentum that carried the market to record highs gradually transitioned to overdue selling, as cyclical sectors led the decline and selling picked up into the close. The S&P 500 financials (-0.8%), industrials (-0.7%), energy (-0.6%), and consumer discretionary (-0.5%) sectors were today's laggards.The defensive-oriented real estate (+1.0%), utilities (+0.2%), and health care (+0.04%) sector finished higher.Boeing (BA 329.92, -6.42, -1.9%) shares were pressured after disparaging employee memos about the 737 MAX situation were released. On a related, Boeing supplier Spirit Aerosystems (SPR 69.70, -3.09, -4.3%) said it will eliminate 2,800 jobs.Six Flags (SIX 35.96, -7.80, -17.8%), KB Home (KBH 35.86, -1.20, -3.2%), and GrubHub (GRUB 52.38, -3.35, -6.0%) were other negative story stocks after providing disappointing updates. Six Flags issued downside Q4 guidance, KB Home missed revenue estimates, and GrubHub denied reports that it was seeking a sale.In M&A activity, Dermira (DERM 19.16, +0.82, +4.5%) agreed to be acquired by Eli Lilly (LLY 138.00, +2.08, +1.5%) for $18.75 per share or $1.1 billion in cash.U.S. Treasuries ended the session on a higher note as part of a defensive-oriented trade. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.56%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.83%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 97.36. WTI crude fell 0.9%, or $0.55, to $58.99/bbl.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for December:December nonfarm payrolls increased by 145,000 (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), private sector payrolls increased by 139,000 (Briefing.com consensus 157,000), the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%), and average hourly earnings were up 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The key takeaway from the report, which included updates to the seasonal adjustment factors for the labor force series derived from the household survey, was that average hourly earnings and the average workweek were both weaker than expected. That may temper any inflation concerns, but at the same time it is apt to temper consumer spending activity and overall GDP growth expectations for the fourth quarter.Wholesale inventories decreased 0.1% m/m in November (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing 0.1% in October. Wholesale sales surged 1.5% after declining 0.9% in October.The key takeaway from the report is that sales activity was strong in November, but it will still prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +2.3% YTDS&P 500 +1.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +1.0% YTDRussell 2000 -0.7% YTD16:17SNDX Syndax Pharmaceuticals announces strategic outlook for 2020 (8.58 -0.27)The final OS analysis for the pivotal Phase 3 E2112 trial in HR+, HER2- breast cancer is expected 2Q20.

From a channel perspective, retail same store sales increased mid-single digits, marking the 11th consecutive quarter of positive comp store gains while e-commerce sales accelerated to double-digit growth. Our performance included record growth in exclusive brand penetration, which along with our continued focus on full-price selling helped drive healthy merchandise margin expansion during the quarter.."16:10OCX OncoCyte to acquire Insight Genetics for closing consideration of approx. $12 mln (2.65 +0.16)OncoCyte has entered into an agreement to acquire, through a subsidiary, all of the outstanding capital stock of privately-held Insight Genetics, which has a history of impactful discoveries in the areas of lung and breast cancer.

Co's Austrian subsidiary, Laudamotion, continues to underperform as a result of intense price competition with Lufthansa subsidiaries, though it has seen "strong traffic growth and high load factors." Raised its FY PAT guidance range to 950-1,050 mln (prior 800-900 mln); co currently expects to finish close to the mid-point of that new range. MELI (669.28 +3.53%): Continues to make steady gains; the stock has advanced by circa +10% over the last week and trades higher by about +17% month-to-date, at five-month highs.

(Related: RBS, BCS)15:49TALKX Market Briefing: Late-day profit takingMajor indices are succumbing to late-day selling interest. Some rumors have swirled about "heavy jet activity in Iraq," yet the selling is probably (and most likely) tied up in the notion that it is overdue.The selling has been orderly, and steady, since about 2:00 p.m. ET, which is not the typical response from a market that gets spooked by an exogenous event.Most sectors are down, but none are down more than 1.0%, so, again, nothing panicky in the retreat that is also probably some position squaring going into the weekend. Two sectors -- real estate (+1.0%) and utilities (+0.2%) -- are up, as they are rate sensitive and are benefiting from the continued drop in market rates.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 are down 0.3%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000 are down 0.5%15:17BONDX Treasury Market SummarySoft Employment Report Boosts TreasuriesU.S. Treasuries ended the week on a higher note with most tenors enjoying their second consecutive day of gains. Treasury futures faced some pressure during the Asian session, which saw gains in most equity indices, but the dip in Treasury futures was reversed during the European session, which was not as upbeat. Longer tenors began the day just above their flat lines, but they surged to fresh highs after the release of the Employment Situation report for December. The report was not bad, but it was underwhelming, as nonfarm payrolls missed expectations (actual 145,000; Briefing.com consensus 160,000), average hourly earnings growth was shy of estimates (actual 0.1%; Briefing.com consensus 0.3%), and average workweek was unchanged from its downwardly revised November level (actual 34.3; Briefing.com consensus 34.4). As a result, average weekly earnings increased by just over a dollar (or 0.1%) to $971.38. On a yr/yr basis, average weekly earnings are up 2.3%. Longer-dated Treasuries overtook their opening highs in mid-morning trade and remained near their highs into the close while shorter tenors settled closer to the midpoint of today's range. The U.S. Dollar Index approached its 50-day moving average (97.60) in early-morning trade but retreated throughout the day. The Index slipped 0.1% to 97.35, narrowing this week's gain to 0.5%. Yield Check: 2-yr: -1 bp to 1.56% 3-yr: -1 bp to 1.58% 5-yr: -2 bps to 1.64% 10-yr: -3 bps to 1.83% 30-yr: -5 bps to 2.28%News: Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, announced new sanctions against Iran, targeting the country's aluminum, copper, iron, and steel manufacturers.

Taiwan will hold a presidential election tomorrow. The Chinese government is reportedly making a strong effort to prevent incumbent Tsai Ing-wen from winning another term.

November Household Spending rose 2.0% m/m (expected -9.8%; last -11.5%) but was down 2.0% yr/yr (expected 2.5%; last -5.1%). Australia's November Retail Sales rose 0.9% m/m (expected 0.4%; last 0.1%) while December AIG Services Index decreased to 48.7 from 53.7. Bloomberg reported that Italy could hold an early election ahead of a planned referendum on reducing the number of parliamentary seats to 600 from 945. The referendum is expected in May or June. Italy's non-performing loans have been reduced to their lowest level in a decade. France's November Industrial Production rose 0.3% m/m (expected 0.1%; last 0.5%). Italy's November Industrial Production ticked up 0.1% m/m, as expected (last -0.3%) but decreased 0.6% yr/yr, as expected (last -2.4%). Spain's November Industrial Production increased 2.1% yr/yr (expected -0.5%; last -1.3%). Today's Data: December nonfarm payrolls increased by 145,000 (Briefing.com consensus 160,000). Job gains have averaged 184,000 over the last three months. November nonfarm payrolls revised to 256,000 from 266,000. December private sector payrolls increased by 139,000 (Briefing.com consensus 157,000). November private sector payrolls revised to 243,000 from 254,000. December unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%), unchanged from November. Persons unemployed for 27 weeks or more accounted for 20.5% of the unemployed versus 20.8% in November. The U6 unemployment rate, which accounts for unemployed and underemployed workers, was 6.7%, versus 6.9% in November. December average hourly earnings were up 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.3% (from 0.2%) in November. Over the last 12 months, average hourly earnings have risen 2.9%, versus 3.1% for the 12 months ending in November. The average workweek in December was 34.3 hours (Briefing.com consensus 34.4) versus a downwardly revised 34.3 hours (from 34.4) in November. Wholesale inventories decreased 0.1% m/m in November (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing 0.1% in October. Wholesale sales surged 1.5% after declining 0.9% in October. The key takeaway from the report is that sales activity was strong in November, but it will still prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.

In Cohort 3 (n=3), there were two confirmed female responders and a third potential male responder; in Cohort 2, one female patient has newly demonstrated a response starting at Week 52, which was confirmed at Week 78, and two previously disclosed responders in Cohorts 1 and 2 also remain clinically and metabolically stable at 104 and 78 weeks, respectively. Up to six of all nine patients dosed in the study have demonstrated a response. Co expects to enroll the first patient in its fourth cohort, using prophylactic steroids, in the first half of 2020. Co is continuing discussions with the FDA regarding the potential Phase 3 study design. Hearing price target raised at SunTrust. Extends to its highest levels since August. NKTR (26.19 +21.32%): Co and Bristol-Myers (BMY) agreed to a new joint development plan to advance bempegaldesleukin plus Opdivo into multiple new registrational trials; the costs for studies to be expanded or initiated under the agreement will be shared based upon the companies' cost-sharing terms outlined in their original collaboration agreement. The collaboration includes the addition of an "important" Phase 3 study in adjuvant melanoma. At five-month highs. SNX (146.18 +13.46%): Reported upside Q4 EPS and revs (+18.7% yr/yr to $6.58 bln), raised its dividend, and announced plans to separate its businesses into two separate publicly-traded companies: 1) SYNNEX Technology Solutions, with approx. $19 bln in annual revenue, continuing as a "top three Americas and Japan IT distribution company," and 2) technology-infused CX solutions provider Concentrix, with approx. $4.7 bln in annual revs -- the segment saw revs grow +24.7% in Q4 due primarily to the Convergys acquisition. At all-time highs.Mid Cap LosersSIX (35.59 -18.68%): Disclosed that development of Six Flags-branded parks in China has been hampered by "severe challenges" faced due to macroeconomic conditions and China's declining real estate market. Co's partner in China, Riverside, has defaulted on certain payment obligations to co, and while co continues to work with Riverside, co notes that the "eventual outcome" of their agreement "is unknown and could range from the continuation of one or more projects to the termination of all the Six Flags-branded projects in China." For Q4, co will realize no revs from the China international agreements and expects a negative $1 mln rev adjustment related to China, as well as further one-time charges. Separately, co's North America parks also experienced lower attendance yr/yr in Q4 in connection with soft season pass and membership sales; co thus guided for total Q4 revs to fall by $8-10 mln yr/yr. Downgraded at Wells Fargo, Janney, and SunTrust. At multi-year lows. TPTX (57.55 -11.94%): Sinks from yesterday's all-time high on above average volume. In recent press, co announced the departure of its Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Jean Cui, who co-founded the company in 2013; Dr. Cui will depart on January 31 for family reasons, though she will serve as a consultant and support co during a transition period through the end of June. ACB (1.67 -10.47%): Downgraded at BofA Merrill -- to Underperform from Neutral -- and at Piper Sandler, which lowers co's rating to Neutral, anticipating that near-term balance sheet constraints will pressure co's production capacity.

The S&P 500 is flat, the Nasdaq Composite is flat, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.Nonfarm payrolls grew by 145,000 in December, which was less than the Briefing.com consensus of 160,000 and less than the readings for November and October. Overall not a bad report, but it may have tempered some growth expectations for the fourth quarter.The market isn't overly reacting to the data, cognizant that the economy is still in good shape, but selling pressure has been kept in check despite calls for a pullback. Buying efforts, however, have shifted to the defensive-oriented real estate (+0.7%), utilities (+0.4%), and health care (+0.3%) sectors.Conversely, the financials sector (-0.4%) is being pressured by some curve-flattening action in the Treasury market while the industrials sector (-0.4%) is being dragged lower by shares of top-weighted Boeing (BA 332.48, -3.86, -1.2%). The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.82%.Boeing shares are back on the retreat after disparaging employee memos about the 737 MAX were released. On a related, Boeing supplier Spirit Aerosystems (SPR 70.85, -1.94, -2.7%) said it will eliminate 2,800 jobs, according to CNBC.In other corporate news, Six Flags (SIX 35.36, -8.41, -19.2%) issued disappointing Q4 guidance, KB Home (KBH 35.96, -1.10, -3.0%) missed revenue estimates, and GrubHub (GRUB 51.80, -3.93, -7.1%) denied prior rumors about a sale. Dermira (DERM 19.25, +0.91, +5.0%) has agreed to be acquired by Eli Lilly (LLY 137.98, +2.06, +1.5%) for $1.1 billion in cash.Reviewing today's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for December:December nonfarm payrolls increased by 145,000 (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), private sector payrolls increased by 139,000 (Briefing.com consensus 157,000), the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%), and average hourly earnings were up 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The key takeaway from the report, which included updates to the seasonal adjustment factors for the labor force series derived from the household survey, was that average hourly earnings and the average workweek were both weaker than expected. That may temper any inflation concerns, but at the same time it is apt to temper consumer spending activity and overall GDP growth expectations for the fourth quarter.Wholesale inventories decreased 0.1% m/m in November (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing 0.1% in October. Wholesale sales surged 1.5% after declining 0.9% in October.The key takeaway from the report is that sales activity was strong in November, but it will still prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.12:38SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Portola Pharma (PTLA) slumps on fourth quarter Andexxa revenue expectations -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersSRNE (4.71 +38.12%): Received a non-binding proposal from a private equity fund offering to acquire a majority or all of co's issued and outstanding shares for up to $7.00/share. The stock closed yesterday at $3.41, meaning that the cap price indicated in the proposal would represent a more than +100% premium to recent levels. The stock last traded above $7.00 in July of 2018. At nine-month highs.RVNC (18.66 +13.18%): Signed a US distribution agreement with TEOXANE SA that makes co the exclusive commercialization partner of TEOXANE's Resilient Hyaluronic Acid technology, including the FDA-approved RHA 2, RHA 3, and RHA 4 products, which include lidocaine. The agreement also includes RHA 1, currently in clinical trials, as well as an ongoing collaboration for other pipeline candidates and a right of first negotiation to access TEOXANE's "novel cosmeceutical line" incorporating RHA technology. The deal and the RHA line give co "access to the fast-growing, billion-dollar U.S. dermal filler market," further positioning co to be the "innovation leader" in the US market for facial injectables. Co, now building out a US commercial organization, targets introduction of TEOXANE RHA fillers in Q2 of 2020. Co has agreed to issue 2.5 mln of its common shares to TEOXANE SA in consideration for the US distribution rights factored into the transaction. ZYXI (10.75 +10.04%): Continued strength following co's Q4 orders update, which was released yesterday morning; orders grew +129% yr/yr in the quarter and +31% sequentially, leading co to raise its outlook for Q4 revs and adj. EBITDA. At one-month highs.Small Cap LosersPTLA (13.98 -43.49%): Announced preliminary Q4 global net revs for Andexxa of $28 mln, including $4 mln from sales of Ondexxya in Europe. Andexxa/Ondexxya had achieved net product revs of $35.7 mln in Q3. Approx. 90 new accounts ordered Andexxa in the US in Q4. Andexxa's US performance was impacted by a $5 mln gross to net adjustment due to a return reserve for short-dated product and flat demand sequentially due to a decrease in utilization, primarily in tier 1 accounts -- co believes that in certain accounts, hospital pharmacies curtailed Andexxa use following drug utilization reviews to manage budgets. Co anticipates "continued strong demand" for Andexxa in 2020 in connection with Factor Xa inhibitor market growth. Oppenheimer cut co's rating to Perform; the firm had expected Q4 Andexxa revs of approx. $39 mln. At all-time lows. MTNB (1.47 -23.04%): Announced a public offering of 32.26 mln shares of its common stock, priced at $1.55/share, for expected gross proceeds of approx. $50.0 mln, which will be put toward purposes including developing co's product candidates, primarily MAT9001. At one-month lows. SPWH (6.63 -16.98%): Lowered its Q4 revenue and earnings guidance below consensus; the quarter's same store sales are expected to decline by 6-7% yr/yr. Results were impacted by "temporary headwinds," driven by competitors discounting firearm and ammunition inventory while exiting those categories as well as difficult yr/yr comparisons connected to certain legislative changes, all of which, exacerbated by the shorter holiday season, hurt traffic and sales more than co had originally projected. Co emphasizes "outsized growth" in its online channel and normalized store traffic trends noted in January, and it believes that competitive changes and industry consolidation will ultimately bode well for co over the long term, despite the short-term headwinds that they have engendered. At two-month lows.12:24SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (123) outpacing new lows (14) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: A, AAPL, AB, ACGL, ACIA, ACM, ADBE, ADSK, ADUS, AGN, AIZ, AKAM, ALL, AMRC, ANSS, APO, APPF, ARD, ATH, ATRC, AXE, AY, B, BBY, BDX, BIO, BKNG, BLDR, BLK, BMY, BRKR, BRO, CACI, CDAY, CNNE, COLL, COUP, CRL, CRM, CROX, CTXS, DERM, DOV, DXCM, EL, EMR, ENTG, EPAM, EQH, FB, FICO, FIS, FISV, FIVN, FRTA, GBT, GOOGL, GPN, GWW, HESM, HII, HRC, INFO, ISRG, JELD, KMI, KO, KRNT, LAMR, LAZ, LDOS, LLY, LMAT, LVS, MA, MASI, MCO, MDT, MIC, MS, MSA, MSFT, MTN, NLOK, NOW, NUVA, NVDA, PAYC, PCTY, PEGA, POWI, PRFT, RMD, RPAY, SAIC, SEDG, SHOP, SNPS, SNX, SPGI, SPNS, SYNH, TDG, TGTX, TJX, TKR, TMO, TREX, TROW, TRU, V, VAR, VEC, WCG, WLTW, WSC, WSM, XENE, XLRN, YNDX, YUMC, ZNGA, ZYMEStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ASIX, CEIX, CNK, CONN, DD, GCI, GOSS, GPOR, HRTG, MAC, PTLA, S, SIX, WETFThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: CABO, CSWI, HURN, SARETFs that traded to 52 week highs: BKF, DIA, EEB, EWC, EWG, GXC, HYG, IGV, IHI, IOO, IWF, IYF, IYH, IYJ, JNK, OEF, PBD, PFF, PHO, PPA, PSK, QQQ, RSX, RTH, SKYY, SOCL, SPY, UYG, VTI, XLI, XLK, XLVETFs that traded to 52 week lows: VXX, VXZ11:54ENDP Endo Intl subsidiaries settle opioid investigation with the State of Oklahoma for $8.75 mln (4.49 +0.08)The Settlement Agreement fully and finally resolves Oklahoma's investigation of the Settling Parties in connection with the opioid abuse crisis in Oklahoma and includes a release of all associated claims by Oklahoma to the Settling Parties and all of their affiliated entities.

Instead, the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed the 29,000 line earlier, continuing its record-setting run.Today's action has been mixed so far, however, partly on a sense that some exhaustion might be setting in after a busy week filled with a lot of headline angst.The latter point notwithstanding, the S&P 500 is up 1.4% for the week, following through on a great fourth quarter rally to end 2019. So, the idea that it is overbought on a short-term basis and due for a pullback continues to hang out there and has participants on close watch for a reversal trade.Today has had a little more guarded feel to it. The information technology sector (+0.2%) has remained an important leadership group, yet some of the more defensive-oriented areas of the market -- real estate (+0.6%), utilities (+0.5%), health care (+0.3%), and consumer staples (+0.1%) -- are stepping up. Also, long-term yields continue to come down.The 10-yr note yield is down four basis points to 1.82% following the December employment report, which was a bit light on job growth, but noticeably light on average hourly earnings growth and the length of the average workweek, and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin announcing new sanctions on Iran.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is flat; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%; and the Russell 2000 is down 0.3%.11:31NLSN Nielsen acquires Precima from Alliance Data Systems (ADS); terms not disclosed (20.04 -0.05)Nielsen Global Connect has completed its acquisition of Precima, an industry-leading, SaaS-based provider of powerful retail and customer data applications and analytics, from Alliance Data Systems. By bringing Precima into its measurement framework, Nielsen Global Connect will achieve a heightened advantage in the loyalty and personalization space, furthering its ability to help brands plan and measure the impact and success of personalized consumer offerings.10:40XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (60.01 -0.14)The major averages started the Friday session on a modestly higher note, but there are a few soft spots in the market. Three cyclical sectors (financials, consumer discretionary, and energy) trade in the red with energy (-0.3%) sitting at the bottom of the leaderboard.The energy sector outperformed earlier this week when concerns about an escalating conflict with Iran led to a spike in the price of oil. However, these concerns have waned in recent days, which has pressured oil, and, in turn, the energy sector. WTI crude is down $0.36, or 0.6%, at $59.20/bbl. The price of oil is now just above its 50-day moving average (58.70) and it is on track to end the week lower by $3.85 or 6.1%.

In addition, the Company expects aggregate one-time charges of approximately $10 mln related to the China international agreements and certain unrelated litigation matters in the fourth quarter. For 2020, while the Company does not foresee any significant additional one-time costs or expenses irrespective of the outcome of the Six Flags-branded projects in China, the loss of all the China projects would result in no revenue for that market if Riverside does not cure the default and the Company is not able to engage other partners to complete any of the projects. Separately, the Company's North America parks experienced lower attendance in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus the same period in 2018 due to softer than expected season pass and membership sales, primarily during the holiday sales periods. As a result, the Company expects total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 to be less than prior year by $8-$10 mln which would translate to revenues of $259.5-261.5 mln vs $285.6 mln Capital IQ consensus.07:47PCRX Pacira Pharma Chief Medical Officer Richard Scranton resigned effective January 24, 2020 (42.90 )Dr. Scranton has decided to pursue an opportunity at a private, early-stage biotechnology company.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.8%) also closed at record highs, while the Russell 2000 increased just 0.1%.The ease in tensions with Iran remained conducive for risk sentiment, even as President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau echoed a Newsweek report that Iranian missiles shot down the Boeing (BA 336.34, +4.97, +1.5%) 737-800 jetliner earlier this week. There was no indication the U.S. would reconsider its de-escalation strategy, though.Other positive factors included 1) upbeat holiday sales results, 2) several analyst upgrades, 3) weekly jobless claims returning to lower levels, and 4) China confirming Vice Premier Liu He will visit Washington from Jan. 13-15 to sign the Phase One trade deal.Apple (AAPL 309.63, +6.44, +2.1%) led the information technology sector (+1.1%) higher after Reuters reported that iPhone sales increased 18% yr/yr in China last month.

The persistent bullish momentum in the market exacerbated a fear of missing out on further gains amid a lack of detrimental developments.It's worth noting, though, that Kohl's (KSS 46.15, -3.23, -6.5%) did issue an earnings warning and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY 13.45, -3.20, -19.2%) withdrew its full-year guidance on top of reporting disappointing results. The broader market was not surprised or bothered by the news.U.S. Treasuries finished the session slightly higher. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.86%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 97.44.

Continuing claims for the week ending December 28 increased by 75,000 to 1.803 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims have settled back down at lower levels, which reflect ongoing tightness in the labor market.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Employment Situation Report for December and Wholesale Inventories for November on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +2.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +1.5% YTDS&P 500 +1.4% YTDRussell 2000 -0.2% YTD16:21PTLA Portola Pharma plunges to $15.20 in extended hours trading after updating Andexxa guidance (24.74 +0.78)16:20NLOK NortonLifeLock announces special, one-time cash dividend of $12 per share of common stock (shares halted) (26.69 +0.08)The dividend is payable on January 31, 2020 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 23.16:19PTLA Portola Pharma guides Q4 Andexxa global net revenues to approx $28 mln; co to host conf call at 5pm ET (24.74 +0.78)Fourth quarter Andexxa net sales in the U.S. were impacted primarily by two factors: A $5 million gross to net adjustment due to a return reserve for short-dated product. The Company expects this to be mitigated going forward by its current longer-dated, 36-month product, which began shipping in November 2019. Flat quarter over quarter demand due to a decrease in utilization, primarily in tier 1 accounts. While physician demand remains strong, the Company believes that in certain of these accounts, hospital pharmacies curtailed use of Andexxa following drug utilization reviews in an effort to manage pharmacy budgets.

US warned Huawei is a threat to NATOCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 15, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 623 wordsBody"If we don't understand the threat and don't do something, it could ultimately compromise what is the most successful military alliance in history, NATO," Mark Esper said at the security conference in Munich, Germany.In the same vein, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denounced the "Trojan Horse" that he believes is the Chinese company, whose involvement in Western 5G networks will lead to transfer to the "Chinese Communist Party" and the "services" Chinese secrets" the data of all users of it.Huawei has been accused by the Trump administration of spying on behalf of the Chinese government, and so he urged many countries not to use the Chinese giant's equipment for the deployment of the new 5G telephone network.The US government stands firm in its global campaign to prevent the Chinese regime from gaining influence in the world through Huawei. Because for Donald Trump's administration, Huawei is synonymous with China.The biggest fear is the beijing regime's interference with its board, which it makes up. By law, Chinese companies have an obligation to back the Chinese Communist Party with the information it requires. This data, in a technology corporation like Huawei, could include sensitive data from governments and users in the event that it stays with 5G networks.Pompeo explained about the risk of using Huawei technology (02/02/2019) (Infobae)If the permissions were to be achieved to expand its own network across much of the globe, Xi Jinping's regime would have access - if it so wished - to infinite data not only from users, but from businesses, organizations, and even governments.In addition, Huawei is a substantial component of Chinese military apparatus. Its founder, Zhengfei was a member of the People's Liberation Army for decades. In 1978 he joined the Communist Party. In the force, he always worked in the area of innovation and science, his great passion, where he excelled until he completed his cycle. In 1982 he settled in Shenzhen Province, near Asia's largest financial center, Hong Kong. Five years later he would realize his dream.But his love for the Army did not change and the collaboration was permanent between the two actors. According to research by Bloomberg, the agreement involves investigations involving corporation employees and uniforms."Over the past decade Huawei workers have teamed up with members of various bodies of the People's Liberation Army in at least ten research ventures ranging from artificial intelligence to radio communications", notices the medium. "They include a joint effort with the research branch of the Central Military Commission - the supreme body of the armed forces - to extract and classify emotions in online video commentary and an elite technology initiative of the University National Defense to explore ways of collecting and analyzing satellite images and geographic coordinates."The American alert is not just from the Trump Administration. This Friday, US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also called for countries to stay away from the tech giant. "China is looking to export its digital autocracy through its telecoms giant Huawei," Pelosi said during an appearance at the Munich Security Conference, an annual gathering of foreign and security leaders from around the world."Nations cannot cede telecommunications infrastructure to China for financial convenience," he stressed. "Such an ill-conceived concession would only embolden (President) Xi (Jinping), as it undermines democratic values,human rights, economic independence and national security," he added.With information from AFP and EFEMORE ON THIS THEME:Nancy Pelosi urged countries around the world to stay away from Huawei: "China is looking to export its digital autocracy"Load-Date: February 16, 2020End of Document

5 things to know for January 17: Impeachment, Iran, China, food stamps, gun rallyCNN WireJanuary 17, 2020 Friday 11:14 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1182 wordsDateline: (CNN) Body (CNN) --  Google's parent company, Alphabet, passed the $1 trillion mark on Wall Street, joining Apple and Microsoft at the tippy top of the market. (Also, we may not have $1 trillion, but we do have a long weekend. 5 Things is off Monday, but we'll be back in your inbox Tuesday morning!) Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get "5 Things You Need to Know Today" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)1. Impeachment While the Senate officially kicked off the impeachment trial of President Trump (actual arguments start Tuesday), a few huge revelations dropped directly in its lap. First, the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan watchdog, released a report that concluded the Trump administration broke the law when it withheld US security aid to Ukraine last year. There reportedly won't be any criminal penalties from the ruling, but it certainly will add fuel to Democrats' push for fresh evidence at the impeachment trial. Meantime, Ukraine's Interior Ministry announced police there are opening a criminal investigation into what may have been surveillance of former US Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. Text messages from Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas included in that big evidence release this week seem to suggest Yovanovitch was being monitored in Kiev, Ukraine's capital. Yovanovitch has faced repeated public attacks from President Trump and testified publicly last year in the House's impeachment probe.2. Iran Eleven American service members were injured in last week's Iranian missile attack on al-Asad air base in Iraq, a US military official told CNN, despite the Pentagon initially saying there were no casualties. (In case you didn't know, "casualties" doesn't always mean deaths but also military personnel wounded.) Some service members were flown to Germany to be treated and assessed, the US-led coalition fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria said. In other news out of Iran, the country's President, Hassan Rouhani, claimed Iran is enriching more uranium and its nuclear industry is thriving more now than before it signed the multinational nuclear deal in 2015. Rouhani didn't talk specifics, but it's not an easy thing to hear as a trio of remaining powers in the deal -- Germany, France and the UK -- scramble to keep it from unraveling after the recent spate of aggression between Iran and the US. 3. China China released its GDP (gross domestic product) figures for 2019 and ... they're not good. The world's second-largest economy grew last year at its slowest pace in nearly three decades. This wasn't totally unexpected, since China is dealing with rising debt, changing global demand and, of course, a damaging trade war with the US. The US-China trade deal signed this week has raised the country's economic hopes a bit, but there are still other challenges to face. Some Chinese government officials worry that any big rise in unemployment could trigger social unrest or even riots. To keep that from happening, the government has been pumping the economy with stimulus measures like tariff reductions and rate cuts. 4. Food stampsFourteen states, plus New York City and the District of Columbia, are suing the US Department of Agriculture over regulations that will require more food stamp recipients to work in order to receive benefits. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, already requires working-age adults without dependents or disabilities to consistently hold a job to benefit from the program. But states can waive the work requirement in areas where there's high unemployment or few jobs. These new regulations would put an end to that option and could result in 688,000 people losing aid when the policy takes effect in April. The administration argues these regulations keep people from becoming dependent in the long term. Attorneys general in states represented in the suit called the proposed policy "heartless" and "cruel to its core." 5. Virginia gun rally A big gun rights rally is set for Monday in Virginia, and people are bracing for possible problems. Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, declared a temporary state of emergency from this evening until Tuesday. He also banned all firearms and other weapons from Capitol grounds, a move that was upheld by a state judge after event organizers pushed back, saying the ban restricted their rights. Much of the concern here isn't about the guns. It's about the extremists the event is likely to attract. Northam said state intelligence officials identified threats and rhetoric used by violent groups and white nationalists in conversations about the event. In fact, the FBI arrested three alleged white supremacists yesterday for firearms and immigration-related offenses, and found out the trio was planning to attend the rally. BREAKFAST BROWSEThe world's largest Snickers bar is the size of 43,000 regular-sized Snickers bars put together Which raises the age-old question: Would you rather fight one giant Snickers bar or 43,000 regular-sized Snickers bars? Demi Lovato will sing the National Anthem at the Super Bowl May the vibrato be always in your favor, Demi. Some want Big Ben to bong when the UK officially leaves the EU at the end of the month UK PM Boris Johnson even said he wants to start a campaign to "bung a bob for a Big Ben bong." An Irish island is seeking a couple to become its sole caretakers and residents So, you'll either be walking directly into a romance novel or a horror movie. Your Fitbit could help health officials predict flu outbreaks in real time TOTAL RECALLQuiz time! Fans of this rock band are furious that it was not included in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame's list of 2020 inductees. A.

UK will allow Huawei to help build its 5G network despite US pressureCNN WireJanuary 28, 2020 Tuesday 6:47 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1152 wordsDateline: LONDON (CNN Business) BodyLONDON (CNN Business) --  The British government said Tuesday that it will allow China's Huawei to help build the country's next generation of super-fast wireless networks, a decision that could undermine trade and intelligence ties with the United States.The announcement follows months of public debate in the United Kingdom over how to respond to concerns raised by the US government about potential national security risks posed by Huawei components and the threat of Chinese cyber attacks.UK mobile operators will be able to use Huawei equipment in their 5G networks but the company will be excluded from "security critical" core areas, according to a statement from the government. The Trump administration had been pressing for a total ban on Huawei products, alleging that Beijing could use the equipment for snooping. It had warned that US-UK intelligence sharing could be put at risk. Under Chinese law, Chinese companies can be ordered to act under the direction of Beijing. Huawei has consistently denied that it would help the Chinese government to spy. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has come under intense pressure, including from within his party, to agree to the US demands on Huawei. He discussed the issue with President Donald Trump in a phone call on Friday. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted Sunday that Britain faced a "momentous" decision on 5G.Huawei already has a significant presence in UK wireless networks, and has been operating under supervision by government security agencies since 2003. "We've always treated them as a 'high risk vendor' and have worked to limit their use in the UK and put extra mitigations around their equipment and services," Ian Levy, technical director of the National Cyber Security Centre, said in a blog post. In a statement, the company said it was "reassured" that it would be able to continue working with its UK customers on 5G, albeit in a restricted role."We agree a diverse vendor market and fair competition are essential for network reliability and innovation, as well as ensuring consumers have access to the best possible technology," said Victor Zhang, a vice president at Huawei.The issue demonstrates how a conflict between the United States and China over the future of technology is forcing other countries to take sides, especially when it comes to advancements that could affect national security. 5G allows greater and faster data processing, and is seen as an integral component of new interconnected technologies such as automated vehicles and smart appliances. Johnson's government has pledged to bring 5G to the entire country by 2025. Huawei, which is a leader in 5G technology and also one of the world's biggest sellers of smartphones, has seen its business targeted in a concerted campaign by the United States. But its products are often described as superior and cheaper than those sold by European rivals Nokia and Ericsson. Some experts say that Huawei owes part of its success to favorable loans from the Chinese state, an assertion the company disputes.The UK government said "high risk vendors" like Huawei will be excluded from all safety critical infrastructure, security critical "core" functions of the network and sensitive locations such as military sites and nuclear power stations. The company will also be limited to supplying 35% of network equipment and base stations, or carrying 35% of network traffic. "The government is certain that these measures, taken together, will allow us to mitigate the potential risk posed by the supply chain and to combat the range of threats, whether cyber criminals, or state sponsored attacks," the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said in a statement. A spokesperson for telecom company BT, which operates networks in the United Kingdom and several other markets, said the government's decision "is an important clarification for the industry." It said it does not use Huawei equipment in its core networks.Three, another mobile network operator, said it was reviewing the announcement. O2, the UK brand of Spain's Telefonica, said that Huawei products make up less than 1% of the network infrastructure it owns. O2 said it would continued to work with its primary vendors, Nokia and Ericsson. Vodafone said it does not use Huawei equipment in core parts of its network. A spokesperson said the company would study the decision and its potential impact on the rest of its network, and work with authorities if it needs to swap out any parts.Trump administration 'disappointed' Britain, which will leave the European Union on Friday, faced a tough choice on whether to use the company's products. In recent years, it has courted investment from China, but it has a very close relationship with the United States and is banking on a new trade deal with Washington after Brexit. Allowing Huawei into its 5G networks could make such an agreement harder to get.The Trump administration said Tuesday it was "disappointed" with the decision.A senior administration official told CNN Business the United States will continue to press "all countries" to avoid using Huawei wireless gear. "There is no safe option for untrusted vendors to control any part of a 5G network," the official said. "We look forward to working with the UK on a way forward that results in the exclusion of untrusted vendor components from 5G networks."Three members of the US Senate, which plays a role in approving trade deals, made the stakes clear in a letter to Johnson on Monday.Marco Rubio, Tom Cotton and John Cornyn told Johnson that while they did not want to "threaten" a free trade deal or to review how the countries share intelligence, the facts on Huawei "are clear.""We hope that your government will make the right decision and reject Huawei's inclusion in its 5G infrastructure," the Republican senators wrote.The Trump administration did not respond Tuesday when asked whether the UK decision would affect intelligence sharing.US Senator Ben Sasse said in a statement that the Chinese Communist Party had now "infected" an intelligence alliance between the United States and its closest allies. "Here's the sad truth: our special relationship is less special now that the UK has embraced the surveillance state commies at Huawei," Sasse said.But British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, speaking to UK lawmakers, denied the decision would affect the United Kingdom's ability "to share highly sensitive intelligence data over highly secure networks, both within the UK and with our partners."Trump and Johnson spoke by phone after Tuesday's announcement. The White House said in a statement that they "discussed critical regional and bilateral issues, including telecommunications security." --- Brian Fung in Washington contributed to this article.Brian Fung contributed to this report TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

The company has cancelled three sailings through Feb 8, on the high yielding Spectrum of the Seas, currently its only ship homeported in China. Co estimates that this (which included the Chinese new year's cruises) will impact 2020 financial results by approximately $0.10 per share. If the travel restrictions in China continue until the end of February, the company estimates that this would further impact its results by an additional $0.10 per share. There are still too many variables and uncertainties regarding this outbreak to calculate the overall impact on the business. For example, co expects an erosion of consumer confidence in China could have an additional impact on load factor and rate in the region until the market normalizes. If these travel restrictions continue for an extended period of time, they could have a material impact on overall financial performance.

"For affected patients, despite current treatment options, there is an urgent unmet need for more effective and durable therapies that can provide reliable, complete, and persistent remission from the disease beyond general immune suppression and B cell depletion provided by current treatment options. Orphan Drug Designation is an important recognition for investigational therapies for rare diseases and provides us with potentially valuable benefits as we prepare to initiate the DesCAARTes trial to generate and then report acute safety data from the first cohort of patients by the end of 2020."08:01SUMRX Gapping up/down: GE +6%, GLW +5%, DOW +3% and BA +1% after earnings, FB +1.6% after upgrade; XLNX -8%, AMD -5%, EAT -2% and SBUX -1% after earningsGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:MTSI +12.7%, GE +6.2%, MSTR +5.6%, SC +5.5%, DT +5%, GLW +5%, MINI +4.9%, MXIM +4.2%, CMRE +2.8%, DOW +2.6%, WRB +2.1%, SYK +1.8%, AAPL +1.6%, MKSI +1.4%, MPC +1.3%, NDAQ +1.2%, BA +1.2%, SMG +1.1%, SWK +1%, RES +0.9%, NVR +0.7%, NYCB +0.6%, EXTR +0.6%, NVS +0.5%, TXT +0.5%, GD +0.5%Other news:CTSO +13.6% (announces approval and availability of CytoSorb for the removal of ticagrelor during surgery requiring CPB in the EU) LB +11% (CEO Leslie Wexner aims to step aside amid push for strategic alternatives at Victoria's Secret, according to WSJ) ORTX +7.8% (receives orphan drug designation from the FDA for OTL-102) SRNE +6.7% (announces manufacturing collaboration with Celularity to initiate emergency allogeneic NK cell therapy development for coronavirus infection) TEVA +2.9% (FDA approval for AJOVY injection autoinjector device)Analyst comments:FB +1.6% (upgraded to Strong Buy from Outperform at Raymond James)HOG +0.9% (upgraded to Sector Weight from Underweight at KeyBanc Capital Markets)Gapping downIn reaction to disappointing earnings/guidance:XLNX -8.2% (also announces 7% global workforce reduction), CHRW -8.2% (also will acquire Prime Distribution for $225 mln), EBAY -5.2%, AMD -4.7%, ADP -3.4%, ANTM -2.9%, SLAB -2.1%, EAT -2%, TRMK -1.8%, RXN -1.6%, ALK -1.4%, IR -1.3%, MKTX -1.3%, LFUS -1.2%, SBUX -1%, BXP -0.7%, SKY -0.6%, BXP -0.6%, T -0.6%, MCD -0.5%Other news:BHVN -11% (prices underwritten public offering of 4,830,917 of its common shares at a price to the public of $51.75 per share)CERS -3.6% (commences $50 mln public offering)DNLI -3.6% (prices offering of 7,826,087 shares of common stock at $23.00 per share) AMPH -3.4% (FDA issued a "MINOR" Complete Response Letter for its ANDA for Epinephrine Injection)ESTA -3.4% (commences $55 mln stock offering)Analyst comments:GLP -2.1% (downgraded to Underweight from Neutral at JP Morgan)CPRI -2.1% (downgraded to Hold at Needham on low visibility)CAL -1.2% (downgraded to Hold at Needham on low visibility for 2020)NUE -1% (downgraded to Underweight from Neutral at JP Morgan)08:00WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +13.90.

CytoSorb is the only approved therapy to remove ticagrelor in the EU, and it is intended to address a major unmet medical need of potentially life-threatening postoperative bleeding in cardiothoracic surgery patients on the drug.COO Vincent Capponi said, "With the approval of CytoSorb for this indication, it may encourage a preference in the selection of ticagrelor [...] as a first-line therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome, given that roughly 10-15% of these patients, or approximately 110,000-165,000 patients in the U.S., and approximately 70,000-100,000 patients in Europe each year will require emergent or urgent cardiac surgery and will be at high risk of bleeding. Now that we can officially market this application on-label internationally, we plan to drive CytoSorb as standard of care for the removal of ticagrelor during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures in every country we serve [...]. In addition, we are aggressively pursuing an approval path for this application in the United States as well."Ticagrelor is marketed by Astra Zeneca (AZN) and sold under the tradenames Brilique in the EU and Brilinta in the US, with projected worldwide sales of more than $1.5 bln in 2019, with more than half of sales coming from Europe, emerging markets, and rest of world.07:33HES Hess misses by $0.12, beats on revs (62.12 )Reports Q4 (Dec) loss of $0.60 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.12 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.48); revenues rose 0.5% year/year to $1.69 bln vs the $1.54 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.07:31PTC PTC to offer $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2025 and senior notes due 2028 in a private offering that is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (84.41 )PTC expects to use $530 million of the net proceeds of the offering of the notes to redeem all $500 million of its outstanding 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024, including the payment of premium and accrued and unpaid interest thereon, on or about May 15, 2020.

The Nasdaq Composite led the rebound with a 1.4% gain, while the S&P 500 (+1.0%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), and Russell 2000 (+0.9%) followed behind.The day began with modest gains, as the market looked past disappointing earnings reports from 3M (MMM 165.56, -10.07, -5.7%) and Pfizer (PFE 38.14, -2.02, -5.0%), then stocks climbed higher soon after the Conference Board released its Consumer Confidence Index for January. That index rose to 131.6 (Briefing.com consensus 128.0) from 128.2 in December.All 11 S&P 500 sectors contributed to the rally, including five that rose at least 1.0%.

In these studies, either rabbits or mice were inoculated with rabbitpox or ectromelia virus, respectively, to determine the survival benefit of BCV in animals acutely infected with these orthopoxviruses. These animal models are being studied in connection with the FDA Animal Rule to determine the utility of BCV as a medical countermeasure against the human orthopoxvirus disease, smallpox. Animals were randomized to receive either placebo or BCV treatment at varying intervals post infection. In both studies, animals that received BCV, regardless of time post-infection, demonstrated a statistically significant survival advantage relative to placebo.The company looks forward to conducting a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA and to its planned submission of applications for approval of BCV in mid-2020.08:03SILC Silicom Limited beats by $0.08, beats on revs (36.25 )Reports Q4 (Dec) earnings of $0.41 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.08 better than the single analyst estimate of $0.33; revenues fell 44.0% year/year to $25.5 mln vs the $25.14 mln single analyst estimate.

"For affected patients, despite current treatment options, there is an urgent unmet need for more effective and durable therapies that can provide reliable, complete, and persistent remission from the disease beyond general immune suppression and B cell depletion provided by current treatment options. Orphan Drug Designation is an important recognition for investigational therapies for rare diseases and provides us with potentially valuable benefits as we prepare to initiate the DesCAARTes trial to generate and then report acute safety data from the first cohort of patients by the end of 2020."08:01SUMRX Gapping up/down: GE +6%, GLW +5%, DOW +3% and BA +1% after earnings, FB +1.6% after upgrade; XLNX -8%, AMD -5%, EAT -2% and SBUX -1% after earningsGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:MTSI +12.7%, GE +6.2%, MSTR +5.6%, SC +5.5%, DT +5%, GLW +5%, MINI +4.9%, MXIM +4.2%, CMRE +2.8%, DOW +2.6%, WRB +2.1%, SYK +1.8%, AAPL +1.6%, MKSI +1.4%, MPC +1.3%, NDAQ +1.2%, BA +1.2%, SMG +1.1%, SWK +1%, RES +0.9%, NVR +0.7%, NYCB +0.6%, EXTR +0.6%, NVS +0.5%, TXT +0.5%, GD +0.5%Other news:CTSO +13.6% (announces approval and availability of CytoSorb for the removal of ticagrelor during surgery requiring CPB in the EU) LB +11% (CEO Leslie Wexner aims to step aside amid push for strategic alternatives at Victoria's Secret, according to WSJ) ORTX +7.8% (receives orphan drug designation from the FDA for OTL-102) SRNE +6.7% (announces manufacturing collaboration with Celularity to initiate emergency allogeneic NK cell therapy development for coronavirus infection) TEVA +2.9% (FDA approval for AJOVY injection autoinjector device)Analyst comments:FB +1.6% (upgraded to Strong Buy from Outperform at Raymond James)HOG +0.9% (upgraded to Sector Weight from Underweight at KeyBanc Capital Markets)Gapping downIn reaction to disappointing earnings/guidance:XLNX -8.2% (also announces 7% global workforce reduction), CHRW -8.2% (also will acquire Prime Distribution for $225 mln), EBAY -5.2%, AMD -4.7%, ADP -3.4%, ANTM -2.9%, SLAB -2.1%, EAT -2%, TRMK -1.8%, RXN -1.6%, ALK -1.4%, IR -1.3%, MKTX -1.3%, LFUS -1.2%, SBUX -1%, BXP -0.7%, SKY -0.6%, BXP -0.6%, T -0.6%, MCD -0.5%Other news:BHVN -11% (prices underwritten public offering of 4,830,917 of its common shares at a price to the public of $51.75 per share)CERS -3.6% (commences $50 mln public offering)DNLI -3.6% (prices offering of 7,826,087 shares of common stock at $23.00 per share) AMPH -3.4% (FDA issued a "MINOR" Complete Response Letter for its ANDA for Epinephrine Injection)ESTA -3.4% (commences $55 mln stock offering)Analyst comments:GLP -2.1% (downgraded to Underweight from Neutral at JP Morgan)CPRI -2.1% (downgraded to Hold at Needham on low visibility)CAL -1.2% (downgraded to Hold at Needham on low visibility for 2020)NUE -1% (downgraded to Underweight from Neutral at JP Morgan)08:00WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +13.90.

CytoSorb is the only approved therapy to remove ticagrelor in the EU, and it is intended to address a major unmet medical need of potentially life-threatening postoperative bleeding in cardiothoracic surgery patients on the drug.COO Vincent Capponi said, "With the approval of CytoSorb for this indication, it may encourage a preference in the selection of ticagrelor [...] as a first-line therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome, given that roughly 10-15% of these patients, or approximately 110,000-165,000 patients in the U.S., and approximately 70,000-100,000 patients in Europe each year will require emergent or urgent cardiac surgery and will be at high risk of bleeding. Now that we can officially market this application on-label internationally, we plan to drive CytoSorb as standard of care for the removal of ticagrelor during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures in every country we serve [...]. In addition, we are aggressively pursuing an approval path for this application in the United States as well."Ticagrelor is marketed by Astra Zeneca (AZN) and sold under the tradenames Brilique in the EU and Brilinta in the US, with projected worldwide sales of more than $1.5 bln in 2019, with more than half of sales coming from Europe, emerging markets, and rest of world.07:33HES Hess misses by $0.12, beats on revs (62.12 )Reports Q4 (Dec) loss of $0.60 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.12 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.48); revenues rose 0.5% year/year to $1.69 bln vs the $1.54 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.07:31PTC PTC to offer $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2025 and senior notes due 2028 in a private offering that is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (84.41 )PTC expects to use $530 million of the net proceeds of the offering of the notes to redeem all $500 million of its outstanding 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024, including the payment of premium and accrued and unpaid interest thereon, on or about May 15, 2020.

The Nasdaq Composite led the rebound with a 1.4% gain, while the S&P 500 (+1.0%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), and Russell 2000 (+0.9%) followed behind.The day began with modest gains, as the market looked past disappointing earnings reports from 3M (MMM 165.56, -10.07, -5.7%) and Pfizer (PFE 38.14, -2.02, -5.0%), then stocks climbed higher soon after the Conference Board released its Consumer Confidence Index for January. That index rose to 131.6 (Briefing.com consensus 128.0) from 128.2 in December.All 11 S&P 500 sectors contributed to the rally, including five that rose at least 1.0%.

The consumer staples sector, which was among yesterday's best-performing groups, increased just 0.1%.As for the coronavirus, there weren't too many positive developments on the situation, as more cases and deaths were confirmed in China with additional travel restrictions enacted. Investors, however, appeared placated by the fact that it remained under control in the U.S. Any negative impact to earnings growth, thus, might be transitory or minimal.In other earnings news, United Technologies (UTX 152.86, +1.83, +1.2%) and Lockheed Martin (LMT 437.17, +4.79, +1.1%) were some of the more notable companies today that beat top and bottom-line estimates.U.S. Treasuries gave back some of their recent gains, sending yields modestly higher.

Statement of Mark W. Begor, Chief Executive Officer of Equifax, On the U.S. Department of Justice Indictment Alleging China Carried Out 2017 Cyber AttackPR NewswireFebruary 10, 2020 Monday 11:08 AM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 679 wordsDateline: ATLANTA, Feb. 10, 2020 BodyPR NewswireEarlier today, the U.S. Department of Justice announced the indictment of four individuals who are members of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), the armed forces of the People's Republic of China, in connection with the theft of consumer data in 2017. As the indictment states, the cyberattack against Equifax was a state-sponsored operation by a well-funded and sophisticated military arm of the Chinese government.  CEO Mark W. Begor issued the following statement:"We are grateful to the Justice Department and the FBI for their tireless efforts in determining that the military arm of China was responsible for the cyberattack on Equifax in 2017.  It is reassuring that our federal law enforcement agencies treat cybercrime - especially state-sponsored crime - with the seriousness it deserves, and that the Justice Department is committed to pursuing those who target U.S. consumers, businesses and our government. The attack on Equifax was an attack on U.S. consumers as well as the United States.Cybercrime is one of the greatest threats facing our nation today, and it is an ongoing battle that every company will continue to face as attackers grow more sophisticated.  Combating this challenge from well-financed nation-state actors that operate outside the rule of law is increasingly difficult. Fighting this cyberwar will require the type of open cooperation and partnership between government, law enforcement and private business that we have experienced firsthand.  During the past two years Equifax has made significant progress and investments to protect the data entrusted to us, and we are committed to being an industry leader in data security. We are spending an incremental $1.25 billion between 2018 and 2020 on enhanced security and technology as part of our EFX 2020 cloud technology transformation, and we have made tremendous progress toward embedding security into everything we do. Our industry leading cloud technology transformation will make us more secure and enable us to innovate and develop solutions with our differentiated data assets to better serve our customers and consumers. Today's announcement is another positive step forward in helping us turn the page on the cybersecurity attack as we continue our focus on being a leader in data security.These cyber attacks on U.S. companies continue to escalate and are increasingly challenging to defend when well-financed state actors are involved. We recognize that cybersecurity issues impact our entire industry, and we will continue to work openly with our peers, customers and partners, to tackle emerging security challenges, document best practices, provide vital data security thought leadership, and work together to deliver solutions that benefit both the security community and consumers. Working together is the only path to defend against these attacks.We greatly appreciate the work of every FBI investigator and Justice Department prosecutor who participated in this investigation."ABOUT EQUIFAX INC.Equifax is a global data, analytics, and technology company and believes knowledge drives progress.

Amtech Reports First Quarter Fiscal 2020 ResultsPR NewswireFebruary 6, 2020 Thursday 4:10 PM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1826 wordsDateline: TEMPE, Ariz., Feb. 6, 2020 BodyPR NewswireAmtech Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASYS), a manufacturer of capital equipment, including thermal processing and wafer polishing, and related consumables used in fabricating semiconductor devices, such as silicon carbide (SiC) and silicon power chips, electronic assemblies and light-emitting diodes (LEDs), today reported results for its first quarter ended December 31, 2019.First Quarter Fiscal 2020 Financial and Operational Highlights from Continuing Operations:Net revenue of $20.7 million Operating income of $1.6 million Loss from continuing operations, net of tax, of $1.3 million, which includes a pre-tax loss of $2.7 million on the sale of R2D Loss per diluted share from continuing operations of $0.09 Customer orders of $17.6 million Unrestricted cash of $52.7 million Board of Directors approval to renew our share repurchase program of up to $4 million of outstanding common stock, effective for the next 12 monthsMr. Michael Whang, Chief Executive Officer of Amtech, commented, "We continue to prepare for the anticipated strengthening of the semiconductor market in the second half of 2020 and for longer-term organic growth opportunities.  We are investing in new product development, market-advancing technologies, our people, capacity expansion and IT systems.  We also continue to evaluate strategic M&A opportunities to build upon our strengths in the high growth areas in semi and silicon carbide."Mr. Whang continued, "In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we shipped our 300 mm diffusion furnace to a new top-tier, power semiconductor customer.  We have also just announced another order for the 300mm clustered HTR diffusion furnace, further validating our power semiconductor strategy and the market interest in this technology. With this new order we are establishing close relationships with top-tier global power semiconductor customers in North America, Europe and Asia."GAAP Financial ResultsNet revenues increased slightly compared to the preceding quarter and decreased 11% from the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Semiconductor revenue in fiscal Q1 2020 includes the shipment of our 300 mm diffusion furnace to a new top-tier, power semiconductor customer, which contributed to the sequential increase in revenue. Semiconductor revenue decreased compared to the prior year quarter due primarily to lower diffusion furnace shipments. SiC/LED revenue decreased sequentially due primarily to lower machine shipments and was relatively flat compared to the prior year quarter. Gross margin increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to a shift in product mix, while decreasing on a sequential basis primarily due to a higher margin product mix in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Operating margin improved sequentially to 7.9%, primarily due to lower employee-related expenses, partially offset by increased legal fees relating to our solar divestitures. The Company recognized a pre-tax loss from the sale of its automation division, R2D, of $2.8 million. Loss from continuing operations, net of tax, for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was $1.3 million, or 9 cents per share. This compares to income of $0.2 million, or 2 cents per share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and income of $1.0 million, or 7 cents per share, in the preceding quarter.As announced previously, we sold our shares of Tempress to Stichting Continuiteit Tempress, an independent foundation ("the Foundation") formed under Dutch law and created for the sole benefit of the employees, customers and suppliers of Tempress. The Foundation is governed by an independent board with members who have restructuring expertise and have no affiliation with Amtech. Effective as of the closing of the sale of Tempress, Amtech has no financial interest in the future losses or profits of the Foundation and will have no further involvement with and no control over the Foundation, absent the right to receive certain limited information from the Foundation pursuant to covenants set forth in the term loan agreement with the Foundation. To-date, we have received repayment of $0.5 million of the loan balance.OutlookOur outlook reflects the January 27 announcement by China's government to extend the Lunar New Year holiday and keep enterprises closed until February 9, due to the coronavirus outbreak. Our outlook also builds in estimated time we believe will be required for employees and the supply chain to resume normal work and production levels. The outlook does not account for any future measures taken by the Chinese government in response to the health crisis that could further delay businesses from returning to a normal operating schedule, which could cause our results to be materially lower than the outlook. Lastly, the outlook reflects some historical softness that occurs in our fiscal Q2, attributable to seasonality and the Chinese New Year. For the quarter ending March 31, 2020 (our 2nd fiscal quarter), revenues are expected to be in the range of $10 to $14 million. Gross margin for the quarter ending March 31, 2020 is expected to be in the upper 20's to 30% range, with operating margin negative.Additionally, in fiscal Q2, we expect to record a pre-tax loss on deconsolidation of Tempress in the range of $12.5 million to $13 million, of which approximately $7.3 million is the recognition of previously recorded accumulated foreign currency translation losses. The total pre-tax loss is not expected to have a material effect on our cash balances from our continuing operations. We also expect to recognize a significant tax benefit relating to this loss, which can be carried over to future years.The semiconductor equipment industries can be cyclical and inherently impacted by changes in market demand. Additionally, operating results can be significantly impacted, positively or negatively, by the timing of orders, system shipments, and the financial results of semiconductor manufacturers.A portion of Amtech's results are denominated in Renminbis, a Chinese currency.  The outlook provided in this press release is based on an assumed exchange rate between the United States Dollar and the Renminbi.  Changes in the value of the Renminbi in relation to the United States Dollar could cause actual results to differ from expectations.Conference CallAmtech Systems will host a conference call and webcast today at 5:00 p.m. ET to discuss first quarter financial results.  Those in the USA wishing to participate in the live call should dial (844) 868-9329.

US congressmen warned British Parliament of 'catastrophic cost' of allowing Huawei to build 5G network in UKCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 3, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 869 wordsBodyThe warning came in a letter signed by 42 US congressmen. There, the Americans explain to British mPs the "catastrophic cost" of allowing Chinese technology company Huawei to build 5G networks in the UK.The document, sent to the Committee for the Defense of Commons, warns: "Government and private industry in China are working together to expand the influence of the ruling Communist Party. Huawei is no exception to this strategy. Any short-term financial savings from Huawei's participation in the UK's 5G network may evaporate due to long-term costs, surveillance."They added: "The UK's willingness to unlock and open the door to the Chinese government will certainly thwart intelligence-sharing activities between our countries. We strongly urge you to exhaust all opportunities to reject or amend the legislation."The warning carries a lot of weight because the US House of Representatives, of which the signatories are members, will have a key voice in any trade agreement signed with Britain, risking the dispute with Huawei overlooking the conversations.The letter comes as a reaction to Premier Boris Johnson's announcement on January 28, when he reported that it will allow Chinese giant Huawei a "limited" stake in the development of the UK's 5G network.Johnson publicly assured that his decision would not damage the bilateral relationship with Washington, but, in reality, he already knew he would have American resistance.Boris Johnson approved Huawei landing last January 28 (REUTERS) (POOL/)US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo himself had urged in May 2019, on a visit to London, to exclude Huawei because of the risks its network involvement might pose to national security.In addition, on the same day as the announcement, three U.S. senators - Republicans Marco Rubio, Tom Cotton and John Cornyn - wrote to all members of the British National Security Council to urge Huawei to be excluded from the 5G network.However, the British security services have considered the risk to be controllable. As noted in a statement, it was agreed at the Council meeting that Huawei may have "a limited minority presence of no more than 35%, on the periphery of the network", which connects "devices and equipment with mobile phone antennas".The Chinese company will be prohibited from providing equipment to those considered "sensitive parts" of the 5G network, known as the "core". You will also be excluded from participating in "sensitive" geographic areas, such as military bases and nuclear plants in this country, and you will also not be able to participate in security-related networks within "critical" national infrastructures.Despite Britain's premier efforts to justify its decision, the US stands firm in its global campaign to prevent the Chinese regime from gaining influence in the world through Huawei. Because for Donald Trump's administration, Huawei is synonymous with China.The biggest fear is the beijing regime's interference with its board, which it makes up. By law, Chinese companies have an obligation to back the Chinese Communist Party with the information it requires. This data, in a technology corporation such as Huawei, could include sensitive data from governments and users if it stays with the network of5G.In August 2018, Donald Trump banned the use of Huawei equipment in his government. The goal was to take care of national security (Bruno Rattazzi/Infobae)If the permissions were to be achieved to expand its own network across much of the globe, Xi Jinping's regime would have access - if it so wished - to infinite data not only from users, but from businesses, organizations, and even governments.In addition, Huawei is a substantial component of Chinese military apparatus. Its founder, Zhengfei was a member of the People's Liberation Army for decades. In 1978 he joined the Communist Party. In the force, he always worked in the area of innovation and science, his great passion, where he excelled until he completed his cycle. In 1982 he settled in Shenzhen Province, near Asia's largest financial center, Hong Kong. Five years later he would realize his dream.But his love for the Army did not change and the collaboration was permanent between the two actors. According to research by Bloomberg, the agreement involves investigations involving corporation employees and uniforms.Pompeo explained about the risk of using Huawei technology (02/02/2019) (Infobae)"Over the past decade Huawei workers have teamed up with members of various bodies of the People's Liberation Army in at least ten research ventures ranging from artificial intelligence to radio communications", notices the medium. "They include a joint effort with the research branch of the Central Military Commission - the supreme body of the armed forces - to extract and classify emotions in online video commentary and an elite technology initiative of the University National Defense to explore ways of collecting and analyzing satellite images and geographic coordinates."MORE ON THIS THEME:The European Union agreed to restrict access by "high-risk" suppliers to future 5G networksThe US government expressed "disappointment" over UK authorization to Huawei for the development of 5G networkLoad-Date: February 4, 2020End of Document

IN 2019, CASEY PRODUCES RESULTS FOR PA CONSTITUENTSStates News ServiceJanuary 1, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 4082 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Pennsylvania Senator Robert P. Casey:Despite rancor and gridlock, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) is finishing 2019 having successfully fought on behalf of his constituents. Senator Casey's 2019 work includes securing miners' pensions and health care, working to phase out the use of dangerous PFAS chemicals and modernizing the regulation of over-the-counter drugs.Below is a list of Senator Casey's 2019 work on behalf of Pennsylvania constituents.Fighting for Jobs and a Secure RetirementRetirement and Health Security for Pennsylvania's Miners: The Bipartisan American Miners Act, S.2788, which Senator Casey co-authored, was included in the 2019 end-of-year funding agreement. This legislation secures the pensions for 11,550 Pennsylvanians and the healthcare for 2,070 Pennsylvanians and their families. Enactment of this legislation is a culmination of over half a decade of work. This legislation includes provisions to shore up the 1974 Pension Plan, which is headed for insolvency due to coal company bankruptcies and the 2008 financial crisis. It would also ensure that miners, whose healthcare is at risk due to 2018 and 2019 coal company bankruptcies, will not lose their health benefits.Passage of CHARITY Act Provision to Simplify the Foundation Excise Tax: A CHARITY Act, S.1475 (Thune-Casey-Wyden), provision to simplify the excise tax on foundations was included in the 2019 end-of-year funding agreement. The provision simplifies the private foundation excise tax at a single rate of 1.39 percent, at no cost to taxpayers. This simplification eliminates the current, two-tiered system that inhibited foundations from increasing grantmaking during times of need, such as a recession.Central Focus on the Economic Challenges Facing Workers and Families: Senator Casey worked to secure broad Democratic Caucus support to expand the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit. This legislation was included in the House Ways and Means-passed Economic Mobility Act of 2019, H.R.3300. The cost of child care has increased by 25 percent over the past decade, creating significant financial strain for middle-class families. This bill would provide significant support to help all working families cover the cost of childcare.Enhance Taxpayer Access to Information about Tax Scams: Two provisions proposed by Senator Casey were incorporated in HR 3151, the Taxpayer First Act, enacted into law as Public Law 116-25.Section 1406 directs IRS/Treasury to provide useful information to taxpayers about common scams and how to report scams, including information about common tax scams, information on where and how to report tax scams and advice on how taxpayers can protect themselves from identity theft and tax scams.Section 7529 (B)(C): Many Americans don't realize that when tax fraud is discovered these crimes are not automatically reported and referred to law enforcement. Section 7529 (B)(C) includes a directive to IRS and Treasury to provide the information taxpayers need to report tax-related identity theft. Often times these crimes don't go reported because (1) victims assume the IRS is investigating and (2) don't know what information needs to be provided. Because taxpayer information is protected, law enforcement cannot investigate tax fraud without explicit permission from a taxpayer.Promoting Economic Development for Pennsylvania CommunitiesAppalachian Development Highway System: Senator Casey helped to secure $100 million in funding for the Appalachian Development Highway System. This is new money is designated for the completion of the ADHS system. Pennsylvania will likely get a large portion of this, which could, for example, be used to complete Route 219 in Somerset County.Lower Mon Project: Senator Casey advocated for additional funding for the Lower Mon Project in Western Pennsylvania, securing $111 million. The locks and dams on the Monongahela River are old and failure would dramatically impact commerce in Southwestern Pennsylvania. Obtaining this funding is critical upgrading the Western PA inland waterway system.Nuclear Power Plant Closures: The year-end appropriations bill also includes $15 million through the Department of Commerce to support communities dealing with the closure of a nuclear power plant. It is anticipated that this funding will be used to assist the area around Three Mile Island.Fighting to Combat Hunger Among ChildrenIntroduction of Child Nutrition Priorities: Senator Casey introduced several bills aimed at expanding access to healthy food for children in the Senate Agriculture Committee's upcoming Child Nutrition Reauthorization. Senators Casey and Collins introduced their bipartisan Wise Investment in Children (WIC) Act to expand nutrition access for children and mothers. Additionally, Senator Casey has introduced legislation to improve the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) as well as the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) in order to expand access to healthy food.Advocated for the Protection of Hunger Assistance Programs: Senator Casey is fighting to protect critical nutrition assistance programs for our most vulnerable citizens. He continues to stand up against attacks to limit access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). He led a Pennsylvania delegation letter opposing the Administration's proposed rules and continues to speak out against proposals that threaten access to food for children and families and which are counter to the bipartisan agreement of the 2018 Farm Bill to protect SNAP. Senator Casey also led appropriations efforts to support funding for The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), including increased support for TEFAP storage and distribution, as well as for the Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI), a program modeled after Pennsylvania's Fresh Food Financing Initiative.Standing Up For VeteransVeterans Exposed to Toxic Substances: Casey has also played a role in supporting access to benefits for Veterans exposed to toxic substances during military service. This includes co-sponsorship of the Blue Water Navy Veterans Act (S. 1195), which passed in June 2019 and will ensure that Veterans exposed to Agent Orange while stationed on ships during the Vietnam war will receive presumptive coverage for related health effects. Senator Casey also supported passage of the Burn Pits Accountability Act via the NDAA to assess the health impacts of servicemembers' exposure to burn pits and lay the groundwork for presumptive coverage.Exposed the VA for Abruptly Denying Access to Caregiver Program: After the review of data regarding participation in the VA Caregiver program, Senator Casey exposed the Department for abruptly terminating veterans from the program, prompting an internal review by the VA into policies and procedures for determining eligibility into the program.Protecting the EnvironmentSecured Funding for the Chesapeake Bay Watershed: Senator Casey joined the Chesapeake Bay delegation in working to secure increased funding for the Chesapeake Bay Program in the FY 2020 spending agreement. Senator Casey also wrote to USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service requesting that any carryover funding be directed to support additional on-farm conservation in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed. Additionally, Senator Casey continues to build on wins from the 2018 Farm Bill for water quality by ensuring that programs are implemented to benefit the Bay and by providing outreach and information to farmers and partners who can utilize these programs.PFAS Contamination: Senator Casey cosponsored the PFAS Action Act, which would require PFAS to be designated under the Superfund Act. He fought for inclusion of key PFAS provision in the Senate version of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and led a delegation letter demanding interagency coordination between DoD, EPA and CDC to address PFAS contamination in PA. While the final NDAA did not include Superfund or drinking water provisions, it did include directions for the military to phase out the use of PFAS-based firefighting foam beginning in 2024, as well as other provisions related to PFAS remediation and study. Senator Casey led efforts to authorize and secure funding for a CDC study on the effects of PFAS on long-term health, and Pennsylvania's Bucks and Montgomery Counties were included in the multi-site study announced this year. Additionally, Senator Casey also helped secure PFAS remediation and base cleanup in the final FY 2020 appropriations legislation.Preserved Public Lands in Pennsylvania: Senator Casey secured two measures in the Natural Resources Management Act (S.47) to establish the Susquehanna National Heritage Area in Lancaster and York counties and to provide a funding fix to ensure the Rivers of Steel National Heritage Area in Pittsburgh remains able to receive federal funding. Further, provisions of the Oil Region National Heritage Area Reauthorization Act (S. 1265), which Senator Casey introduced, were included in the end of year spending deal, extending authorization through September 30, 2022. The extension of the region's status as a National Heritage Area will ensure that it can continue to benefit from the infusion of Federal, state and tourism dollars that come from a Heritage Area designation.Keeping Communities Safe and Our Judiciary WorkingNine District Court Judges Confirmed in Pennsylvania: Senator Casey has worked with Senator Toomey to confirm nine more Federal judges to the District Courts in PA. They include: Joshua Wolfson (EDPA); J. Nicholas Ranjan (WDPA); John Milton Young (EDPA); Stephanie Haines (WDPA); William Stickman (WDPA); Jennifer Wilson (MDPA); Rob Colville (WDPA); Karen Marston (EDPA); and John Gallagher (EDPA).Community Oriented Policing Services: Senator Casey worked to secure additional funding for the COPS Program, which has been funded at $343 million for FY20, an increase of nearly $40 million more than the FY19 level. It will, among other things, place approximately 1,300 more police officers on the streets of our communities.Combat Online Predators: Senator Casey worked with Senator Toomey to pass the Combat Online Predators Act in the Senate. This bipartisan bill was drafted in response to the traumatic experiences of a Pennsylvania family and will give judges additional tools to ensure that perpetrators who stalk or cyberstalk children are held accountable with serious penalties.Fighting Gun ViolenceFederal Funding into Gun Violence: Senator Casey worked to secure $25 million in funding for gun violence research at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health. This is the first funding to study gun violence that has been allocated in over 20 years.Fighting for Health CareFunding for the National Institutes of Health: The final FY2020 appropriations deal included an additional $2.6 billion for the National Institutes of Health, bringing the total NIH budget for FY 2020 to $41.5 billion. Pennsylvania researchers successfully compete for billions of dollars in NIH grants each year. Senator Casey leads the annual appropriations letter requesting robust funding for the NIH.Health Care Oversight: Senator Casey has led efforts to expose and stop efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act. He released a report in the fall highlighting the ways in which the Trump Administration and Congressional Republicans are working to destroy, dismantle and defund the law. A link to the report can be found here.Improved Health Care Consumer Protections by Cracking Down on False Online Advertisements: Following reports of false and misleading online advertisements for health insurance, Senator Casey conducted an investigation into the types of advertisements displayed to Pennsylvanians seeking to purchase affordable health care online. The investigative report documented the proliferation of advertisements falsely claiming to be HealthCare.gov. As a result of the investigation, Google agreed to remove the false advertisements.Senate Passage of OTC Monograph Reform: In December the Senate passed the Over-the-Counter Monograph Safety, Innovation, and Reform Act, landmark legislation to reform the Food and Drug Administration's authority to regulate non-prescription "over-the-counter" medications. This legislation addresses the outdated and inefficient monograph process, which FDA's own leadership and consumer advocates have highlighted as being in need of improvement.Complex Manual Wheelchairs: Enacted into law S. 1223, the Protecting Beneficiary Access to Complex Rehab Technology Act, which Senator Casey introduced with Senator Portman to exempt complex rehab technology from competitive bidding pricing under Medicare. The provision exempts manual technology from bidding requirements to ensure that people with disabilities can retain access to complex rehab technology and accessories.Children's Hospital Graduate Medical Education (CHGME) Program: Senator Casey, the Senate champion of the Children's Hospital Graduate Medical Education (CHGME) and author of several laws to extend and improve the program, secured additional funding for the program through the appropriations process. Funding for the program was increased by $15 million from $325 to $340 million for FY2020Helping Children Learn More Now So They Can Earn More LaterEarly Childhood Development and Learning: Senator Casey is one of the Senate champions on early childhood education, leading his colleagues every year in seeking appropriations for Head Start and child care. This year, under his leadership, the FY 2020 Labor /HHS appropriations bill secured an increase of $1.1 billion for early learning, including $550 million for Head Start and $550 million for CCDBG. Total for Head Start is $10.61 billion and total for CCDBG is $5.82 billion. Senator Casey also requested and securing increased funding for early learning under the IDEA program.National Center for Information and Technical Support for Postsecondary Students with Disabilities : After the Department of Education ordered it shuttered, Senator Casey secured $500,000 for the Center through the appropriations process. This funding will allow it to serve as a critical resource for postsecondary students with disabilities and the institutions who serve them. The Center provides technical assistance and information to college students, faculty, disability services professionals, and researchers. It also collects information and reports to the Department about the status of college students with disabilities.HBCU Permanent Funding: Congress passed permanent funding for minority-serving institutions, including HBCUs on December 10, 2019. President Trump signed the bill into law on December 19, 2019. Senator Casey worked with Senate Democrats to press Senate Republicans to stop blocking the funding, which had expired in September 2019. Senator Casey asked unanimous consent to take up and pass the FUTURE Act. He also signed letters urging quick passage of funding.Fighting the Administration's Immigration CrueltyCare of Immigrant Children in U.S. Custody: At Senator Casey's request, The Government Accountability Office opened an investigation into the conditions and care of migrants, including children, in CBP custody. The report, expected in the spring of 2020, will analyze, among other things, the adequacy of current health protocols and screenings, as well as provide an analysis of how DHS has used supplemental funding slated for humanitarian purposes.Standing Up for SeniorsGroundbreaking Investigation into Under Performing Nursing Homes: Senator Casey conducted a groundbreaking investigation into underperforming nursing homes, which resulted in the first-ever release of a secret list, maintained by the Federal government, of the 400 of the poorest performing facilities. This list brought greater transparency to families seeking to find a home for a loved one and greater oversight and accountability to these facilities.Spearheaded Efforts to Promote Access to Affordable Prescription Drugs: Senator Casey convened three hearings in the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging and participated in three hearings in the Senate Finance Committee related to the price of prescription drugs. He also introduced and supported legislation to allow Medicare to negotiate the price of prescription drugs, allow for the importation of prescription drugs from countries like Canada, cap out-of-pocket spending on prescription drugs for seniors, facilitate prescription drug price transparency, and enhance affordability for low-income seniors.Secured $300,000 Funding to Support Grandfamilies: The Advisory Council to Support Grandparents Raising Grandchildren, which stems from Senator Casey's 2018 law, will continue to be able to meet in 2020 as a result of $300,000 in new funding which Casey obtained through the appropriations process. The council, which met for the first time in 2019, is tasked with developing a one-stop shop of resources to help grandparents raising grandchildren navigate federal, state and local programs and benefits.Secured $246 million to Fight Senior Hunger: Senator Casey secured $246 million, an increase of $23 million in FY2020 to help fight senior hunger through the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, commonly known as the senior food box. This program provides shelf stable food to at-risk seniors. The new funding comes following the passage of Senator Casey's Nourishing Our Golden Years Act, which modernized the program in 2018.Convened Advocates and Stakeholder in Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C.: In an effort to highlight the voices of Pennsylvanians, Senator Casey convened conferences on issues of importance, including issues facing seniors and miners, in Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C. These conferences fostered dialogue between advocates and elected officials with hundreds in attendance.Leading Efforts for Individuals with DisabilitiesSenate Casey continues to be the Senate's leader on disability rights, leading on a total of 19 disability policy bills covering education, health, employment, financial security, civil rights, disaster preparation and relief, veterans and social security. Eight of the bills had a Republican co-sponsor and 14 of the bills had a House companion.Fighting Back on Untested Social Media Surveillance of People with Disabilities: In response to a letter from Senator Casey and Sen. Brown, the Social Security Administration agreed to stop any plans to implement social media monitoring of people receiving SSI or SSDI.Seeking a Fair Wage for People with Disabilities: Senator Casey introduced legislation to eliminate the use of outdated subminimum wages that pay well below market rates for the labor of people with disabiliities. In furtherance of that effort, he also secured language in the Labor-HHS appropriations bill directing the Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division to collect data on the number of individuals paid subminimum wage, the number of subminimum wage employers, the wages paid to their workers, and to provide a briefing to authorizing and appropriations staff on the findings.Fighting Budget Cuts for Programs Serving People with Disabilities : Senator Casey led the fight in the Senate against proposed Trump Administration cuts to programs serving people with disabilities. Though proposed cuts to the Special Olympics, later rescinded under pressure, were the most visible, they were just one part of a broader assault on disability related funding. Senator Casey wrote to the Trump Administration in April arguing against cuts and instead in favor of a budget that reflect the goals of the ADA: equal opportunity, independent living, full participation and economic self-sufficiency.Securing Additional Funding for Programs to Improve the Lives of People with Disabilities:Community Integration and Competitive Employment : Secured $1 million to create a pilot program to develop models of transition for youth with developmental and intellectual disabilities from schools to community/employment.Independent Living: Secured $2M additional to NIDILRR to develop greater community-based technologies for independent living for people with disabilities and older adults.Postsecondary Education: Secured $11.8M to continue TPSID (Transition and Postsecondary Programs for Students with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities) and to provide for a new five year competition for the programs.Seclusion and Restraints: Secured appropriations language directing the Department of Education Office of Civil Rights to continue collection of information about the use of restraint and seclusion in schools and to improve the accuracy and completeness of the data collected.International Disability Rights : Senator Casey led a bicameral delegation in the introduction of a resolution recognizing International Day of Persons with Disabilities (IDPD) on December 3. The legislation highlights the unique struggles faced by individuals with disabilities and reiterates Congressional support for efforts to promote inclusivity and accessibility for people with disabilities around the world.Protecting the Nation and Promoting American Values AbroadCountering Chinese Government Aggression: Senator Casey has been fighting to counter the Chinese government's intellectual property theft from Pennsylvania's academic research institutions. Through the FY20 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), he secured a provision requiring the Department of Defense to provide training to academic research institutions and personnel on unclassified and sensitive national security information. The amendment will help ensure that universities are better protected against IP theft by malign foreign actors.Seeking responsible policy in the Middle East: Senator Casey continues to support efforts toward a sustainable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He continues to speak out against the Administration's efforts to undermine peace and stability in the Middle East and supports Congressional checks on the President's incendiary actions toward Iran. To that end, Senator Casey co-sponsored provisions to prohibit the United States from expending funds which could lead to war with Iran without express approval from Congress, as required by the Constitution. Senator Casey will continue to fight to assert constitutionally-vested congressional authority over the decision to go to war and will push against reckless and thoughtless decisions that put Americans in harm's way.Senator Casey also jointly introduced a resolution with Sen. Lankford to affirm the work of Operation Good Neighbor, a partnership of the Israeli government, US NGO's, including faith-based organizations, and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to provide humanitarian relief to Syrians. Operation Good Neighbor has helped to provide secure and safe access for NGOs throughout southern Syria. The bicameral, bipartisan resolution affirms the unique collaboration across government agencies, military personnel, and NGO's to ensure safety for refugees across the region.Promoting our Health Security: Senator Casey led the effort in securing $360 million for congressionally directed Department of Defense medical research into critical conditions, including hepatitis, pancreatitis and mitochondrial disease, as well as potentially lifesaving blood technologies.Bipartisan Hearing on China's Economic Influence Campaign: Senators Casey and Cornyn continued their bipartisan work in the Finance Subcommittee on International Trade Customs and Global Competitiveness. As a Subcommittee, the Senators have held a series of hearings focused on the challenges posed by China. Their most recent hearing covered the Chinese Government's Belt and Road Initiative, and its efforts to export their economic and authoritarian system. This work will continue in the new year.Bolstering Pennsylvania's Defense Industrial Base: Senator Casey continues to champion Pennsylvania's contributions to U.S. national security and the American warfighter's capability to effectively combat our enemies abroad. Among other things, he has led efforts to ensure that the Army continues with Chinook helicopter Block II production, built by UAW workers in Philadelphia. He has supported funding to expand the industrial base for the Columbia Class Submarine, to which several PA companies will be contributing.###Load-Date: January 4, 2020End of Document

Stock Market UpdateBriefing.comFebruary 6, 2020 4:22 PMCopyright 2020 Briefing.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 4674 wordsBody-- Stock market extends weekly gains and closes at new record highs-- China said it will cut tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. imports by 50%-- Weekly jobless claims drop below expectations to nine-month lowMajor indices extend weekly gains, close at new highs - Feb 06 - 16:10 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (+0.3%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.7%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.3%) added to their strong weekly gains and closed at fresh record highs on Thursday. The small-cap Russell 2000 (-0.3%) struggled to keep pace and closed lower. The lead news item today was China announcing it will cut tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. imports by 50% on Feb. 14. This should not only help Beijing fulfill its pledges from the Phase One trade deal, but also provide additional economic stimulus. In the U.S, weekly jobless claims falling to their lowest level in nine months was another good sign for the economy.Mega-cap technology stocks did the heavy lifting today, helping the S&P 500 communication services (+1.1%) and information technology (+0.9%) sectors outpace the broader market. The S&P 500, however, drifted with modest gains throughout the session, as investors presumably exercised some caution after a big week with the January employment report still due tomorrow. The energy sector (-1.0%) was today's outright laggard after a rare outperformance yesterday. Earnings were mixed and, keeping with recent trend, reactions were isolated to reporting companies. Twitter (TWTR 38.41, +5.02, +15.0%) and Cardinal Health (CAH 58.26, +5.58, +10.6%) stood out with impressive post-earnings gains, while Becton Dickinson (BDX 252.25, -33.74, -11.8%) and Kellogg (K 63.46, -5.90, -8.5%) were some of the laggards. Separately, Boeing (BA 341.43, +11.88, +3.6%) shares outperformed on reports that the FAA will approve the company's design fixes to the 737 MAX. New software flaws were discovered but the goal to return to service by mid-year remained intact, according to Bloomberg.U.S. Treasuries finished a quiet session little changed. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 1.45%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.64%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 98.49. WTI crude increased 0.2% to $50.97/bbl. Reviewing Thursday's economic data:• Initial claims for the week ending February 1 decreased by 15,000 to 202,000 (Briefing.com consensus 218,000), which is a nine-month low. Continuing claims for the week ending January 25 increased by 48,000 to 1.751 million.The key takeaway from the report is that the low level of initial claims, which are a leading indicator, is indicative of employers maintaining a positive view of the demand outlook.• The BLS reported that nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased 1.4% in the fourth quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.7%). Unit labor costs were also up 1.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that productivity is still running below the long-term average from 1947 to 2019 (2.1%); however, the 1.7% growth in nonfarm business sector productivity in 2019 was the strongest since 2010 and above the 1.3% average for the period 2007-2019.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Employment Situation Report for January, the Wholesale Inventories report for December, and the Consumer Credit report for December on Friday.• Nasdaq Composite +6.7% YTD• S&P 500 +3.6% YTD• Dow Jones Industrial Average +3.0% YTD• Russell 2000 +0.5% YTDNASDAQ - 1459 - 1703 - 2.3 blnNYSE - 1359 - 1502 - 950.0 mlnDJ30 - +88.92 - 29379.68NASDAQ - +63.47 - 9572.17SP500 - +11.09 - 3345.78WTI crude inches higher - Feb 06 - 15:25 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is down from prior highs and is up just 0.2%. One last look at the S&P 500 sectors before the close shows mixed results. Communication services (+1.1%) and information technology (+0.8%) outperform amid strength in the mega-cap technology stocks, while energy (-0.9%) and materials (-0.3%) underperform. WTI crude increased $0.12 (+0.2%) to $50.97/bbl. NASDAQ - 1546 - 1562 - 1.7 blnNYSE - 1399 - 1453 - 513.8 mlnDJ30 - +40.17 - 29330.93NASDAQ - +44.87 - 9553.57SP500 - +6.92 - 3341.61Elliot Management takes stake in Softbank; Starlink may go public - Feb 06 - 14:55 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.4%, and any gain today would be good for a record close. In corporate news, The Wall Street Journal is reporting that activist fund Elliott Management has amassed a nearly $2.5 billion stake in Softbank (SFTBY 23.03, +1.93, +9.2%). Separately, Bloomberg is reporting that Elon Musk's SpaceX is aiming to spin off its Starlink unit into a public company. Looking ahead, T-Mobile US (TMUS 82.56, +0.77, +0.9%), Uber (UBER 37.04, +0.23, +0.6%), and Wynn Resorts (WYNN 133.12, +0.84, +0.6%) are some notable companies that will report earnings after the close.NASDAQ - 1556 - 1547 - 1.6 blnNYSE - 1446 - 1395 - 480.1 mlnDJ30 - +92.72 - 29383.48NASDAQ - +52.47 - 9561.17SP500 - +10.92 - 3345.61Earnings Movers Dominate S&P 500 - Feb 06 - 14:30 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The broader market is settling in into the final few hours of action on Thursday with the Nasdaq Composite clinging to its market-leading gains of 0.54%, while the S&P 500 and DJIA hold gains of 0.30% apiece.S&P 500 constituents Cognizant Tech (CTSH 70.83, +5.86, +9.02%), FMC Corp (FMC 107.51, +5.69, +5.59%), and Take-Two (TTWO 127.07, +6.31, +5.23%) dot the top of the group on Thursday. Last night CTSH and FMC reported earnings, while TTWO will report tonight.Conversely, New Jersey-based med tech company Becton Dickinson (BDX 255.73, -30.26, -10.58%) rounds out the worst performers in the index today after offering unimpressive FY2020 earnings guidance.NASDAQ - 1542 - 1549 - 1.53 blnNYSE - 1395 - 1437 - 450.0 mlnDJ30 - +87.24 - 29378NASDAQ - +51.23 - 9559.93SP500 - +9.85 - 3344.54Gold Higher For Back-To-Back Days - Feb 06 - 14:00 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages jostled around in the last half hour but currently sit little changed since our lat update; the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite still sits in front, up 0.62%.Gold futures settled $7.20 higher (+0.5%) to $1,570/oz as investors are becoming more reassured that the worst is behind us with the coronavirus.The U.S. Dollar Index is up about 0.2% to 98.49.NASDAQ - 1544 - 1542 - 1.43 blnNYSE - 1406 - 1420 - 421.0 mlnDJ30 - +87.75 - 29378.51NASDAQ - +59.17 - 9567.87SP500 - +10.24 - 3344.93Nasdaq Still Atop The Standings - Feb 06 - 13:30 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite still leads, up 0.56%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average share gains of 0.28% apiece.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that Boeing (BA 341.60, +12.05, +3.66%), Microsoft (MSFT 183.12, +3.22), and WaltDisney (DIS 143.27, +1.90) are outperforming. After notching all-time highs yesterday, shares of MSFT ended down about 0.1%; the stock bucks up today, higher by 1.79%. Shares of DIS, too, faded into Wednesday's close; the stock now rebounds 1.34% off yesterday's losses.Conversely, UnitedHealth (UNH 290.69, -5.04, -1.70%) sits at the bottom of the index.The DJIA's all-time highs today took the index up 3.05% YTD, though now stands modestly off those levels.NASDAQ - 1558 - 1501 - 1.33 blnNYSE - 1429 - 1396 - 392.0 mlnDJ30 - +81.95 - 29372.71NASDAQ - +53.66 - 9562.36SP500 - +9.27 - 3343.96Stocks extend gains amid positive trade news, economic data - Feb 06 - 12:55 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The large-cap indices have added to their strong weekly gains today, with the S&P 500 up another 0.4% in midday action. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite outperforms with a 0.7% gain. Positive sentiment has been aided by 1) China saying it will cut tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. imports by half on Feb. 14 and 2) weekly jobless claims dropping to a nine-month low to 202,000 (Briefing.com consensus 218,000). The market is now up around 4% this week in front of the employment report for January tomorrow, which may be keeping gains in check today. The S&P 500 communication services sector (+1.2%) leads the advance amid a rebound in Alphabet (GOOG 1473.73, +25.50, +1.8%) and a 18% earnings-driven gain in Twitter (TWTR 39.57, +6.18, +18.4%). Sector laggards include energy (-0.7%), materials (-0.2%), and financials (-0.2%). Besides Twitter, notable earnings movers include Cardinal Health (CAH 58.79, +6.11, +11.6%) on the upside and Qualcomm (QCOM 89.84, -1.09, -1.2%), Becton Dickinson (BDX 257.86, -18.10, -9.8%), Kellogg (K 64.01, -5.35, -7.7%), and Twilio (TWLO 118.55, -8.61, -6.8%) on the downside. Boeing (BA 341.79, +12.22, +3.7%) shares are seeing positive action after the FAA reportedly said it will likely approve the company's software design fixes to the 737 MAX. Tesla (TSLA 766.30, +30.92, +4.3%) shares, meanwhile, are up 4% after yesterday's 17% pullback. U.S. Treasuries are holding steady despite the positive bias in equities, as are oil prices ($50.85/bbl, +0.10, +0.2%) despite talk of a possible OPEC+ recommendation to cut production by 600,000 barrels per day. The benchmark 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.64%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 98.48. Reviewing today's economic data:• Initial claims for the week ending February 1 decreased by 15,000 to 202,000 (Briefing.com consensus 218,000), which is a nine-month low. Continuing claims for the week ending January 25 increased by 48,000 to 1.751 million.The key takeaway from the report is that the low level of initial claims, which are a leading indicator, is indicative of employers maintaining a positive view of the demand outlook.• The BLS reported that nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased 1.4% in the fourth quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.7%). Unit labor costs were also up 1.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that productivity is still running below the long-term average from 1947 to 2019 (2.1%); however, the 1.7% growth in nonfarm business sector productivity in 2019 was the strongest since 2010 and above the 1.3% average for the period 2007-2019.NASDAQ - 1595 - 1448 - 1.2 blnNYSE - 1461 - 1360 - 362.7 mlnDJ30 - +93.26 - 29384.02NASDAQ - +62.76 - 9571.46SP500 - +12.14 - 3346.83Netflix shares slip; Microsoft gains - Feb 06 - 12:25 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq is up 0.6%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Netflix (NFLX 367.50, -2.17, -0.6%) as the lone stock in the red. Alphabet (GOOG 1474.33, +26.10, +1.8%) is up nicely, followed by modest gains in Amazon (AMZN 2050.48, +10.61, +0.5%), Apple (AAPL 322.74, +1.29, +0.4%), and Facebook (FB 210.64, +0.54, +0.2%). Fellow mega-cap stock Microsoft (MSFT 182.61, +2.71, +1.5%) is providing influential support for the broader market and the information technology sector (+0.6%).NASDAQ - 1573 - 1444 - 1.1 blnNYSE - 1446 - 1348 - 330.6 mlnDJ30 - +89.47 - 29380.23NASDAQ - +52.38 - 9561.08SP500 - +10.13 - 3344.82Investors unimpressed with OPEC recommendation - Feb 06 - 11:55 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, while the S&P MidCap 400 (-0.3%) and Russell 2000 (-0.1%) underperform. There are press reports that the Joint Technical Committee will recommend a 600,000 barrel per day cut to help offset the weakening oil demand from China. Neither Russia nor Saudi Arabia has signed on to any production-cut agreement, though. The fact that oil prices are little changed today is reflecting investors' lack of confidence in OPEC to meaningfully affect prices. Overseas, the major European indices closed on a higher note. Germany's DAX increased 0.7%, UK's FTSE increased 0.3%, and France's CAC increased 0.9%. The Europe Stoxx 600 advanced 0.5%. NASDAQ - 1506 - 1492 - 1.0 blnNYSE - 1388 - 1401 - 302.7 mlnDJ30 - +34.20 - 29324.96NASDAQ - +47.14 - 9555.84SP500 - +7.91 - 3342.6Alphabet rebounds, FAA news lift Boeing - Feb 06 - 11:25 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is now up 0.3%, led higher by the communication services sector (+1.2%) amid a rebound in shares of Alphabet (GOOG 1479.72, +31.49, +2.2%). Boeing (BA 338.26, +8.71, +2.6%) shares are on the rise on reports the FAA said it will likely approve the company's 737 MAX software design changes. Separately, Casper Sleep (CSPR 15.60, +3.59, +29.9%) recently opened for trading at $14.50 after pricing IPO at $12, the low end of the $12-13 range that was expected.NASDAQ - 1573 - 1412 - 885.4 mlnNYSE - 1443 - 1334 - 262.6 mlnDJ30 - +80.21 - 29370.97NASDAQ - +58.46 - 9567.16SP500 - +11.44 - 3346.13China to cut tariffs on some U.S. goods - Feb 06 - 10:55 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to hold onto a modest gain of 0.2%. For the week, the benchmark index is now up 3.6%, so today's sluggish start appears justified. Part of the weekly advance can be attributed to China shoring up confidence. First it injected liquidity into its overnight market, then signaled plans to cut rates to spur lending activity, and now it has indicated it will cut tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. imports by half. In other earnings news, shares of Peloton (PTON 29.93, -3.78, -8.5%) have dropped more than 8% after the company provided downside Q3 revenue guidance. Shares were up more than 30% from its lows late last year. NASDAQ - 1523 - 1426 - 722.3 mlnNYSE - 1310 - 1423 - 218.5 mlnDJ30 - +19.94 - 29310.7NASDAQ - +36.80 - 9545.5SP500 - +5.95 - 3340.64Twitter shares rally, while Tesla shares stabilize - Feb 06 - 10:25 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading just above its flat line in a shaky start to the session.Shares of Twitter (TWTR 38.62, +5.23, +15.7%) are now up more than 15% after the company reported $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time and reported a solid increase in monetizable daily active users. Another earnings winner today is Cardinal Health (CAH 58.81, +6.13, +11.5%) with shares up more than 11% in response. Shares of Tesla (TSLA 750.48, +17.11, +2.4%) have stabilized after yesterday's 17% pullback. NASDAQ - 1494 - 1433 - 558.4 mlnNYSE - 1354 - 1357 - 173.8 mlnDJ30 - -31.83 - 29258.93NASDAQ - +20.16 - 9528.86SP500 - +2.60 - 3337.29Semiconductor stocks pull back after Qualcomm earnings - Feb 06 - 09:55 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 and Russell 2000 are both up 0.1%Semiconductor stocks are pulling back today after Qualcomm (QCOM 87.02, -3.95, -4.3%) issued cautious commentary about the coronavirus impacting demand, which has overshadowed its earnings beat.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.7%) and Russell 2000 (+1.5%) outperformed the benchmark index. The Nasdaq Composite (+0.4%) underperformed in a rare outing, although it still closed at a new high. Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors contributed to the advance, especially the energy sector (+3.8%) after weeks of underperformance and a nice rebound in oil prices ($50.85, +1.24, +2.5%). The real estate sector (-0.1%) was the lone holdout today. The bullish price action was driven mostly by optimism, particularly tied to the prevailing view that the economy is fine and any negative impact resulting from the coronavirus will be minimal. Aiding this sentiment were reports that progress is being made in developing a vaccine and economic data depicting a healthy labor market and services sector. Specifically, the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for January increased to 55.5% (Briefing.com consensus 55.0%) from 54.9% in December. The ADP Employment Change report showed an estimated 291,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in January (Briefing.com consensus 160,000).That's not to say that the coronavirus is behind the market, though.

In these studies, either rabbits or mice were inoculated with rabbitpox or ectromelia virus, respectively, to determine the survival benefit of BCV in animals acutely infected with these orthopoxviruses. These animal models are being studied in connection with the FDA Animal Rule to determine the utility of BCV as a medical countermeasure against the human orthopoxvirus disease, smallpox. Animals were randomized to receive either placebo or BCV treatment at varying intervals post infection. In both studies, animals that received BCV, regardless of time post-infection, demonstrated a statistically significant survival advantage relative to placebo.The company looks forward to conducting a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA and to its planned submission of applications for approval of BCV in mid-2020.08:03SILC Silicom Limited beats by $0.08, beats on revs (36.25 )Reports Q4 (Dec) earnings of $0.41 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.08 better than the single analyst estimate of $0.33; revenues fell 44.0% year/year to $25.5 mln vs the $25.14 mln single analyst estimate.

"For affected patients, despite current treatment options, there is an urgent unmet need for more effective and durable therapies that can provide reliable, complete, and persistent remission from the disease beyond general immune suppression and B cell depletion provided by current treatment options. Orphan Drug Designation is an important recognition for investigational therapies for rare diseases and provides us with potentially valuable benefits as we prepare to initiate the DesCAARTes trial to generate and then report acute safety data from the first cohort of patients by the end of 2020."08:01SUMRX Gapping up/down: GE +6%, GLW +5%, DOW +3% and BA +1% after earnings, FB +1.6% after upgrade; XLNX -8%, AMD -5%, EAT -2% and SBUX -1% after earningsGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:MTSI +12.7%, GE +6.2%, MSTR +5.6%, SC +5.5%, DT +5%, GLW +5%, MINI +4.9%, MXIM +4.2%, CMRE +2.8%, DOW +2.6%, WRB +2.1%, SYK +1.8%, AAPL +1.6%, MKSI +1.4%, MPC +1.3%, NDAQ +1.2%, BA +1.2%, SMG +1.1%, SWK +1%, RES +0.9%, NVR +0.7%, NYCB +0.6%, EXTR +0.6%, NVS +0.5%, TXT +0.5%, GD +0.5%Other news:CTSO +13.6% (announces approval and availability of CytoSorb for the removal of ticagrelor during surgery requiring CPB in the EU) LB +11% (CEO Leslie Wexner aims to step aside amid push for strategic alternatives at Victoria's Secret, according to WSJ) ORTX +7.8% (receives orphan drug designation from the FDA for OTL-102) SRNE +6.7% (announces manufacturing collaboration with Celularity to initiate emergency allogeneic NK cell therapy development for coronavirus infection) TEVA +2.9% (FDA approval for AJOVY injection autoinjector device)Analyst comments:FB +1.6% (upgraded to Strong Buy from Outperform at Raymond James)HOG +0.9% (upgraded to Sector Weight from Underweight at KeyBanc Capital Markets)Gapping downIn reaction to disappointing earnings/guidance:XLNX -8.2% (also announces 7% global workforce reduction), CHRW -8.2% (also will acquire Prime Distribution for $225 mln), EBAY -5.2%, AMD -4.7%, ADP -3.4%, ANTM -2.9%, SLAB -2.1%, EAT -2%, TRMK -1.8%, RXN -1.6%, ALK -1.4%, IR -1.3%, MKTX -1.3%, LFUS -1.2%, SBUX -1%, BXP -0.7%, SKY -0.6%, BXP -0.6%, T -0.6%, MCD -0.5%Other news:BHVN -11% (prices underwritten public offering of 4,830,917 of its common shares at a price to the public of $51.75 per share)CERS -3.6% (commences $50 mln public offering)DNLI -3.6% (prices offering of 7,826,087 shares of common stock at $23.00 per share) AMPH -3.4% (FDA issued a "MINOR" Complete Response Letter for its ANDA for Epinephrine Injection)ESTA -3.4% (commences $55 mln stock offering)Analyst comments:GLP -2.1% (downgraded to Underweight from Neutral at JP Morgan)CPRI -2.1% (downgraded to Hold at Needham on low visibility)CAL -1.2% (downgraded to Hold at Needham on low visibility for 2020)NUE -1% (downgraded to Underweight from Neutral at JP Morgan)08:00WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +13.90.

CytoSorb is the only approved therapy to remove ticagrelor in the EU, and it is intended to address a major unmet medical need of potentially life-threatening postoperative bleeding in cardiothoracic surgery patients on the drug.COO Vincent Capponi said, "With the approval of CytoSorb for this indication, it may encourage a preference in the selection of ticagrelor [...] as a first-line therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome, given that roughly 10-15% of these patients, or approximately 110,000-165,000 patients in the U.S., and approximately 70,000-100,000 patients in Europe each year will require emergent or urgent cardiac surgery and will be at high risk of bleeding. Now that we can officially market this application on-label internationally, we plan to drive CytoSorb as standard of care for the removal of ticagrelor during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures in every country we serve [...]. In addition, we are aggressively pursuing an approval path for this application in the United States as well."Ticagrelor is marketed by Astra Zeneca (AZN) and sold under the tradenames Brilique in the EU and Brilinta in the US, with projected worldwide sales of more than $1.5 bln in 2019, with more than half of sales coming from Europe, emerging markets, and rest of world.07:33HES Hess misses by $0.12, beats on revs (62.12 )Reports Q4 (Dec) loss of $0.60 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.12 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.48); revenues rose 0.5% year/year to $1.69 bln vs the $1.54 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.07:31PTC PTC to offer $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2025 and senior notes due 2028 in a private offering that is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (84.41 )PTC expects to use $530 million of the net proceeds of the offering of the notes to redeem all $500 million of its outstanding 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024, including the payment of premium and accrued and unpaid interest thereon, on or about May 15, 2020.

In these studies, either rabbits or mice were inoculated with rabbitpox or ectromelia virus, respectively, to determine the survival benefit of BCV in animals acutely infected with these orthopoxviruses. These animal models are being studied in connection with the FDA Animal Rule to determine the utility of BCV as a medical countermeasure against the human orthopoxvirus disease, smallpox. Animals were randomized to receive either placebo or BCV treatment at varying intervals post infection. In both studies, animals that received BCV, regardless of time post-infection, demonstrated a statistically significant survival advantage relative to placebo.The company looks forward to conducting a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA and to its planned submission of applications for approval of BCV in mid-2020.08:03SILC Silicom Limited beats by $0.08, beats on revs (36.25 )Reports Q4 (Dec) earnings of $0.41 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.08 better than the single analyst estimate of $0.33; revenues fell 44.0% year/year to $25.5 mln vs the $25.14 mln single analyst estimate.

"For affected patients, despite current treatment options, there is an urgent unmet need for more effective and durable therapies that can provide reliable, complete, and persistent remission from the disease beyond general immune suppression and B cell depletion provided by current treatment options. Orphan Drug Designation is an important recognition for investigational therapies for rare diseases and provides us with potentially valuable benefits as we prepare to initiate the DesCAARTes trial to generate and then report acute safety data from the first cohort of patients by the end of 2020."08:01SUMRX Gapping up/down: GE +6%, GLW +5%, DOW +3% and BA +1% after earnings, FB +1.6% after upgrade; XLNX -8%, AMD -5%, EAT -2% and SBUX -1% after earningsGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:MTSI +12.7%, GE +6.2%, MSTR +5.6%, SC +5.5%, DT +5%, GLW +5%, MINI +4.9%, MXIM +4.2%, CMRE +2.8%, DOW +2.6%, WRB +2.1%, SYK +1.8%, AAPL +1.6%, MKSI +1.4%, MPC +1.3%, NDAQ +1.2%, BA +1.2%, SMG +1.1%, SWK +1%, RES +0.9%, NVR +0.7%, NYCB +0.6%, EXTR +0.6%, NVS +0.5%, TXT +0.5%, GD +0.5%Other news:CTSO +13.6% (announces approval and availability of CytoSorb for the removal of ticagrelor during surgery requiring CPB in the EU) LB +11% (CEO Leslie Wexner aims to step aside amid push for strategic alternatives at Victoria's Secret, according to WSJ) ORTX +7.8% (receives orphan drug designation from the FDA for OTL-102) SRNE +6.7% (announces manufacturing collaboration with Celularity to initiate emergency allogeneic NK cell therapy development for coronavirus infection) TEVA +2.9% (FDA approval for AJOVY injection autoinjector device)Analyst comments:FB +1.6% (upgraded to Strong Buy from Outperform at Raymond James)HOG +0.9% (upgraded to Sector Weight from Underweight at KeyBanc Capital Markets)Gapping downIn reaction to disappointing earnings/guidance:XLNX -8.2% (also announces 7% global workforce reduction), CHRW -8.2% (also will acquire Prime Distribution for $225 mln), EBAY -5.2%, AMD -4.7%, ADP -3.4%, ANTM -2.9%, SLAB -2.1%, EAT -2%, TRMK -1.8%, RXN -1.6%, ALK -1.4%, IR -1.3%, MKTX -1.3%, LFUS -1.2%, SBUX -1%, BXP -0.7%, SKY -0.6%, BXP -0.6%, T -0.6%, MCD -0.5%Other news:BHVN -11% (prices underwritten public offering of 4,830,917 of its common shares at a price to the public of $51.75 per share)CERS -3.6% (commences $50 mln public offering)DNLI -3.6% (prices offering of 7,826,087 shares of common stock at $23.00 per share) AMPH -3.4% (FDA issued a "MINOR" Complete Response Letter for its ANDA for Epinephrine Injection)ESTA -3.4% (commences $55 mln stock offering)Analyst comments:GLP -2.1% (downgraded to Underweight from Neutral at JP Morgan)CPRI -2.1% (downgraded to Hold at Needham on low visibility)CAL -1.2% (downgraded to Hold at Needham on low visibility for 2020)NUE -1% (downgraded to Underweight from Neutral at JP Morgan)08:00WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +13.90.

CytoSorb is the only approved therapy to remove ticagrelor in the EU, and it is intended to address a major unmet medical need of potentially life-threatening postoperative bleeding in cardiothoracic surgery patients on the drug.COO Vincent Capponi said, "With the approval of CytoSorb for this indication, it may encourage a preference in the selection of ticagrelor [...] as a first-line therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome, given that roughly 10-15% of these patients, or approximately 110,000-165,000 patients in the U.S., and approximately 70,000-100,000 patients in Europe each year will require emergent or urgent cardiac surgery and will be at high risk of bleeding. Now that we can officially market this application on-label internationally, we plan to drive CytoSorb as standard of care for the removal of ticagrelor during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures in every country we serve [...]. In addition, we are aggressively pursuing an approval path for this application in the United States as well."Ticagrelor is marketed by Astra Zeneca (AZN) and sold under the tradenames Brilique in the EU and Brilinta in the US, with projected worldwide sales of more than $1.5 bln in 2019, with more than half of sales coming from Europe, emerging markets, and rest of world.07:33HES Hess misses by $0.12, beats on revs (62.12 )Reports Q4 (Dec) loss of $0.60 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.12 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.48); revenues rose 0.5% year/year to $1.69 bln vs the $1.54 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.07:31PTC PTC to offer $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2025 and senior notes due 2028 in a private offering that is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (84.41 )PTC expects to use $530 million of the net proceeds of the offering of the notes to redeem all $500 million of its outstanding 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024, including the payment of premium and accrued and unpaid interest thereon, on or about May 15, 2020.

The Nasdaq Composite led the rebound with a 1.4% gain, while the S&P 500 (+1.0%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), and Russell 2000 (+0.9%) followed behind.The day began with modest gains, as the market looked past disappointing earnings reports from 3M (MMM 165.56, -10.07, -5.7%) and Pfizer (PFE 38.14, -2.02, -5.0%), then stocks climbed higher soon after the Conference Board released its Consumer Confidence Index for January. That index rose to 131.6 (Briefing.com consensus 128.0) from 128.2 in December.All 11 S&P 500 sectors contributed to the rally, including five that rose at least 1.0%. The information technology sector (+1.9%) led the charge on the back of Apple (AAPL 317.69, +8.74, +2.8%), which was set to release its earnings report after the close. Shares got an added lift on reports Apple asked suppliers to raise iPhone production levels by more than 10% over the last year.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which was among yesterday's worst-performing groups, rose 2.4%. The consumer staples sector, which was among yesterday's best-performing groups, increased just 0.1%.As for the coronavirus, there weren't too many positive developments on the situation, as more cases and deaths were confirmed in China with additional travel restrictions enacted. Investors, however, appeared placated by the fact that it remained under control in the U.S. Any negative impact to earnings growth, thus, might be transitory or minimal.In other earnings news, United Technologies (UTX 152.86, +1.83, +1.2%) and Lockheed Martin (LMT 437.17, +4.79, +1.1%) were some of the more notable companies today that beat top and bottom-line estimates.U.S. Treasuries gave back some of their recent gains, sending yields modestly higher.

Study authors concluded that STS101 showed a favorable tolerability profile and resulted in DHE plasma concentrations comparable to IM DHE and exceeding Migranal. Based on data from this study and the results from other clinical studies with DHE (including injected, liquid nasal spray, and orally inhaled DHE dosage forms), the authors posited that STS101 is anticipated to demonstrate rapid pain relief, improvement in functionality, and excellent 2-hour and sustained pain freedom rates.

Rep. Smith: Weekly Capitol ReportTargeted News ServiceJanuary 11, 2020 Saturday 8:12 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 691 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Jason Smith, R-Missouri, issued the following Capitol Report column:Every year, I crisscross Southern Missouri, visiting farms, farmers, and families in each of the 30 counties which make up our congressional district. The places I visit are diverse - some plant row crops, some raise bison, some harvest timber, and some are in agri-tourism, but at each I see the humble, honest Missouri values, the fulfillment that comes from working on one's own land, and the pride that comes from feeding communities or producing the raw materials that fuel local economies.Unfortunately, many on the Left don't see Missouri farmers the same way. Their view of farmers is condescending, derogatory, and simplistic. At a time when rural America faces unprecedented challenges, liberals want to pass new legislation and regulations that would further harm our communities. For instance, just one provision of the proposed 'Green New Deal' would require every farmer to get rid of their equipment that runs on gas or diesel.President Trump promised to make a national priority combatting cheating by the USA's trading partners. And he has. At a time when corporate, coastal elites such as Lebron James and Google want to kowtow to the Chinese regime, President Trump has stood up for America's farmers and made their best interest, and that of the American worker, second to none.Under many past presidents, China has used the U.S.-led international system to prop up their own companies, steal U.S. property, and ignore international trade rules. Instead of letting natural supply and demand determine the value of their currency, the central government rigs the price of the yuan so their companies can buy U.S. crops and livestock at lower prices than they are really worth. That means that Missouri farmers who labor all year to produce high-quality soybeans, cotton, and cattle aren't rewarded appropriately for their work. In addition, they are forced to compete unfairly day in and day out against the Chinese government.President Trump fought back. Using their own dependency on U.S. goods and commodities, he called out the Chinese and targeted their weak points with tariffs and sanctions. His strong leadership, coupled with a booming U.S. economy, forced China to back down and agree to fairness and access for our farmers. On January 15th, President Trump will formally sign this "Phase One" trade agreement with China's lead negotiator at the White House. The deal contains an abundance of substantial wins for our American farmers.For years, the Chinese government used arguments that were not grounded in fact to keep American agricultural products out of their markets. That's why President Trump got China to agree on a new science-based regulatory process that includes faster approval times to ensure American products cannot be forced out indefinitely in the future. Also, China is removing restrictions they had in place on U.S. beef, pork, poultry, rice, and animal feed. They also agreed to increase purchases of U.S. goods and services at over $200 billion over the next two years, including upwards of $50 billion per year on agricultural products alone. Just on the announcement of the trade deal, China dramatically increased its purchase of U.S. soybeans. In November, they purchased 5.4 million tons of soybeans, which was more than double the 2.6 million tons of soybeans China purchased during the previous month.While this is a win for all of America, for Missouri farmers and ranchers, it is a reaffirmation of our central role in the modern American economy. In addition to negotiations with China, President Trump also ripped up NAFTA and replaced it with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement to grow our economy, increase jobs, and benefit our farming families. He is always willing to stand up for our interests and put them front and center as a central concern of his Administration.

It was planning to reopen its retail locations on Feb. 9, but it extended closure indefinitely in early February.As of Feb. 9, only 10% of employees have returned to work at Foxconn factories in Zhengzhou and Shenzhen, where Apple's iPhones are assembled.In Wuhan, there are five major LCD factories whose operations were disrupted when the Chinese government quarantined the city.Resulting production cuts may force Chinese LCD producers to raise prices, according to IHS Markit analyst David Hsieh.Factory closures are affecting more than just the tech industry.While many automakers in China are in the process of reopening factories to resume vehicle production, the extended closure causes them to take more time to reach full capacity than previously planned.Tesla Inc. expects to see a 1-1.5 week delay in reaching full production of its Shanghai-produced Model 3 cars due to the effects of the virus.Hyundai Motor is idling all 7 of its plants in the country, citing a lack of parts from Chinese suppliers.LMC Automotive, a provider of automotive industry forecasting figures, expects auto production in China to decline by 3-5 % this year due to the disease.The economically damaging effects of the virus' spread is reaching beyond the borders of China and into other parts of Asia in addition to the nation's trade partners.With a world gross domestic product share of over 15%, hits to the Chinese economy are sure to be felt globally.According to Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi, a 1% sustained reduction in the real GDP of China can result in a 0.4% drop in world GDP, excluding China.The world is expected to see a drop in GDP by 0.8% for the first quarter of 2020 and .3% for the year.If world economic growth slows to a great extent, unemployment could rise and the risk of a recession could become uncomfortably high, according to Zandi.Major slowdowns in Chinese tourism are impacting other parts of Asia and the United States.The Tourism Authority of Thailand estimated that tourism revenues in the country would fall by about $3 billion due to reduced numbers of Chinese tourists, but is now expecting that figure to rise as tourists from other nations avoid traveling to the Asian region overall.The United States usually hosts about 3 million tourists from China each year who spend an estimated $6,700 per person per trip.A heavy reduction in tourism can account for a drop in first-quarter U.S. GDP of about 0.2% according to Moody's Analytics.The spread of coronavirus has led to a steep drop in demand for oil as production remains halted for Chinese manufacturers, and many flights to the region have been cancelled.As a result, delegations from Russia and member states of The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries held an emergency meeting to discuss cutting oil production in order to avoid oversupplying the market.The groups extended the meeting after failing to come to a decision, though there are talks of cutting oil production by up to 1 million barrels per day until the market stabilizes again.Some OPEC estimates forecast that demand growth could be cut by between 202,000 and 124,000 barrels per day for the rest of the year, according to the Wall Street Journal.While progress has been made between Chinese and American negotiators in abating the trade war that has pressured the economies of both nations, China's preoccupation with the outbreak could provide new challenges for the country.Fulfilling purchase promises made as a part of the recent trade deal made by President Donald Trump's administration could become more difficult for China.Load-Date: February 20, 2020End of Document

Apple faces shareholder vote on its policies to meet China's demandsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 26, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 252 wordsBodyBy Stephen Nellis26 Feb (Reuters) - Apple Inc shareholders will vote Wednesday on a proposal that challenges its decision to remove apps at the request of the Chinese government and asks the iPhone manufacturer to express "publicly its commitment to respect for the freedom of expression as a human right."It is one of six proposals to be put to a vote at Apple's annual shareholder conference at its Cupertino headquarters in California.Shareholders' proposal on free speech focuses on Apple's decision to remove all private virtual apps from its App Store in China in 2017. These programs allowed users to overlook Beijing's so-called "Great Firewall" aimed at restricting access to web content from abroad.Apple opposes the proposal and says it already provides far-reaching information on cases where it withdraws applications at the request of governments in various parts of the world to comply with the laws of the nations where it operates."While we might disagree with certain decisions, we don't think it would be in our users' best interest to simply leave markets, as that would leave consumers with fewer privacy options and protections," Apple said in saying rejection.Consulting firms Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services have recommended voting in favour of the measure, according to reports that Reuters had access to.Apple shareholders have voted against measures related to human rights issues in the past.(Stephen Nellis report in San Francisco.

Students Hold Vigil for Doctor Li Wenliang, Coronavirus WhistleblowerChicago Maroon: University of ChicagoFebruary 25, 2020 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 890 wordsByline: Jeremy LindenfeldBodyOn Wednesday, February 12, a group of Chinese graduate students organized a memorial service to honor the late Li Wenliang, a whistleblower for the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, who died of complications from the virus on February 7. The vigil took place at Bond Chapel, and over 100 people in the University and Hyde Park community attended.Li, an ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital, was among the first to spread the word online of the SARS-like virus spreading in Wuhan before the Chinese government released any information. In early January, he was disciplined at work and by local police for promoting "untrue speech." On February 7, Li died of COVID-19, which he contracted while treating a patient who was later diagnosed as positive. By then, Wuhan had been locked down for two weeks. The death of Li triggered widespread mourning among Chinese communities around the globe.The group of students organized the vigil for Li on February 12, five days after Li's death. In traditional Chinese belief, this day, called "Tou Qi," is thought to be the day when the spirit of the deceased revisits its home."I was inspired to organize this after I saw the news about a vigil at Central Park in New York City," explained a Ph.D. student of comparative literature who wished to remain anonymous. "I was angry and sad when I received the news of doctor Li's death, so I wanted to do something."She posted about the idea of holding a vigil in Chicago on Douban, a Chinese social networking site; the post was soon censored and removed. She then decided to organize a vigil on campus with several other students.During her introduction of Li, another student who hosted the event commended his courage to continue speaking to the public after being forced to sign a police document admitting that he had committed an "illegal act.""Doctor Li told us that a healthy society should not only have one voice," she said.The audience read the poem "The Answer" by Bei Dao together. The poem is well-known among Chinese audiences for its defiant language against the Cultural Revolution's civil restrictions. The group then mourned in silence for one minute.A second-year Chinese student in the Master of Arts Program in the Humanities , told The Maroon that her motivation for coming to the vigil was more than just about memorializing Li's death. "I think there's a responsibility that comes with being a citizen. If you believe that free speech is important, and if you think that the government could have done a better job during this kind of event, you would come to this vigil.""The outbreak of coronavirus will completely change the lives of many, including my own. I don't want to call Li a hero, but he's an ordinary person who we've seen and understood in this revolutionary period. I wanted to remember him in my own way," another MAPH student added.Benjamin Ross, a Ph.D. student in the sociology department, said he was interested in people's response from a social-movement perspective. "It is an interesting historical moment, because Chinese people are very angry," Ross said. "You can see the huge response in social media. Meanwhile, the most fruitful thing that comes out of these activities is that you connect with people who have similar beliefs with you."Participants lighted candles at the vigil.Jeremy Lindenfeld / The Chicago MaroonOne of the organizers was a MAPH graduate who worked part-time on campus and who wished to remain anonymous. Before the vigil, he had assisted with relief efforts for the outbreak by collecting information about nonprofits, civil society, and individual donors."I finished doing that a week ago. This week, I felt helpless as I faced the news about the outbreak until I heard about doctor Li's death," the organizer said. "I felt that it was something I could do. I didn't think too much of it; I think that most people don't think too much when they're responding to huge events or disasters.""We had originally planned to hold the vigil outside Regenstein Library," he added. "We hoped that more people would be able to see and learn about the cause, even if they hadn't kept up with the news." The vigil was moved to Bond Chapel due to snowy weather.The day after the vigil, Li's framed picture, along with candles and flowers, was moved to an area in front of Regenstein Library.Sociology professor Dingxin Zhao used the vigil to reflect on the tense relationship between the Chinese people and their government. In an interview with The Maroon, Zhao said, "Li was not a whistleblower. He only warned his friends in private messages. He became a hero in the minds of people because we, as a society, needed a hero amid our overwhelming fear of the coronavirus."Zhao pointed out that while many other significant people have died of the virus, only the death of Li has generated widespread outrage. "The sad thing that our memorial of Li has reflected is the distrust between the people and the government," he said. "The Chinese people have never fully trusted their government, and this distrust has now reached new heights."Before he left the memorial service, Zhao wrote a note on the message board, which read: "A society that makes an ordinary person a hero must be an unstable society."Participants left notes on the message board.Jeremy Lindenfeld / The Chicago MaroonLoad-Date: February 27, 2020End of Document

Waterford native chronicles coronavirus outbreak from BeijingThe Day (New London, Connecticut)January 29, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 The DayDistributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWSLength: 952 wordsByline: Karen Florin, The Day, New London, Conn.BodyJan. 29--     Jan. 29--Waterford native Julie Wernau, a Wall Street Journal reporter posted in Beijing, traveled from China to France on Tuesday, passing through security after being screened for fever and convincing airport staff to let her keep a half-full bottle of hand sanitizer she had purchased before the coronavirus outbreak.Everyone on the 11-hour flight wore masks, including the crew, Wernau said during a phone interview Wednesday from her hotel room in Paris. Prior to departure, she signed a form indicating she had not been to the province of Hubei or its capital city of Wuhan, where the virus emerged and whose 11 million citizens are on lockdown.While other Americans are evacuating China, where officials on Wednesday reported more than 6,000 cases of the coronavirus and 132 deaths, Wernau said she left Beijing because she had previous plans to speak on a panel in Paris. She plans to return to Beijing on Feb. 5.Wernau, 38, worked for Shore Publishing and The Day from 2003 to 2008. She joined the Wall Street Journal in 2015 following a stint at the Chicago Tribune. She moved to China a year ago to write about one of the largest consumer markets in the world, but most recently has been writing about the coronavirus while experiencing the outbreak firsthand.Her Facebook post on Jan. 25 seemed surreal: "Cases of this mysterious virus doubled overnight," Wernau wrote. "They're locking down cities in China and not letting people out. Building a new hospital in six days. All Chinese New Year plans canceled here in Beijing and the major sites like attractions at the Great Wall and Ming Tombs are shuttered."Schools closed indefinitely. The government encouraged people to stay home and avoid human contact, but Wernau, who lives within walking distance of her office, said she's purposefully gone to places like the airport and subway to report on the outbreak."I've been to places people are trying to avoid, because I'm a reporter," she said.Before getting on the Beijing subway, Wernau said passengers are checked for fever by a man in a white protective suit with a thermometer that doesn't touch the forehead but comes close enough to read the temperature."There's a lot of temperature checking going on, which is quite odd because this disease doesn't necessarily come with a fever," she said.Symptoms of coronavirus include coughing, fever and difficulty breathing, according to news reports.The outbreak occurred at the worst possible time, Wernau said, since millions of Chinese are traveling within the country and abroad for the Lunar New Year, which also is known as Spring Festival. Wernau likened it to the holiday season in the United States and said huge banquets are common."There's a couple of things that have made the spread of the coronavirus more rampant that are cultural," Wernau said. "One of those is that, when you eat a meal in China, it's generally shared. You get a big group together, you order tons of dishes and everyone digs into the middle of the table with chopsticks."After the SARS outbreak in 2003, people started using "serving chopsticks" but SARS is a distant memory, and Wernau said it would be strange to say, "Hey, can you not put your chopsticks in my food?"Conversely, people in China are accustomed to wearing face masks to protect one another and themselves."One of the things I really like about China is there's definitely a sense that you have a responsibility to protect one another," Wernau said. "If I have a cold in the office in China, I wear a mask. I don't come in and sneeze like we do in the U.S."In Paris, where Wernau said there had been just four cases of coronavirus as of Wednesday, she said Chinese tourists who would normally be shopping for luxury goods are swarming pharmacies to buy masks, hand sanitizer and other health products, such as Vitamin C. Some are trying to delay their return flights to China.News of the coronavirus outbreak began around Dec. 31, and in Beijing people usually cite Jan. 16 as the day when, all of a sudden, the number of cases doubled overnight. People weren't panicked yet, but they were paying attention and began changing their plans.Facial masks are common in Beijing, where air pollution is a problem, and Wernau checks her air quality app the way most people look at the weather. "If it's a bad day, there's this weird yellow haze to everything, and you start to feel it in the back of your throat," she said.But the air quality had improved recently, and before the outbreak Wernau said she had gotten used to not wearing a mask as much.She wore a black mask last week at an "intense" news conference by Chinese officials, including virologist Gao Fu from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, who discovered the coronavirus. She said at one point, the journalists rushed the speaker."He was telling people, 'Back away. Don't crowd me. We have a virus here,'" Wernau said. "It was one of those moments where you were like, 'I'm in the middle of something big.'"She said Gao said some alarming things about how the virus, thought to have first been transmitted from animal to human, has grown more contagious. But he also said there's now a test for the virus and scientists are working on a vaccine and sharing information with the world."The Chinese government has gotten a certain amount of praise for the way they handled it," Wernau said. "There's been a lot more transparency and they have moved really quickly. Some would say it's overkill to shut down cities, but it's China and they can do that."k.florin@theday.com___ (c)2020 The Day (New London, Conn.)

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite outperforms with a 0.7% gain.Positive sentiment has been aided by 1) China saying it will cut tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. imports by half on Feb. 14 and 2) weekly jobless claims dropping to a nine-month low to 202,000 Briefing.com consensus 218,000). The market is now up around 4% this week in front of the employment report for January tomorrow, which may be keeping gains in check today.The S&P 500 communication services sector (+1.2%) leads the advance amid a rebound in Alphabet (GOOG 1473.73, +25.50, +1.8%) and a 18% earnings-driven gain in Twitter (TWTR 39.57, +6.18, +18.4%). Sector laggards include energy (-0.7%), materials (-0.2%), and financials (-0.2%).Besides Twitter, notable earnings movers include Cardinal Health (CAH 58.79, +6.11, +11.6%) on the upside and Qualcomm (QCOM 89.84, -1.09, -1.2%), Becton Dickinson (BDX 257.86, -18.10, -9.8%), Kellogg (K 64.01, -5.35, -7.7%), and Twilio (TWLO 118.55, -8.61, -6.8%) on the downside.Boeing (BA 341.79, +12.22, +3.7%) shares are seeing positive action after the FAA reportedly said it will likely approve the company's software design fixes to the 737 MAX. Tesla (TSLA 766.30, +30.92, +4.3%) shares, meanwhile, are 4% after yesterday's 17% pullback.U.S. Treasuries are holding steady despite the positive bias in equities, as are oil prices ($50.85/bbl, +0.10, +0.2%) despite talk of a possible OPEC+ recommendation to cut production by 600,000 barrels per day. The benchmark 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.64%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 98.48.Reviewing today's economic data:Initial claims for the week ending February 1 decreased by 15,000 to 202,000 (Briefing.com consensus 218,000), which is a nine-month low. Continuing claims for the week ending January 25 increased by 48,000 to 1.751 million.The key takeaway from the report is that the low level of initial claims, which are a leading indicator, is indicative of employers maintaining a positive view of the demand outlook.The BLS reported that nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased 1.4% in the fourth quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.7%). Unit labor costs were also up 1.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that productivity is still running below the long-term average from 1947 to 2019 (2.1%); however, the 1.7% growth in nonfarm business sector productivity in 2019 was the strongest since 2010 and above the 1.3% average for the period 2007-2019. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1461/1360. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1595/1448.12:25 ETDow +89.47 at 29380.23, Nasdaq +52.38 at 9561.08, S&P +10.13 at 3344.82[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq is up 0.6%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Netflix (NFLX 367.50, -2.17, -0.6%) as the lone stock in the red. Alphabet (GOOG 1474.33, +26.10, +1.8%) is up nicely, followed by modest gains in Amazon (AMZN 2050.48, +10.61, +0.5%), Apple (AAPL 322.74, +1.29, +0.4%), and Facebook (FB 210.64, +0.54, +0.2%).Fellow mega-cap stock Microsoft (MSFT 182.61, +2.71, +1.5%) is providing influential support for the broader market and the information technology sector (+0.6%).11:55 ETDow +34.20 at 29324.96, Nasdaq +47.14 at 9555.84, S&P +7.91 at 3342.6[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, while the S&P MidCap 400 (-0.3%) and Russell 2000 (-0.1%) underperform.There are press reports that the Joint Technical Committee will recommend a 600,000 barrel per day cut to help offset the weakening oil demand from China. Neither Russia nor Saudi Arabia has signed on to any production-cut agreement, though.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.7%) and Russell 2000 (+1.5%) outperformed the benchmark index. The Nasdaq Composite (+0.4%) underperformed in a rare outing, although it still closed at a new high.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors contributed to the advance, especially the energy sector (+3.8%) after weeks of underperformance and a nice rebound in oil prices ($50.85, +1.24, +2.5%). The real estate sector (-0.1%) was the lone holdout today.The bullish price action was driven mostly by optimism, particularly tied to the prevailing view that the economy is fine and any negative impact resulting from the coronavirus will be minimal. Aiding this sentiment were reports that progress is being made in developing a vaccine and economic data depicting a healthy labor market and services sector.Specifically, the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for January increased to 55.5% (Briefing.com consensus 55.0%) from 54.9% in December. The ADP Employment Change report showed an estimated 291,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in January (Briefing.com consensus 160,000).That's not to say that the coronavirus is behind the market, though. For instance, Walt Disney (DIS 141.37, -3.36, -2.3%), Nike (NKE 100.54, -0.84, -0.8%), and Capri Holdings (CPRI 33.31, +2.55, +8.3%) formally stated that the coronavirus will have a negative impact on financial results.

The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.45%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.65%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.28.Reviewing Wednesday's economic data:The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for January registered a 55.5% reading (Briefing.com consensus 55.0%) versus a downwardly revised 54.9% (from 55.0%) in December. The January reading eclipsed the December reading as the fastest pace of expansion since August 2019.The key takeaway from the report is that it marked the second straight month of accelerating activity in the services sector, which is an encouraging sign that the U.S. economic expansion is poised to continue.The Trade Balance report for December showed a widening in the deficit to $48.9 billion (Briefing.com consensus -$48.2 billion) from a downwardly revised -$43.7 billion (from -$43.1 billion). Exports were $1.6 billion more than November exports while imports were $6.8 billion more than November imports.The key takeaway from the report is that the goods deficit with China decreased by $73.9 billion in 2019 to $345.6 billion, as tariff measures contributed to a $13.5 billion decrease in exports and an $87.4 billion decrease in imports.The ADP Employment Change report showed an estimated 291,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in January (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), with healthy gains across small, midsized, and large employers. In turn, there was a nice pickup in jobs added on the goods-producing side of the economy (+54,000).The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index rose 5.0% following a 7.2% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report and preliminary Q4 readings for Productivity and Unit Labor Costs on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +6.0% YTDS&P 500 +3.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +2.6% YTDRussell 2000 +0.8% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2203/668. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2207/981.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: February 6, 2020End of Document

After notching all-time highs yesterday, shares of MSFT ended down about 0.1%; the stock bucks up today, higher by 1.79%.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite outperforms with a 0.7% gain.Positive sentiment has been aided by 1) China saying it will cut tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. imports by half on Feb. 14 and 2) weekly jobless claims dropping to a nine-month low to 202,000 (Briefing.com consensus 218,000). The market is now up around 4% this week in front of the employment report for January tomorrow, which may be keeping gains in check today.The S&P 500 communication services sector (+1.2%) leads the advance amid a rebound in Alphabet (GOOG 1473.73, +25.50, +1.8%) and a 18% earnings-driven gain in Twitter (TWTR 39.57, +6.18, +18.4%). Sector laggards include energy (-0.7%), materials (-0.2%), and financials (-0.2%).Besides Twitter, notable earnings movers include Cardinal Health (CAH 58.79, +6.11, +11.6%) on the upside and Qualcomm (QCOM 89.84, -1.09, -1.2%), Becton Dickinson (BDX 257.86, -18.10, -9.8%), Kellogg (K 64.01, -5.35, -7.7%), and Twilio (TWLO 118.55, -8.61, -6.8%) on the downside.Boeing (BA 341.79, +12.22, +3.7%) shares are seeing positive action after the FAA reportedly said it will likely approve the company's software design fixes to the 737 MAX.

The benchmark 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.64%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 98.48.Reviewing today's economic data:Initial claims for the week ending February 1 decreased by 15,000 to 202,000 (Briefing.com consensus 218,000), which is a nine-month low. Continuing claims for the week ending January 25 increased by 48,000 to 1.751 million.The key takeaway from the report is that the low level of initial claims, which are a leading indicator, is indicative of employers maintaining a positive view of the demand outlook.The BLS reported that nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased 1.4% in the fourth quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.7%). Unit labor costs were also up 1.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that productivity is still running below the long-term average from 1947 to 2019 (2.1%); however, the 1.7% growth in nonfarm business sector productivity in 2019 was the strongest since 2010 and above the 1.3% average for the period 2007-2019. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1461/1360. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1595/1448.12:25 ETDow +89.47 at 29380.23, Nasdaq +52.38 at 9561.08, S&P +10.13 at 3344.82[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq is up 0.6%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Netflix (NFLX 367.50, -2.17, -0.6%) as the lone stock in the red.

Neither Russia nor Saudi Arabia has signed on to any production-cut agreement, though.

Germany's DAX increased 0.7%, UK's FTSE increased 0.3%, and France's CAC increased 0.9%. The Europe Stoxx 600 advanced 0.5%.11:25 ETDow +80.21 at 29370.97, Nasdaq +58.46 at 9567.16, S&P +11.44 at 3346.13[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is now up 0.3%, led higher by the communication services sector (+1.2%) amid a rebound in shares of Alphabet (GOOG 1479.72, +31.49, +2.2%).Boeing (BA 338.26, +8.71, +2.6%) shares are on the rise on reports the FAA said it will likely approve the company's 737 MAX software design changes.Separately, Casper Sleep (CSPR 15.60, +3.59, +29.9%) recently opened for trading at $14.50 after pricing IPO at $12, the low end of the $12-13 range that was expected.10:55 ETDow +19.94 at 29310.7, Nasdaq +36.80 at 9545.5, S&P +5.95 at 3340.64[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to hold onto a modest gain of 0.2%. For the week, the benchmark index is now up 3.6%, so today's sluggish start appears justified.Part of the weekly advance can be attributed to China shoring up confidence.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.7%) and Russell 2000 (+1.5%) outperformed the benchmark index. The Nasdaq Composite (+0.4%) underperformed in a rare outing, although it still closed at a new high.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors contributed to the advance, especially the energy sector (+3.8%) after weeks of underperformance and a nice rebound in oil prices ($50.85, +1.24, +2.5%). The real estate sector (-0.1%) was the lone holdout today.The bullish price action was driven mostly by optimism, particularly tied to the prevailing view that the economy is fine and any negative impact resulting from the coronavirus will be minimal. Aiding this sentiment were reports that progress is being made in developing a vaccine and economic data depicting a healthy labor market and services sector.Specifically, the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for January increased to 55.5% (Briefing.com consensus 55.0%) from 54.9% in December. The ADP Employment Change report showed an estimated 291,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in January (Briefing.com consensus 160,000).That's not to say that the coronavirus is behind the market, though. For instance, Walt Disney (DIS 141.37, -3.36, -2.3%), Nike (NKE 100.54, -0.84, -0.8%), and Capri Holdings (CPRI 33.31, +2.55, +8.3%) formally stated that the coronavirus will have a negative impact on financial results.

The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.45%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.65%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.28.Reviewing Wednesday's economic data:The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for January registered a 55.5% reading (Briefing.com consensus 55.0%) versus a downwardly revised 54.9% (from 55.0%) in December. The January reading eclipsed the December reading as the fastest pace of expansion since August 2019.The key takeaway from the report is that it marked the second straight month of accelerating activity in the services sector, which is an encouraging sign that the U.S. economic expansion is poised to continue.The Trade Balance report for December showed a widening in the deficit to $48.9 billion (Briefing.com consensus -$48.2 billion) from a downwardly revised -$43.7 billion (from -$43.1 billion). Exports were $1.6 billion more than November exports while imports were $6.8 billion more than November imports.The key takeaway from the report is that the goods deficit with China decreased by $73.9 billion in 2019 to $345.6 billion, as tariff measures contributed to a $13.5 billion decrease in exports and an $87.4 billion decrease in imports.The ADP Employment Change report showed an estimated 291,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in January (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), with healthy gains across small, midsized, and large employers. In turn, there was a nice pickup in jobs added on the goods-producing side of the economy (+54,000).The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index rose 5.0% following a 7.2% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report and preliminary Q4 readings for Productivity and Unit Labor Costs on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +6.0% YTDS&P 500 +3.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +2.6% YTDRussell 2000 +0.8% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2203/668. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2207/981.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: February 6, 2020End of Document

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite outperforms with a 0.7% gain.Positive sentiment has been aided by 1) China saying it will cut tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. imports by half on Feb. 14 and 2) weekly jobless claims dropping to a nine-month low to 202,000 (Briefing.com consensus 218,000). The market is now up around 4% this week in front of the employment report for January tomorrow, which may be keeping gains in check today.The S&P 500 communication services sector (+1.2%) leads the advance amid a rebound in Alphabet (GOOG 1473.73, +25.50, +1.8%) and a 18% earnings-driven gain in Twitter (TWTR 39.57, +6.18, +18.4%). Sector laggards include energy (-0.7%), materials (-0.2%), and financials (-0.2%).Besides Twitter, notable earnings movers include Cardinal Health (CAH 58.79, +6.11, +11.6%) on the upside and Qualcomm (QCOM 89.84, -1.09, -1.2%), Becton Dickinson (BDX 257.86, -18.10, -9.8%), Kellogg (K 64.01, -5.35, -7.7%), and Twilio (TWLO 118.55, -8.61, -6.8%) on the downside.Boeing (BA 341.79, +12.22, +3.7%) shares are seeing positive action after the FAA reportedly said it will likely approve the company's software design fixes to the 737 MAX.

The benchmark 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.64%.

Continuing claims for the week ending January 25 increased by 48,000 to 1.751 million.The key takeaway from the report is that the low level of initial claims, which are a leading indicator, is indicative of employers maintaining a positive view of the demand outlook.The BLS reported that nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased 1.4% in the fourth quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.7%). Unit labor costs were also up 1.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that productivity is still running below the long-term average from 1947 to 2019 (2.1%); however, the 1.7% growth in nonfarm business sector productivity in 2019 was the strongest since 2010 and above the 1.3% average for the period 2007-2019. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1461/1360. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1595/1448.12:25 ETDow +89.47 at 29380.23, Nasdaq +52.38 at 9561.08, S&P +10.13 at 3344.82[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq is up 0.6%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Netflix (NFLX 367.50, -2.17, -0.6%) as the lone stock in the red.

Neither Russia nor Saudi Arabia has signed on to any production-cut agreement, though. The fact that oil prices are little changed today is reflecting investors' lack of confidence in OPEC to meaningfully affect prices.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a higher note. Germany's DAX increased 0.7%, UK's FTSE increased 0.3%, and France's CAC increased 0.9%. The Europe Stoxx 600 advanced 0.5%.11:25 ETDow +80.21 at 29370.97, Nasdaq +58.46 at 9567.16, S&P +11.44 at 3346.13[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is now up 0.3%, led higher by the communication services sector (+1.2%) amid a rebound in shares of Alphabet (GOOG 1479.72, +31.49, +2.2%).Boeing (BA 338.26, +8.71, +2.6%) shares are on the rise on reports the FAA said it will likely approve the company's 737 MAX software design changes.Separately, Casper Sleep (CSPR 15.60, +3.59, +29.9%) recently opened for trading at $14.50 after pricing IPO at $12, the low end of the $12-13 range that was expected.10:55 ETDow +19.94 at 29310.7, Nasdaq +36.80 at 9545.5, S&P +5.95 at 3340.64[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to hold onto a modest gain of 0.2%. For the week, the benchmark index is now up 3.6%, so today's sluggish start appears justified.Part of the weekly advance can be attributed to China shoring up confidence. First it injected liquidity into its overnight market, then signaled plans to cut rates to spur lending activity, and now it has indicated it will cut tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. imports by half.In other earnings news, shares of Peloton (PTON 29.93, -3.78, -8.5%) have dropped more than 8% after the company provided downside Q3 revenue guidance.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.7%) and Russell 2000 (+1.5%) outperformed the benchmark index. The Nasdaq Composite (+0.4%) underperformed in a rare outing, although it still closed at a new high.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors contributed to the advance, especially the energy sector (+3.8%) after weeks of underperformance and a nice rebound in oil prices ($50.85, +1.24, +2.5%). The real estate sector (-0.1%) was the lone holdout today.The bullish price action was driven mostly by optimism, particularly tied to the prevailing view that the economy is fine and any negative impact resulting from the coronavirus will be minimal. Aiding this sentiment were reports that progress is being made in developing a vaccine and economic data depicting a healthy labor market and services sector.Specifically, the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for January increased to 55.5% (Briefing.com consensus 55.0%) from 54.9% in December. The ADP Employment Change report showed an estimated 291,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in January (Briefing.com consensus 160,000).That's not to say that the coronavirus is behind the market, though. For instance, Walt Disney (DIS 141.37, -3.36, -2.3%), Nike (NKE 100.54, -0.84, -0.8%), and Capri Holdings (CPRI 33.31, +2.55, +8.3%) formally stated that the coronavirus will have a negative impact on financial results. The market is simply viewing the situation through a positive lens.In earnings news, Merck (MRK 85.83, -2.53, -2.9%) fell despite beating profit estimates. Ford Motor (F 8.31, -0.87, -9.5%) and General Motors (GM 35.03, +0.66, +1.9%) trended in opposite directions following their resultsOther story stocks included Tesla (TSLA 734.70, -152.36, -17.2%), which pulled back from its parabolic rise, and Biogen (BIIB 332.87, +49.58, +17.5%), which was awarded a favorable patent decision for a multiple sclerosis drug.U.S. Treasuries succumbed to selling interest for the second straight session. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.45%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.65%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.28.Reviewing Wednesday's economic data:The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for January registered a 55.5% reading (Briefing.com consensus 55.0%) versus a downwardly revised 54.9% (from 55.0%) in December. The January reading eclipsed the December reading as the fastest pace of expansion since August 2019.The key takeaway from the report is that it marked the second straight month of accelerating activity in the services sector, which is an encouraging sign that the U.S. economic expansion is poised to continue.The Trade Balance report for December showed a widening in the deficit to $48.9 billion (Briefing.com consensus -$48.2 billion) from a downwardly revised -$43.7 billion (from -$43.1 billion). Exports were $1.6 billion more than November exports while imports were $6.8 billion more than November imports.The key takeaway from the report is that the goods deficit with China decreased by $73.9 billion in 2019 to $345.6 billion, as tariff measures contributed to a $13.5 billion decrease in exports and an $87.4 billion decrease in imports.The ADP Employment Change report showed an estimated 291,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in January (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), with healthy gains across small, midsized, and large employers. In turn, there was a nice pickup in jobs added on the goods-producing side of the economy (+54,000).The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index rose 5.0% following a 7.2% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report and preliminary Q4 readings for Productivity and Unit Labor Costs on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +6.0% YTDS&P 500 +3.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +2.6% YTDRussell 2000 +0.8% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2203/668. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2207/981.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: February 6, 2020End of Document

After notching all-time highs yesterday, shares of MSFT ended down about 0.1%; the stock bucks up today, higher by 1.79%. Shares of DIS, too, faded into Wednesday's close; the stock now rebounds 1.34% off yesterday's losses.Conversely, UnitedHealth (UNH 290.69, -5.04, -1.70%) sits at the bottom of the index.The DJIA's all-time highs today took the index up 3.05% YTD, though now stands modestly off those levels.12:55 ETDow +93.26 at 29384.02, Nasdaq +62.76 at 9571.46, S&P +12.14 at 3346.83[BRIEFING.COM] The large-cap indices have added to their strong weekly gains today, with the S&P 500 up another 0.4% in midday action. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite outperforms with a 0.7% gain.Positive sentiment has been aided by 1) China saying it will cut tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. imports by half on Feb. 14 and 2) weekly jobless claims dropping to a nine-month low to 202,000 (Briefing.com consensus 218,000). The market is now up around 4% this week in front of the employment report for January tomorrow, which may be keeping gains in check today.The S&P 500 communication services sector (+1.2%) leads the advance amid a rebound in Alphabet (GOOG 1473.73, +25.50, +1.8%) and a 18% earnings-driven gain in Twitter (TWTR 39.57, +6.18, +18.4%). Sector laggards include energy (-0.7%), materials (-0.2%), and financials (-0.2%).Besides Twitter, notable earnings movers include Cardinal Health (CAH 58.79, +6.11, +11.6%) on the upside and Qualcomm (QCOM 89.84, -1.09, -1.2%), Becton Dickinson (BDX 257.86, -18.10, -9.8%), Kellogg (K 64.01, -5.35, -7.7%), and Twilio (TWLO 118.55, -8.61, -6.8%) on the downside.Boeing (BA 341.79, +12.22, +3.7%) shares are seeing positive action after the FAA reportedly said it will likely approve the company's software design fixes to the 737 MAX. Tesla (TSLA 766.30, +30.92, +4.3%) shares, meanwhile, are up 4% after yesterday's 17% pullback.U.S. Treasuries are holding steady despite the positive bias in equities, as are oil prices ($50.85/bbl, +0.10, +0.2%) despite talk of a possible OPEC+ recommendation to cut production by 600,000 barrels per day. The benchmark 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.64%.

Continuing claims for the week ending January 25 increased by 48,000 to 1.751 million.The key takeaway from the report is that the low level of initial claims, which are a leading indicator, is indicative of employers maintaining a positive view of the demand outlook.The BLS reported that nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased 1.4% in the fourth quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.7%). Unit labor costs were also up 1.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that productivity is still running below the long-term average from 1947 to 2019 (2.1%); however, the 1.7% growth in nonfarm business sector productivity in 2019 was the strongest since 2010 and above the 1.3% average for the period 2007-2019. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1461/1360. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1595/1448.12:25 ETDow +89.47 at 29380.23, Nasdaq +52.38 at 9561.08, S&P +10.13 at 3344.82[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq is up 0.6%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Netflix (NFLX 367.50, -2.17, -0.6%) as the lone stock in the red.

Neither Russia nor Saudi Arabia has signed on to any production-cut agreement, though. The fact that oil prices are little changed today is reflecting investors' lack of confidence in OPEC to meaningfully affect prices.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a higher note. Germany's DAX increased 0.7%, UK's FTSE increased 0.3%, and France's CAC increased 0.9%. The Europe Stoxx 600 advanced 0.5%.11:25 ETDow +80.21 at 29370.97, Nasdaq +58.46 at 9567.16, S&P +11.44 at 3346.13[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is now up 0.3%, led higher by the communication services sector (+1.2%) amid a rebound in shares of Alphabet (GOOG 1479.72, +31.49, +2.2%).Boeing (BA 338.26, +8.71, +2.6%) shares are on the rise on reports the FAA said it will likely approve the company's 737 MAX software design changes.Separately, Casper Sleep (CSPR 15.60, +3.59, +29.9%) recently opened for trading at $14.50 after pricing IPO at $12, the low end of the $12-13 range that was expected.10:55 ETDow +19.94 at 29310.7, Nasdaq +36.80 at 9545.5, S&P +5.95 at 3340.64[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to hold onto a modest gain of 0.2%. For the week, the benchmark index is now up 3.6%, so today's sluggish start appears justified.Part of the weekly advance can be attributed to China shoring up confidence.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.7%) and Russell 2000 (+1.5%) outperformed the benchmark index. The Nasdaq Composite (+0.4%) underperformed in a rare outing, although it still closed at a new high.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors contributed to the advance, especially the energy sector (+3.8%) after weeks of underperformance and a nice rebound in oil prices ($50.85, +1.24, +2.5%). The real estate sector (-0.1%) was the lone holdout today.The bullish price action was driven mostly by optimism, particularly tied to the prevailing view that the economy is fine and any negative impact resulting from the coronavirus will be minimal. Aiding this sentiment were reports that progress is being made in developing a vaccine and economic data depicting a healthy labor market and services sector.Specifically, the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for January increased to 55.5% (Briefing.com consensus 55.0%) from 54.9% in December. The ADP Employment Change report showed an estimated 291,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in January (Briefing.com consensus 160,000).That's not to say that the coronavirus is behind the market, though. For instance, Walt Disney (DIS 141.37, -3.36, -2.3%), Nike (NKE 100.54, -0.84, -0.8%), and Capri Holdings (CPRI 33.31, +2.55, +8.3%) formally stated that the coronavirus will have a negative impact on financial results.

The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.45%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.65%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.28.Reviewing Wednesday's economic data:The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for January registered a 55.5% reading (Briefing.com consensus 55.0%) versus a downwardly revised 54.9% (from 55.0%) in December. The January reading eclipsed the December reading as the fastest pace of expansion since August 2019.The key takeaway from the report is that it marked the second straight month of accelerating activity in the services sector, which is an encouraging sign that the U.S. economic expansion is poised to continue.The Trade Balance report for December showed a widening in the deficit to $48.9 billion (Briefing.com consensus -$48.2 billion) from a downwardly revised -$43.7 billion (from -$43.1 billion). Exports were $1.6 billion more than November exports while imports were $6.8 billion more than November imports.The key takeaway from the report is that the goods deficit with China decreased by $73.9 billion in 2019 to $345.6 billion, as tariff measures contributed to a $13.5 billion decrease in exports and an $87.4 billion decrease in imports.The ADP Employment Change report showed an estimated 291,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in January (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), with healthy gains across small, midsized, and large employers. In turn, there was a nice pickup in jobs added on the goods-producing side of the economy (+54,000).The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index rose 5.0% following a 7.2% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report and preliminary Q4 readings for Productivity and Unit Labor Costs on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +6.0% YTDS&P 500 +3.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +2.6% YTDRussell 2000 +0.8% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2203/668. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2207/981.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: February 6, 2020End of Document

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite outperforms with a 0.7% gain.Positive sentiment has been aided by 1) China saying it will cut tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. imports by half on Feb. 14 and 2) weekly jobless claims dropping to a nine-month low to 202,000 (Briefing.com consensus 218,000). The market is now up around 4% this week in front of the employment report for January tomorrow, which may be keeping gains in check today.The S&P 500 communication services sector (+1.2%) leads the advance amid a rebound in Alphabet (GOOG 1473.73, +25.50, +1.8%) and a 18% earnings-driven gain in Twitter (TWTR 39.57, +6.18, +18.4%).

Continuing claims for the week ending January 25 increased by 48,000 to 1.751 million.The key takeaway from the report is that the low level of initial claims, which are a leading indicator, is indicative of employers maintaining a positive view of the demand outlook.The BLS reported that nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased 1.4% in the fourth quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.7%). Unit labor costs were also up 1.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that productivity is still running below the long-term average from 1947 to 2019 (2.1%); however, the 1.7% growth in nonfarm business sector productivity in 2019 was the strongest since 2010 and above the 1.3% average for the period 2007-2019. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1461/1360. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1595/1448.12:25 ETDow +89.47 at 29380.23, Nasdaq +52.38 at 9561.08, S&P +10.13 at 3344.82[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq is up 0.6%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Netflix (NFLX 367.50, -2.17, -0.6%) as the lone stock in the red.

Neither Russia nor Saudi Arabia has signed on to any production-cut agreement, though. The fact that oil prices are little changed today is reflecting investors' lack of confidence in OPEC to meaningfully affect prices.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a higher note. Germany's DAX increased 0.7%, UK's FTSE increased 0.3%, and France's CAC increased 0.9%. The Europe Stoxx 600 advanced 0.5%.11:25 ETDow +80.21 at 29370.97, Nasdaq +58.46 at 9567.16, S&P +11.44 at 3346.13[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is now up 0.3%, led higher by the communication services sector (+1.2%) amid a rebound in shares of Alphabet (GOOG 1479.72, +31.49, +2.2%).Boeing (BA 338.26, +8.71, +2.6%) shares are on the rise on reports the FAA said it will likely approve the company's 737 MAX software design changes.Separately, Casper Sleep (CSPR 15.60, +3.59, +29.9%) recently opened for trading at $14.50 after pricing IPO at $12, the low end of the $12-13 range that was expected.10:55 ETDow +19.94 at 29310.7, Nasdaq +36.80 at 9545.5, S&P +5.95 at 3340.64[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to hold onto a modest gain of 0.2%. For the week, the benchmark index is now up 3.6%, so today's sluggish start appears justified.Part of the weekly advance can be attributed to China shoring up confidence.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.7%) and Russell 2000 (+1.5%) outperformed the benchmark index. The Nasdaq Composite (+0.4%) underperformed in a rare outing, although it still closed at a new high.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors contributed to the advance, especially the energy sector (+3.8%) after weeks of underperformance and a nice rebound in oil prices ($50.85, +1.24, +2.5%). The real estate sector (-0.1%) was the lone holdout today.The bullish price action was driven mostly by optimism, particularly tied to the prevailing view that the economy is fine and any negative impact resulting from the coronavirus will be minimal. Aiding this sentiment were reports that progress is being made in developing a vaccine and economic data depicting a healthy labor market and services sector.Specifically, the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for January increased to 55.5% (Briefing.com consensus 55.0%) from 54.9% in December. The ADP Employment Change report showed an estimated 291,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in January (Briefing.com consensus 160,000).That's not to say that the coronavirus is behind the market, though. For instance, Walt Disney (DIS 141.37, -3.36, -2.3%), Nike (NKE 100.54, -0.84, -0.8%), and Capri Holdings (CPRI 33.31, +2.55, +8.3%) formally stated that the coronavirus will have a negative impact on financial results.

The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.45%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.65%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.28.Reviewing Wednesday's economic data:The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for January registered a 55.5% reading (Briefing.com consensus 55.0%) versus a downwardly revised 54.9% (from 55.0%) in December. The January reading eclipsed the December reading as the fastest pace of expansion since August 2019.The key takeaway from the report is that it marked the second straight month of accelerating activity in the services sector, which is an encouraging sign that the U.S. economic expansion is poised to continue.The Trade Balance report for December showed a widening in the deficit to $48.9 billion (Briefing.com consensus -$48.2 billion) from a downwardly revised -$43.7 billion (from -$43.1 billion). Exports were $1.6 billion more than November exports while imports were $6.8 billion more than November imports.The key takeaway from the report is that the goods deficit with China decreased by $73.9 billion in 2019 to $345.6 billion, as tariff measures contributed to a $13.5 billion decrease in exports and an $87.4 billion decrease in imports.The ADP Employment Change report showed an estimated 291,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in January (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), with healthy gains across small, midsized, and large employers. In turn, there was a nice pickup in jobs added on the goods-producing side of the economy (+54,000).The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index rose 5.0% following a 7.2% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report and preliminary Q4 readings for Productivity and Unit Labor Costs on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +6.0% YTDS&P 500 +3.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +2.6% YTDRussell 2000 +0.8% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2203/668. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2207/981.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: February 6, 2020End of Document

The small-cap Russell 2000 (-0.3%) struggled to keep pace and closed lower.The lead news item today was China announcing it will cut tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. imports by 50% on Feb. 14. This should not only help Beijing fulfill its pledges from the Phase One trade deal, but also provide additional economic stimulus. In the U.S, weekly jobless claims falling to their lowest level in nine months was another good sign for the economy.Mega-cap technology stocks did the heavy lifting today, helping the S&P 500 communication services (+1.1%) and information technology (+0.9%) sectors outpace the broader market. The S&P 500, however, drifted with modest gains throughout the session, as investors presumably exercised some caution after a big week with the January employment report still due tomorrow.The energy sector (-1.0%) was today's outright laggard after a rare outperformance yesterday.Earnings were mixed and, keeping with recent trend, reactions were isolated to reporting companies. Twitter (TWTR 38.41, +5.02, +15.0%) and Cardinal Health (CAH 58.26, +5.58, +10.6%) stood out with impressive post-earnings gains, while Becton Dickinson (BDX 252.25, -33.74, -11.8%) and Kellogg (K 63.46, -5.90, -8.5%) were some of the laggards.Separately, Boeing (BA 341.43, +11.88, +3.6%) shares outperformed on reports that the FAA will approve the company's design fixes to the 737 MAX. New software flaws were discovered but the goal to return to service by mid-year remained intact, according to Bloomberg.U.S. Treasuries finished a quiet session little changed. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 1.45%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.64%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 98.49. WTI crude increased 0.2% to $50.97/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Initial claims for the week ending February 1 decreased by 15,000 to 202,000 (Briefing.com consensus 218,000), which is a nine-month low. Continuing claims for the week ending January 25 increased by 48,000 to 1.751 million.The key takeaway from the report is that the low level of initial claims, which are a leading indicator, is indicative of employers maintaining a positive view of the demand outlook.The BLS reported that nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased 1.4% in the fourth quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.7%). Unit labor costs were also up 1.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that productivity is still running below the long-term average from 1947 to 2019 (2.1%); however, the 1.7% growth in nonfarm business sector productivity in 2019 was the strongest since 2010 and above the 1.3% average for the period 2007-2019.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Employment Situation Report for January, the Wholesale Inventories report for December, and the Consumer Credit report for December on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +6.7% YTDS&P 500 +3.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +3.0% YTDRussell 2000 +0.5% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1359/1502. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1459/1703.15:25 ETDow +40.17 at 29330.93, Nasdaq +44.87 at 9553.57, S&P +6.92 at 3341.61[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is down from prior highs and is up just 0.2%.One last look at the S&P 500 sectors before the close shows mixed results. Communication services (+1.1%) and information technology (+0.8%) outperform amid strength in the mega-cap technology stocks, while energy (-0.9%) and materials (-0.3%) underperform.WTI crude increased $0.12 (+0.2%) to $50.97/bbl.14:55 ETDow +92.72 at 29383.48, Nasdaq +52.47 at 9561.17, S&P +10.92 at 3345.61[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.4%, and any gain today would be good for a record close.In corporate news, The Wall Street Journal is reporting that activist fund Elliott Management has amassed a nearly $2.5 billion stake in Softbank (SFTBY 23.03, +1.93, +9.2%). Separately, Bloomberg is reporting that Elon Musk's SpaceX is aiming to spin off its Starlink unit into a public company.Looking ahead, T-Mobile US (TMUS 82.56, +0.77, +0.9%), Uber (UBER 37.04, +0.23, +0.6%), and Wynn Resorts (WYNN 133.12, +0.84, +0.6%) are some notable companies that will report earnings after the close.14:30 ETDow +87.24 at 29378, Nasdaq +51.23 at 9559.93, S&P +9.85 at 3344.54[BRIEFING.COM] The broader market is settling in into the final few hours of action on Thursday with the Nasdaq Composite clinging to its market-leading gains of 0.54%, while the S&P 500 and DJIA hold gains of 0.30% apiece.S&P 500 constituents Cognizant Tech (CTSH 70.83, +5.86, +9.02%), FMC Corp (FMC 107.51, +5.69, +5.59%), and Take-Two (TTWO 127.07, +6.31, +5.23%) dot the top of the group on Thursday. Last night CTSH and FMC reported earnings, while TTWO will report tonight.Conversely, New Jersey-based med tech company Becton Dickinson (BDX 255.73, -30.26, -10.58%) rounds out the worst performers in the index today after offering unimpressive FY2020 earnings guidance.14:00 ETDow +87.75 at 29378.51, Nasdaq +59.17 at 9567.87, S&P +10.24 at 3344.93[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages jostled around in the last half hour but currently sit little changed since our lat update; the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite still sits in front, up 0.62%.Gold futures settled $7.20 higher (+0.5%) to $1,570/oz as investors are becoming more reassured that the worst is behind us with the coronavirus.The U.S. Dollar Index is up about 0.2% to 98.49.13:30 ETDow +81.95 at 29372.71, Nasdaq +53.66 at 9562.36, S&P +9.27 at 3343.96[BRIEFING.COM] The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite still leads, up 0.56%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average share gains of 0.28% apiece.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that Boeing (BA 341.60, +12.05, +3.66%), Microsoft (MSFT 183.12, +3.22), and Walt Disney (DIS 143.27, +1.90) are outperforming. After notching all-time highs yesterday, shares of MSFT ended down about 0.1%; the stock bucks up today, higher by 1.79%. Shares of DIS, too, faded into Wednesday's close; the stock now rebounds 1.34% off yesterday's losses.Conversely, UnitedHealth (UNH 290.69, -5.04, -1.70%) sits at the bottom of the index.The DJIA's all-time highs today took the index up 3.05% YTD, though now stands modestly off those levels.12:55 ETDow +93.26 at 29384.02, Nasdaq +62.76 at 9571.46, S&P +12.14 at 3346.83[BRIEFING.COM] The large-cap indices have added to their strong weekly gains today, with the S&P 500 up another 0.4% in midday action. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite outperforms with a 0.7% gain.Positive sentiment has been aided by 1) China saying it will cut tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. imports by half on Feb. 14 and 2) weekly jobless claims dropping to a nine-month low to 202,000 (Briefing.com consensus 218,000). The market is now up around 4% this week in front of the employment report for January tomorrow, which may be keeping gains in check today.The S&P 500 communication services sector (+1.2%) leads the advance amid a rebound in Alphabet (GOOG 1473.73, +25.50, +1.8%) and a 18% earnings-driven gain in Twitter (TWTR 39.57, +6.18, +18.4%). Sector laggards include energy (-0.7%), materials (-0.2%), and financials (-0.2%).Besides Twitter, notable earnings movers include Cardinal Health (CAH 58.79, +6.11, +11.6%) on the upside and Qualcomm (QCOM 89.84, -1.09, -1.2%), Becton Dickinson (BDX 257.86, -18.10, -9.8%), Kellogg (K 64.01, -5.35, -7.7%), and Twilio (TWLO 118.55, -8.61, -6.8%) on the downside.Boeing (BA 341.79, +12.22, +3.7%) shares are seeing positive action after the FAA reportedly said it will likely approve the company's software design fixes to the 737 MAX. Tesla (TSLA 766.30, +30.92, +4.3%) shares, meanwhile, are up 4% after yesterday's 17% pullback.U.S. Treasuries are holding steady despite the positive bias in equities, as are oil prices ($50.85/bbl, +0.10, +0.2%) despite talk of a possible OPEC+ recommendation to cut production by 600,000 barrels per day. The benchmark 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.64%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 98.48.Reviewing today's economic data:Initial claims for the week ending February 1 decreased by 15,000 to 202,000 (Briefing.com consensus 218,000), which is a nine-month low. Continuing claims for the week ending January 25 increased by 48,000 to 1.751 million.The key takeaway from the report is that the low level of initial claims, which are a leading indicator, is indicative of employers maintaining a positive view of the demand outlook.The BLS reported that nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased 1.4% in the fourth quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.7%). Unit labor costs were also up 1.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that productivity is still running below the long-term average from 1947 to 2019 (2.1%); however, the 1.7% growth in nonfarm business sector productivity in 2019 was the strongest since 2010 and above the 1.3% average for the period 2007-2019. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1461/1360. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1595/1448.12:25 ETDow +89.47 at 29380.23, Nasdaq +52.38 at 9561.08, S&P +10.13 at 3344.82[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq is up 0.6%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Netflix (NFLX 367.50, -2.17, -0.6%) as the lone stock in the red.

Neither Russia nor Saudi Arabia has signed on to any production-cut agreement, though. The fact that oil prices are little changed today is reflecting investors' lack of confidence in OPEC to meaningfully affect prices.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a higher note. Germany's DAX increased 0.7%, UK's FTSE increased 0.3%, and France's CAC increased 0.9%. The Europe Stoxx 600 advanced 0.5%.11:25 ETDow +80.21 at 29370.97, Nasdaq +58.46 at 9567.16, S&P +11.44 at 3346.13[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is now up 0.3%, led higher by the communication services sector (+1.2%) amid a rebound in shares of Alphabet (GOOG 1479.72, +31.49, +2.2%).Boeing (BA 338.26, +8.71, +2.6%) shares are on the rise on reports the FAA said it will likely approve the company's 737 MAX software design changes.Separately, Casper Sleep (CSPR 15.60, +3.59, +29.9%) recently opened for trading at $14.50 after pricing IPO at $12, the low end of the $12-13 range that was expected.10:55 ETDow +19.94 at 29310.7, Nasdaq +36.80 at 9545.5, S&P +5.95 at 3340.64[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to hold onto a modest gain of 0.2%. For the week, the benchmark index is now up 3.6%, so today's sluggish start appears justified.Part of the weekly advance can be attributed to China shoring up confidence.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.7%) and Russell 2000 (+1.5%) outperformed the benchmark index. The Nasdaq Composite (+0.4%) underperformed in a rare outing, although it still closed at a new high.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors contributed to the advance, especially the energy sector (+3.8%) after weeks of underperformance and a nice rebound in oil prices ($50.85, +1.24, +2.5%). The real estate sector (-0.1%) was the lone holdout today.The bullish price action was driven mostly by optimism, particularly tied to the prevailing view that the economy is fine and any negative impact resulting from the coronavirus will be minimal. Aiding this sentiment were reports that progress is being made in developing a vaccine and economic data depicting a healthy labor market and services sector.Specifically, the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for January increased to 55.5% (Briefing.com consensus 55.0%) from 54.9% in December. The ADP Employment Change report showed an estimated 291,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in January (Briefing.com consensus 160,000).That's not to say that the coronavirus is behind the market, though. For instance, Walt Disney (DIS 141.37, -3.36, -2.3%), Nike (NKE 100.54, -0.84, -0.8%), and Capri Holdings (CPRI 33.31, +2.55, +8.3%) formally stated that the coronavirus will have a negative impact on financial results. The market is simply viewing the situation through a positive lens.In earnings news, Merck (MRK 85.83, -2.53, -2.9%) fell despite beating profit estimates. Ford Motor (F 8.31, -0.87, -9.5%) and General Motors (GM 35.03, +0.66, +1.9%) trended in opposite directions following their resultsOther story stocks included Tesla (TSLA 734.70, -152.36, -17.2%), which pulled back from its parabolic rise, and Biogen (BIIB 332.87, +49.58, +17.5%), which was awarded a favorable patent decision for a multiple sclerosis drug.U.S. Treasuries succumbed to selling interest for the second straight session. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.45%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.65%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.28.Reviewing Wednesday's economic data:The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for January registered a 55.5% reading (Briefing.com consensus 55.0%) versus a downwardly revised 54.9% (from 55.0%) in December. The January reading eclipsed the December reading as the fastest pace of expansion since August 2019.The key takeaway from the report is that it marked the second straight month of accelerating activity in the services sector, which is an encouraging sign that the U.S. economic expansion is poised to continue.The Trade Balance report for December showed a widening in the deficit to $48.9 billion (Briefing.com consensus -$48.2 billion) from a downwardly revised -$43.7 billion (from -$43.1 billion). Exports were $1.6 billion more than November exports while imports were $6.8 billion more than November imports.The key takeaway from the report is that the goods deficit with China decreased by $73.9 billion in 2019 to $345.6 billion, as tariff measures contributed to a $13.5 billion decrease in exports and an $87.4 billion decrease in imports.The ADP Employment Change report showed an estimated 291,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in January (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), with healthy gains across small, midsized, and large employers. In turn, there was a nice pickup in jobs added on the goods-producing side of the economy (+54,000).The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index rose 5.0% following a 7.2% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report and preliminary Q4 readings for Productivity and Unit Labor Costs on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +6.0% YTDS&P 500 +3.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +2.6% YTDRussell 2000 +0.8% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2203/668. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2207/981.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: February 6, 2020End of Document

The small-cap Russell 2000 (-0.3%) struggled to keep pace and closed lower.The lead news item today was China announcing it will cut tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. imports by 50% on Feb. 14. This should not only help Beijing fulfill its pledges from the Phase One trade deal, but also provide additional economic stimulus. In the U.S, weekly jobless claims falling to their lowest level in nine months was another good sign for the economy.Mega-cap technology stocks did the heavy lifting today, helping the S&P 500 communication services (+1.1%) and information technology (+0.9%) sectors outpace the broader market. The S&P 500, however, drifted with modest gains throughout the session, as investors presumably exercised some caution after a big week with the January employment report still due tomorrow.The energy sector (-1.0%) was today's outright laggard after a rare outperformance yesterday.Earnings were mixed and, keeping with recent trend, reactions were isolated to reporting companies. Twitter (TWTR 38.41, +5.02, +15.0%) and Cardinal Health (CAH 58.26, +5.58, +10.6%) stood out with impressive post-earnings gains, while Becton Dickinson (BDX 252.25, -33.74, -11.8%) and Kellogg (K 63.46, -5.90, -8.5%) were some of the laggards.Separately, Boeing (BA 341.43, +11.88, +3.6%) shares outperformed on reports that the FAA will approve the company's design fixes to the 737 MAX. New software flaws were discovered but the goal to return to service by mid-year remained intact, according to Bloomberg.U.S. Treasuries finished a quiet session little changed. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 1.45%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.64%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 98.49. WTI crude increased 0.2% to $50.97/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Initial claims for the week ending February 1 decreased by 15,000 to 202,000 (Briefing.com consensus 218,000), which is a nine-month low. Continuing claims for the week ending January 25 increased by 48,000 to 1.751 million.The key takeaway from the report is that the low level of initial claims, which are a leading indicator, is indicative of employers maintaining a positive view of the demand outlook.The BLS reported that nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased 1.4% in the fourth quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.7%). Unit labor costs were also up 1.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that productivity is still running below the long-term average from 1947 to 2019 (2.1%); however, the 1.7% growth in nonfarm business sector productivity in 2019 was the strongest since 2010 and above the 1.3% average for the period 2007-2019.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Employment Situation Report for January, the Wholesale Inventories report for December, and the Consumer Credit report for December on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +6.7% YTDS&P 500 +3.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +3.0% YTDRussell 2000 +0.5% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1359/1502. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1459/1703.15:25 ETDow +40.17 at 29330.93, Nasdaq +44.87 at 9553.57, S&P +6.92 at 3341.61[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is down from prior highs and is up just 0.2%.One last look at the S&P 500 sectors before the close shows mixed results.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite outperforms with a 0.7% gain.Positive sentiment has been aided by 1) China saying it will cut tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. imports by half on Feb. 14 and 2) weekly jobless claims dropping to a nine-month low to 202,000 (Briefing.com consensus 218,000). The market is now up around 4% this week in front of the employment report for January tomorrow, which may be keeping gains in check today.The S&P 500 communication services sector (+1.2%) leads the advance amid a rebound in Alphabet (GOOG 1473.73, +25.50, +1.8%) and a 18% earnings-driven gain in Twitter (TWTR 39.57, +6.18, +18.4%).

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.7%) and Russell 2000 (+1.5%) outperformed the benchmark index. The Nasdaq Composite (+0.4%) underperformed in a rare outing, although it still closed at a new high.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors contributed to the advance, especially the energy sector (+3.8%) after weeks of underperformance and a nice rebound in oil prices ($50.85, +1.24, +2.5%). The real estate sector (-0.1%) was the lone holdout today.The bullish price action was driven mostly by optimism, particularly tied to the prevailing view that the economy is fine and any negative impact resulting from the coronavirus will be minimal. Aiding this sentiment were reports that progress is being made in developing a vaccine and economic data depicting a healthy labor market and services sector.Specifically, the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for January increased to 55.5% (Briefing.com consensus 55.0%) from 54.9% in December. The ADP Employment Change report showed an estimated 291,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in January (Briefing.com consensus 160,000).That's not to say that the coronavirus is behind the market, though. For instance, Walt Disney (DIS 141.37, -3.36, -2.3%), Nike (NKE 100.54, -0.84, -0.8%), and Capri Holdings (CPRI 33.31, +2.55, +8.3%) formally stated that the coronavirus will have a negative impact on financial results. The market is simply viewing the situation through a positive lens.In earnings news, Merck (MRK 85.83, -2.53, -2.9%) fell despite beating profit estimates. Ford Motor (F 8.31, -0.87, -9.5%) and General Motors (GM 35.03, +0.66, +1.9%) trended in opposite directions following their resultsOther story stocks included Tesla (TSLA 734.70, -152.36, -17.2%), which pulled back from its parabolic rise, and Biogen (BIIB 332.87, +49.58, +17.5%), which was awarded a favorable patent decision for a multiple sclerosis drug.U.S. Treasuries succumbed to selling interest for the second straight session. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.45%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.65%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.28.Reviewing Wednesday's economic data:The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for January registered a 55.5% reading (Briefing.com consensus 55.0%) versus a downwardly revised 54.9% (from 55.0%) in December. The January reading eclipsed the December reading as the fastest pace of expansion since August 2019.The key takeaway from the report is that it marked the second straight month of accelerating activity in the services sector, which is an encouraging sign that the U.S. economic expansion is poised to continue.The Trade Balance report for December showed a widening in the deficit to $48.9 billion (Briefing.com consensus -$48.2 billion) from a downwardly revised -$43.7 billion (from -$43.1 billion). Exports were $1.6 billion more than November exports while imports were $6.8 billion more than November imports.The key takeaway from the report is that the goods deficit with China decreased by $73.9 billion in 2019 to $345.6 billion, as tariff measures contributed to a $13.5 billion decrease in exports and an $87.4 billion decrease in imports.The ADP Employment Change report showed an estimated 291,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in January (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), with healthy gains across small, midsized, and large employers. In turn, there was a nice pickup in jobs added on the goods-producing side of the economy (+54,000).The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index rose 5.0% following a 7.2% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report and preliminary Q4 readings for Productivity and Unit Labor Costs on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +6.0% YTDS&P 500 +3.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +2.6% YTDRussell 2000 +0.8% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2203/668. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2207/981.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: February 6, 2020End of Document

The small-cap Russell 2000 (-0.3%) struggled to keep pace and closed lower.The lead news item today was China announcing it will cut tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. imports by 50% on Feb. 14. This should not only help Beijing fulfill its pledges from the Phase One deal, but also provide additional economic stimulus. In the U.S, weekly jobless claims falling to their lowest level in nine months was another good sign for the economy.Mega-cap technology stocks did the heavy lifting today, helping the S&P 500 communication services (+1.1%) and information technology (+0.9%) sectors outpace the broader market. The S&P 500, however, drifted with modest gains throughout the session, as investors presumably exercised some caution after a big week with the January employment report still due tomorrow.The energy sector (-1.0%) was today's outright laggard after a rare outperformance yesterday.Earnings were mixed and, keeping with recent trend, reactions were isolated to reporting companies. Twitter (TWTR 38.41, +5.02, +15.0%) and Cardinal Health (CAH 58.26, +5.58, +10.6%) stood out with impressive post-earnings gains, while Becton Dickinson (BDX 252.25, -33.74, -11.8%) and Kellogg (K 63.46, -5.90, -8.5%) were some of the laggards.Separately, Boeing (BA 341.43, +11.88, +3.6%) shares outperformed on reports that the FAA will approve the company's design fixes to the 737 MAX. New software flaws were discovered but the goal to return to service by mid-year remained intact, according to Bloomberg.U.S. Treasuries finished a quiet session little changed. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 1.45%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.64%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 98.49. WTI crude increased 0.2% to $50.97/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Initial claims for the week ending February 1 decreased by 15,000 to 202,000 (Briefing.com consensus 218,000), which is a nine-month low. Continuing claims for the week ending January 25 increased by 48,000 to 1.751 million.The key takeaway from the report is that the low level of initial claims, which are a leading indicator, is indicative of employers maintaining a positive view of the demand outlook.The BLS reported that nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased 1.4% in the fourth quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.7%). Unit labor costs were also up 1.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that productivity is still running below the long-term average from 1947 to 2019 (2.1%); however, the 1.7% growth in nonfarm business sector productivity in 2019 was the strongest since 2010 and above the 1.3% average for the period 2007-2019.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Employment Situation Report for January, the Wholesale Inventories report for December, and the Consumer Credit report for December on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +6.7% YTDS&P 500 +3.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +3.0% YTDRussell 2000 +0.5% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1359/1502. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1459/1703.15:25 ETDow +40.17 at 29330.93, Nasdaq +44.87 at 9553.57, S&P +6.92 at 3341.61[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is down from prior highs and is up just 0.2%.One last look at the S&P 500 sectors before the close shows mixed results.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.7%) and Russell 2000 (+1.5%) outperformed the benchmark index. The Nasdaq Composite (+0.4%) underperformed in a rare outing, although it still closed at a new high.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors contributed to the advance, especially the energy sector (+3.8%) after weeks of underperformance and a nice rebound in oil prices ($50.85, +1.24, +2.5%). The real estate sector (-0.1%) was the lone holdout today.The bullish price action was driven mostly by optimism, particularly tied to the prevailing view that the economy is fine and any negative impact resulting from the coronavirus will be minimal. Aiding this sentiment were reports that progress is being made in developing a vaccine and economic data depicting a healthy labor market and services sector.Specifically, the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for January increased to 55.5% (Briefing.com consensus 55.0%) from 54.9% in December. The ADP Employment Change report showed an estimated 291,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in January (Briefing.com consensus 160,000).That's not to say that the coronavirus is behind the market, though. For instance, Walt Disney (DIS 141.37, -3.36, -2.3%), Nike (NKE 100.54, -0.84, -0.8%), and Capri Holdings (CPRI 33.31, +2.55, +8.3%) formally stated that the coronavirus will have a negative impact on financial results.

The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.45%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.65%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.28.Reviewing Wednesday's economic data:The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for January registered a 55.5% reading (Briefing.com consensus 55.0%) versus a downwardly revised 54.9% (from 55.0%) in December. The January reading eclipsed the December reading as the fastest pace of expansion since August 2019.The key takeaway from the report is that it marked the second straight month of accelerating activity in the services sector, which is an encouraging sign that the U.S. economic expansion is poised to continue.The Trade Balance report for December showed a widening in the deficit to $48.9 billion (Briefing.com consensus -$48.2 billion) from a downwardly revised -$43.7 billion (from -$43.1 billion). Exports were $1.6 billion more than November exports while imports were $6.8 billion more than November imports.The key takeaway from the report is that the goods deficit with China decreased by $73.9 billion in 2019 to $345.6 billion, as tariff measures contributed to a $13.5 billion decrease in exports and an $87.4 billion decrease in imports.The ADP Employment Change report showed an estimated 291,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in January (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), with healthy gains across small, midsized, and large employers. In turn, there was a nice pickup in jobs added on the goods-producing side of the economy (+54,000).The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index rose 5.0% following a 7.2% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report and preliminary Q4 readings for Productivity and Unit Labor Costs on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +6.0% YTDS&P 500 +3.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +2.6% YTDRussell 2000 +0.8% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2203/668. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2207/981.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: February 6, 2020End of Document

The US says Huawei has been spying through 'backdoors' designed for law enforcement - which is what the US has been pressuring tech companies to do for yearsBusiness Insider USFebruary 12, 2020 Wednesday 06:48 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 970 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Isobel Asher Hamilton)Highlight: This is the first time the US has given any details about how it thinks Huawei spies on people though mobile telecoms.BodyREUTERS/Aly Song• The US government accused Huawei of spying on people by exploiting telecoms backdoors intended for use by law enforcement, the Wall Street Journal reports.• The US has repeatedly accused Huawei of spying for the Chinese government, but this is the first detail it's ever given about how it thinks Huawei does it. Huawei denies the allegation.• The US government has been pressuring tech companies like Apple and Facebook to build vulnerabilities for law enforcement to access encrypted devices and messages for years.• Tech companies have argued against building backdoors, as they argue malicious actors would be able to exploit them.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.The US accused Huawei of spying on people through technological "backdoors" intended for use by law enforcement, the Wall Street Journal reports.According to the Journal, US officials say Huawei has had this technology for over a decade. The US kept this information highly classified until late 2019 when it started sharing it with selected allies including Germany and the UK in a bid to get them to freeze out Huawei equipment from their 5G networks.The information doesn't seem to have troubled the UK however, as the country announced last month it would allow Huawei to build a limited amount of its            "non-core" 5G infrastructure.The US has long accused Huawei of acting as a conduit for Chinese government spying, but this is the first time it's provided precise details of exactly how it thinks Huawei does this. Huawei has repeatedly denied that it spies for China.Specifically officials said Huawei has built equipment that allows it to tap into telecoms using interfaces intended only designed for law enforcement without alerting the carriers. "Huawei does not disclose this covert access to its local customers, or the host nation national-security agencies," the Journal cited a senior US official as saying.Officials were non-specific about whether they've observed Huawei exploiting this access, and didn't give technical details other than to say they'd first spotted it in 2009 on 4G equipment.Huawei was not immediately available for comment on the Journal's report when contacted by Business Insider, but a spokesperson told the Journal:"We emphatically reject these latest allegations. Again, groundless accusations are being repeated without providing any kind of concrete evidence."The perils of building backdoorsThis latest allegation against Huawei highlights a security argument which the US has been wrangling with tech companies for years - whether it's safe to build privacy vulnerabilities for use by law enforcement.The US has pressured big tech companies to build methods for allowing law enforcement to circumvent security measures like encryption for years.REUTERS/Tom BrennerIn 2015 the FBI started a long-running feud with Apple when it asked for the company's help breaking into the iPhone of a mass-shooter. Apple refused on the basis that its encryption means it doesn't have access to customers' passwords, and building any security flaw which would allow the FBI to break in by other means would mean weakening its security overall.The case led to a huge standoff between Apple and the government, which Apple eventually won when the FBI announced it had found a third party to unlock the iPhone and dropped the case. More recently however the FBI has requested Apple's help opening another iPhone, and            President Trump lashed out at the tech giant for "refus[ing] to unlock phones used by killers, drug dealers and other violent criminal elements."Meanwhile Attorney General William Barr has been pressuring Facebook to build methods for law enforcement to access encrypted messaging on WhatsApp, and asked it to            hold off on encrypting its other messaging services.Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty ImagesDigital Rights and Regulation expert Dr Michael Veale told Business Insider the pressure to build backdoors in encrypted services is dangerous."Cryptography is so heavily relied on by financial services, businesses, electronic commerce, whistleblowers, journalists and governments. Introducing backdoors weakens the Internet for everyone, and leaves it so much more vulnerable to everyone from cybercrime rings to authoritarian regimes," he said.The US government's allegation that Huawei has exploited a similar mechanism in telecoms equipment would lend weight to this argument.Veale added that governments should invest in investigative powers that use the vast amount of internet data that isn't encrypted."The world isn't 'going dark' to law enforcement because of encryption; law enforcement are going blind to the huge amount of unencrypted data that is available to help investigations. It does not follow that because criminals, like all of us, now communicate online, catching them should become as simple as a web search. If anything, this new encryption debate highlights the greediness, laziness, and cost-cutting desires of national governments, and their willingness to throw fundamental rights and economic trust under a bus in search of a shortcut to avoid investing in proper investigative capacity."NOW WATCH: What it takes to be an NFL referee, according to an official who spent 19 seasons in the leagueSee Also:• China says Huawei is the victim of a 'witch hunt' as it warns European countries not to freeze the company out of their 5G networks• All it takes to fool facial recognition at airports and border crossings is a printed mask, researchers found• iPhone maker Foxconn is warning workers in Shenzhen to stay home as it diverts production to face masks amid coronavirus outbreakSEE ALSO: China says Huawei is the victim of a 'witch hunt' as it warns European countries not to freeze the company out of their 5G networksLoad-Date: February 12, 2020End of Document

Students Organize Coronavirus Donation and Information TableThe Wesleyan Argus: Wesleyan UniversityFebruary 11, 2020 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 908 wordsByline: Jordan Saliby, Assistant News EditorBodyA coronavirus information and donation table organized by Chinese students at the University ran from Tuesday, Feb. 4 to Friday, Feb. 7 in the Usdan University Center. Brochures and donation links were shared to spread awareness about the virus and to provide support for those affected. The main organizers of the event told The Argus about the ongoing process of fundraising, and the difficulties associated with trying to find donation channels that would ensure resources are delivered to the necessary locations affected by the virus. In brainstorming ideas for potential methods of donation, they considered sending supplies from the United States directly to China. However, Huiquin Hu '20 explained that there are legal requirements that could pose a problem."After you register with the Chinese Border Control, you have to register with the Wuhan Red Cross or Wuhan Charity Federation," Hu said. "Those are the two official NGOs that are basically a part of the bureaucratic system of the Chinese government."Recent reports of mismanagement by journalists and doctors have prompted backlash against one of these official organizations, The Red Cross Society of Hubei. Many believe a bottleneck-a situation that causes a delay in the distribution of supplies-has been created by the government's centralization of the donation process, leaving doctors and nurses using social media to ask for assistance."The desperate situation faced by doctors and nurses in Hubei became known to the Chinese public after hospitals bypassed the designated charity organisations and posted online appeals for donations for N95 masks, goggles, protective suits and gloves," The South China Morning Post wrote.Given the current state of affairs with The Red Cross Society of Hubei, student organizers took precautions to choose an organization to send supplies to after the donation drive. "Everything is making us disappointed by those channels," Hu said. "So we had to find organizations that will be able to send things directly to the hospital instead of going through the Red Cross."As a result, the organizers settled on the nonprofits Wuhan United and the Huazhong University of Science and Technology as primary donation recipients, along with the Wuhan University Alumni of North Carolina with Direct Relief."Wuhan University Alumni Association has contacts within China so they can do the border control clearance, [and be in] direct contact with Wuhan Hospital," Hu said. "So Direct Relief gave Wuhan University 2.5 tons of supplies.... Because they offended the Red Cross, you're getting those plans domestically. But the 2.5 tons of supplies basically saved them last minute."Given the media coverage of the outbreak and an increased demand in necessary medical equipment, supply shortages have been an increased concern. Linus Mao '23 primarily worked on finding potential suppliers of masks, gloves, and other necessary medical equipment for the campaign. Mao explained that many American and Chinese suppliers-including local suppliers like the Middletown CVS-were mostly out of stock or provided inopportune methods of transporting materials.Additionally, while the University operates an official WeChat group for Chinese students, a separate WeChat group, outside of the Wesleyan-operated one, exists specifically for parents of Chinese students. The parents group has been working with organizers to receive updates on new donations and sources. The organizers tried to have the event advertised in the official Wesleyan group but ran into concerns."They didn't want to set a precedent of the University official account marketing a private event that is organized by students," Hu said.Given this communication barrier, Shaoxuan Tian '22 is working with University's Program Manager for Global Initiatives Zijia Guo, to determine how students might use the University-run group to call for donations.The campaign also focused on raising awareness about coronavirus and emphasized community and compassion given rising fears associated with the outbreak. Maria Tan '22 and Oliver Cho '22 researched the outbreak and published an opinion piece in The Argus discussing their findings and sharing Chinese students' experiences of scrutiny and alienation after returning to the University for the spring semester. "I think it's really important to bring the awareness of how serious this situation is and more of like, stats and facts," Tan said. "They were so over exaggerated in the social media climate. So we did a lot of research."Tan emphasized that the brochures distributed at the event were meant to spread a message of empathy."The message that we want to say is that we should all be compassionate to one another to eliminate any chance of racism and Sinophobia," Tan said.Hu urges the Wesleyan community to realize the scope of the coronavirus and that a serious response is necessary to deal with the growing cases."This is not just a Wuhan issue anymore," Hu said. "It's a China issue. To give you an example, my city is super small. You can imagine it as Arlington, Texas. 17 years ago, back when SARS was spreading in China, my entire province only had three confirmed cases and my city had zero. Right now, my city has 62 confirmed cases. That's the scale of coronavirus."Donations are still being accepted, and  instructions on how to donate can be found on the event's page.Jordan Saliby can be reached at jsaliby@wesleyan.eduLoad-Date: February 11, 2020End of Document

Demand in Mexico's industrial markets remains stable and public construction activity in the country is beginning to show some signs of improvement.

Currently, BIFMA is forecasting 2% growth for the coming year. That seems like a reasonable starting point for core growth, though it is quite a bit lower than the double digit increases in both the number of and dollar value of the projects we are tracking and the growth in the number of clients visiting with us. We have seen average order size continue to stabilize and believe some of that is a function of our ability to capture a greater portion of our client's workplace spend. If you add on approximately three quarters of Fully sales, you arrive at a mid-single digit top line growth rate for 2020.We expect gross margin expansion of 20 to 30 basis points during 2020, driven primarily by continued lean initiatives in our manufacturing facilities and supply chain, and favorable commodity pricing. Mid-term gross margin expansion will be bolstered by our manufacturing footprint optimization and we expect to begin recognizing savings late in 2020, but more meaningfully in 2021, delivering an additional 50 basis points of improvement. However, we do expect that the combination of a slight reduction in production capacity during the first quarter of 2020 as the result of our manufacturing optimization moves, combined with somewhat extended client request dates in our backlog, will result in a shift of revenue from the first to the second quarter. Additionally, while we have very little revenue exposure in China, we are watching any potential supply disruptions due to extended supplier shutdowns in China. At this point in time we do not see any material impact but understand that the situation is fluid.As we look out over the 2020 year, we expect EBITDA margin expansion to be more modest. Looking to 2021, we will move closer to our long-term goal of 15% consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin with the benefit of a year of savings related to the footprint and logistics optimization activities. As we continue to focus on debt reduction as a use of available free cash, we believe our average outstanding debt will be approximately $435 million during 2020, with an average interest rate of approximately 3.7%. This is reflective of the $250 million interest rate swap for 2020 and an average credit spread of 150 basis points. We expect our consolidated effective tax rate to be between 25% and 26% for full year 2020.As a result of the continued efforts around showroom enhancements to make the most use of our floor space to support the constellation selling strategy and residential initiatives, as well as investments in new product development and technology expansion for our e-commerce capabilities, we expect 2020 capital expenditures will be between $55 million and $60 million.16:23DT Dynatrace launches follow-on public offering of 25.0 mln shares of common stock by certain selling stockholders (35.14 -0.98)Dynatrace will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares being offered by the selling stockholders but will bear the costs associated with the sale of such shares.16:22KRG Kite Realty beats by $0.01, beats on revs; guides FY20 FFO below consensus (18.00 +0.08)Reports Q4 (Dec) funds from operations of $0.40 per share, $0.01 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.39; revenues fell 13.4% year/year to $75.27 mln vs the $73.17 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The market resiliently cut its losses during the afternoon, though, leaving the S&P 500 down 0.3% for the session.The Nasdaq Composite (+0.02%) eked out a closing record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.6%) and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) still finished lower.Apple specifically said it doesn't expect to meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter due to the coronavirus restraining its supply chain and impacting consumer demand in China. The news didn't come as a surprise given similar warnings previously issued by companies, and investors presumably viewed the situation as temporary and China-specific.Investors, however, did assume some defensive positioning, evident by the gains in bonds, gold futures ($1590.00, +$19.00, +1.2%), and the CBOE Volatility Index (14.83, +1.15, +8.4%). The resulting decline in Treasury yields undercut the financials sector (-0.9%), while it benefited the utilities sector (+0.8%).The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.40%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.56%. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.4% to 99.43. WTI crude inched up 0.1% (+$0.05) to $52.10/bbl, recouping its intraday losses.Microsoft (MSFT 187.23, +1.88, +1.0%) and Amazon (AMZN 2155.67, +20.80, +1.0%), which have a combined market cap of nearly $2.5 trillion, helped offset the weakness in Apple with 1% gains of their own. Both stocks extended their yearly gains to 18.7% and 16.6%, respectively, while Apple trimmed its yearly gain to 8.6%.Walmart (WMT 119.63, +1.74, +1.5%) also outperformed despite missing profit estimates. Tesla (TSLA 858.40, +58.37, +7.3%) resumed its parabolic advance after its price target was raised at Bernstein and Morgan Stanley, although both targets were well below TSLA's closing price.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included the Empire State Manufacturing Survey and NAHB Housing Market Index:The Empire State Manufacturing Survey for February increased to 12.9 (Briefing.com consensus 6.3) from the prior month's reading of 4.8.The NAHB Housing Market Index for February declined to 74 (Briefing.com consensus 75) from 75 in January.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for January, Housing Starts and Building Permits for January and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite +8.5% YTDS&P 500 +4.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +2.4% YTDRussell 2000 +0.9% YTD16:18INVH Invitation Homes misses by $0.01, misses on revs; guides FY20 FFO in-line (32.61 +0.06)Reports Q4 (Dec) funds from operations of $0.32 per share, $0.01 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.33; revenues rose 2.7% year/year to $444.28 mln vs the $450.54 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

In the first-quarter 2020, oil production is projected to average in the range of 158,000 to 163,000 barrels per day. Importantly, Devon expects to deliver this improved oil growth outlook with less capital than previously projected. The company is now lowering the top end of its upstream capital guidance by $50 million to a range of $1.7 billion to $1.85 billion in 2020. Furthermore, the capital efficiency of this investment in 2020 is expected to be enhanced by reallocation of capital to the Delaware Basin from the STACK play. The company now projects that capital spending in the Delaware Basin will increase by approximately 15 percent year-over-year and account for approximately 60 percent of Devon's total capital investment in 2020. Another noteworthy guidance item for 2020 is the company's full-year G&A outlook that is expected to decline to a range of $360 million to $400 million. Including costs reclassified as discontinued operations, this represents an improvement of more than 20 percent compared to 2019. With this outlook, Devon remains on track to meet or exceed its stated goal of reducing total G&A expense to a level of $350 million by the end of 2021.16:13TPH TRI Pointe Homes beats by $0.14, beats on revs (17.23 -0.27)Reports Q4 (Dec) earnings of $0.85 per share, $0.14 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.71; revenues rose 1.5% year/year to $1.14 bln vs the $1.09 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Excluding interest, impairments and lot option abandonments, adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage was 26.2%.New home orders of 1,235 compared to 812, an increase of 52%.Backlog units at quarter end of 1,752 homes compared to 1,335, an increase of 31%.For the first quarter of 2020, the Company expects to open 15 new communities and close out of 7 communities, which would result in 145 active selling communities as of March 31, 2020.
