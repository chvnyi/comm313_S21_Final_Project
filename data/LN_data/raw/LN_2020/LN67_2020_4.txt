TEAR DOWN CHINA'S FIREWALLStates News ServiceJune 4, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 337 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the National Center for Public Policy Research:by David AlmasiChina's greatest wall is not the one made of stone. It's the Internet firewall that the repressive communist government uses to suppress free speech and the flow of information.The National Center has joined the Conservative Action Project and others in a coalition letter telling the Trump Administration that "[a]s the U.S. seeks to challenge Chinese dominance, breaking through these firewalls will be of critical importance."The letter, signed by National Center General Counsel Justin Danhof, Esq., notes that Chinese firewalls:Block contentMonitor use and browsing historyAllow government dissemination of liesPromote censorshipIt further states that Chinese government abuse turns the Internet into "a repressive information and mind control system."The coalition letter specifically recommends:As the U.S. coalesces around a more robust response to China, confronting their Internet firewall must place a key role. The Secretary of State should use his authority, granted to him by Congress in Sec. 7050 of the State Department's appropriations act, to partner with the private sector to develop technologies and initiatives aimed at cracking China's firewall.The U.S. should also seek to leverage our trade relationship with China to require a freer and more transparent Internet.In addition to Justin, the letter was signed by former Reagan Administration cabinet members Edwin Meese III (attorney general), Donald Paul Hodel (Interior and Energy) and James C. Miller (Office of Management and Budget); former congressmen Bob McEwen (Ohio) and David McIntosh (Indiana) and former senator Jim DeMint; and organization leaders including Ron Robinson of Young America's Foundation (and National Center's board), E.W.

Chinese crude reserves hit record, satellite imageCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 3, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 297 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- Oil inventories at the world's largest crude oil importer rose to record this week, satellite data showed, after Chinese refineries made a wave of purchases last quarter, when the economy began to recover from the coronavirus.Crude oil reserves at 39 storage sites monitored by company-owned and Chinese government-owned Ursa Space Systems increased to 70% of its capacity in the week through July 2, said Geoffrey Craig, a global energy analyst for the satellite company, which uses radars to monitor the filling of storage tanks. Inventories have increased since mid-May, mainly due to an increase in imports, he said.The Asian giant's rapid recovery in the wake of the coronavirus crisis coincided with the historic lows reaching crude oil prices in April and early May, leading to a wave of purchases that led to a series of oil tankers waiting on the coast to unload. However, high levels of stored crudes point to a possible slowdown in purchases from here, threatening to eliminate one of the main drivers of the recovery in global crude oil prices."China's buying wave has definitely declined since the last quarter, as refineries are taking their time to assess the shipments they bought when the oil was at $20," said Li Li, an analyst at commodity research firm ICIS-China in Shanghai. "We'll see a break in purchases in the third quarter."Storage sites near the Chinese coast are among the most at the top, with rates of more than 80% of its capacity, according to Ursa Space. The previous overall high was 68.5% in the week until March 26. Brent crude, a global benchmark, briefly fell below US$20 per barrel in mid-April, but has since recovered to about $43.Original Note:China's Oil Stockpiles Rise to a Record, Satellite Imaging Shows©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: July 4, 2020End of Document

Facebook And Twitter Push Back Against China, Deny Requests From Hong Kong For User DataThe Daily CallerJuly 6, 2020 Monday 07:08 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: DAILY-CALLER-NEWS-FOUNDATION; techLength: 541 wordsByline: Chris White, Tech Reporter, chris@dailycallernewsfoundation.orgChris is a Missourian trying to find news angles in the blank spaces of life. Also go Chiefs!Author ImageBodyLink to ImageFacebook and WhatsApp are suspending requests from Hong Kong officials to review user information after China imposed a law placing heavy regulations on the city's use of the internet, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday.WhatsApp is consulting with human rights experts to determine the impact Beijing's National Security Law has on the company's users, a company spokeswoman said of the decision, according to a Journal report. Facebook, which is the parent company of WhatsApp, and Twitter are doing the same thing, the report states.“We have grave concerns regarding both the developing process and the full intention of this law,” a Twitter spokesman told the Daily Caller News Foundation. He did not provide a reason for speaking anonymously, but Twitter's press office often requests anonymity when speaking to journalists.The National Security Law reportedly creates a commission in Hong Kong to report rebellious acts, including secession and working with foreign powers, to the Chinese government. The law was released in June before the anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China from Britain in 1997.WhatsApp is temporarily stopping such requests “pending further assessment of the impact of the National Security Law, including formal human-rights due diligence and consultations with human-rights experts,” WhatsApp's spokeswoman said.Link to ImageSAN JOSE, CA - MAY 01: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg  (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)“We believe freedom of expression is a fundamental human right and support the right of people to express themselves without fear for their safety or other repercussions,” Facebook said in a press statement to the Journal.Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, and other platforms operate freely inside of Hong Kong even though all three companies are blocked inside China. (RELATED: Facebook's Former Security Chief Shames Big Tech, Twitter For Not Banning Chinese-State Media)Hong Kong citizens have used such platforms to express support for activists demonstrating against Beijing. China clamped down on internet usage in Hong Kong after protesters spent weeks demonstrating against the Chinese Communist Party, which rolled out security measures in May following the demonstrations.Activists are welcoming Facebook's pushback. “I think it's a good sign. They are upholding freedom of speech and user privacy,” Francis Fong, honorary president of the Hong Kong Information Technology Federation trade association, said in a press statement.Tech companies have a difficult relationship with China, with many of them forced to submit to Chinese censorship in exchange for access to the country's massive customer base.Apple, for instance, admitted in 2017 to removing from its app store hundreds of virtual private network apps in China allowing users to avoid censors and in 2018 built a data center in the country to comply with Beijing's cyber security laws, which give the country the ability to seize data on political dissidents.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

UK bans Huawei from its 5G network in rapid about-faceCNN WireJuly 14, 2020 Tuesday 5:12 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1052 wordsDateline: LONDON (CNN Business) BodyLONDON (CNN Business) --  The United Kingdom has banned Huawei from its 5G telecom network, reversing a January decision to allow the embattled Chinese tech company a limited role in building the country's super-fast wireless infrastructure. Operators such as BT and Vodafone have been given until 2027 to remove existing Huawei equipment from their 5G networks, the UK government announced on Tuesday. Digital and Culture Minister Oliver Dowden said new US sanctions imposed on the company in May had "significantly changed" the landscape."Given the uncertainty this creates around Huawei's supply chain, the UK can no longer be confident it will be able to guarantee the security of future Huawei 5G equipment," Dowden said. The decision is a big win for the Trump administration, which has been pushing allies to exclude Huawei from their 5G networks, arguing that the Chinese company is a threat to national security. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared last month that "the tide is turning against Huawei as citizens around the world are waking up to the danger of the Chinese Communist Party's surveillance state." But it risks a backlash from China as Britain looks for new trading opportunities around the world after Brexit, and will delay the rollout of 5G across the country by at least a year, Dowden said. The US campaign against Huawei was having mixed success until the new sanctions in May further reduced the company's ability to manufacture and obtain semiconductor chips using American-made technology.That triggered another UK security review of the company's involvement in the British network, leading to Tuesday's decision by the National Security Council to order the phased removal of its technology. The decision is a huge blow for Huawei, which has operated in Britain for 20 years. Europe is a key market for the company, accounting for 24% of sales last year. Huawei on Monday announced half year results earlier than usual, reporting slower revenue growth. The company is already experiencing a decline in smartphone sales, after Washington blocked it from accessing popular Google apps. The phones became a lot less attractive in markets outside of China as a result. Huawei said it was confident that the recent US sanctions would not have affected "the resilience or security" of its products and described the UK announcement as disappointing."It threatens to move Britain into the digital slow lane, push up bills and deepen the digital divide," said Ed Brewster, a spokesperson for Huawei UK. "Regrettably our future in the UK has become politicized, this is about US trade policy and not security."The US sanctions restrict companies like TSMC, a Taiwan-based firm, from exporting computer chipsets and other key components to Huawei. Without them, Huawei can't build 5G base stations and other equipment."Based on the current direct export rule that the US put on, I really think that Huawei's 5G equipment business is in grave danger," Jefferies analyst Edison Lee said last month.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson had faced mounting pressure from lawmakers within his own party, along with the Trump administration, which argues that the Chinese government could use Huawei for spying and even sabotage.Washington had warned that US-UK intelligence sharing and military collaboration could be put at risk if Britain went ahead with its plan. Under Chinese law, Chinese companies can be ordered to act under the direction of Beijing. Huawei has consistently denied that it would help the Chinese government to spy, and says it is "100% owned by employees."Speaking early Tuesday before the UK announcement, China's Foreign Ministry repeated a previous warning by its ambassador that the decision would have consequences for the wider relationship between the two countries. "Whether the UK can provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies ... is a litmus test for British markets after Brexit, and it is also an indicator for China's investment in the UK," foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said.Ban will cause delays and cost billionsHuawei had lobbied hard to persuade the UK government it was a trustworthy partner, launching an advertising campaign last month emphasizing its history of investment and job creation in the country. This month, it announced that it had received approval to build a sprawling $1.25 billion research facility in Cambridge.Huawei is already an integral part of Britain's existing 4G infrastructure, and telecom operators will not be required to swap out the company's equipment in those networks. The Chinese company's European rivals said they were ready to fill the 5G void left by Huawei.Nokia said in a statement that it has the "capacity and expertise to replace all of the Huawei equipment in the UK's networks at scale and speed." Arun Bansal, Europe and Latin America president for Ericsson, said in a statement that the Swedish company "has the technology, experience and supply chain capacity," to help the United Kingdom reach its 5G goals. Nonetheless, the UK will pay a hefty price for kicking out Huawei. The government said Tuesday that the cumulative delay to 5G networks from the ban on new Huawei equipment and replacing its existing technology would be two or three years, at a total cost of as much as £2.5 billion ($3.1 billion). That means British consumers and businesses will have to wait longer, and possibly pay more, for the services that the extra bandwidth can support, such as self-driving cars and advanced manufacturing and healthcare applications. "Obviously we are disappointed because this decision --- as the government has highlighted today --- will add delay to the roll out of 5G in the UK and will result in additional costs for the industry," a Vodafone spokesperson said. BT CEO Philip Jansen said his company would be able to make the required changes without a significant impact on its timetable for 5G rollout. The implementation costs would be no higher than the £500 million ($627 million) BT estimated in January it would cost to comply with the previous UK decision to limit Huawei's role. --- Sherisse Pham and Chris Liakos contributed to this article.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

US ambassador to Brazil warns huawei 5G governmentCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 30, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 364 wordsBodySAO PAULO.- U.S. ambassador to Brazil, Todd Chapman, alerted the Brazilian government to possible "consequences" if Huawei's Chinese technology was authorized on the country's 5G network, which is scheduled for auction next year."I would say there will be no retaliation, but consequences. Each country is responsible for its decisions," he said in an interview published wednesday by the newspaper O Globo.In that regard, the U.S. ambassador suggested that Huawei's presence could compromise future investments by U.S. companies in fear that their intellectual property secrets will be violated."First, the information will not be secure. At any time the Chinese government will be able to ask Huawei to send the information to them," Chapman stressed.Those who are investing in pharmaceuticals, in software, look at that. Our economy is service-based. America's biggest export is intelligence, intellectual property. And Brazil has to do the same, or it will continue to export primary and non-high-tech products," he added.The 5G auction has generated great international interest and has become a new chapter of tensions between the United States and China due to the appetite expressed by Chinese giant Huawei to offer its technologies and the public pressures of US President Donald Trump's government for the Asian company to be vetoed.Although Huawei is not a telephony operator and would not participate in the auction, it is one of the largest infrastructure companies for 5G technology in the world, together with Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia. According to Chapman, the selection of 5G suppliers is not a business issue for the United States, but a matter of "national security."However, Brazil's Vice President Hamilton Mourao recently said it will be difficult to leave Huawei out of the auction, although he acknowledged that there will be increased pressures to do so as the U.S. presidential election approaches.President Jair Bolsonaro's government, aligned with the United States, has tried to maintain the difficult balance between its biggest political ally and its main trading partner, although the upcoming 5G auction could put the country at a crossroads.Load-Date: July 31, 2020End of Document

Tension between China and UK moves to passportsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 23, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 281 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- China said it might not recognize British national passports (abroad) as valid travel documents, as Beijing continues to threaten retaliation for the UK's support for Hong Kong.China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin raised passport questions Thursday in response to a question about the UK's plan to make eligible 3 million Hong Kongers' citizenship feasibled.The Chinese position is that the United Kingdom had broken a promise made before Hong Kong's return to the Chinese government in 1997 not to confer the right of residence on Chinese citizens in Hong Kong who hold passports."Since the British side broke off its commitment first, the Chinese side will consider no longer recognizing such passports as valid travel documents and reserves the right to take further action," Wang said Thursday.While it is likely to intensify diplomatic tensions with the UK, any China's move to invalidate passports is likely to have little practical significance to Hong Kong residents, who usually enter and leave the city with their local identity cards.There are currently 350,000 British national passport holders abroad and they typically use the document to enter countries such as the United Kingdom, Japan or the United States.The decision to recognize this document rests with the country that receives the visitor.The United Kingdom insisted that China should recognize these passports as valid. "These are legitimate international travel documents and that's how they would be expected to be treated," James Slack, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman, told reporters.Original Note:China May to Accept British National Overseas Passports©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: July 24, 2020End of Document

So far, it is Beijing's most vocal defense of the viral video app owned by ByteDance Ltd.President Donald Trump has commented that he is considering blocking the popular video application, while adviser Peter Navarro warned of sanctions for "information war" against the U.S. When asked about the count, foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin accused Washington of unfairly pointing to Chinese companies."Recently, governments and media in some countries have said that the double standard should not be used for social media applications," Wang told reporters in a regular briefing. "China's companies and their products have provided a variety of options for U.S. consumers. We expect the U.S. to pay attention to the voice of the market to provide an open and fair trading environment to foreign countries and stop politicizing economic problems."ByteDance has become the world's largest startup thanks to TikTok's phenomenal success, which U.S. lawmakers say poses a threat to national security by snorting data. They have suggested that TikTok can be used as a tool to spy on users or spread propaganda to influence The November presidential election, which Wang said was "totally unfounded.""China is not interested in the US election," he said Wednesday. "We urge certain people in the U.S. to take a fair and impartial view on this matter, to stop using state power to oppress Chinese companies."Trump has the power to cried out ByteDance's precious asset. The president could add TikTok to the U.S. list of entities, forcing U.S. companies like Google's Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. to remove service from their app stores. The U.S. Foreign Investment Committee, better known as CFIUS, is also reviewing ByteDance's 2017 purchase of the business that became TikTok.ByteDance has taken steps to distance himself from TikTok and shore up relations in Washington, naming Walt Disney Co.'s former executive director, Kevin Mayer, as CEO in May and increasing spending on lobbying. It has also set aside a $200 million fund to help its most popular U.S. users make a career with their participation in the service.Original Note:China Criticizes Trump for 'Double Standards' Over TikTok©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: July 31, 2020End of Document

"I think we, the American people, the American government and American companies, all together, can do it again," he added.Load-Date: July 17, 2020End of Document

China to Canada PM: Stop 'irresponsible remarks' on spy caseAssociated Press InternationalJune 22, 2020 Monday 3:46 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 483 wordsDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) — China told Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday to “stop making irresponsible remarks” after he said Beijing's decision to charge two Canadians with spying was linked to his country's arrest of a Chinese tech executive.The spying charges are “completely different” from the case of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, a foreign ministry spokesman said. Meng was arrested on U.S. charges connected to possible violations of trade sanctions on Iran.Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were detained in what was widely seen as an attempt to Canada after Meng's December 2018 arrest in Vancouver. Charges against them were announced Friday after a Canadian judge ruled Meng's extradition case can proceed to its next stage, moving her closer to being handed over to American authorities.Trudeau, speaking to reporters in Ottawa, said Chinese authorities “directly linked” the cases of Kovrig and Spavor with Meng. He called on Beijing to end their “arbitrary detention.”“There is no such thing as arbitrary detention,” said the ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian.“China urges the relevant Canadian leader to earnestly respect the spirit of the rule of law, respect China’s judicial sovereignty and stop making irresponsible remarks," Zhao said.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday called the charges against Kovrig and Spavor “politically motivated and completely groundless."“The United States stands with Canada in calling on Beijing for the immediate release of the two men and rejects the use of these unjustified detentions to coerce Canada,” Pompeo said in a statement.Trudeau thanked the U.S. and other allies for speaking out against China.“It has been obvious from the beginning that this was a political decision made by the Chinese government and we deplore it,” Trudeau said Monday. "This using of arbitrary detentions as a means to advance political gains is totally unacceptable in a world based on rules.”Meng, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies Ltd. and the daughter of its founder, is accused of lying to banks in Hong Kong about Huawei’s dealings with Iran in possible violation of U.S. sanctions.Meng’s case is a “seriously political incident” and part of U.S. efforts to “suppress Chinese high-tech enterprises and Huawei,” Zhao said. He said Canada “played the role of an accomplice.”“We strongly urge Canada to correct its mistakes as soon as possible, immediately release Meng Wanzhou and ensure her safe return to home,” said Zhao.Meng is living in a mansion she owns in Vancouver, where she reportedly is working on a graduate degree. Kovrig and Spavor are being held at an undisclosed location and have been denied access to lawyers or family members.China has also sentenced two other Canadians to death and suspended imports of Canadian canola.Zhao said visits by foreign diplomats to prisoners were suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic.Load-Date: June 22, 2020End of Document

US orders China to close its consulate in HoustonCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 23, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 332 wordsBodyBEIJING (AP) — The United States ordered China to close its consulate in Houston, exacerbating tensions between the world's two largest economies by increasing President Donald Trump's punitive measures against Beijing ahead of the November US election.The Chinese government said Wednesday that the order was "outrageous" and warned that it will implement a strong response if it is not reversed.The closure of the consulate, one of six China diplomatic missions in the United States, is a drastic step in bilateral relations, which are under intense strain not only because of the coronavirus pandemic, but also by disputes over trade, respect for human rights, the situation in Hong Kong, and Beijing's claims in the South China Sea.The State Department said it ordered the closure of the consulate within 72 hours of claiming that Chinese agents have attempted to steal information from facilities in Texas, including the Texas A&M; medical system; and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.There were indications that consulate staff were preparing to leave: on Tuesday night papers were being burned at their premises, a common practice when a diplomatic mission is to be shut down after a sudden notice. Cai Wei, the Chinese consul general, told Houston's KTRK-TV channel that the order to close was "pretty bad" and was "very damaging" to China-U.S. relations.Asked about accusations of espionage and data theft, Cai replied: "It is necessary to present evidence, to say something from the facts. knowing the Americans, you have the rule of law, you are innocent until you are proven guilty."Morgan Ortagus, a state department spokesman, said the closure was "to protect American intellectual property and Americans' private information.""The United States will not tolerate (China's) violations (of China) of our sovereignty or intimidation of our people, nor have we tolerated (their) unfair trade practices, theft of American jobs, and other heinous behavior," he said.Load-Date: July 24, 2020End of Document

FCC Designates Huawei and ZTE as National Security ThreatsTargeted News ServiceJuly 1, 2020 Wednesday 8:33 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 494 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Federal Communications Commission issued the following news release on June 30:The Federal Communications Commission took a major step in its ongoing efforts to protect U.S. communications networks from security risks. Specifically, the FCC's Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau formally designated two companies--Huawei Technologies Company (Huawei) and ZTE Corporation (ZTE), as well as their parents, affiliates, and subsidiaries--as covered companies for purposes of the agency's November 2019 ban on the use of universal service support to purchase equipment or services from companies posing a national security threat. As a result of today's action, money from the FCC's $8.3 billion a year Universal Service Fund may no longer be used to purchase, obtain, maintain, improve, modify, or otherwise support any equipment or services produced or provided by these suppliers."With today's Orders, and based on the overwhelming weight of evidence, the Bureau has designated Huawei and ZTE as national security risks to America's communications networks--and to our 5G future," said FCC Chairman Ajit Pai. "Both companies have close ties to the Chinese Communist Party and China's military apparatus, and both companies are broadly subject to Chinese law obligating them to cooperate with the country's intelligence services. The Bureau also took into account the findings and actions of Congress, the Executive Branch, the intelligence community, our allies, and communications service providers in other countries. We cannot and will not allow the Chinese Communist Party to exploit network vulnerabilities and compromise our critical communications infrastructure. Today's action will also protect the FCC's Universal Service Fund--money that comes from fees paid by American consumers and businesses on their phone bills--from being used to underwrite these suppliers, which threaten our national security."In November 2019, the Commission unanimously adopted a ban on the use of universal service support to purchase, obtain, or maintain any equipment or services produced or provided by companies posing a national security threat to the integrity of communications networks or the communications supply chain.The Commission proposed that Huawei and ZTE be covered by this rule because of their substantial ties to the Chinese government, Chinese law requiring them to assist in espionage activities, known cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities in their equipment, and ongoing Congressional and Executive Branch concern about this equipment. In the Orders issued today, the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau bases its final designations on the totality of evidence, including evidence supporting the Commission's initial designations and filings submitted in the record by Huawei, ZTE, and other interested parties. The final designations of Huawei and ZTE are effective immediately.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7161325 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 1, 2020End of Document

The diplomacy of the coverCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 2, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 589 wordsBodyThe new coronavirus will accelerate the geopolitical changes that were observed on the chessboard before it hit the world.The extremely visible and therefore dangerous diplomatic confrontation between the United States and China will impact the world and put down hope for a G2 formed by the two superpowers discussed a few years ago. "I think there will be a huge break between the United States and China. Donald Trump will continue to talk about the Chinese virus. Protectionist impulses and anti-Chinese sentiment will increase in the United States and trade will plummet. Conversely, anti-Americanism in China will grow," says Gideon Rachman, international policy analyst at the British newspaper Financial Times (El País Semanal magazine, May 31).Faced with the action of having covered up the magnitude of the impact of the new coronavirus, whose initial epicenter was Wuhan, China has sought to compensate for the negative effects on its image through the diplomacy of the cover.Paul Fraioli, a geopolitics specialist at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, comments: "The Chinese Communist Party has launched a furious campaign to promote its response to the virus, to blame others for the emergency and to promote their delivery of medical equipment to struggling countries" (The Weekly Country).In the face of the countries that have criticized him, the Chinese government has not hidden its teeth. Far behind is the strategy of "hiding our capabilities and waiting for our moment" preached by reformer Deng Xiaoping. Now, there is a group of more combative, nationalistic and braised Chinese diplomats who do not hesitate to respond immediately to their critics.Some examples: Ambassador Cheng Jingye threatened to boycott Australian products because Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government wants an independent investigation into the origin and spread of the pandemic to be pushed. The threat went to reality. China rejected four shipments of meat and imposed tariffs of 80% on Australian barley.In France, as the scourge of the pandemic was growing, a Chinese diplomat accused Macron's government of "letting his elders die."Zhao Lijian, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, has become the strateman who has turned diplomatic communication around. The world met him when he accused the United States of bringing the virus to Wuhan.On the other side are friendsAt least 15 flights from Shanghai loaded with sanitary equipment such as mouth caps, medical tests of the new coronavirus and respirators have landed in Mexico. Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard has posted on his Twitter account the details of each Aeromexico flight returning from China loaded with the material.The bul-cover diplomacy has also been deployed by Xi Jinping's government to Serbia, Italy, Libya, the Philippines and the Czech Republic, among others.International institutions that emerged after World War II, of which the United States were its main drivers, are quarantined. One example is the UN with its low participation in the current crisis.Faced with the desolation generated by this scenario, the world is watching with astonishment at the confrontation between the United States and China.The timing that best represents this confrontation is President Trump's decision last Friday: to leave the World Health Organization for his alleged complicity of this body with the Chinese government. Raising the hypothesis is legitimate, but leaving the body without having the results of the investigation is not serious.Load-Date: June 3, 2020End of Document

WALORSKI CALLS FOR HEARING ON CHINA'S EFFORTS TO HACK CORONAVIRUS VACCINE RESEARCHERSStates News ServiceJuly 31, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 379 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of Indiana Rep. Jackie Walorski:U.S. Rep. Jackie Walorski (R-Ind.) today called for the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis to hold a hearing on China's efforts to hack companies researching and developing a coronavirus vaccine. The U.S. Department of Justice last week announced the indictment of two hackers working with the Chinese government to target intellectual property and confidential business information, including COVID-19 research."Just last week, the Justice Department indicted two Chinese nationals for hacking companies that are working on a vaccine," Congresswoman Walorski said. "We sent a strong message to China: this will not be tolerated. I'm glad the administration took action by naming and shaming those involved, as well as closing down a Chinese consulate that was a hub for intellectual property and trade secret theft. We must hold China accountable, Mr. Chairman. Before I close, can you commit to holding a hearing on the threat of Chinese espionage on vaccine producers?"In today's subcommittee hearing, Walorski also applauded the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed, an initiative to accelerate the development of a safe, effective, affordable, and widely available vaccine. In response to questions from Congresswoman Walorski, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, assured the American people the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will not compromise or eliminate any safety standards in the vaccine approval process."I believe ultimately over a period of time in 2021, if we have and I think we will have a safe and effective vaccine, that Americans will be able to get it," Dr. Fauci said. "The commissioner of the FDA, Dr. Stephen Hahn, has assured me and has spoken publicly that he would make sure any decision on the part of the FDA will be based on sound scientific data proving the safety and the efficacy. Given that, I think the American public should be assured that in the process of determining the safety and efficacy the proper steps have been taken to determine that, and when a vaccine becomes available it's important for their own health and for the health of the country to take that vaccine."Load-Date: July 31, 2020End of Document

Victim or demon? Why in some countries they banned TikTokCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 29, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 972 wordsBodyWhile Facebook and Google compete to design the most effective clone to dethrone TikTok, this Chinese-born social network became an engine of socialization and a cultural model for a whole generation. However, the lack of transparency with which TikTok manages data and its indiscreet algorithm triggered global alarms. This led India and Hong Kong to ban the use of the app. While america put her in the crosshairs and threatens to lower her blind. Is he a demon or a victim of competition?With more than 2 billion downloads and 800 million active users per month, according to Sensor Tower, the app became a favorite of children and teenagers, as there they have their own virtual space, without parental supervision or adults fluttering. Despite her candor and simplicity, several security analysts accuse her of being a data collection service disguised as a social network."Some American companies (e.g. Amazon) and several countries decided to ban TikTok because they consider it to be used as a potential data mining tool. As for the privacy aspect, some researchers highlight the amount of permissions it requires to be able to function. Even when compared to other social networks, the detail of information so that a user can register and share content leads to recommend caution to all those who have installedit", warns Santiago Pontiroli, security analyst of Kaspersky.The great merit of TikTok, of the Chinese company ByteDance, is to be the only Chinese social network that threatens the supremacy of the American giants that lead this market. In recent months, because of the mandatory lockdown, the proposal to record a 15-second video enchanted the younger ones and overshadowed the viral capacity of Instagram and YouTube."One of the big concerns of many governments is that there is an almost massive migration of younger Users from Instagram and Facebook to TikTok. On American platforms, middle-aged and older people are left. This power of attraction of TikTok is thanks to the power of Artificial Intelligence algorithms that are under the control orbit of the Chinese government," warns Gabriel Zurdo, CEO of BTR Consulting.The most serious allegation is that this is a "Chinese spyware". That is, it collects data from the associated devices and dispatches it to its base of operations in Beijing. And while this action can scare off the most in-whole, it is the same thing that Facebook, Google and many other applications that one gives to exploit the data stored on the device, in exchange for free use."Unlike Instagram or Google, which are companies headquartered in the United States, TikTok is a company with Asian roots and was accused of censoring content in line with government ideals, or using information from its users to identify government-interest objectives," Pontiroli said.A team of computer forensics (ProofPoint and Zimperium) reverse engineered the app and found that it collects information about the phone's hardware features, installed applications, networks to which it is connected (4G and Wi-Fi), IP addresses, geolocation via GPS, and GPS pinging every 30 seconds. Also, if the mobile is rooted.Another point that makes it potentially risky is that TikTok videos are based on opaque algorithms that cannot be subjected to expertise. Added to this is China's Cyber Security Act, whoseprovisions are quite confusing, as they do not specify when the authorities can request data on certain users."The app is in the middle of a geopolitical controversy that drags it. There are also a number of issues that are empirical, just being fined in the United States for trafficking and sharing information from minors to third parties. It is similar to FaceApp that analyzes positioning data, the device it uses to connect to, which data server connects to, and the people it talks to. These companies have two monetization lanes: one is the sale of advertising and the other is user data," says Gabriel Zurdo, CEO of BTR Consulting.The United States "declared war on him." Lawmakers in that country have been warning about the security risks involved in the handling of the data that this software performs. On July 20, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to ban the use of TikTok on all government-issued phones.As Trump's presidential campaign began these days, he ran ads on Facebook asking to sign a petition for the exclusion of TikTok,increasing the pressure of the representative on the manufacturer of the app.The Hacking Group Anonymous made a call via Twitter for TikTok users to delete it from their devices, on the grounds that it is a parasitic application. "It's essentially malware operated by the Chinese government that executes a massive espionage operation," they said in a statement.A few days ago this social network was banned in India,its largest market, along with other Chinese applications. The Computer Emergency Response Team of India stated that it had received many "representations from citizens regarding data security and privacy violations affecting public order issues."The Indian Government stressed that "the collection of such data, its extraction and profiling by elements hostile to national security and the country's defence" posed a danger they wanted to curb. Analysts estimate that one in three mobile phones in India (with 1.3 billion inhabitants) had this app installed.In Hong Kong TikTok will also cease to be available after the new wave of movements to control the population and the enactment of a new national security law that could affect this special and semi-autonomous administrative region of China.The problem is that, because it is not available in the Honduran app stores and that ByteDance has no plans to replenish it, there are users who download a Pro version that works despite the restrictions but is actually a hoax.Load-Date: July 30, 2020End of Document

When he was hired last year, the university described him as “a nationally and internally renowned researcher” known as an enthusiastic pioneer in his field.Prosecutors now say Zheng was involved in a “sophisticated medical grant fraud scheme” involving the transfer of research paid for with U.S. grant funds to China. He faces one felony count of fraud or bribery concerning programs receiving federal funds, which carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison, and one count of making false statements when not disclosing his foreign affiliations to authorities, which carries up to five years.Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Preston Deavers ordered Zheng held without bond because he is a flight risk. The case will be presented to a federal grand jury for possible indictment. The investigation is continuing.Federal agents arrested Zheng in Alaska in May, as they say he was attempting to board a private flight headed to China. He initially told investigators he was “going home,” later changing his story to say he only was planning a visit to see his sick father. Documents say he had “three large bags packed for a long, if not permanent, journey,” including one stuffed with two laptop computers, several USB drives and silver bars.“We allege that Zheng was preparing to flee the country after he learned that his employer had begun an administrative process into whether or not he was complying with rules governing taxpayer-funded grants,” U.S. Attorney David M. DeVillers said in a statement.An affidavit filed with the complaint alleges that Zheng has been participating since 2013 in a Chinese Talent Plan, a program established by the Chinese government to recruit those with knowledge or access to foreign technology intellectual property.FBI Cincinnati Special Agent in Charge Chris Hoffman said U.S. taxpayers “are the real victims” when researchers defraud the government on behalf of a rival country."The cutting-edge technologies that are being developed in our country must be carefully protected from our foreign adversaries and the FBI will continue to work with our partners to safeguard these important innovations,” Hoffman said in a statement.Before moving to Ohio, Zheng worked at the University of Southern California and Pennsylvania State University, the complaint said.Ohio State spokesman Ben Johnson said Zheng is currently on unpaid leave and the university has begun the process of terminating him.Load-Date: July 10, 2020End of Document

Twitter suspended a hundred thousand of pro China accountsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 11, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 275 wordsBodyOn Thursday, Twitter announced the removal of hundreds of thousands of accounts linked to a Chinese government-backed influence operation that spread favorable messages to Beijing on a variety of topics, including its management of the coronavirus pandemic.The company suspended a central network of 23,750 highly active accounts, as well as a larger network of about 150,000 "amplifier" accounts that he said were used to increase the content of the central accounts.Twitter said the network had links to a Chinese state-backed operation dismantled last year by the company, Facebook and YouTube that had been driving misleading narratives about political dynamics in Hong Kong.The new operation focused heavily on the protests in Hong Kong, but also promoted messages about the coronavirus pandemic, Chinese billionaire exile Guo Wengui and Taiwan, the associate investigators said.Network activity on coronavirus increased in late January, when the outbreak began to spread beyond China, and soared in late March, praising China's response to the disease. He also used the pandemic to antagonize the United States and activists in Hong Kong,they noted.The U.S. State Department had said in early May that it had found a network of non-authentic Twitter accounts with "highly likely" links to the Chinese Communist Party (PCCh) that were spreading false claims about coronavirus.Twitter, which has its own battle with Donald Trump'sadministration, rejected the State Department's claims at the time and said the 5,000 accounts identified included non-governmental organizations and journalists, and largely did not express support for Chinese positions.Load-Date: June 12, 2020End of Document

Google is wading into a market that China really wants to ownCNN WireJuly 25, 2020 Saturday 00:25Invalid date found for VDI: 1594957039 XCEDOCID: 0 LNI: 60F5-4RK1-JBSS-S03T-00000-00. Date output 'as-is'.GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1411 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Google is teaming up with India's hottest tech company to win over new smartphone users. That should worry the Chinese firms who have long dominated the market in the world's second most populous nation. The Silicon Valley giant announced last week that it is pouring $4.5 billion into Jio Platforms, the mobile carrier-turned-tech juggernaut that has netted a slew of big investors this year. Some of that money will be used to develop a super cheap smartphone tailor-made for the local market --- a device that could help Google and Jio capture some of the half a billion Indians who have yet to own their first smartphone, many in rural communities. While few details are known about the new phone, the deal suggests that Google and Jio could shake up a market where Chinese brands accounted for more than 75% of total sales in the quarter ended in June, according to research firm Canalys. South Korea's Samsung was the No. 3 seller with just under 17%.A cheap, entry-level smartphone from Jio and Google could be bad news for Chinese smartphone makers trying to break through with first-time Indian internet users, according to Kiranjeet Kaur, senior research manager at IDC. "Depending on the product proposition that comes from this Jio-Google partnership, it could potentially pose a challenge," she added.A Jio-branded smartphone could also benefit from rising anti-China sentiment in India. The Indian government recently banned TikTok and dozens of other Chinese apps following deadly border clashes between Chinese and Indian troops, and many Indians have called for boycotts of Chinese products.An untapped marketMuch has been made of India's growing mobile internet market. Roughly 450 million Indians already have smartphones, according to Counterpoint Research. They rely on them to stream content, shop, hail rides and order food. But about 500 million people don't yet own such devices --- and Google and Jio want to give them a cheap way in."They should not be deprived of the benefits of the digital and data revolution," said Mukesh Ambani, the CEO of Jio parent company Reliance Industries and the richest man in Asia, during a company event last week. He said that the goal of the partnership with Google is to design smartphones for a "fraction" of what they currently cost."Jio is a company that's very focused on the rural side, because that's the real India," said Tarun Pathak, associate director at Counterpoint Research. "You have a big funnel [of] users who are yet to come on board and experience and taste this internet for the first time." Most of those people are using feature phones --- old-school mobile devices with numeric key pads and basic screens --- on India's 2G network. Getting them on 4G or 5G smartphones would be a "win-win" for both companies, Pathak said, because Jio can provide new users with data plans, while Google serves them YouTube, search, maps and other apps. Jio already sells cheap 4G feature phones with basic data plans that can access the internet and run stripped down versions of a few apps. But fewer than 20% of India's feature phone users are on Jio devices, according to Pathak. To reach India's huge low-tier market, Counterpoint Research and IDC analysts say the two companies would have to develop a smartphone with an Android-based operating system for less than $50.That could be difficult to achieve. The budget smartphone market in India right now is full of phones that typically sell for $70 to $100. Xiaomi leads that category with 40% of the market, according to IDC, followed by Samsung with 17% and realme with 11%. Kaur noted that costly parts such as memory, chips and display panels typically inflate the price, pushing smartphones above the $50 range. And even a $50 price point is more than most rural Indians can afford, she added. But if Jio and Google can pull it off --- and get those users to stick with them for upgrades --- that could be a big loss for Chinese smartphone makers. Indian foreign policy think tank Gateway House expects the country's smartphone users to double to 900 million by 2025, as income levels rise and smartphones get cheaper. The upside for Google and JioSelling ultra cheap smartphones likely won't make Jio a lot of money. The company will be making razor thin margins on the hardware, or more likely will have to subsidize the cost of the devices by bundling them with other phone and data services. But a successful breakthrough would get millions more Indians onto ecosystems owned and controlled by Jio and Google. Jio already offers a family of apps to watch movies, stream music and shop online. And for Google, "it's less about money, it's more about profiling users," said Pathak. The more users the Silicon Valley firm can add to its Android system, the "more they can sell ads to these users, which is the end goal of the company," he said. Advertising makes up the vast majority of Google parent company Alphabet's revenues, accounting for more than 80% of last year's $162 billion haul.India is also "a dream for any tech company given the diversity," said Blaise Fernandes, director at Gateway House. The potentially huge, diverse datasets Google could harvest from new and existing Indian smartphone users would help it "get better reach, and in return better ad sales and subscription revenues" in India, and "better app efficiencies in other markets," he said.Android already has a lock on the Indian market, accounting for 91% of the mobile operating systems in use there in 2019, according to Statista. But co-designing a smartphone and selling it with a custom-built operating system would give Google the added benefit of more control over the Android experience in India. Xiaomi, Samsung and other smartphone companies usually launch phones with their own user interfaces, building "a local flavor on top" of Android's operating system, Pathak said. (Apple doesn't have this kind of fragmented experience, because iOS is a closed system.) Winning 'brownie points' with IndiaMarket opportunities aside, Jio has also emerged as a homegrown tech champion at an opportune time: Nationalist sentiment in India is on the rise. Canalys reported last week that smartphone sales in India plummeted 50% last quarter, compared to the same period a year earlier. While that drop was largely driven by store shutdowns and the economic battering caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the market research firm pointed out that Chinese smartphone makers have been dealing with more than just fallout from Covid-19."There has been public anger directed towards China," Canalys research analyst Adwait Mardikar wrote in a note. "The combinations of this and the [...] self-sufficient initiatives by the government have pushed Chinese smartphone vendors into the eye of the public storm."Even before the country's recent dispute with China, Prime Minister Modi and his ruling political party "have been pushing 'India first' ideas around tech for several years," said Abishur Prakash, a geopolitical futurist and co-founder of Center for Innovating the Future, a consulting firm that works on technology and geopolitics."Companies like Jio, who are championing homegrown alternatives, are accelerating India's nationalistic moves," he added.In four short months, Jio has secured more than $20 billion in funding from Facebook, Google, Saudia Arabia's Public Investment Fund and other top tier investors. Jio wants to use some of that money to drive India's digital transformation, especially in agriculture, health care and education. Ambani also hopes that the smartphone project with Google will help "accelerate the national mission of putting a smart device in the hands of every Indian."Such moves earn Jio "brownie points from the government," according to Pathak, of Counterpoint Research, who added that a good chunk of Google's investment in Jio will likely be used to buy stakes in a lot of Indian startups. That could potentially push out Chinese investors, who have backed half of India's 30 unicorns and poured some $4 billion into tech startups in the country since 2015, according to Gateway House. Alibaba, for example, has invested in Indian e-commerce company Snapdeal, digital wallet Paytm and food delivery platform Zomato. Tencent, meanwhile, has backed Indian messaging company Hike and ride hailing app Ola. TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

REP. BUCK LEADS LETTER SUPPORTING TIKTOK BAN IN THE U.S.States News ServiceJuly 15, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 800 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of Colorado Rep. Ken Buck:Today, Congressman Ken Buck led 24 of his Republican colleagues in a letter supporting the Trump Administration in its efforts to stop TikTok and other social media apps linked to the Chinese Communist Party from stealing Americans' data and threatening our national security."These popular apps' data collection practices, coupled with China's onerous cybersecurity laws requiring all companies operating in China, including TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to share user data with CCP authorities, present a very real threat to U.S. national security. As such, we urge your administration to take decisive action to protect the American people's privacy and safety," Rep. Buck and co-signers wrote. "It is clear that the United States should not trust TikTok or any other Chinese-affiliated social media websites or apps to protect Americans' data, privacy, or security. As such, we urge you to take strong action to stop the CCP's sophisticated espionage campaign against our country and protect our national security. Thank you in advance for your attention to this important matter."Text of the letter is available HEREThe Honorable Donald J. TrumpPresident of the United StatesThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NWWashington, DC 20502Dear President Trump:We write to support your administration's efforts to restrict TikTok and other social media sites linked to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from accessing U.S. markets. These popular apps' data collection practices, coupled with China's onerous cyber security laws requiring all companies operating in China, including TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to share user data with CCP authorities, present a very real threat to U.S. national security. As such, we urge your administration to take decisive action to protect the American people's privacy and safety.In June, India took the extraordinary step of banning 60 Chinese-affiliated mobile apps, including TikTok, due to national security concerns. However, the CCP's systemic campaign to collect and illicitly transmit user data for the Chinese government's purposes is not unique to Indian consumers. In fact, Chinese authorities currently enjoy relatively unrestricted access to U.S. consumer and government data through the country's advanced data mining policies. As evidence, TikTok's privacy policy for U.S. residents is upfront about the vast quantity of user data it collects and shares with the CCP:"We automatically collect certain information from you when you use the Platform, including internet or other network activity information such as your IP address, geolocation-related data...,unique device identifiers, browser and search history (including content you have viewed in the Platform), and Cookies."Additionally, the company's privacy policy notes that it "also collect[s] information you share with [TikTok] from third-party social network providers, and technical and behavioral information about your use of the Platform." As U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently stated, Americans should only use this app, "if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party."Furthermore, TikTok's censorship of user content to advance the CCP's foreign policy aims is deeply concerning. Leaked documents detail instructions to ban videos on the app that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence, or banned religious groups. Moreover, an Australian Strategic Policy Institute report recently found that ByteDance works closely with the Chinese government to enable human rights abuses against Uighur Muslims by disseminating the CCP's state propaganda. ByteDance is also required under Chinese law to provide seats on the company's board of directors to CCP officials, further cementing the authoritarian government's role in setting these policies.It is clear that the United States should not trust TikTok or any other Chinese-affiliated social media websites or apps to protect Americans' data, privacy, or security.

China to accelerate US agricultural purchases after Hawaii meetingCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 19, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 427 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- China plans to accelerate purchases of U.S. agricultural products to comply with the phase one trade agreement with the United States following talks in Hawaii this week.The world's largest importer of soybeans intends to increase the purchase of all kinds of products, such as soybeans, maize and ethanol, following delayed purchases due to coronavirus disorders, two people familiar with the issue said, who asked that their identity not be disclosed because the information is private.Another person said the Chinese government has asked state agricultural buyers to make every effort to comply with the phase one agreement. No representative of the Ministry of Commerce responded to a fax for comment.The plan gives a respite to markets concerned about trade disruptions after countries exchanged attacks on various issues such as the origin of coronavirus until the new security legislation in Hong Kong. U.S., Euro Stoxx 50, soybeans in Chicago and yuan expanded profits.On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said China's top foreign policy office pledged to meet all of his country's commitments under the trade agreement."During my meeting with PCCh Politburo member Yang Jiechi, the PCCh pledged to complete and honor all Phase 1 obligations of the trade agreement between our two countries," Pompeo said in a tweet Thursday, using the acronym of the Chinese Communist party.Pompeo offered no details beyond tweet, but that was the first significant news of the secret meeting with Yang at Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii on Wednesday. It is not yet clear how the meeting came about or who requested it. Both countries have said that the other party initiated the process.China committed to buy US$36.5 billion agricultural products under the Phase One agreement, up from US$24 billion in 2017, ahead of the trade war.However, China purchased only $4.65 billion in the first four months of the year, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The figure represents only 13% of the target set in the trade agreement and almost 40% lower than purchases in the same period in 2017.China had asked state buyers to suspend some purchases of U.S. agricultural products, including soybeans, Bloomberg News reported earlier this month. However, Chinese importers continued to increase purchases of U.S. soybeans, receiving 2.2 million metric tons of oilseeds in the two-week period ending June 11, according to USDA data.Original Note:China to Accelerate U.S. Farm Purchases After Hawaii Talks (1)©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: June 20, 2020End of Document

The portfolio threatened to retaliate, but did not specify what action it will take.The Chinese embassy in Washington has received "bomb and death threats" due to "defamation and hatred stoked by the U.S. government," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying wrote in a tweet Wednesday."The United States should reverse its wrong decision," he added. "China will surely react with strong countermeasures."Communist Party leaders in Beijing considered closing the U.S. legation in Wuhan in retaliation, he indicated a source with knowledge of the matter.Chinese experts in the United States said Beijing could also choose to target major consulates in Hong Kong, Shanghai or Guangzhou, which could harm U.S. companies.The move comes on the road to November's U.S. presidential election, in which President Donald Trump and his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, have tried to appear as a hardline over China.Over the course of a visit to Denmark, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reiterated accusations about Chinese theft of American and European intellectual property, which he said is costing "hundreds of thousands of jobs."While he did not offer specific details about the Houston consulate, Pompeo on Tuesday referred to a Justice Department indictment against two Chinese citizens for what he called a decade-long cyber espionage campaign targeting defense contractors, COVID-19 investigators and hundreds of other victims around the world."President Trump has said enough. We're not going to let this happen anymore," he said at a news conference. "The actions you are seeing have been taken by President Trump and we will remain committed to this."Ties between the United States and China have become increasingly strained this year on a number of issues: from coronavirus and telecom equipment manufacturer Huawei to Beijing's territorial claims in the South China Sea and its imposition of a new security law in Hong Kong.On Tuesday night in Houston, firefighters went to the consulate after smoke was seen. Two U.S. government officials said they had information that documents were being burned there.

Huawei s terrible weekiCrowdNewswire (English)June 1, 2020 Monday 7:55 PM GMTCopyright 2020 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1126 wordsBodyWhen news broke Friday morning that Britain is looking to propose an alliance of democracies to build a 5G alternative to Huawei, you might think that that was the worst thing to happen to the controversial Chinese telecoms giant this week.

Continue reading Huawei s terrible weekWhen news broke Friday morning that Britain is looking to propose an alliance of democracies to build a 5G alternative to Huawei, you might think that that was the worst thing to happen to the controversial Chinese telecoms giant this week. In fact, it just caps off a series of fast-moving events that surely makes this one of the most decisive weeks yet in the global fight over next-generation 5G networks.So let s go back a step. After all, readers who have been following the Huawei debate might recall that not long ago the UK had controversially agreed to allow Huawei to attain up to 35% market share in  non-core areas  of its 5G network. So what was behind London s sudden about-face?The answer is politics. There was always a loud group of China-skeptic dissenters in Parliament, but anger over China s handling of the novel coronavirus pandemic pushed more MPs from Prime Minister Boris Johnson s own Conservative Party into the anti-Huawei camp and made the government s position untenable. Rather than face a large parliamentary rebellion and possible legislative defeat later this year, Johnson instead gave in and announced plans earlier this week to phase out Huawei s participation in Britain s 5G network by 2023.Now, Johnson seems to be going a step further. Reports indicate that he is seeking to organize fellow G7 countries Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and the United States, as well as Australia, South Korea, and India on the issue. Skeptics of the U.S. campaign against Huawei have long lamented that Washington is asking governments to oppose Huawei without proposing a viable alternative. London s so-called D10 alliance is the first attempt to explicitly try to answer that question.Meanwhile on the legal front, British Columbia s Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that proceedings to extradite Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou to the United States could go ahead. Instead of being released and on her way back to China, Meng, who is the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, is now one step closer to facing trial in the U.S. on fraud charges relating to Huawei s circumvention of U.S. sanctions on Iran.Huawei is used to geopolitical maneuvering, of course. After all, its plans to build an underseas cable last year connecting Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands with high speed internet were preempted when Australia, wary of growing Chinese influence in its South Pacific backyard, offered to pay for it instead.When the Chinese ambassador to Denmark threatened to scuttle a trade deal with the Faroe Islands, a semi-autonomous Danish region, if Denmark didn t choose it for its 5G network, Copenhagen responded by issuing tough new security requirements that Huawei has said would give it no choice but to leave the country entirely. And as I wrote in March, the question of Huawei has been increasingly debated at the highest levels of government around the world.Yet, this week does seem to mark a dramatic turning point in the global 5G battle.First, even limited access to the UK market had been a coup for Huawei. With its well-regarded Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre, Britain s seal of approval was a valuable signal to other governments on the fence about whether or not Huawei is worth the security risk. For Britain to not only reverse itself but then take the lead on coordinating an international alternative just a few days later marks a remarkable course correction.A former British diplomat told me in March that the West s lack of cooperation on the issue was  a striking failure  of political coordination. That s certainly not the case anymore   and as other NATO, EU, and Five Eye intelligence allies consider whether or not to permit Huawei themselves, the existence of a democratic anti-Huawei consortium (should it truly develop) would make it that much harder for them to justify going against the U.S.Second, the Meng case might be soundly based in international law, but to paraphrase Clausewitz: it s international relations by other means. After all, U.S. investigators, concerned that Huawei was acting as an arm of the Chinese government, had been looking for an excuse to file charges against the company for years. Fittingly enough, the charges against Meng were linked to an unrelated geopolitical issue: violating U.S. sanctions on Iran.A defeat for the U.S. in the British Columbia Supreme Court would have struck a blow to the U.S. government s attempts to extend its legal reach around the globe. Instead, its victory solidifies an already escalating global sanctions regime that is proving devastating for any company caught in its dragnet. As if the Meng case weren t enough, TSMC, one of the world s largest semiconductors contractors, also announced that it would no longer sell to Huawei in order to comply with new US export controls.The question is thus: if this does mark a turning point in the US-China global tech rivalry, what will the next stage look like?Given its history, there s not much suspense in what the Trump administration will likely do next. Certainly it will keep pursuing Huawei s Meng in court. And count on a new round of pressure in Europe as the EU deadline for members to stake out their 5G security protocols fast approaches this summer. But America s 5G diplomatic push has been seen as tone deaf in European capitals   now that Britain is onside, Washington would be smart to let London take the lead.How China responds is the more important question. Its continued strong and vocal support for Huawei should be assumed, but what form will it take? Huawei s conciliatory approach in the UK has now clearly failed. But so too did its attempts to strong-arm Denmark. Will the gloves now come off? Or will Beijing be forced to distance itself from its national champion for Huawei s own good?Huawei has tried to have it both ways, benefiting from the support it draws from the Chinese government while assuring foreign governments of its independence at the same time. But as global public opinion harden against Beijing in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and Western nations take stronger actions against his company, Huawei CEO Ren might consider just how hazardous being yoked to a superpower can be.See Campaign:https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/downing-street-plans-new-5g-club-of-democracies-bfnd5wj57Contact Information:Scott BadeTags:, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: June 1, 2020End of Document

US Indicts Hackers Working With China To Steal COVID-19 Vaccines, TreatmentsThe FrontrunnerJuly 22, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 317 wordsBodyThe AP (7/21, Tucker) reports that the Justice Department on Tuesday unveiled an indictment charging "hackers working with the Chinese government" with having "targeted firms developing vaccines for the coronavirus and stole[n] hundreds of millions of dollars worth of intellectual property and trade secrets from companies across the world." The two defendants "are not in custody, and federal officials conceded Tuesday that they were not likely to step foot in an American courtroom." The indictment also did not say whether the hackers succeeded in obtaining "any COVID-19 research." The CBS Evening News (7/21, story 4, 1:35, O'Donnell, 4.49M), however, said the "breaches could potentially slow down critical research."NBC Nightly News (7/21, story 5, 1:30, Holt, 6.23M) reported that "less than a week after Novavax, a Maryland biotech firm, announced that it was researching a potential COVID vaccine, the FBI says, a computer hacker in China, Li Xiaoyu, searched for ways to hack into its computers. Now, he and a former college classmate are wanted men, charged by federal prosecutors with trying to hack into three other US companies working on COVID treatments and testing."Japan Helps 87 Companies To "Exit China" To End Overreliance.The Washington Post (7/21, Denyer, 14.2M) reports Japan is "paying 87 companies to shift production back home or into Southeast Asia after the coronavirus pandemic disrupted supply chains and exposed an overreliance on Chinese manufacturing." In March, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe "said the government wanted to bring production back home and diversify into Southeast Asia." He "has now announced a list of companies that will benefit from the first round of subsidies, with 57 companies receiving a total of $535 million to open factories inside Japan and another 30 paid to expand production in Vietnam, Myanmar, Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries."Load-Date: July 22, 2020End of Document

Justice Department: Researcher Pleaded Guilty to Conspiring to Steal Scientific Trade Secrets From Ohio Children's HospitalTargeted News ServiceJuly 31, 2020 Friday 9:47 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 693 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Department of Justice issued the following news release on July 30:Former Ohio woman Li Chen, 46, pleaded guilty today via video conference in U.S. District Court today to conspiring to steal scientific trade secrets and conspiring to commit wire fraud concerning the research, identification and treatment of a range of pediatric medical conditions."Once again we see the People's Republic of China (PRC) facilitating the theft of our nation's ingenuity and hard work as part of their quest to rob, replicate and replace any product they don't have the ability to develop themselves," said John C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security. "Far from being an isolated incident, we see the PRC implicated in around 60 percent of all trade secret theft cases. This continued economic belligerence runs contrary to the values and norms that facilitate the success of our industries and countering it remains among our highest priorities.""Nationwide Children's Hospital's Research Institute took reasonable measures to protect its cutting-edge intellectual property and trade secrets regarding exosomes, and I commend the cooperation of Nationwide Children's throughout this investigation," U.S. Attorney David M. DeVillers said. "Chen betrayed her employer of 10 years by stealing trade secrets from this American institution and transferring them to China after receiving payments from the Chinese government.""Li Chen was a trusted researcher at Nationwide Children's Hospital, conducting cutting-edge U.S. government-funded research," stated FBI Cincinnati Special Agent in Charge Chris Hoffman. "With her guilty plea, she admits that she abused this trust to establish a company in China for her own financial gain. The FBI is committed to working closely with partners such as Nationwide Children's Hospital to protect the innovations that make America a world leader in science and technology."Chen admitted to stealing scientific trade secrets related to exosomes and exosome isolation from Nationwide Children's Hospital's Research Institute for her own personal financial gain.Chen and her husband, alleged co-conspirator Yu Zhou, 49, worked in separate medical research labs at the Research Institute for 10 years each (Zhou from 2007 until 2017 and Chen from 2008 until 2018). They are charged with conspiring to steal at least five trade secrets related to exosome research from Nationwide Children's Hospital.Exosomes play a key role in the research, identification and treatment of a range of medical conditions, including necrotizing enterocolitis (a condition found in premature babies), liver fibrosis and liver cancer.According to her plea agreement, Chen conspired to steal and then monetize one of the trade secrets by creating and selling exosome "isolation kits." Chen admitted to starting a company in China to sell the kits. Chen received benefits from the Chinese government, including the State Administration of Foreign Expert Affairs and the National Natural Science Foundation of China. Chen also applied to multiple Chinese government talent plans, a method used by China to transfer foreign research and technology to the Chinese government.As part of her plea, Chen has agreed to forfeit approximately $1.4 million, 500,000 shares of common stock of Avalon GloboCare Corp. and 400 shares of common stock of GenExosome Technologies Inc.Chen and Zhou were arrested in California in July 2019 and their case was unsealed in August 2019 when they appeared in federal court in Columbus.John C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security;David M. DeVillers, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio; and Chris Hoffman, Special Agent in Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cincinnati Division, announced the plea entered into today before U.S. District Judge Sarah D. Morrison. Assistant U.S. Attorneys S. Courter Shimeall, Peter K. Glenn-Applegate, Special Assistant U.S. Attorney J. Michael Marous and National Security Division Trial Attorney Matthew J. McKenzie, are representing the United States in this case.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7194290 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 31, 2020End of Document

Sen. Wyden Issues Statement at Finance Committee Hearing on President Trump 2020 Trade Policy AgendaTargeted News ServiceJune 18, 2020 Thursday 7:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 792 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, ranking Democratic member of the Senate Finance Committee, issued the following statement at a hearing on President Trump's 2020 trade policy agenda on June 17:This is our fourth annual hearing on the Trump trade agenda, which means it's the fourth time the committee will hear a familiar old routine about Trump getting tough on China and protecting American jobs everywhere - the president cracking down once and for all, big changes right around the corner, an American economy on the brink of transformation. It's been three and a half years of those big promises. What are the results?The Phase One deal the president called "the biggest deal there is anywhere in the world by far..." is already coming apart, with China falling behind on commitments.According to an analysis by the Peterson Institute looking at the first four months of the deal, China's purchases of U.S. manufactured goods were at 56 percent of the target level set by the Phase One deal. China's purchases of U.S. agricultural goods were at 38 percent.The president said he'd stop the overproduction of steel in China that has wiped out so many steel jobs here in the U.S. But mills in China are producing steel at record levels - up 6.6 percent in 2018 and 8.3 percent in 2019.The president said he'd fix the most damaging rip offs that target American innovation and jobs. But when it comes to IP theft or forced technology transfers, the Phase One deal recycled existing law and repeated the same promises China has broken many times before.According to the Economic Policy Institute, the U.S. has lost 3.7 million jobs to China in the last two decades - three quarters of them in manufacturing. Donald Trump has not meaningfully changed any of the conditions that allowed that to happen.Bottom line, the status quo under this president is good for China, and the Chinese government is reportedly interested in maintaining it.Now let's turn to the new NAFTA. Ambassador Lighthizer and I long agreed that NAFTA needed a major overhaul. It wasn't built for a digital economy, and it wasn't strong enough on enforcement to protect American workers. When the Trump administration first brought its renegotiated deal to the Congress, it made progress on digital trade, but it didn't go nearly far enough to protect family-wage jobs and workers with tough rules on labor and environmental protection. In fact, the old, broken down system of enforcement from the old NAFTA was still a part of the Trump administration's new NAFTA. That meant that all of the president's boasting about getting a great deal for workers was more of the same old happy talk on trade.Democrats in the Senate and the House said that was unacceptable and got down to work improving those areas where the administration's deal fell short. Senator Brown and I worked with our colleagues to develop a faster, more aggressive approach to labor enforcement so that American workers won't have to spend years waiting for action against trade cheats. Ambassador Lighthizer helped us get it done, and now the deal is set to go into effect in two weeks.But the start of the new deal means the work is just getting started. Most critically, I have major concerns about Mexico's ability to stay on track with implementing the labor obligations, and with our ability to monitor and enforce them. The administration absolutely must hit the ground running on enforcement on day one.There are a few other areas where American businesses, producers and workers need more information and more certainty as the agreement goes into effect. Our dairy farmers need to know that their products won't face unfair discrimination by Canada and Mexico. American innovators need assurances that Mexico will make changes it promised to its intellectual property laws. Finally, American automakers need to know how USTR and the Department of Labor will apply the auto "rules of origin," which impact their supply chains and their ability to qualify for tariff benefits.The reality is, the new NAFTA made real progress on several key issues, and that's why it got overwhelming support from this committee and the Senate. That progress can be undone if the administration fails to enforce the deal - particularly using the enforcement tools the Congress created to protect American jobs. This committee will keep a close watch on these issues in the weeks and months ahead.With that, let me thank Ambassador Lighthizer for joining the committee today. I know I'm not the only Democrat on this committee who's grateful for his outreach and all his work on a bipartisan basis over the last few years. Questions and answers with Bob Lighthizer are never dull.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7146483 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: June 18, 2020End of Document

Security law could hurt Hong Kong as a global business hubCNN WireJuly 2, 2020 Thursday 10:13 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1536 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  China's imposition of its sweeping national security law on Hong Kong has already divided the business community. Now executives are anxiously waiting to see whether its implementation will undermine the city's role as a global finance and trading hub.Hong Kong's government insists the law will be good for stability and prosperity, and won't harm the political freedoms and judicial autonomy the city was guaranteed for half a century when the United Kingdom handed it back to China exactly 23 years ago. But no draft was made public ahead of its approval by Beijing's top lawmaking body on Tuesday. The law was finally published at 11 p.m. local time (11 a.m. ET) as it went into effect.It criminalizes offenses such as secession and subversion against the central Chinese government, and its passage has already prompted some opposition groups in Hong Kong to disband. It has caused outcry in the West, where politicians and democracy activists have criticized it as damaging to Hong Kong's semi-autonomous status.Some high profile businesses with deep roots in Hong Kong, such as HSBC, Standard Chartered, Swire (Cathay Pacific's major shareholder) and Jardine Matheson have previously voiced support for the legislation. "In general, the business community wants the rule of law and they want a stable business environment," said Simon Lee, a senior lecturer of finance at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. "As long as this national security law can provide stability for business operations, it is quite okay for them."Hong Kong authorities have also tried to soothe fears about how it could affect the city's global reputation. The financial sector has "commonly" said the law "will help Hong Kong restore stability and order," wrote Financial Secretary Paul Chan in a blog post Sunday. The city was rocked last year by months of pro-democracy protests.But many other international companies, and some local entrepreneurs, are very nervous. Gordon Lam, a 35-year-old businessman who owns bars and restaurants in Hong Kong, told CNN that the law is China's most serious assault on the city's freedoms."As the Hong Kong national security law comes into effect, many business owners in the catering sector are afraid whether we will be penalized for speaking our mind," said the pro-democracy businessman, who leads the Hong Kong Small and Medium Restaurant Federation.When the law was first announced in May, the city's benchmark Hang Seng Index slumped --- though it has stabilized since. And more than 80% of firms that responded to a survey conducted by the American Chamber of Commerce in early June said they were either "very" or "moderately" concerned about the law and felt pessimistic about Hong Kong's future.Some expressed fears that it could lead to "potential harassment and privacy concerns," or that more restrictive measures could be on the way. Others were concerned about the law's ambiguity and the erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy, a loss of talented employees or status as an international business center. American companies also fear that an escalation in US-China relations could hamper cross border deals.More than 50 out of the 180 respondents to the survey said they were considering moving capital, assets or business operations to "other locations."On Thursday, the American Chamber of Commerce said in a statement that it remains committed to Hong Kong as a "home base for international business.""It will take time for the business community to digest details of the law, but we hope it will not impact the dynamism and benefits of this great city, which continues to serve as an important gateway between East and West," the organization said, adding that it is seeking further clarity on how the law will be interpreted and implemented.Will the US punish Hong Kong? The United States has already warned that it is looking at Hong Kong differently than it has in the past. Washington has previously said it would unravel a special trading relationship with Hong Kong, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this week that the United States would end exports of US-origin defense equipment to the city.The special arrangement between Hong Kong and the United States has its benefits, such as allowing Hong Kong to avoid tariffs that Washington imposed on Chinese goods as part of the US-China trade war. The value of the trading relationship between the two, though, is trivial compared to the direct relationship between the United States and mainland China. Hong Kong's real advantage, however, is the opportunity it has afforded foreign firms to operate without restrictions encountered elsewhere in China. Beijing regulates everything about how a foreign company does business in the mainland, from how much capital they can invest there to how large of an ownership stake they can hold in their own business ventures.Unraveling that relationship between Hong Kong and the West would be complicated, given how closely the two are intertwined. Citi analysts have said that more than 1,300 US companies alone operate in the city, for example. And analysts from Eurasia Group warned recently that any redefinition of Washington's ties with the city would "touch on complicated issues of regulatory cooperation, tax treatment, and legal cooperation."Change in those areas would not "unfold quickly," the Eurasia Group analysts wrote in May, adding that President Donald Trump was unlikely to immediately sanction Hong Kong in a way that hurts its financial stability, such as making it harder for Hong Kong authorities to clear US dollar transactions. Washington's response this week on defense exports is "not entirely surprising," wrote economists at Citi in a research note Tuesday. And even if Washington were to revoke the special status it has given Hong Kong, that may not "materially affect" the city economically --- "though we need to watch out for potential US sanctions on high-level individuals and secondary sanctions on financial institutions," the economists added.Nick Marro, global trade lead at the Economist Intelligence Unit, wrote Wednesday that the new national security law "might have somewhat of a chilling effect on international business sentiment, which could make it more difficult to attract overseas capital and talent to the region."Any US sanctions might be targeted at Chinese individuals and entities, but that could still raise "uncertainty around doing business in Hong Kong, undermining near-term economic prospects," Marro added.Few alternatives For those companies already considering moving operations or people out of Hong Kong there aren't very many good alternatives.Singapore is the only other hub in the region that even comes close, analysts have told CNN Business given its status as a major financial center in Asia that has a convertible currency and favorable regulatory environment. The city-state also is only a few hours flying distance from many of the region's most important players, giving it a leg up over cities like Sydney. There are some concerns, though, including a controversial fake news law introduced by the Singaporean government last year that critics said was leading to increased censorship and official overreach.And regardless of Singapore's financial prowess, analysts still stressed that Hong Kong holds an edge.Some foreign companies might be comfortable operating under Chinese law in the end, Brock Silvers, chief investment officer for Hong Kong-based Adamas Asset Management, told CNN Business last month, especially if their business is "significantly China focused, or reliant on government good will."A Chinese makeover For Chinese firms, meanwhile, Hong Kong is becoming more attractive, not less.Some companies that trade publicly in New York, for example, have expressed unease that the United States is becoming more hostile for them as regulators and lawmakers consider rules that would lead to harsher scrutiny. Some restrictions could even make it tougher for companies to go public or keep trading in New York.Those concerns have already been cited by companies such as NetEase and JD.com, both of which completed secondary listings in Hong Kong in June. "China's tech giants see Hong Kong as middle ground," said Silvers. He pointed out that the city is "under Chinese control, but still with US dollar access." Hong Kong allows capital to flow more freely than mainland China, and the city's currency is also freely convertible.Analysts at Jefferies suggested earlier this year that the Hang Seng Index will eventually have a "complete makeover" as more Chinese internet companies list in Hong Kong, edging out more city-centric stocks, such as banks and property firms.In a research note, Jefferies analysts said the Dow Jones Industrial Average has outperformed the Hang Seng because of its willingness to replace "stagnant" companies with "successful, high-growth" ones."We believe the [Hang Seng] will undergo a similar change over the next few years, and will become an index that reflects mainly the growth of new economy companies in China," they wrote at the time.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Carlos Fazio /III: Capitalism of SurveillanceCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 29, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 805 wordsBody       Difuminada at the juncture by the media apocalypse unleashed by America's plutocratic elites and factual powers as a result of the emergence of Covid-19, the trade and financial war between the governments of Donald Trump and Xi Jinping will deepen the post-pandemia race for hegemony, at a time when, to paraphrase Clausewitz, technology is the continuation of politics by other means.In 2016, a report by Barack Obama on the future of artificial intelligence (AI) recognized that his successor would rule a country that is being transformed by AI. Although Trump partially abandoned that vision, the United States remains a leader in AI thanks to leading digitization companies known through the acronym Gafa (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon), but the breakpoint is becoming data access control, as major platforms subject their users to non-standardized, outdated monitoring processes with AI speed.AI engineers need data (raw material) to create their algorithms and/or refine them. And while the US has collected the most data, starting with Xi Jinping's 13th Five-Year National Computerization Plan (2016-20), China has exponentially increased its capabilities through the Internet of Things, machine learning, and the number of users of its innovative companies supported by new technologies (startups).The Chinese government has made strong investments in research and development, subsidizes the processing chip industry, and has more lax regulation in automation and mass data collection technologies. Thus emerged commercial private Internet conglomerates such as Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent (known under the acronym Bat), which in the face of the race for AI have technologically reached the American corporations of the sector.And as in its origins with the Silicon Valley Goggles, pioneers of digital capitalism thanks to Keynesian military investment programs, which after September 11, 2001 – in connection with the national security state of the Bush Jr. administration – developed the huge state surveillance and control apparatus revealed in 2013 by former CIA and NSA contractor Edward Snowden , the Chinese government's support has been key in the development of Baidu as the base AI platform for autonomous vehicles, Alibaba for smart cities and Tencent for health care.Alibaba, considered the Chinese Amazon, developed a private social credit scoring system, which aims to collect and store all the traces that users leave on the Internet and regulate each person's behavior on access to credit, formal education and the labour market, including the use of commercial airlines and high-speed trains. The company implemented the City Brain project to connect maps, surveillance cameras, sensors, government data and information shared on social media through software, which process AI algorithms into supercomputers that serve as food for urban planning and traffic management in cities such as Hangzhou and Macau.Baidu's cooperation with the Chinese authorities also revolves around data control and cybersecurity. The corporation has equipped public space hotspots with cameras that feature sophisticated facial recognition software that can also identify people hooded by the way they walk. Tencent, the third member of the Bat, also exploits facial recognition and video surveillance patents. Ergo, the capitalism of surveillance.In the post-pandemia of Covid-19, the political, commercial andtechnology between the US and China will heat up. After Trump launched his decoupling (disconnect) strategy to contain China's economic growth, Xi called for an emphasis on domestic market development, not exports. Although outdoors, through Alibaba, Chinese soft power will increase its rail, port and digital infrastructure (fiber optics, telecommunications antennas, 5G) in its area of influence: Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore, and eventually Bangladesh and Pakistan. Even in Africa.It is in that context that Xi's speeches from May 26 to the Central Military Commission (the Chinese version of the Pentagon) and Trump's at the West Point military academy must be placed on June 13. Xi ordered the military to think of the worst-case scenario to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests. Trump hinted at doctrinal changes to a conflict with China to maintain global hegemony.US hegemony is based on the dominance of sea routes and their technological superiority. According to Pentagon sources cited by the English newspaper The Times, based on mock war games, in 2030 the US would lose a naval war with China in the Pacific. The analysis concludes that all US bases in the Indo-Pacific Command region would be overwhelmed by Chinese medium-range ballistic missiles, including Guam Island, the main base of the B-2 strategic bombers. The geopolitical dispute is in full swing.Load-Date: June 30, 2020End of Document

China sees European strain of coronavirus in Beijing, WHO says more studies are neededCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 19, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 511 wordsBodyBy Roxanne Liu and Stephanie NebehayPEKON/GENEVA, 19 Jun (Reuters) - China said Friday that identified a European strain of coronavirus that had caused the recent Beijing outbreak, while the World Health Organization said it had only been imported from outside the city and more research was needed.China has published data on the sequencing of the coronavirus genome from samples taken in Beijing, and authorities said they have identified a European strain based on preliminary studies. Some 183 people have been infected in the resurgence that began eight days ago and is linked to the giant wholesale food market in Xinfadi, in Beijing."Strains and viruses are moving around the world," WHO's top emergency expert Mike Ryan said at a press conference in Geneva. "I don't think it's indicating that Europe is the source of the disease at all. What he's saying is that it's very likely that the disease has been imported from outside Beijing at some point."It was crucial to establish when the virus arrived in Beijing, how many people got infected along the way, and what factors amplified its spread, Ryan said. But it was "reassuring" that the virus appeared to be of human origin and had not jumped the species barrier again, he added.China has been under pressure to make public data as COVID-19 cases accumulate in the capital.Washington blamed the Chinese government for moving too slowly to contain the initial outbreak. Meanwhile, Beijing says he wasted no time publishing information, including the genome sequence of the first outbreak in Wuhan.The latest genome sequence was published Thursday night and was also shared with WHO and the Global Influenza Data Initiative (GISAID), the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said.The sequencing of the virus genome is a vital and rapidly developing tool in the diagnosis of COVID-19 and in understanding the spread and control of the new coronavirus.Details published on the website of China's National Microbiology Data Center reveal that genome data are based on three samples—two human and one environmental—collected on June 11. That was the same day Beijing reported its first new local COVID-19 infection in months."According to the preliminary results of a genomic and epidemiological study, the virus is from Europe, but it is different from the virus currently spreading in Europe," said Zhang Yong of the Chinese CDC in a paper published Friday. "It is older than the virus currently spreading in Europe."Wu Zunyou, the CDC's leading epidemiology expert, had told state media earlier this week that the Beijing strain was similar to that of Europe, although not necessarily transmitted directly from European countries. Wu did not elaborate on those comments made before the release of the genome sequence.The coronavirus strains found in the United States and Russia were mostly from Europe, according to Wu.(Report of Ryan Woo, Roxanne Liu, Lusha Zhang, Se Young Lee and Guijuan Qu in Beijing and Stephanie Nebehay in Geneva, Edited in Spanish by Tomas Cobos and Manuel Farías)Load-Date: June 20, 2020End of Document

US TREASURY TO RECOMMEND OPTIONS TO TRUMP ABOUT TIK TOKStates News ServiceJuly 29, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 304 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):The Chinese-owned app TikTok is under a security review by the U.S. government, which will make a recommendation on the matter to President Donald Trump next week, according to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.Trump said Wednesday, "we are thinking about making a decision" about TikTok.The video-sharing social media app, is extremely popular in both the US. and around the world. It has already been downloaded 2 billion times worldwide and 165 million of those downloads were in the U.S.The app features not only entertainment videos, but also debates and takes positions on political issues, such as racial justice and the upcoming U.S. presidential election.TikTok to Exit Hong Kong Market Over New National Security LawDecision by Chinese-based app follows decisions by Facebook, Google and Twitter to briefly suspend review of Beijing requests for user data in semi-autonomous cityU.S. officials are concerned that TikTok may pose a security threat, fearing that the company might share its user data with China's government. However, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, has said it does not share user data with the Chinese government and maintains that it only stores U.S. user data in the U.S. and Singapore. TikTok also recently chose former Disney executive Kevin Mayer as its chief executive in a move seen as an effort to distance itself from Beijing.Mnuchin said that the U.S. government's Committee on Foreign Investment (CFIUS), an interagency group led by the Treasury Department, will be looking into TikTok. CFIUS' job is to oversee foreign investments and assess them for potential national security risks.CFIUS has the ability to force companies to cancel deals or put in place other measures it deems necessary for national security.Load-Date: July 29, 2020End of Document

Theft, censorship and the 'emperors of the online economy': Tech CEOs go on defensePolitico.comJuly 29, 2020 Wednesday 5:28 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: CONGRESSLength: 5909 wordsHighlight: Lawmakers hammered the chief executives of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon - and unleashed a host of documents on alleged antitrust abuses.BodyFour of the nation's most powerful CEOs beamed into a Capitol Hill hearing Wednesday and raised their hands to swear to tell the truth as they faced a barrage of questions on one major issue: Are their companies too big and powerful for America's good?Members of the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee came at them with a wealth of newly released documents that could pose problems for the tech giants as they confront investigations around the globe.Lawmakers hammered Google Sundar Pichai about his company's relations with China and whether it steals ideas from other businesses, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg about a blizzard of disinformation plaguing his social network, and Apple CEO Tim Cook on whether his iPhone-maker strong-arms developers on its App Store.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos - the world's richest man, making his long-awaited first-ever appearance before a congressional hearing - faced no questions at all for nearly two hours, before offering an inconclusive answer on whether the company uses data to undermine its third-party merchants. Amazon is still facing allegations that one of its executives misled Congress about that same issue last year.The virtual testimony comes at a time of rising legal jeopardy for the major tech companies, who are the subject of antitrust and consumer-protection probes in Washington, multiple U.S. states and Europe.Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.) set the tone early, with an opening statement vowing to check the power of the "emperors of the online economy." But so did Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the full Judiciary panel, who laid out a long series of alleged slights against conservatives by top social media companies - and later got into a shouting match after a Democrat accused him of promoting "fringe conspiracy theories."See live highlights from the hearing below.6:30 P.M.Amazon seller fees increasing because of greater use of services, Bezos saysAmazon is making more money from sellers fees because more third-party sellers are using its services, CEO Jeff Bezos told lawmakers, countering the idea that his company is unfairly profiting from the merchants.But the Amazon CEO acknowledged that the marketplace algorithm may "indirectly" favor those who pay the company to fulfill orders.Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-Pa.) cited a new report by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance that found Amazon brought in nearly $60 billion from seller fees last year - 21 percent of Amazon's total revenue - and that the e-commerce giant keeps about 30 percent of each sale. That amount is up from 19 percent of each sale five years ago.Bezos said the increased amount is because sellers are spending more money with Amazon by using additional services such as Fulfillment by Amazon, where the company stores and ships products on behalf of third-party sellers."When you see these fees going up, sellers are choosing to use more of our services we make available," he said. "Previously they were shipping their own products from their own fulfillment centers so they would have had costs doing that. ... Now they are doing that through Fulfilment by Amazon."Bezos also acknowledged that the Buy Box - which preselects the seller for when a user clicks on a product - "indirectly" favors sellers who use the Fulfilled by Amazon services."Indirectly, I think the Buy Box does favor products that can be shipped with Prime," he said. "The Buy Box is trying to pick the offer that we predict the customer would most like. That includes price, that includes delivery speed, and if you're a Prime member, it includes whether the item is eligible for Prime."In response to questions from Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Ill.) about stolen and counterfeit goods, Bezos said he believes that Amazon requires sellers to provide a real name and address, but wasn't sure whether a phone number is required. He also said he didn't know how many resources Amazon devotes to seller verification.6:04 P.M.Jeff Bezos: Social media a 'nuance destruction machine'Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos took a rare swipe against a core feature of his Silicon Valley competitors late in today's hearing, singling out social media as destructive for free expression."What I find a little discouraging is that it appears to me that social media is a 'nuance destruction machine,'" Bezos said. "And I don't think that's helpful for a democracy."Bezos offered his critique while testifying by videoconference, alongside the head of social media giant Facebook.He was responding to House Judiciary ranking member Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who was invoking the idea of "cancel culture" and the notion of online mobs that shout down unfashionable opinions. The lawmaker was assessing whether lawmakers were concerned about the polarizing idea, which some question as overblown."I am concerned in general about that," Bezos told Jordan.Other tech CEOs also appeared sympathetic to Jordan's cancel culture worries.Apple CEO Tim Cook noted he wasn't "all the way up to speed" on the idea but expressed concern: "If you're about where somebody with a different point of view talks, and they're 'canceled,' I don't think that's good. I think it's good for people to hear from different points of view and decide for themselves.""I'm very worried about some of the forces of illiberalism that I see in this country that are pushing against free expression," Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Jordan, without identifying specifics.Google CEO Sundar Pichai simply noted the interest in building platforms to allow freedom of expression. - John Hendel5:41 P.M.Tech CEOs demur on China, except Facebook's ZuckerbergThe Chinese government steals U.S. technologies, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said - making him the only one of the four tech CEOs willing to say that plainly in response to a question from Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.)."I think it's well-documented that the Chinese government steals technology from American companies," Zuckerberg said.Apple CEO Tim Cook said he had no personal knowledge about Chinese technology theft.Google CEO Sundar Pichai initially followed Cook's line, but later corrected the record to confirm that in 2009 China stole Google information in a "well-publicized" cyberattack.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who answered last, acknowledged that he had read "many reports" about technology theft by Beijing, but had no first-hand experience beyond knock-off products sold on Amazon.All four CEOs passed on the opportunity to suggest how Congress could better help defend U.S. companies abroad, against either technology theft or excessive regulation.- Leah Nylen and Ryan Heath5:22 p.m. Cicilline to Zuckerberg: 'You can't contain deadly content' Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who heads the House's probe into tech giants, accused Facebook of tolerating a fountain of misinformation that benefits the company's engagement-driven business model - even on topics as deadly as the coronavirus. "There's no competition forcing you to police your own platform," the House antitrust subcommittee chairman told CEO Mark Zuckerberg. "During the greatest public health crisis of our lifetime, don't you agree that these articles viewed by millions on your platform will cost lives?"The lawmaker cited articles that drew millions of views on sites like Facebook while making claims about Covid-19, including those describing President Donald Trump's musings about placing disinfectants inside the body or allegations that coronavirus "hype" is a political hoax. Cicilline said Facebook allows such content to reap advertising dollars. But Zuckerberg countered that this kind of noxious material is not "helpful for our business.""It is not what people want to see, and we rank what we show in Feed based on what is going to be most meaningful to people and what is going to create long-term satisfaction," Zuckerberg said.Zuckerberg defended Facebook's policy of taking down bogus information that could cause imminent harm and its attempt to highlight authoritative guidance. But Cicilline brought up a Monday video from the conservative website Breitbart, which dismissed the necessity of masks and called hydroxychloroquine a Covid-19 cure - and which experienced soaring Facebook traffic over several hours before Facebook removed it. "A lot of people shared that," Zuckerberg said. "And we did take it down because it violates our policies.""After 20 million people saw it after a period of five hours?" Cicilline countered. "Doesn't that suggest, Mr. Zuckerberg, that your platform is so big that even with the right policies in place, you can't contain deadly content?" - John Hendel4:57 P.M.Cook: Apple wasn't trying to protect its own app when it removed competitorsApple didn't consider the impact on its own parental control app when it removed some of the most popular apps that limit screentime from its App Store, CEO Tim Cook told lawmakers.Apple introduced its own Screen Time app, which allows parents to limit how much time kids spend on their phones, in September 2018. After that, the company removed a number of competing apps. Qustodio and Kidslox, two of the leading parental control apps, have filed a complaint with the European Commission about their removal.Cook said Apple removed the apps because of privacy concerns."We were worried about the safety of kids," Cook said in response to questions by Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.).Demings asked Cook why the company removed many of the most popular screentime apps but not Absher, an app created by the Saudi Arabian government that uses the same technology. "It sounds like you applied different rules to the same apps," Demings said.Cook said he wasn't familiar with Absher, but said the App Store has about 30 parental control apps after it changed its policy last year. Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Ga.), who returned to the issue later in the hearing, noted that Apple eventually allowed the apps back into the App Store after six months without requiring major changes."We apply the rules to all developers equally," Cook said. "I see Screen Time as just an alternative. There's vibrant competition for parental controls out there."- Leah Nylen3:55 P.M. Zuckerberg denies threatening rivalsFacebook has "certainly adapted features" from competing services, CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged Wednesday, but he denied it has threatened to copy start-ups if they wouldn't sell to his company.But Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) expressed skepticism about his answer, reading from text messages between Zuckerberg and Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom and messages between Systrom and a venture capitalist. She asked Zuckerberg whether he "threatened" Systrom and Snap CEO Evan Spiegel by saying he would clone their products if they didn't sell to Facebook. The company bought Instagram in 2012, but Snap rebuffed offers to sell to the social network. The House subcommittee also posted those documents to its website Wednesday."I'm not sure what you would mean by 'threaten,'" Zuckerberg said, referring to the company's effort to build an app called Facebook Camera. "It was public we were building a camera app at the time. That was a well-documented thing."It was clear this was a space we were going to compete in one way or another," he said. "I don't think those are a threat in any way."Jayapal reminded Zuckerberg he was under oath while testifying.In closing her questioning, Jayapal said she didn't believe threats should be a normal business practice. "Facebook is a case study in monopoly power, in my opinion, because your company harvests and monetizes our data and then your company uses that data to spy on your competitors and copy, acquire and kill rivals," she said. "You've used Facebook's power to threaten smaller competitors and ensure you always get your way. These tactics reinforce Facebook's dominance." - Leah Nylen3:44 P.M. Sensenbrenner: No need for Congress to change antitrust law House Judiciary Democrats lost a big potential GOP ally if they had any hopes of bipartisan recommendations to update antitrust law as part of their probe into tech giants. "I have reached the conclusion that we do not need to change our antitrust laws," Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), the top Republican on the antitrust subcommittee, said hours into the hearing on alleged bad behavior by Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook. "They've been working just fine. The question here is the question of enforcement of those antitrust laws."The subcommittee's probe has been led by Chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who has been preparing a report to conclude the long investigation. GOP buy-in would strongly bolster its conclusions, including potential recommendations for updates to antitrust law.Notably, Sensenbrenner seemed to support the probe itself and said he's "been working with the chairman for over a year on this bipartisan investigation." His support runs counter to some Republicans who have disparaged Democratic handling of the probe. But Congress shouldn't toss out a century of precedent, added the retiring House Republican. He said lawmakers should instead pressure antitrust regulators like the Federal Trade Commission, an agency that has faced accusations of going lightly on companies like Facebook and Google.  - John Hendel3:20 p.m. 'Mr. Jordan, you do not have the time!'Tempers flared more than two hours into the hearing after Rep. Mary Scanlon (D-Pa.) began her questioning with a dismissal of what she called "fringe conspiracy theories" of House Judiciary ranking member Jim Jordan (R-Ohio).That prompted an outburst from Jordan, who had just pressed Google on whether it's biased toward Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden and said he had internal evidence of the search giant's interest in encouraging Latino voters in 2016. The only problem: It was no longer Jordan's time to speak, as Democrats immediately reminded him as they shouted him down."Mr. Jordan, you do not have the time!" antitrust subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.) declared amid gavel slamming. When someone told him to wear a mask, Jordan sought to bring up the "unmasking" - in the surveillance sense - of former Trump White House national security adviser Michael Flynn. "When someone comes after my motives for asking questions, I get a chance to respond," Jordan said before letting the hearing proceed. For the record, Google CEO Sundar Pichai maintained that his company is apolitical. - John Hendel2:56 P.M.Bezos doesn't totally resolve questions on misleading Amazon testimonyAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos said the company is still investigating whether employees may have used data it acquires from its third-party sellers to launch competing products - an issue that has prompted allegations that the company misled House lawmakers a year ago."We have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private label business. I can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated," Bezos said in response to questions from Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), whose district includes Amazon headquarters. "If we found someone violated the policy, we would take action against them."The Wall Street Journal reported this year that Amazon employees frequently looked at seller data to help determine what products the company should offer, contrary to what an Amazon executive told the House a year ago. Jayapal also quoted a former Amazon employee as telling the panel that seller data is "a candy shop. Everyone can have access to anything they want."Bezos also acknowledged that while company policy might prevent employees from looking at a specific seller's information, they could look at aggregate data. Jayapal and The Wall Street Journal story noted that Amazon workers took advantage of that by pairing a successful seller with one who had little business to gain insights into particular products."You have access to data that other sellers do not have," Jayapal said. "The whole goal of this committee's work is to make sure that there are more Amazons, that there are more Apples, that there are more companies that get to innovate and small businesses get to thrive. ...That is why we need to regulate these marketplaces so that no company has a platform so dominant that it is essentially a monopoly."- Leah Nylen2:42 P.M.Committee members came out swinging, often catching CEOs flat-footed The first batch of questions saw the CEOs collectively struggle to directly answer lawmakers, who came armed with well-researched questions and strong opinions - a shift in gear from previous congressional tech hearings. The one exception was Jeff Bezos, who escaped all questions for the first hour. As Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended his company's management of Instagram, citing the Federal Trade Commission's original decision not to challenge the company's 2012 merger with Instagram, hearing chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.) dismissed Zuckerberg, saying the "failures" of the FTC in 2012 "do not alleviate" Facebook's current antitrust challenges. Google CEO Sundar Pichai tried to fend off questions by citing examples of individual vendors using Google to grow their business, before Cicilline cut him off for not answering the question.Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) reeled off a list of possible links and alignment between Google and the Chinese Communist Party, leaving Pichai to say only that Google had only a "very limited presence" in China. He repeated that answer to Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who repeated charges by tech investor Peter Thiel that Google's China links are "treason," and concerns from Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who said in 2018 that Google's artificial intelligence work in China puts the U.S. military at a competitive disadvantage. - Ryan Heath2:19 P.M.Apple's App Store treats developers fairly, Cook saysApple CEO Tim Cook rejected allegations that the company's App Store rules for developers are enforced arbitrarily and argued that the company must compete with rivals to interest developers in building apps for its iPhone and iPad. "We treat every developer the same. We have open and transparent rules," Cook said under questioning from Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.). "Those rules apply evenly to everyone."Cook said the majority of apps sold through the App Store, 84 percent, pay no fees. The remainder pay either a 30 percent or 15 percent commission, he said. Johnson noted that Amazon has an agreement with Apple to allow users to bypass the iPhone's in-app payment service, and its 30 percent fee, and instead use the credit card on file in their Amazon account for the Amazon Prime Video app. Cook said that would be "available to anyone meeting the conditions," though he didn't outline what those conditions are.The Apple CEO also argued that the company must compete to attract developers, who could offer apps for Google's Android, Microsoft's Windows or XBox or Nintendo's Playstation. "There's a competition for developers just like there's a competition for customers," Cook said. "It's so competitive I would describe it as a street fight for market share in the smartphone business."- Leah Nylen2:15 P.M.Zuckerberg: Buying Instagram was 'buying time'We're starting to see some fruits of the subcommittee's year-plus investigation, and it's got Zuckerberg on the defensive. The Facebook CEO and New York Democrat Jerry Nadler went back and forth over internal company emails in which, Nadler said, Zuckerberg told a colleague back in 2012 that it was buying the photo-sharing Instagram because it could "meaningfully hurt us without becoming a huge business."Zuckerberg's thinking at the time could become a critical piece of evidence if it bolsters the idea that Facebook was abusing its dominance - and deep coffers - to eliminate budding rivals. Facebook's buying up of Instagram has become a key focus for critics of the company, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and others saying the deal should be unwound. That's a threat for Facebook: Instagram has become wildly popular in its own right, and is central to Zuckerberg's plan to keep a toe hold with younger generations who are otherwise flocking to sites like TikTok."Did you mean that consumers might switch from Facebook to Instagram?" Nadler asked. "Congressman...," started Zuckerberg, attempting to make the case that no one at the time saw Instagram has a general social network app, rather than a really good photo-sharing app. Nadler pressed on: "Yes or no: Did you mean that?"Then Nadler went for the kill, asking what Zuckerberg meant when he wrote that "what we're really buying is time," adding, "Mr. Zuckerberg: Mergers and acquisitions that buy off potential competitive threats violate the antitrust laws." Zuckerberg tried again, insisting that the Federal Trade Commission knew how Facebook was thinking about Instagram back when it signed off on the merger almost a decade ago. That's when antitrust subcommittee David Cicilline (D-R.I.) jumped in: "I would remind the witness that the failures of the FTC in 2012 of course do not alleviate the antitrust challenges that the chairman described." Translation: Don't think this is over just because that agency down the road said it was.-Nancy Scola2:04 p.m.Sensenbrenner presses Zuckerberg over Twitter's Don Jr. call A top House Republican used his questioning to press Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg over a recent content moderation squabble involving Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, with Twitter. "It was reported that Donald Trump Jr. got taken down for a period of time because he put something up on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine," Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), the top Republican on the Judiciary antitrust subcommittee. Although Sensenbrenner said he wouldn't take the medication, the lawmaker said, "I think this is a legitimate matter of discussion." "Why has that happened?" Sensenbrenner asked Zuckerberg. "Congressman, first, to be clear, I think what you might be referring to happened on Twitter, so it's hard for me to speak to that," the Facebook CEO said. "But I can talk to our policies about this." Zuckerberg said Facebook would take down any claim a proven cure for Covid-19 exists when there is none, given the potential imminent risk for harm, although he said the social platform would allow free discussion about drug trials and what people may think more generally about a treatment's prospects."Our goal is to offer a platform for all ideas," Zuckerberg told Sensebrenner. "Frankly I think we've distinguished ourselves as one of the companies that defends free expression the most." - John Hendel1:58 P.M.Google: We don't steal Google CEO Sundar Pichai denied that the search giant steals content from other websites and rejected reports alleging that the company steers users to its own products and sites rather than sources elsewhere on the web."We have always focused on providing users the most relevant information," Pichai said in response to pointed questions from House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee chair David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who said the panel had seen evidence about Google taking content from other websites and placing more ads on its search results. "The vast majority of queries on Google, we don't show ads at all."Cicilline cited an investigation by The Markup that showed Google has devoted more space on the first page of search results to its own products -- which earn the company more revenue that if users go to other webpages. Pichai said that Google only shows ads when consumers are seeking to buy products and argued that they compete with other e-commerce platforms, like Amazon, where consumers often go directly to try to find products."When I run the company I'm really focused on giving users what they want," Pichai said. "We see vigorous competition, whether it be travel or real estate, and we are working hard to innovate."The Federal Trade Commission's investigation into Google in the early 2010s found Google "scraped" content from other websites, including Yelp and TripAdvisor. The company agreed to allow other companies to opt out of having their content scraped through 2017.- Leah Nylen1:51 P.M.Facebook: We're an underdog - just look at the rest of this witness list One surprise so far in the hearing: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who generally likes to stick fairly religiously to a script in his public appearances, went far afield from his written testimony - including strongly arguing that his 2-billion-member social network is an underdog when you look at the behemoths he's testifying alongside.Zuckerberg pointed out that Facebook competes with other companies that, too, have hundreds of millions or even billions of users. "Some are upstarts," said Zuckerberg, "but others are gatekeepers with the power to decide if we can even release our apps in their apps stores to compete with them" - a seeming shot at Apple, with whom Facebook has no love lost. (Apple CEO Tim Cook was off-screen at the time.)And it's not just Apple, argued Zuckerberg, who added that Facebook has to battle with YouTube when it comes to video and Amazon when it comes to the online ads market.  "In many areas we're behind our competitors," said Zuckerberg. That's not what you'd expect a CEO to a multibillion-dollar titan to say, but it's a direct rebuke to the very premise of the hearing - that Facebook is so giant, so powerful, that Washington needs to step in.- Nancy Scola1:49 P.M.Tim Cook delivers opening statementRead his prepared testimony here.- POLITICO staff1:43 P.M.Sundar Pichai delivers opening statementRead his prepared testimony here.- POLITICO staff1:40 P.M.Jeff Bezos delivers opening statement"Just like the world needs small companies, it also needs large ones," Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos told the antitrust subcommittee Wednesday - while arguing that his online commerce giant is not all that large when considered as a percentage of the global retail market.Bezos, the world's richest person, also pointed to his humble origins, noting that "my mom, Jackie, had me when she was a 17-year-old high school student in Albuquerque."Read the rest of his prepared testimony here.- Bob King1:35 P.M.Jordan: They're out to get us"I'll just cut to the chase: Big Tech is out to get conservatives," Rep. Jim Jordan said at the hearing's outset - a not-unexpected outburst from the top Republican on the full Judiciary Committee, who has become a public face of the complaints from some on the right that Silicon Valley is innately biased against them. Jordan also brought up the fact that he'd hoped to have Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter - a frequent target of Jordan, President Donald Trump, and other Republicans - testify at the hearing, a request shot down by Democrats.Jordan also made a last-minute request to rope into the hearing another Republican member, who's not on the subcommittee, to dig into the alleged constitutional questions raised by the companies testifying. Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.) wasn't having it - a signal that he intends to keep the hearing on topic. - Nancy Scola1:20 P.M.Sensenbrenner: 'Conservatives are consumers too'The Republican leader of the House Judiciary antitrust panel became the first to raise concerns about "conservative bias" by the biggest U.S. tech companies. In his opening statement, Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) emphasized that a firm's large size doesn't mean they are in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. Rather, how the problem is how they use that power."Companies like Facebook, Google's YouTube and Twitter have become the public square of today where political debates play out in real time," Sensenbrenner said in his opening statement. "Conservatives are consumers too and they need the protection of the antitrust laws. The power to influence debate carries with it remarkable responsibilities."But like his counterpart, panel chair David Cicilline (D-R.I.), Sensenbrenner said he hopes to examine the size and power of the U.S. four biggest tech companies."Your companies are large. That's not a problem. Your companies are successful. That's not a problem either," he said. "I want to leave here today with a more complete picture of how your individual companies use your size, success and power and what it means to the American consumer."- Leah Nylen1:04 P.M.Interest groups clamor to raise other tech complaints Tech companies have become such a political flashpoint - and exert such influence on our economy and society - that dozens of interest groups are angling to get their issues into the record today, during a hearing whose stated topic is antitrust.Data privacy and misinformation are two themes that many groups want to see raised. The NAACP is one group with a particularly compelling - though off-topic - message. NAACP tweeted that it hopes the hearing "addresses [the] devastating conclusion of civil rights audit of @Facebook - that company allows hate speech & disinformation to thrive." Facebook denies those allegations. - Ryan Heath1 P.M.Cicilline vows to check 'emperors of the online economy'The top Democrat leading the House Judiciary antitrust panel's investigation into competition in digital markets said the nation's largest tech companies have "too much power." "As gatekeepers to the digital economy, these platforms enjoy the power to pick winners and losers, shake down small businesses, and enrich themselves while choking off competitors," Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) said in his opening statement. "Our founders would not bow before a king. Nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy."The antitrust subcommittee's investigation, opened last summer and focused on conduct by Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, has so far compiled millions of documents and hundreds of hours of interviews from more than 100 companies, Cicilline said. While he acknowledged that the four companies operate in different markets, Cicilline said the quartet act in similar ways. They are "critical arteries of commerce and communications" who use their control over access or marketplaces to surveil rivals and wield their power in order to expand into other markets."Simply put: They have too much power," Cicilline said. "This power staves off new forms of competition, creativity, and innovation. And while these dominant firms may still produce some new innovative products, their dominance is killing the small businesses, manufacturing, and overall dynamism that are the engines of the American economy."Read the rest of his opening remarks here. - Leah Nylen12:30 P.M. Trump's hearing counterprogramming includes threat of more executive ordersPresident Donald Trump, who earlier in the day told reporters he'll be watching Wednesday's hearing, is now saying he's ready to take executive action to rein in the tech giants. Trump in May already issued a hotly contested executive order aimed at what he called social media censorship, which he signed in the middle of sparring with Twitter over its attempts to fact-check his tweeting. Under directives from that order, the Commerce Department petitioned the Federal Communications Commission this week asking the independent agency to narrow the liability protections shielding internet companies from lawsuits over the content their users post. The administration petition also asks the FCC, which doesn't regulate social media, to mandate that internet companies offer more transparent disclosure about their moderation policies. - John Hendel12:12 p.m.The world is watching today's hearingsHeading into Wednesday's hearings, America's big tech firms had similar messages emphasizing that "we're good for America." While that may or may not be true, what is certain is that this hearing has a global audience. As CEOs of global companies, today's witnesses run the risk of inflaming regulators and antitrust enforcers in other countries by playing the American patriotism card. Apple and Google have major open cases in Brussels, for example, and when Mark Zuckerberg appeared before Congress in April 2018, it immediately sparked demands from the European Parliament and elsewhere that he appear. British lawmakers are still peeved that he's avoided appearances in London. We've seen before - in European antitrust cases - companies like Google and Microsoft shift discussions about technical antitrust matters into broader discussions: essentially saying that because consumers like their products, competition problems and hidden costs either don't exist or do not need to be addressed by regulators and courts. Those arguments were effective in initial stages of public debate in Europe, but fell flat over time. Based on their opening statements, the CEOs run the risk of making a similar miscalculation today.- Ryan Heath12:04 P.M. Hearing delayed 1 hourThe House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee hearing with tech company CEOs will start later than planned to allow time to clean the hearing room, a spokesperson for the panel said.An earlier 9:30 a.m. hearing before the Judiciary Committee's immigration panel finished up later than expected. Richard Luchette, a spokesperson for antitrust subcommittee chair David Cicilline (D-R.I.), said standard committee procedure requires cleaning of the room between meetings.The hearing with the top executives of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google will now begin at 1 p.m., Judiciary Committee spokesperson Shadawn Reddick-Smith said in an e-mail.- Leah Nylen11:44 A.M.Trump: 'What the big tech companies are doing is very bad'President Donald Trump plans to watch Wednesday's hearing, he told reporters outside the White House earlier in the day."We're going to be watching the hearing today very closely," the president said. "Because there's no question that what the big tech companies are doing is very bad."Trump has long criticized the U.S. tech giants over how they moderate content, including accusing them of making it hard for his supporters to find his posts. They have denied doing any such thing, although some companies - especially Twitter - have started placing warning or fact-checking notices on some of his statements.- John Hendel10:13 A.M. TikTok CEO slams Zuckerberg's China comments just before hearingTikTok CEO Kevin Mayer slammed Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday ahead of Wednesday's high-stakes congressional hearing, where the tech mogul is expected to picture Chinese tech corporations as a threat."Let's focus our energies on fair and open competition in service of our consumers, rather than maligning attacks by our competitor - namely Facebook - disguised as patriotism and designed to put an end to our very presence in the U.S.," Mayer said in a statement.Zuckerberg depicted Facebook in his prepared statement for the hearing as a "proudly American company."U.S. officials have recently floated a ban on TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance. If the company were to leave the U.S. market, American advertisers would be left with less choice, Mayer argued.The newly appointed CEO, who comes from Disney, also said tech companies should disclose their algorithms, moderation policies and data flows to regulators. "We will not wait for regulation to come, but instead TikTok has taken the first step by launching a Transparency and Accountability Center for moderation and data practices," he explained."TikTok has become the latest target, but we are not the enemy," Mayer said.- Laura KayaliLoad-Date: August 5, 2020End of Document

Asked whether the press will continue to have the right to cover any issue, Lam has said that if journalists can give "100 per 100 guarantees that they will not commit any crime," then she can guarantee "the same thing.""It's not about me being here to give you a guarantee of what they can or can't do," he said. Details of the new National Security Act released on Monday include increased powers for the police, including the ability to seize electronic devices and enter offices or homes without a prior court order, as well as freeze assets and restrict the movement of people.Encrypted mobile messaging apps such as Telegram, Whatsapp and Facebook have announced that they suspend the processing of user data requests transferred by Hong Kong authorities by applying the new standard.Facebook has said that its decision will be re-evaluated pending consultations with "due diligence" on human rights and with experts in the area. Signal, a mobile messaging app that does not store user data, has increased in popularity since the application of the new National Security Law and is already among the most downloaded from Google's mobile store.From his Twitter account, Signal has assured that he has "never" given user data to the Hong Kong Police." "We don't have user data to deliver," he said.The Tik Tok app announced Monday night that it will retire its platform in Hong Kong. Tik Tok's parent company, ByteDance, has tried to distance itself from its Chinese competitor, which do comply with Chinese censorship and privacy standards*The company has told the Axios portal that it would be impossible for Tik Tok to refuse to hand over user data to the Chinese government under the new National Security Act.Load-Date: July 8, 2020End of Document

TikTok Ban? President Trump 'Just Getting Started': White House AdviserNewsweek.comJuly 13, 2020 Monday 7:07 AM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 739 wordsByline: Jason MurdockHighlight: Like Huawei before it, TikTok has been flagged as a national security concern by elected officials who have called for investigations into how it handles U.S. user data.BodyAs speculation swirls about a possible TikTok ban in the U.S., a top White House adviser has indicated fresh restrictions are indeed imminent.The short form video app—which is hugely popular with teens and boasts millions of American users—has become a major politicial talking point in recent weeks.It is currently led by an American CEO, former Disney streaming executive Kevin Mayer, but is owned by a Beijing-based technology startup called ByteDance.Like Huawei before it, TikTok has been flagged as a national security concern by elected officials, who called for investigations into how it handles U.S. user data.In late June, the app was banned in India for threatening "sovereignty and integrity," and suggestions the White House could soon follow suit were teased by U.S. secretary of state Mike Pompeo and the president himself during interviews last week.Speaking with Fox News on Sunday, trade adviser Peter Navarro was the latest to voice the opinion that both TikTok and WeChat, a popular chat app widely used in China that is broadly similar to WhatsApp, may soon be outlawed in the states."TikTok and WeChat, I suspect that the president is just getting started with those two," Navarro said during a segment on the Sunday Morning Futures show.While his arguments appeared to be a list of political talking points—describing Trump rival Joe Biden as "the candidate of the Chinese Communist Party"—Navarro said the apps could be used for hijacking information, surveillance and extortion."All the data that goes into those mobile apps that kids have so much fun with... it goes right to servers in China, right to the Chinese military, the Chinese Communist Party and the agencies which want to steal our intellectual property," he claimed."The worst thing they use them for, besides surveilling and tracking... is [to] engage in information warfare against the American people, against this president. The Chinese Communist Party wants Joe Biden more than anything right now," he added.The White House adviser didn't elaborate on a time-scale for enforcement, but said the Trump administration is "looking very closely" at TikTok, which has repeatedly denied that it shares data with the Chinese government, despite U.S. accusations.The White House has been contacted for comment.Referencing reports that TikTok may change its structure to distance itself from China, Navarro said it wouldn't matter and called Mayer an "American puppet."Also like Huawei, experts told Wired there has been little evidence made public to back up U.S. assertions that TikTok is a major risk. A full national security review into the app was reportedly launched last November. Its findings, if any, remain unclear."Is TikTok a national security threat or is it another punchbag in the middle of the U.S.-China trade war? Potentially both," Tim Stevens, a lecturer in global security at King's College London, told the magazine in an article published today.According to TikTok, U.S. data is stored in the U.S with a backup in Singapore, although a post last April appeared to suggest some user data passed through China."Our goal is to minimize data access across regions so that, for example, employees in the APAC region, including China, would have very minimal access to user data from the EU and US," it said at the time, noting it would limit access to such information.A TikTok spokesperson previously told Newsweek: "TikTok is led by an American CEO, with hundreds of employees and key leaders... here in the U.S. We have no higher priority than promoting a safe and secure app experience for our users. We have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked."In the past week, as political criticism spiked, some companies urged employees not to download or use TikTok, blaming issues with data handling and privacy.Last Friday, Amazon called on staff to remove the app from their devices, citing security concerns, but later said the notice had been sent by mistake. Wells Fargo has also told its employees to purge the app from their phones, The Information reported.The Democratic and Republican national committees have both made similar requests, urging workers to exercise caution when using the app, according to CNN.When asked about the Amazon situation on Sunday, Navarro told the Fox News host it had showcased the "power of the Chinese Communist Party on corporate America."Link to ImageGraphic President Donald TrumpChip Somodevilla/GettyPresident Donald Trump meets with students, teachers and administrators about how to safely re-open schools during the novel coronavirus pandemic in the East Room at the White House July 07, 2020 in Washington, DC.Load-Date: July 13, 2020End of Document

Growing tension between US and China hits Wall Street: Dow Jones jeopardizes its supportsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 24, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 574 wordsBodyWall Street faces the final straight of the week down, as have the main squares of Asia and Europe before. New York Stock Exchange indices begin on Friday with drops reaching the percentage point. And if you look at technical analysis, there's more reason to worry: the Dow Jones jeopardizes its support in the 26,500 points that, if lost at the end of the day, will mean entry into a bearish context in the short term. The growing diplomatic tension between the United States and China, the world's two largest economies, raise fears that the global economic recovery after the coronavirus shock will become even more complicated.American equities follow the red wake marked by Chinese ones. Shanghai, a reference in the Asian giant, has plummeted by 3.9% on Friday and Hong Kong has lost more than 2%.On Wall Street, today's weekly closes assume that the Dow Jones is reeling at 26,500 points, a level to be monitored precisely on the index."If you lose them, we are very afraid that we would see falls towards the June lows, which is in the 25,000," says Joan Cabrero, Ecotrader Advisor. Or what's the same: the US stock exchange will open the door to falls close to 6% in the short term if it doesn't save the supports today.The expert has for days warned of the importance of the DOw succeeding in overcoming at the end of a day the resistance he has in the 27,580 points to ward off the 'bad omens'.The S&P; 500 did succeed in batiting its resistance earlier in the week, but it is necessary for its 'partner' to do the same "to fully trust" potential climbs, the technical analyst insists. Something this session cravs, at the very least, complicated.Raise the tension  The equities end the week with a bad taste in the mouth. The almost permanent tension in relations between Beijing and Washington has been largely ignored in recent weeks and months, with the evolution of the coronavirus pandemic as the main investor concern. But things have changed in markets, where the 'findings' between the two nations already weigh, recalling the summer of 2019.The Chinese government has on Friday ordered the closure of the U.S. consulate in Chengdu, Sichuan, in retaliation for the closure of its consulate in Houston, Texas, by order of the U.S. Executive earlier in the week.Moreover, the rhetoric between the two countries has hardened in recent days, hampering their already complicated trade relations. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said yesterday that "the old paradigm of commitment to China has failed." "We must not continue it. We must not go back to it," he insisted.And US President Donald Trump himself has claimed that the principle of trade deal signed in January with China is no longer as important to the United States. This pact is considered the 'phase 1' towards trade peace between the two powers. But doubts that this will ever occur keep increasing.Doubts about recovery"The latest weekly unemployment data in the US, which recorded its first rise after 15 consecutive weeks of decline and lead to the pace of economic recovery, also do not help," notes the Department of Income Analysis 4.These figures met in the early afternoon yesterday afternoon and caused Wall Street to quote negative, closing the day with losses of up to 2% in its main targets. And in the face of the escalation of tension between the US and China, the declines extend this session.commentsforum0WhatsAppFacebook  Twitter  Linkedin       Load-Date: July 25, 2020End of Document

Changing the Cyber Landscape; Magazine series examines telecommunications environment evolution.GlobeNewswireJuly 10, 2020 Friday 2:39 PM PTCopyright 2020 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: FEATURE ARTICLE; GOVERNMENT NEWS; OTHER NEWS; RESEARCH ANALYSIS AND REPORTSLength: 767 wordsBodyFairfax, VA, July  10, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The next-generation Internet proposed by Huawei and supported by the Chinese government would provide a platform for revolutionary capabilities while implementing repressive measures that would eliminate today's open communication, Internet experts agree. At worst, it would place control of Internet content in the hands of a few masters. According to Vint Cerf and several other experienced Internet professionals, even if it does not subsume the entire Internet, China could cripple the interoperability that has characterized the network's value as an economic growth engine by creating separate and unequal Internets.For a multipart series of articles posted on SIGNAL Media's website, Editor-in-Chief Robert K. Ackerman spoke with Cerf, Laura DeNardis, Ted Hardie and Melissa Hathaway among others, all specialists in the area of international telecommunication and the impact China could have on the future of telecommunications. The upshot is China is pushing its new Internet architecture both through market penetration by its own industries and by influence among international standards bodies, they concur. Ultimately, the only way to prevent this methodical takeover would be for governments to provide financial and logistical support to their own companies while those companies improve efficiencies to compete with China's telecommunications firms globally.Cerf, an Internet pioneer who is vice president and chief Internet evangelist at Google, notes that China's own implementation of the Internet "The Great Chinese Firewall" indicates a high degree of sophistication in the ability to filter content. Cerf also notes that China's products are favorably priced and have carved out a significant market share, especially in Africa and elsewhere in the developing world. China's M.O. is to loan money to countries for purchase of products and services, he says.China's high-technology communications and networking industries are proposing a host of future capabilities to come if vendors cast their lot with companies such as Huawei and ZTE. But these new technologies, once ensconced, would lead their users down a path closed to others and open to Chinese government control, say the experts.Cerf observes that China probably is pursuing a multi-pronged strategy. It is working to maximize its presence in the markets and place as much of its own equipment in the global networking realm as possible, which is the goal of every manufacturer. Simultaneously, the republic is striving to be more influential in the standards community. These efforts might be more coincidental than coordinated, he admits.According to DeNardis, China is becoming a power player around the Internet in a variety of ways. The interim dean of the School of Communications at American University and author of several books about the Internet, including The Global War for Internet Governance, DeNardis says this power comes from the rise of Chinese companies. In addition, China's outsourcing of production and manufacturing by other countries' companies into China and its involvement and expertise in standards-setting bodies also play a role.She also contends the term "Internet governance" is an oxymoron. A lot of it involves the private sector, which controls much of the infrastructure. Keeping in mind that this is an ecosystem, she describes it as a private-sector-led multistakeholder model where no single player is in charge of all Internet governance responsibilities.In contrast, China's approach to Internet governance is more of cyber sovereignty. "The state has a much more powerful role in control of the network," she offers. "Not only do they control the network, but also they co-opt the network in order to propel their political aims such as censoring, surveillance and enacting control over citizens."To learn more about China's influence in the telecommunications marketplace, read the SIGNAL Media series online.###SIGNAL is the official media for AFCEA International, an organization established in 1946, as a non-profit membership association serving the military, government, industry and academia.

US gives 72 hours to close Chinese consulate in Houston; China warns of "countermeasures"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 22, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 540 wordsBodyMADRID (EUROPA PRESS).- The United States gave China 72 hours to close its Consulate General in Houston, arguing that there is an "unbalance" in bilateral relations, something Beijing considered a "political provocation," while threatening Washington to adopt "countermeasures."The information was first shared on Twitter by the editor-in-chief of the official Global Times newspaper, Hu Xijin, but later Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin confirmed it at the daily press conference.According to Wang, cited by the local South China Morning Post, Donald Trump's Administration notified the closing order to China on Tuesday, so as of that day it has 72 hours to close this consular office."The United States argued that there is an imbalance in bilateral relations, but this is its usual excuse without foundation. Indeed, judging by the number of diplomats and diplomatic institutions, the United States has many more than China," Wang said.U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus explained that the U.S. goal is to "protect U.S. intellectual property and U.S. private information," without giving further details, as collected by CNN.On Tuesday, the Justice Department accused two Chinese hackers of "launching a global computer intrusion campaign" against laboratories dedicated to coronavirus research and vaccine development, which it claimed is supported by the Beijing government."Nice stay"The Chinese spokesman denounced a diplomatic offensive from Washington to Beijing whereby "the United States has placed restrictions on Chinese diplomats in June and October without a valid reason."In his view, "due to the deliberate acts of hate speech by the United States, Chinese delegations in the country have recently received bomb and death threats."The U.S. Embassy in Beijing has also frequently published articles attacking China," Wang added, believing that this makes clear "who is intervening in the internal affairs of others and who has started the confrontation."Thus, the Beijing government "strongly" condemned the American request, considering that this is a "political provocation" as it does not obey a previous movement, but has been taken "unilaterally", leading to "an unprecedented escalation"."China demands that the United States reverse this erroneous decision," Wang said, warning that, "if the United States moves on, China will have to take the necessary countermeasures."U.S. media reported on Wednesday that the Houston Police and Fire Departments attended the Chinese Consulate General Tuesday night because they were burning documents in the garden.According to its website, the Houston Consulate General was the first to establish China in the United States in 1979 when the two countries restored their diplomatic relations. It serves eight U.S. states—Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi—and Puerto Rico.China and the United States have been mired in an escalation of tension from trade war to restrictions on journalists and the media for years, although in recent months it has been shot at the coronavirus pandemic, which Washington blames directly on Beijing.You may be interested in: US forces want to provoke new 'cold war', China warnsLoad-Date: July 23, 2020End of Document

China to take US blacklist "necessary action"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 5, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 225 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- The Chinese government said it will take "necessary measures" to safeguard the interests of domestic companies, after new U.S. restrictions on a blacklist of 33 companies took effect Friday.Without specifying what the measures would be, the Ministry of Commerce issued a statement that it opposed measures that make 33 Chinese companies subject to restrictions on access to U.S. technology on the case that they have ties to the Army or are involved in human rights violations.The United States "has repeatedly used so-called national security grounds, abused export controls and other measures to attack companies in other countries, causing serious damage to the international economic and trade order," according to the statement. "This does not help China, the U.S. or the world."The U.S. Department of Commerce expanded its so-called list of entities, which restricts access to technology and other U.S. items, in May, to include 24 Chinese companies and universities that, according to the Trump administration, had ties to the military, as well as nine other entities it accused of human rights violations in Sinkiang. Over the past year, China has threatened to produce its own list of "unreliable entities," but so far it has not.Original Note:China Says It Will Take 'Necessary Measures' on U.S. Blacklist©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: June 6, 2020End of Document

Tech Giants Resist China's Online Censorship in Hong Kong as TikTok Plans ExitMT Newswires Live Briefs PROJuly 7, 2020 Tuesday 4:13 AM ESTCopyright 2020 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 411 wordsBody China's national security law for Hong Kong, warmly embraced by stock market investors when it was passed last week, is now facing criticism from tech giants including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)-owned Google after they decided to suspend processing requests for user data from Hong Kong authorities.The news snapped Hong Kong stocks' recent three-day winning streak after the Hang Seng Index plummeted 1.4% when the market closed Tuesday.US tech giants echoed concerns about the security law's power to quash free speech and end Hong Kong's status as a semi-autonomous region. "We believe freedom of expression is a fundamental human right and we support the right of people to express themselves without fear for their safety or other repercussions," a Facebook spokeswoman told The Wall Street Journal.Facebook-owned WhatsApp also told the newspaper that reviews of user data will be suspended "pending further assessment of the impact of the National Security Law, including formal human-rights due diligence and consultations with human-rights experts."Google also told Wall Street Journal that it halted all data and information requests from Hong Kong authorities as soon as the law came into effect, while Twitter also suspended processing requests.Adding to Beijing's woes is short form video app platform TikTok's recent decision to exit the former British colony within days "in light of recent events," Reuters reported Wednesday, citing a company spokesman.Although TikTok is owned by Chinese tech company ByteDance, the app is not available in mainland China. TikTok had previously said that it will not comply with requests by the Chinese government to censor content or to access user data, the news outlet said.TikTok's decision came less than a month after it was reported that the company signed a three-year lease for an office space in Hong Kong.Unlike TikTok, the US tech giants did not announce plans to exit Hong Kong. The Journal said Google, Facebook and Twitter generate large revenues from advertising in China despite being blocked in the country.Under the national security law, police will no longer have to seek court orders before requiring internet users or internet companies to remove information or help with an investigation, the South China Morning Post reported last week.The Journal said companies could be fined almost $13 thousand, while its employees could face six months in jail if they fail to comply.Load-Date: July 8, 2020End of Document

Hong Kong: Freedom House Condemns China's Imposition of National Security LawTargeted News ServiceJuly 1, 2020 Wednesday 8:31 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 638 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyFreedom House issued the following news release on June 30:In response to the Chinese central government's imposition of a repressive National Security Law on Hong Kong, Freedom House issued the following statement."Freedom House is appalled at China's passage and promulgation today of a National Security Law for Hong Kong," said Michael J. Abramowitz, president of Freedom House."The speed and secrecy with which this law was drafted, adopted, and put into effect is reprehensible. The action amounts to new low even for the Chinese Communist Party, which routinely flouts international standards on the rule of law.""Beijing has unilaterally and brazenly superseded Hong Kong's Basic Law, stripping millions of Hong Kongers of fundamental rights that are guaranteed to them under local and international law," Abramowitz continued."The National Security Law represents a potent threat not just to individual Hong Kongers, but also to the status of Hong Kong as a city committed to the rule of law. We commend the US government's announcement of sanctions against Chinese officials responsible for rights violations in Hong Kong, as well as the US Senate's recent passage of the Hong Kong Autonomy Act. We urge other democratic governments around the world to take similar measures."Background:On June 30, China's National People's Congress Standing Committee announced that it had drafted and passed a new National Security Law for Hong Kong that would take effect by midnight local time. The full text of the law, however, was not made public until an hour before midnight. Within China, legislation is typically open to public comment prior to adoption, and there is a substantial gap of time between promulgation and the effective date.The full National Security Law includes six sections and 66 articles. It outlines various activities that would be considered to fall under the four main offenses of separatism, subversion, terrorism, and colluding with foreign forces, which could result in sentences as long as life in prison.The legislation also sets up several institutional structures in Hong Kong that would be under Beijing's close supervision and control, including a secretive national security committee, a special prosecutorial office, and a national security agency. The national security committee, tasked with overseeing the law's implementation, will not be subject to judicial review.The announcement has had an almost immediate chilling effect. For the first time, Hong Kong police denied permits to organizers of an annual July 1 protest marking Hong Kong's 1997 transition from British to Chinese rule. Prominent rights advocate Joshua Wong announced his withdrawal from Demosisto, a prodemocracy organization he helped found, and the group subsequently announced that it was disbanding. Large numbers of Hong Kong Twitter users have also announced their departure from the social media platform--which is banned in mainland China--for fear of legal reprisals for their posts.The new law has been widely condemned by foreign governments. Anticipating adoption of the legislation, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo announced on June 26 that the United States would impose visa restrictions on Chinese Communist Party officials found to have undermined Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and curtailed human rights. In addition, the US Senate unanimously approved the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which imposes sanctions on individuals and entities that materially contribute to China's failure to preserve Hong Kong's autonomy, as well as foreign financial institutions that conduct significant transactions with such individuals or entities. The legislation must pass the US House of Representatives before being signed into law.[Category: International]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7160588 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 1, 2020End of Document

Will Kevin Mayer TikTok transform?CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 2, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1082 wordsBodyDisney's flagship executive takes on the challenge of piloting the global expansion of the Chinese social network despite turbulent us-Asian giant relations.Homer Simpson, Darth Vader and Captain America have one thing in common: they came to Disney with Kevin Mayer. Now, the U.S. media executive is preparing to live his own epic adventure, which some believe is wrong. The 57-year-old executive took over the Chinese app TikTok, whose presence on the screens of smartphones of billions of people has attracted the focus of lawmakers around the world.At Disney, where it went on to take responsibility for its streaming service, which has garnered more than 50 million subscribers in less than six months, Mayer is best known for its problem-solving ability. But when he was not considered this year to hold the office of greater power, he could not resist the invitation to join the board of directors of ByteDance, Beijing's $75 billion (68.25 billion) giant.One of Disney's top executives explains that they had agreed that there were "great opportunities" in making more widespread use of Bytedance technology, especially the algorithm that predicts what viewers will like. "On an operational level, ByteDance has the most advanced, more evolved artificial intelligence (AI) than companies like Amazon,and Kevin sees great opportunities in that," he says.An example is Resso, the streaming music platform that ByteDance has launched in India that allows users to incorporate songs into video clips and animated images. If Resso adds to large record studios, "his power in artificial intelligence and video recommendations could make him a real rival [for Spotify]," warns a record label executive.But Mayer has little experience in managing the difficult US-China relations, or with the often lascive content he has made TikTok popular and controversial at the same time. "He's in a delicate political zone," says the Disney executive. "It has to increase the transparency of American business, and make it acceptable to the political class in the US. It also has to align TikTok with its Chinese owners, and has no experience in any of it."SecurityThe company awaits the outcome of a national security investigation in the US. Politicians have criticized her for the unproven potential of her sharing data from foreign users with the Chinese government, and for its control of content. "We have a communication problem with political leaders," explains Bill Ford, a member of ByteDance's board of directors and an investor through his Venture Capital Group General Atlantic. "Everything that is said about us, since we were part of the Communist Party to sharing TikTok data with the Chinese government is objectively incorrect."Kevin Mayer, new CEO of Bytedance, the Chinese company that owns Tik Tok. EXPANSIONWhile trying to calm markets outside China, ByteDance weighs the extent to which TikTok should split from its Beijing matrix. Ford explained that they were working on creating a TikTok board of directors, although he subsequently added in a statement that there were no plans to create a separate "board of directors". Both he and a TikTok spokesman explained that the company was studying instead creating more advisory positionsExternal."The most important thing is to create a structure that offers the confidence to know that TikTok is managed in compliance with U.S. standards and global standards,"says Philippe Laffont, a Member of ByteDance's board and head of the Coatue Management technology hedge fund."They will carry out product development in the US and TikTok will end up going public in New York," the Disney executive predicts. But one investor at ByteDance denies it: "There are other ways to solve problems and address fears about things like data privacy. We'll have to be one more everywhere."Perfect trajectoryNo trajectory could be more prominent in Washington's eyes than Mayer's pedigree at Disney, especially in the face of TikTok's headaches to protect children from using his app. Last year, the Federal Trade Commission fined him $5.7 million for misusing children's data.For ByteDance, Mayer represents the bridgehead of its global expansion plans. In March, its founder Zhang Yiming announced that it intended to have 100,000 employees by the end of 2020, an increase of 40,000, the equivalent of hiring virtually all of Facebook's workforce in nine months.In April, the company announced 10,000 new jobs, which outside China were concentrated in the US, London and Singapore. In the US, ByteDance has hired executives like Erich Andersen, a former Microsoft Vice President who will be its global general counsel; Ole Obermann, a former vice president of Warner Music; Blake Chandlee, former Facebook advertising manager and Vanessa Pappas, youTube's former director of creative ideas.But several U.S. executives have turned down offers, and some of the new signings felt "tainted" by the fact that the last word on decisions was held by Beijing, according to two people in the media industry.Apart from hiring, Mayer is responsible for making Bytedance's international business profitable and expanding its catalog of music, games and videos outside China. If successful, you will have created the first truly global Chinese software brand. Bytedance's foreign business contributed 1% of its 130,000 to 140 billion yuan (16,600 to 17.9 billion euros) of revenue last year, according to the Chinese media portal LatePost, which reports that this year it intends to increase revenue to 180 billion, and multiply by five foreign revenues to 7.5 billion.TikTok's sister app in China, Douyin, is the main driver of the company's sales, and ByteDance currently owns about 20% of the local online advertising market, according to investor Tiger Global, suggesting annual sales of $15 billion.But although he has been appointed Chief Operating Officer of Bytedance, Mayer's responsibility is the foreign business. He will not oversee the company's operations in China. His trajectory indicates that TikTok can invest more in content, and is already considering commissioning to record companies, and ways to monetize his list of creators.His hiring is "a clear sign that [ByteDance] wants to be a full-fledged media company," explains a music industry executive engaged in negotiations with TikTok. "The innovator's manual has brought them to this point. But Kevin Mayer's hiring suggests that his ambitions to grow and go public will take precedence."Load-Date: June 3, 2020End of Document

5 things to know for June 30: Coronavirus, SCOTUS, White House, China, social mediaCNN.comJune 24, 2020 Wednesday 6:03 AM ESTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: USLength: 1096 wordsByline: By AJ Willingham, CNNBodyThe FBI wants you to be on the lookout for fake coronavirus antibody tests, which scammers could be using to steal personal information.Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.(You can also get "5 Things You Need to Know Today" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)1. CoronavirusAt least 16 states have now paused their reopening plans due to surging coronavirus numbers, but experts warn it may already be too late to stop the next wave of infections. The virus has been especially rampant in Arizona, and the state is closing bars, gyms and other businesses for another 30 days as a precaution. In Florida, some jurisdictions are requiring the use of face masks, including in Jacksonville, where President Trump is expected to accept the Republican presidential nomination in less than two months. Across the pond, the European Union is preparing to reopen its external border to 15 countries outside the bloc as early as tomorrow. China is on the list, but the US reportedly is not. In case that wasn't enough bad news, Chinese researchers have discovered a new type of swine flu called the G4 virus that can infect humans and has what researchers call "all the essential hallmarks of a candidate pandemic virus."2. SCOTUSThe Supreme Court has blocked a controversial Louisiana law that critics said would have effectively banned abortion in the state. Chief Justice John Roberts sided with liberal justices in the 5-4 decision, marking yet another time he has subverted an expected outcome from the conservative-majority court. The ruling is a big win for abortion rights advocates who claimed the law was not medically necessary and was simply a veiled attempt to restrict access to the procedure. The law would have barred doctors from performing abortions unless they had admitting privileges at a nearby hospital (the Supreme Court struck down a similar Texas law four years ago). However, even those celebrating the ruling are concerned that the wording of a footnote by Roberts could leave the door open for states to try their luck at similar laws, thereby keeping the controversial issue front and center for the foreseeable future. Justice Clarence Thomas in his dissent to yesterday's ruling wrote: "Our abortion precedents are grievously wrong and should be overruled." In his rebuttal, Thomas said the landmark Roe v. Wade case that paved the way for legalized abortion in the US is "without a shred of support" from the Constitution.3. White HouseIn hundreds of highly classified phone calls with foreign heads of state, President Trump was so consistently unprepared for discussion of serious issues, so often outplayed in his conversations with powerful leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Erdogan, and so abusive to leaders of America's principal allies, that the calls helped convince some senior US officials -- including his former secretaries of state and defense, two national security advisers and his longest-serving chief of staff -- that the President himself posed a danger to the national security of the United States. This is according to White House and intelligence officials intimately familiar with the contents of the conversations, in a report by CNN's Carl Bernstein. We're learning this at the same time a US official with direct knowledge of the latest information tells CNN that the intelligence that assessed there was an effort by a Russian military intelligence unit to pay the Taliban to kill US soldiers was included in one of President Trump's daily briefings on intelligence matters sometime in the spring.4. ChinaBeijing has reportedly passed that wide-reaching national security law for Hong Kong that critics say could erode the autonomous city's civil and political freedoms. The law criminalizes activities like secession, subversion against the central Chinese government, terrorism, and colluding with foreign forces. Human rights groups and global leaders worry the law could be used to target activists, journalists, political dissidents and basically anyone who opposes Beijing's rule. The law is expected to fuel new rashes of protests in Hong Kong, which has already weathered months of unrest due to resistance over China's tightening grip on the city. The US has also announced it will end exports of US-origin defense equipment to Hong Kong, citing the need to protect American security. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo specifically mentioned the new Hong Kong law in announcing the decision.5. Social mediaMore social media companies are making moves to curb the spread of hate speech and misinformation. YouTube has banned white supremacist Richard Spencer and former KKK leader David Duke a full year after the site first announced it would disallow supremacist content on its platform. Reddit has expanded its hate policy and banned about 2,000 forums (known as subreddits) that promote hate based on "identity or vulnerability." This includes r/The_Donald, a massively popular subreddit for Trump supporters that was an incubator for bigoted memes, conspiracy theories and trolling campaigns. Trump-related accounts are getting the boot elsewhere as well. Twitch, the video game streaming platform, suspended an account belonging to the Trump campaign, saying it violated its policies on hate. Twitch, which is owned by Amazon, said the campaign account recently rebroadcast a video of Trump's 2016 campaign rally in which he disparaged Mexicans.BREAKFAST BROWSEIndia has banned TikTok as tensions escalate with ChinaIndia says the app poses a "threat to sovereignty and integrity."Several MLB players are opting out of the upcoming season for health reasonsThe boys of summer are making some tough choices.Beavers are gnawing away at the Arctic permafrost, and that's bad for the environmentBeavers, don't betray us like this.AMC is delaying US theater openings to wait for delayed summer blockbuster releasesYou'll have to get your summer air conditioning fix elsewhere.Costco won't sell its popular half-sheet cakes anymoreIt's the end of a (very delicious) era.TODAY'S NUMBER$3,120That's how much a five-day course of the Covid-19 drug remdesivir will cost through US private insurance companies, according to the drug's manufacturer Gilead Sciences.

Dow Jones Today, Stocks Slide On China Conflict; AMD Gains From Intel's Woes; Apple, Tesla TumbleInvestor's Business DailyJuly 24, 2020Copyright 2020 Investor's Business Daily, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: STOCK MARKET TODAYLength: 1368 wordsByline: ALAN R. ELLIOTTBodyhttps://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SMT0800-020720-adobe.jpgStocks dived, then pared opening losses Friday, as the Dow industrials appeared set to end a three-week rally. Rising tension in China and mixed news in the chip trade triggered a pullback across global markets. Skechers and Edwards Lifesciences were early earnings winners. Intel collapsed on bad news that sent AMD and Taiwan Semiconductor soaring. Verizon helped prop the Dow Jones today, gaining ground after a positive Q2 report.The Nasdaq trimmed a 2.2% loss to 1.7%, as Intel and Tesla took the hardest hits among Nasdaq 100 stocks, and Apple fell more than 3%. The Dow dropped 0.4%, and the S&P 500 took a 0.6% dive, both off early lows on the stock market today. Trading volume was mixed, higher on the Nasdaq and lower on the NYSE, vs. action at the same time on Thursday.IBD 50 stock Advanced Micro Devices sat atop both the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500, rallying more than 10% on news of Intel's delayed move into new generation chips. Taiwan Semiconductor also benefited from Intel's news, jumping 9.2% as it vies for its fifth-straight weekly advance.The mixed pressure rippled out across the chip trade, with Applied Materials down 5.3% and ASML Holdings off 4.5%. Skyworks SolutionsSWKS fell 4%, despite a handlful of price target hikes following its fiscal Q3 results. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF traded 2.1% lower in early action.China stocks took an early pounding, after the Chinese government's expected retaliation to the U.S. State Department's closing of China's Houston consulate on Thursday. China ordered the shutdown of the U.S. consulate in Chengdu.  Alibaba Group Holdings and Baidu each fell more than 3%. JD.com dropped 2.1%. On the IBD 50 list, Futu Holdings fell 2.3% and GSX Techedu took a 4.2% tumble.Gear up for Friday's market action by reading IBD's Investing Action Plan.Earnings News: BJ Restaurants, Skechers, Edwards LifesciencesIn earnings news, BJ's Restaurants jumped 4%, Scientific Games scored a 5.3% gain. Boston Beer Co. tapped a 13% gain as at least four analyst raised price targets following its late-Thursday report.Skechers grabbed an early 4% gain as a deep loss reported in its second quarter was less deep than the forecast from analysts. Revenue fell 42%, vs. expectations for a 48% slide.IBD 50 Growth Stocks To Watch Right NowEdwards Lifesciences edged 0.9% higher, after beating second-quarter expectations and raising third-quarter and full-year guidance. The move boosted shares toward an 82.64 buy point in an eight-month saucer base.Dow Jones Today: Intel, AmEx, Verizon EarningsIntel unraveled a 17% loss as mixed guidance and a delayed scale-down to smaller chip architecture overpowered otherwise strong second-quarter results, delivered late Thursday. Verizon powered up 2.6%, helping to prop the Dow Jones today, as investors dug into its second-quarter results. American Express shares slipped 0.7% after its second-quarter report.Goldman Sachs notched a 0.3% gain after agreeing to pay the Malaysian government $2.5 billion in cash to settle corruption charges related to the 1 Malaysia Development Berhad scandal. The agreement included guarantees for another $1.4 billion "to cover any shortfall in the sale of seized assets from the sovereign-wealth fund," according to the Wall Street Journal.Markets In China, Europe Sharply LowerRising tension between the U.S. and China drove the Shanghai Composite to a 3.9% nosedive on Friday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng tumbled 2.2%, and the risk-off mood rippled out across global markets.Other indicators were less bearish: gold was steady, oil futures ticked higher, bonds eased slightly and the dollar gave up ground against the euro and the yen.Still, markets in Europe swung to broad losses, with the FTSE in London, Frankfurt's DAX and the CAC-40 in Paris all down more than 1% in afternoon trade.IBD Live: A New Tool For Daily Stock Market AnalysisCoronavirus, Global: Brazil's Tragic LeadSince Monday, countries have reported more than 1.009 million persons newly infected with the coronavirus. That lifted the total from 14.664 million patients on Monday to more than 15.673 million cases by Friday morning, a 6.9% increase. More than 27,500 people have died since Monday morning, putting Friday morning's death count at 636,848 people lost, up 4.5% for the week, according to Worldometer data.At the beginning of the week, the U.S. accounted for 30.8% of all new cases reported in the 24 hours to Monday morning. India was 18.7% and Brazil was 11.7%. On Friday, the U.S. comprised 25.1% of all new cases. India fell to 17.7% and Brazil rose to 21.2%. The week saw South Africa decrease from 6.4% of new cases on Monday to 4.8% on Friday.Among countries reporting the largest share of deaths during the 24-hour period to Monday morning, Brazil was 19.6%, India was 18.4%, and the U.S. was 11.1%. Friday morning's data showed Brazil with 21.6% of all deaths over the prior 24 hours. The U.S. had 18.8% and India had 12.3%.Coronavirus, U.S.In the U.S., California, Florida and Texas continued reporting the highest numbers of new cases. California was 14.5% of all new cases, Florida was 14.8%, and Texas was 13.6%. All other states were below 4% of new cases. The U.S. reported 1,149 deaths during the 24-hour period to Friday. Texas represented 18.5% of that total. Florida had 15%. California accounted for 13.7%.Combined, California, Florida and Texas comprised 43% of all new cases, and 47% of deaths reported in the U.S. during the 24-hours to Friday morning.Testing levels held steady, with the COVID Tracking Project reporting more than 774,000 tests conducted on Thursday. That lifted the 10-day average for tests to more than 775,000, up from 761,000 on Monday. Active cases, which counts patients in hospitals or under supervised care, climbed above 2.043 million on Friday, with the growth rate easing for a second day, to 1.3%. New cases had increased 3.8% since Monday.Dow Jones Today: An Important SessionThe Dow industrials head into Friday's session effectively flat for the week, down less than 0.1% through Thursday. The Dow Jones today appears set for a weak start, but the index is sitting on a 2% cushion above its 200-day moving average. So long as the index holds above that line, it will be a bullish week.A drop below the 200-day would set up a worrisome echo of the week ended June 12, when the Dow fell hard back below support after spending a single week above the line. That makes Friday an important session, either reinforcing the support established since July 14, or reinforcing the 200-day as a concrete line of resistance for a large swath of the big-cap segment of the market. The Dow would have to drop more than 400 points just to touch its 200-day line, more to break it.For more detailed analysis of the current stock market and its status, study the Big Picture.The Nasdaq is down 0.4% through Thursday. IBD's Big Picture market analysis noted Thursday that market leaders Amazon.com, Apple , Chipotle Mexican Grill, Microsoft and Tesla all remain far above their 50-day moving average lines, a key support level.Another reading on the still-confirmed uptrend's verve were breakouts during the week on the IBD 50 list, which included Audiocode, Virtu Financial, Franco Nevada and Dollar General. Virtu and Dollar General slipped back below their buy points, but the breakouts remain in play.Small caps were one restrained segment of the market that have, so far, made progress for the week. The Russell 2000 climbed 1.2% through Thursday. The segment was possibly boosted by anticipation of another round of coronavirus stimulus. But so far, it is the index's best effort to turn its 200-day line into a level of support since before the market began its downturn in February.Find Alan R.

Also go Chiefs!Author ImageBodyLink to ImageFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was the only tech executive at Wednesday's antitrust hearing who unequivocally said China is stealing technology from American companies.“I think it's well documented that the Chinese government steals technology from American companies,” the 36-year-old Silicon Valley executive said after Rep. Greg Steube asked him if China is stealing from U.S. technology companies. The Florida Republican posed the same question to CEOs Tim Cook of Apple, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, and Sundar Pichai of Google.Steube is one of lawmakers on the House Judiciary's subcommittee on antitrust who grilled the tech executives about the size and scope of their Silicon Valley empires. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Questioning Tech Execs On Conservative Bias Is Crucial During Antitrust Hearings, Rep. Buck Says)“I don't know of specific cases where we have been stolen from by the government,” Cook said in response and when Steube asked him the same question. Bezos and Pichai provided similar answers, with the Apple CEO telling lawmakers that he has “no first-hand knowledge of any information stolen from Google.”Apple admitted in 2017 to removing from its app store hundreds of virtual private network apps in China allowing users to avoid the country's censors, CNBC reported in 2017. The company built a data center in 2018 in China to comply with Beijing's cyber security laws, which give the country the ability to seize data on political dissidents, Reuters reported in 2018.Google sought to launch a plan in 2018 to create a censorship-compliant search engine in China, The Intercept reported in 2018. The search engine - codenamed Project Dragonfly - would blacklist sensitive queries preventing people from searching certain terms in China. The project ended in December 2018 after employees complained.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Additionally, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned the XPCC for their connection to forced labor and the mass interment of Muslim minorities in the XUAR."Any individual linked to the human rights abuses against Uyghur and other Turkic minorities must be held accountable. I applaud the Trump Administration for their continued commitment to imposing costs on individuals and entities linked to the heinous crimes in Xinjiang. The XPCC's role in forced labor should serve as a warning to any company with supply chains in Xinjiang.

State firm Sinograin, which stores crops, had previously submitted bids for Pacific Northwest shipments, people said.Chinese government officials have asked major state-owned agricultural companies to suspend imports of some U.S. products, including soybeans, people familiar with the issue told Bloomberg News on Monday. Beijing is assessing its situation with Washington after President Donald Trump criticized China on Friday for imposing controversial new national security legislation in Hong Kong.The Chinese Ministry of Commerce did not immediately respond to a fax requesting comment. Sinograin and Cofco's managers also did not respond to calls.There are some exceptions to the order that state buyers Cofco and Sinograin suspend U.S. soybean purchases, one of the people said. An exception is when state firms buy on behalf of private companies, which are unaffected by the cessation, the person said. Another is when state buyers need grains to cover their derivatives positions, and a third exception is if transactions are already in progress, the person said.Original Note:American Exporters Sell Soy to China Despite Rising Tensions©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: June 3, 2020End of Document

Hong Kong security law takes aim at protester actionsAssociated Press InternationalJune 30, 2020 Tuesday 4:43 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 1286 wordsByline: ZEN SOO and KEN MORITSUGU, Associated PressDateline: HONG KONG BodyHONG KONG (AP) — China on Tuesday approved a contentious national security law for Hong Kong that takes direct aim at some of the actions of anti-government protesters last year, in a move many see as Beijing’s boldest yet to erase the legal firewall between the semi-autonomous territory and the mainland’s authoritarian Communist Party system.Details of the law remained under wraps until 11 p.m. (1500 GMT, 11:00 a.m. EDT), when it was published and took effect immediately.The text specifies that those who destroy government facilities and utilities would be considered subversive. Damaging public transportation facilities and arson would constitute acts of terrorism. Any person taking part in secessionist activities, whether organizing or participating, will violate the law regardless of whether violence is used.“We hope the law will serve as a deterrent to prevent people from stirring up trouble,” said Tam Yiu-Chung, Hong Kong’s sole representative on the Standing Committee “Don’t let Hong Kong be used as a tool to split the country.”The law took effect ahead an hour before July 1, the 23rd anniversary of the territory’s passing from Britain to China. Amid protests in Hong Kong last year, demonstrators broke into the legislative building on the anniversary, spray painted slogans on the walls and heavily damaged the electronic voting system.During months of protests, they frequently smashed subway ticket machines and electronic sensors at entry gates, and disrupted service by holding doors open so trains couldn't leave the stations.President Xi Jinping signed a presidential order promulgating the law after its approval by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, the official Xinhua News Agency said. It was to be added to the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s constitution.Under the law, those found guilty of inciting secessionist, subversive, terrorist activities and colluding with foreign forces could face life imprisonment if they are deemed masterminds of such activities.The legislation also states that Hong Kong's government “shall take necessary measures to strengthen publicity, guidance, supervision and management” for schools, social groups, media, internet and other matters related to national security.Hong Kong will establish a committee responsible for maintaining national security in the city. It will be chaired by chief executive Carrie Lam and will be accountable to and supervised by the Chinese government.Passage of the law came amid fears in Hong Kong and abroad that it would be used to curb opposition voices in the financial hub. The U.S. has already begun moves to end special trade terms given to Hong Kong after the former British colony was returned to China in 1997.Speaking in a video message to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, Lam said the law would “only target an extremely small minority” of lawbreakers, would not be retroactive, and that mainland legal bodies would only have jurisdiction in “rare, specified situations.”Critics say it is the most significant erosion to date of Hong Kong’s British-style rule of law and the high degree of autonomy that Beijing promised Hong Kong would enjoy at least through 2047 under a “one country, two systems” framework.Hong Kong pro-democracy activists Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow and Nathan Law issued statements on Facebook saying they would withdraw from their organization Demosisto, which then announced that it would disband with the loss of its top members.Wong said “worrying about life and safety” has become a real issue and nobody will be able to predict the repercussions of the law, whether it is being extradited to China or facing long jail terms.A group of about 30 pro-China supporters gathered at Hong Kong's Tamar Park on Tuesday, waving Chinese flags. Organizers said that the rally was to show support of the national security law, and to celebrate Hong Kong’s return to China.Meanwhile, more than 100 protesters gathered at a luxury mall in Hong Kong’s Central business district, chanting slogans including “Free Hong Kong, Revolution Now,” with several holding a flag representing an independent Hong Kong as well as posters condemning the law.The law’s passage “represents the greatest threat to human rights in the city’s recent history,” said Joshua Rosenzweig, head of Amnesty International’s China Team.“The speed and secrecy with which China has pushed through this legislation intensifies the fear that Beijing has calculatingly created a weapon of repression to be used against government critics, including people who are merely expressing their views or protesting peacefully,” Rosenzweig said in a statement.Concerns also were expressed in Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own territory to be brought under its control by force if necessary.“Democracy and freedom are shared universal values of Hong Kong and Taiwan,” the island’s Mainland Affairs Council said, adding that China had betrayed its promises to Hong Kong,The self-governing island recently said it would consider providing asylum for Hong Kong opposition figures who fear arrest.Ahead of the law’s passage, the Trump administration said it will bar defense exports to Hong Kong and will soon require licenses for the sale of items that have both civilian and military uses.“We cannot risk these items falling into the hands of the People’s Liberation Army, whose primary purpose is to uphold the dictatorship of the (ruling Communist Party) by any means necessary,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said his government was “deeply concerned” by reports of the law’s passage, saying that would be a “grave step.” Britain has said it could offer residency and possible citizenship to about 3 million of Hong Kong’s 7.5 million people."This issue is purely China’s internal affairs, and no foreign country has the right to interfere," Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said.He said China would take necessary measures to protect its national interests in response to “the wrong acts of the United States.”Under the law, Beijing will set up a national security office in Hong Kong to collect and analyze intelligence and deal with criminal cases related to national security.Government critics fear Beijing will use the law to pursue political opponents. Some have questioned the legal basis for the legislation, saying it undermines the Basic Law.An earlier attempt to pass a security law in 2003 was dropped after hundreds of thousands of people marched in Hong Kong against it.China for years had put off another such effort. Citing a new urgency after last year's protests, it announced it would bypass the Hong Kong legislature and enact the law on its own.Chinese officials have railed against what they call foreign interference in the territory that they blame for encouraging the anti-government protests. Beijing condemned the protests as an attempt to permanently split Hong Kong from China.Drafting of the law took place amid intense secrecy, with even top Hong Kong officials reportedly not given advance notice of its specifics.Questions linger over the effects on Hong Kong’s free press that has come under increasing political and financial pressure, as well as the operations of nongovernmental organizations, particularly those with foreign connections.The law’s passage comes after Hong Kong’s legislature in early June approved a contentious bill making it illegal to insult the Chinese national anthem. Pro-China figures have also been pushing for more “patriotic” education to be introduced into the curriculum in hopes that will boost their identification with Beijing.___Moritsugu reported from Beijing.Load-Date: June 30, 2020End of Document

Theft, censorship and the 'emperors of the online economy': Tech CEOs go on defensePolitico.comJuly 30, 2020 Thursday 2:36 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 5632 wordsHighlight: Lawmakers hammered the chief executives of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon - and unleashed a host of documents on alleged antitrust abuses.BodyFour of the nation's most powerful CEOs beamed into a Capitol Hill hearing Wednesday and raised their hands to swear to tell the truth as they faced a barrage of questions on one major issue: Are their companies too big and powerful for America's good?Members of the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee came at them with a wealth of newly released documents that could pose problems for the tech giants as they confront investigations around the globe.Lawmakers hammered Google Sundar Pichai about his company's relations with China and whether it steals ideas from other businesses, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg about a blizzard of disinformation plaguing his social network, and Apple CEO Tim Cook on whether his iPhone-maker strong-arms developers on its App Store.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos - the world's richest man, making his long-awaited first-ever appearance before a congressional hearing - faced no questions at all for nearly two hours, before offering an inconclusive answer on whether the company uses data to undermine its third-party merchants. Amazon is still facing allegations that one of its executives misled Congress about that same issue last year.The virtual testimony comes at a time of rising legal jeopardy for the major tech companies, who are the subject of antitrust and consumer-protection probes in Washington, multiple U.S. states and Europe.Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.) set the tone early, with an opening statement vowing to check the power of the "emperors of the online economy." But so did Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the full Judiciary panel, who laid out a long series of alleged slights against conservatives by top social media companies - and later got into a shouting match after a Democrat accused him of promoting "fringe conspiracy theories."See live highlights from the hearing below.Amazon is making more money from sellers fees because more third-party sellers are using its services, CEO Jeff Bezos told lawmakers, countering the idea that his company is unfairly profiting from the merchants.But the Amazon CEO acknowledged that the marketplace algorithm may "indirectly" favor those who pay the company to fulfill orders.Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-Pa.) cited a new report by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance that found Amazon brought in nearly $60 billion from seller fees last year - 21 percent of Amazon's total revenue - and that the e-commerce giant keeps about 30 percent of each sale. That amount is up from 19 percent of each sale five years ago.Bezos said the increased amount is because sellers are spending more money with Amazon by using additional services such as Fulfillment by Amazon, where the company stores and ships products on behalf of third-party sellers."When you see these fees going up, sellers are choosing to use more of our services we make available," he said. "Previously they were shipping their own products from their own fulfillment centers so they would have had costs doing that. ... Now they are doing that through Fulfilment by Amazon."Bezos also acknowledged that the Buy Box - which preselects the seller for when a user clicks on a product - "indirectly" favors sellers who use the Fulfilled by Amazon services."Indirectly, I think the Buy Box does favor products that can be shipped with Prime," he said. "The Buy Box is trying to pick the offer that we predict the customer would most like. That includes price, that includes delivery speed, and if you're a Prime member, it includes whether the item is eligible for Prime."In response to questions from Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Ill.) about stolen and counterfeit goods, Bezos said he believes that Amazon requires sellers to provide a real name and address, but wasn't sure whether a phone number is required. He also said he didn't know how many resources Amazon devotes to seller verification.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos took a rare swipe against a core feature of his Silicon Valley competitors late in today's hearing, singling out social media as destructive for free expression."What I find a little discouraging is that it appears to me that social media is a 'nuance destruction machine,'" Bezos said. "And I don't think that's helpful for a democracy."Bezos offered his critique while testifying by videoconference, alongside the head of social media giant Facebook.He was responding to House Judiciary ranking member Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who was invoking the idea of "cancel culture" and the notion of online mobs that shout down unfashionable opinions. The lawmaker was assessing whether lawmakers were concerned about the polarizing idea, which some question as overblown."I am concerned in general about that," Bezos told Jordan.Other tech CEOs also appeared sympathetic to Jordan's cancel culture worries.Apple CEO Tim Cook noted he wasn't "all the way up to speed" on the idea but expressed concern: "If you're about where somebody with a different point of view talks, and they're 'canceled,' I don't think that's good. I think it's good for people to hear from different points of view and decide for themselves.""I'm very worried about some of the forces of illiberalism that I see in this country that are pushing against free expression," Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Jordan, without identifying specifics.Google CEO Sundar Pichai simply noted the interest in building platforms to allow freedom of expression. - John HendelThe Chinese government steals U.S. technologies, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said - making him the only one of the four tech CEOs willing to say that plainly in response to a question from Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.)."I think it's well-documented that the Chinese government steals technology from American companies," Zuckerberg said.Apple CEO Tim Cook said he had no personal knowledge about Chinese technology theft.Google CEO Sundar Pichai initially followed Cook's line, but later corrected the record to confirm that in 2009 China stole Google information in a "well-publicized" cyberattack.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who answered last, acknowledged that he had read "many reports" about technology theft by Beijing, but had no first-hand experience beyond knock-off products sold on Amazon.All four CEOs passed on the opportunity to suggest how Congress could better help defend U.S. companies abroad, against either technology theft or excessive regulation.- Leah Nylen and Ryan HeathRep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who heads the House's probe into tech giants, accused Facebook of tolerating a fountain of misinformation that benefits the company's engagement-driven business model - even on topics as deadly as the coronavirus. "There's no competition forcing you to police your own platform," the House antitrust subcommittee chairman told CEO Mark Zuckerberg. "During the greatest public health crisis of our lifetime, don't you agree that these articles viewed by millions on your platform will cost lives?"The lawmaker cited articles that drew millions of views on sites like Facebook while making claims about Covid-19, including those describing President Donald Trump's musings about placing disinfectants inside the body or allegations that coronavirus "hype" is a political hoax. Cicilline said Facebook allows such content to reap advertising dollars. But Zuckerberg countered that this kind of noxious material is not "helpful for our business.""It is not what people want to see, and we rank what we show in Feed based on what is going to be most meaningful to people and what is going to create long-term satisfaction," Zuckerberg said.Zuckerberg defended Facebook's policy of taking down bogus information that could cause imminent harm and its attempt to highlight authoritative guidance. But Cicilline brought up a Monday video from the conservative website Breitbart, which dismissed the necessity of masks and called hydroxychloroquine a Covid-19 cure - and which experienced soaring Facebook traffic over several hours before Facebook removed it. "A lot of people shared that," Zuckerberg said. "And we did take it down because it violates our policies.""After 20 million people saw it after a period of five hours?" Cicilline countered. "Doesn't that suggest, Mr. Zuckerberg, that your platform is so big that even with the right policies in place, you can't contain deadly content?" - John HendelApple didn't consider the impact on its own parental control app when it removed some of the most popular apps that limit screentime from its App Store, CEO Tim Cook told lawmakers.Apple introduced its own Screen Time app, which allows parents to limit how much time kids spend on their phones, in September 2018. After that, the company removed a number of competing apps. Qustodio and Kidslox, two of the leading parental control apps, have filed a complaint with the European Commission about their removal.Cook said Apple removed the apps because of privacy concerns."We were worried about the safety of kids," Cook said in response to questions by Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.).Demings asked Cook why the company removed many of the most popular screentime apps but not Absher, an app created by the Saudi Arabian government that uses the same technology. "It sounds like you applied different rules to the same apps," Demings said.Cook said he wasn't familiar with Absher, but said the App Store has about 30 parental control apps after it changed its policy last year. Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Ga.), who returned to the issue later in the hearing, noted that Apple eventually allowed the apps back into the App Store after six months without requiring major changes."We apply the rules to all developers equally," Cook said. "I see Screen Time as just an alternative. There's vibrant competition for parental controls out there."- Leah NylenFacebook has "certainly adapted features" from competing services, CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged Wednesday, but he denied it has threatened to copy start-ups if they wouldn't sell to his company.But Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) expressed skepticism about his answer, reading from text messages between Zuckerberg and Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom and messages between Systrom and a venture capitalist. She asked Zuckerberg whether he "threatened" Systrom and Snap CEO Evan Spiegel by saying he would clone their products if they didn't sell to Facebook. The company bought Instagram in 2012, but Snap rebuffed offers to sell to the social network. The House subcommittee also posted those documents to its website Wednesday."I'm not sure what you would mean by 'threaten,'" Zuckerberg said, referring to the company's effort to build an app called Facebook Camera. "It was public we were building a camera app at the time. That was a well-documented thing."It was clear this was a space we were going to compete in one way or another," he said. "I don't think those are a threat in any way."Jayapal reminded Zuckerberg he was under oath while testifying.In closing her questioning, Jayapal said she didn't believe threats should be a normal business practice. "Facebook is a case study in monopoly power, in my opinion, because your company harvests and monetizes our data and then your company uses that data to spy on your competitors and copy, acquire and kill rivals," she said. "You've used Facebook's power to threaten smaller competitors and ensure you always get your way. These tactics reinforce Facebook's dominance." - Leah NylenHouse Judiciary Democrats lost a big potential GOP ally if they had any hopes of bipartisan recommendations to update antitrust law as part of their probe into tech giants. "I have reached the conclusion that we do not need to change our antitrust laws," Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), the top Republican on the antitrust subcommittee, said hours into the hearing on alleged bad behavior by Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook. "They've been working just fine. The question here is the question of enforcement of those antitrust laws."The subcommittee's probe has been led by Chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who has been preparing a report to conclude the long investigation. GOP buy-in would strongly bolster its conclusions, including potential recommendations for updates to antitrust law.Notably, Sensenbrenner seemed to support the probe itself and said he's "been working with the chairman for over a year on this bipartisan investigation." His support runs counter to some Republicans who have disparaged Democratic handling of the probe. But Congress shouldn't toss out a century of precedent, added the retiring House Republican. He said lawmakers should instead pressure antitrust regulators like the Federal Trade Commission, an agency that has faced accusations of going lightly on companies like Facebook and Google.  - John HendelTempers flared more than two hours into the hearing after Rep. Mary Scanlon (D-Pa.) began her questioning with a dismissal of what she called "fringe conspiracy theories" of House Judiciary ranking member Jim Jordan (R-Ohio).That prompted an outburst from Jordan, who had just pressed Google on whether it's biased toward Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden and said he had internal evidence of the search giant's interest in encouraging Latino voters in 2016. The only problem: It was no longer Jordan's time to speak, as Democrats immediately reminded him as they shouted him down."Mr. Jordan, you do not have the time!" antitrust subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.) declared amid gavel slamming. When someone told him to wear a mask, Jordan sought to bring up the "unmasking" - in the surveillance sense - of former Trump White House national security adviser Michael Flynn. "When someone comes after my motives for asking questions, I get a chance to respond," Jordan said before letting the hearing proceed. For the record, Google CEO Sundar Pichai maintained that his company is apolitical. - John HendelAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos said the company is still investigating whether employees may have used data it acquires from its third-party sellers to launch competing products - an issue that has prompted allegations that the company misled House lawmakers a year ago."We have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private label business. I can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated," Bezos said in response to questions from Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), whose district includes Amazon headquarters. "If we found someone violated the policy, we would take action against them."The Wall Street Journal reported this year that Amazon employees frequently looked at seller data to help determine what products the company should offer, contrary to what an Amazon executive told the House a year ago. Jayapal also quoted a former Amazon employee as telling the panel that seller data is "a candy shop. Everyone can have access to anything they want."Bezos also acknowledged that while company policy might prevent employees from looking at a specific seller's information, they could look at aggregate data. Jayapal and The Wall Street Journal story noted that Amazon workers took advantage of that by pairing a successful seller with one who had little business to gain insights into particular products."You have access to data that other sellers do not have," Jayapal said. "The whole goal of this committee's work is to make sure that there are more Amazons, that there are more Apples, that there are more companies that get to innovate and small businesses get to thrive. ...That is why we need to regulate these marketplaces so that no company has a platform so dominant that it is essentially a monopoly."- Leah NylenThe first batch of questions saw the CEOs collectively struggle to directly answer lawmakers, who came armed with well-researched questions and strong opinions - a shift in gear from previous congressional tech hearings. The one exception was Jeff Bezos, who escaped all questions for the first hour. As Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended his company's management of Instagram, citing the Federal Trade Commission's original decision not to challenge the company's 2012 merger with Instagram, hearing chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.) dismissed Zuckerberg, saying the "failures" of the FTC in 2012 "do not alleviate" Facebook's current antitrust challenges. Google CEO Sundar Pichai tried to fend off questions by citing examples of individual vendors using Google to grow their business, before Cicilline cut him off for not answering the question.Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) reeled off a list of possible links and alignment between Google and the Chinese Communist Party, leaving Pichai to say only that Google had only a "very limited presence" in China. He repeated that answer to Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who repeated charges by tech investor Peter Thiel that Google's China links are "treason," and concerns from Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who said in 2018 that Google's artificial intelligence work in China puts the U.S. military at a competitive disadvantage. - Ryan HeathApple CEO Tim Cook rejected allegations that the company's App Store rules for developers are enforced arbitrarily and argued that the company must compete with rivals to interest developers in building apps for its iPhone and iPad. "We treat every developer the same. We have open and transparent rules," Cook said under questioning from Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.). "Those rules apply evenly to everyone."Cook said the majority of apps sold through the App Store, 84 percent, pay no fees. The remainder pay either a 30 percent or 15 percent commission, he said. Johnson noted that Amazon has an agreement with Apple to allow users to bypass the iPhone's in-app payment service, and its 30 percent fee, and instead use the credit card on file in their Amazon account for the Amazon Prime Video app. Cook said that would be "available to anyone meeting the conditions," though he didn't outline what those conditions are.The Apple CEO also argued that the company must compete to attract developers, who could offer apps for Google's Android, Microsoft's Windows or XBox or Nintendo's Playstation. "There's a competition for developers just like there's a competition for customers," Cook said. "It's so competitive I would describe it as a street fight for market share in the smartphone business."- Leah NylenWe're starting to see some fruits of the subcommittee's year-plus investigation, and it's got Zuckerberg on the defensive. The Facebook CEO and New York Democrat Jerry Nadler went back and forth over internal company emails in which, Nadler said, Zuckerberg told a colleague back in 2012 that it was buying the photo-sharing Instagram because it could "meaningfully hurt us without becoming a huge business."Zuckerberg's thinking at the time could become a critical piece of evidence if it bolsters the idea that Facebook was abusing its dominance - and deep coffers - to eliminate budding rivals. Facebook's buying up of Instagram has become a key focus for critics of the company, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and others saying the deal should be unwound. That's a threat for Facebook: Instagram has become wildly popular in its own right, and is central to Zuckerberg's plan to keep a toe hold with younger generations who are otherwise flocking to sites like TikTok."Did you mean that consumers might switch from Facebook to Instagram?" Nadler asked. "Congressman...," started Zuckerberg, attempting to make the case that no one at the time saw Instagram has a general social network app, rather than a really good photo-sharing app. Nadler pressed on: "Yes or no: Did you mean that?"Then Nadler went for the kill, asking what Zuckerberg meant when he wrote that "what we're really buying is time," adding, "Mr. Zuckerberg: Mergers and acquisitions that buy off potential competitive threats violate the antitrust laws." Zuckerberg tried again, insisting that the Federal Trade Commission knew how Facebook was thinking about Instagram back when it signed off on the merger almost a decade ago. That's when antitrust subcommittee David Cicilline (D-R.I.) jumped in: "I would remind the witness that the failures of the FTC in 2012 of course do not alleviate the antitrust challenges that the chairman described." Translation: Don't think this is over just because that agency down the road said it was.-Nancy ScolaA top House Republican used his questioning to press Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg over a recent content moderation squabble involving Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, with Twitter. "It was reported that Donald Trump Jr. got taken down for a period of time because he put something up on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine," Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), the top Republican on the Judiciary antitrust subcommittee. Although Sensenbrenner said he wouldn't take the medication, the lawmaker said, "I think this is a legitimate matter of discussion." "Why has that happened?" Sensenbrenner asked Zuckerberg. "Congressman, first, to be clear, I think what you might be referring to happened on Twitter, so it's hard for me to speak to that," the Facebook CEO said. "But I can talk to our policies about this." Zuckerberg said Facebook would take down any claim a proven cure for Covid-19 exists when there is none, given the potential imminent risk for harm, although he said the social platform would allow free discussion about drug trials and what people may think more generally about a treatment's prospects."Our goal is to offer a platform for all ideas," Zuckerberg told Sensebrenner. "Frankly I think we've distinguished ourselves as one of the companies that defends free expression the most." - John HendelGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai denied that the search giant steals content from other websites and rejected reports alleging that the company steers users to its own products and sites rather than sources elsewhere on the web."We have always focused on providing users the most relevant information," Pichai said in response to pointed questions from House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee chair David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who said the panel had seen evidence about Google taking content from other websites and placing more ads on its search results. "The vast majority of queries on Google, we don't show ads at all."Cicilline cited an investigation by The Markup that showed Google has devoted more space on the first page of search results to its own products -- which earn the company more revenue that if users go to other webpages. Pichai said that Google only shows ads when consumers are seeking to buy products and argued that they compete with other e-commerce platforms, like Amazon, where consumers often go directly to try to find products."When I run the company I'm really focused on giving users what they want," Pichai said. "We see vigorous competition, whether it be travel or real estate, and we are working hard to innovate."The Federal Trade Commission's investigation into Google in the early 2010s found Google "scraped" content from other websites, including Yelp and TripAdvisor. The company agreed to allow other companies to opt out of having their content scraped through 2017.- Leah NylenOne surprise so far in the hearing: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who generally likes to stick fairly religiously to a script in his public appearances, went far afield from his written testimony - including strongly arguing that his 2-billion-member social network is an underdog when you look at the behemoths he's testifying alongside.Zuckerberg pointed out that Facebook competes with other companies that, too, have hundreds of millions or even billions of users. "Some are upstarts," said Zuckerberg, "but others are gatekeepers with the power to decide if we can even release our apps in their apps stores to compete with them" - a seeming shot at Apple, with whom Facebook has no love lost. (Apple CEO Tim Cook was off-screen at the time.)And it's not just Apple, argued Zuckerberg, who added that Facebook has to battle with YouTube when it comes to video and Amazon when it comes to the online ads market.  "In many areas we're behind our competitors," said Zuckerberg. That's not what you'd expect a CEO to a multibillion-dollar titan to say, but it's a direct rebuke to the very premise of the hearing - that Facebook is so giant, so powerful, that Washington needs to step in.- Nancy ScolaRead his prepared testimony here.- POLITICO staffRead his prepared testimony here.- POLITICO staff"Just like the world needs small companies, it also needs large ones," Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos told the antitrust subcommittee Wednesday - while arguing that his online commerce giant is not all that large when considered as a percentage of the global retail market.Bezos, the world's richest person, also pointed to his humble origins, noting that "my mom, Jackie, had me when she was a 17-year-old high school student in Albuquerque."Read the rest of his prepared testimony here.- Bob King"I'll just cut to the chase: Big Tech is out to get conservatives," Rep. Jim Jordan said at the hearing's outset - a not-unexpected outburst from the top Republican on the full Judiciary Committee, who has become a public face of the complaints from some on the right that Silicon Valley is innately biased against them. Jordan also brought up the fact that he'd hoped to have Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter - a frequent target of Jordan, President Donald Trump, and other Republicans - testify at the hearing, a request shot down by Democrats.Jordan also made a last-minute request to rope into the hearing another Republican member, who's not on the subcommittee, to dig into the alleged constitutional questions raised by the companies testifying. Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.) wasn't having it - a signal that he intends to keep the hearing on topic. - Nancy ScolaThe Republican leader of the House Judiciary antitrust panel became the first to raise concerns about "conservative bias" by the biggest U.S. tech companies. In his opening statement, Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) emphasized that a firm's large size doesn't mean they are in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. Rather, how the problem is how they use that power."Companies like Facebook, Google's YouTube and Twitter have become the public square of today where political debates play out in real time," Sensenbrenner said in his opening statement. "Conservatives are consumers too and they need the protection of the antitrust laws. The power to influence debate carries with it remarkable responsibilities."But like his counterpart, panel chair David Cicilline (D-R.I.), Sensenbrenner said he hopes to examine the size and power of the U.S. four biggest tech companies."Your companies are large. That's not a problem. Your companies are successful. That's not a problem either," he said. "I want to leave here today with a more complete picture of how your individual companies use your size, success and power and what it means to the American consumer."- Leah NylenTech companies have become such a political flashpoint - and exert such influence on our economy and society - that dozens of interest groups are angling to get their issues into the record today, during a hearing whose stated topic is antitrust.Data privacy and misinformation are two themes that many groups want to see raised. The NAACP is one group with a particularly compelling - though off-topic - message. NAACP tweeted that it hopes the hearing "addresses [the] devastating conclusion of civil rights audit of @Facebook - that company allows hate speech & disinformation to thrive." Facebook denies those allegations. - Ryan HeathThe top Democrat leading the House Judiciary antitrust panel's investigation into competition in digital markets said the nation's largest tech companies have "too much power." "As gatekeepers to the digital economy, these platforms enjoy the power to pick winners and losers, shake down small businesses, and enrich themselves while choking off competitors," Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) said in his opening statement. "Our founders would not bow before a king. Nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy."The antitrust subcommittee's investigation, opened last summer and focused on conduct by Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, has so far compiled millions of documents and hundreds of hours of interviews from more than 100 companies, Cicilline said. While he acknowledged that the four companies operate in different markets, Cicilline said the quartet act in similar ways. They are "critical arteries of commerce and communications" who use their control over access or marketplaces to surveil rivals and wield their power in order to expand into other markets."Simply put: They have too much power," Cicilline said. "This power staves off new forms of competition, creativity, and innovation. And while these dominant firms may still produce some new innovative products, their dominance is killing the small businesses, manufacturing, and overall dynamism that are the engines of the American economy."Read the rest of his opening remarks here. - Leah NylenPresident Donald Trump, who earlier in the day told reporters he'll be watching Wednesday's hearing, is now saying he's ready to take executive action to rein in the tech giants. Trump in May already issued a hotly contested executive order aimed at what he called social media censorship, which he signed in the middle of sparring with Twitter over its attempts to fact-check his tweeting. Under directives from that order, the Commerce Department petitioned the Federal Communications Commission this week asking the independent agency to narrow the liability protections shielding internet companies from lawsuits over the content their users post. The administration petition also asks the FCC, which doesn't regulate social media, to mandate that internet companies offer more transparent disclosure about their moderation policies. - John HendelHeading into Wednesday's hearings, America's big tech firms had similar messages emphasizing that "we're good for America." While that may or may not be true, what is certain is that this hearing has a global audience. As CEOs of global companies, today's witnesses run the risk of inflaming regulators and antitrust enforcers in other countries by playing the American patriotism card. Apple and Google have major open cases in Brussels, for example, and when Mark Zuckerberg appeared before Congress in April 2018, it immediately sparked demands from the European Parliament and elsewhere that he appear. British lawmakers are still peeved that he's avoided appearances in London. We've seen before - in European antitrust cases - companies like Google and Microsoft shift discussions about technical antitrust matters into broader discussions: essentially saying that because consumers like their products, competition problems and hidden costs either don't exist or do not need to be addressed by regulators and courts. Those arguments were effective in initial stages of public debate in Europe, but fell flat over time. Based on their opening statements, the CEOs run the risk of making a similar miscalculation today.- Ryan HeathThe House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee hearing with tech company CEOs will start later than planned to allow time to clean the hearing room, a spokesperson for the panel said.An earlier 9:30 a.m. hearing before the Judiciary Committee's immigration panel finished up later than expected. Richard Luchette, a spokesperson for antitrust subcommittee chair David Cicilline (D-R.I.), said standard committee procedure requires cleaning of the room between meetings.The hearing with the top executives of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google will now begin at 1 p.m., Judiciary Committee spokesperson Shadawn Reddick-Smith said in an e-mail.- Leah NylenPresident Donald Trump plans to watch Wednesday's hearing, he told reporters outside the White House earlier in the day."We're going to be watching the hearing today very closely," the president said. "Because there's no question that what the big tech companies are doing is very bad."Trump has long criticized the U.S. tech giants over how they moderate content, including accusing them of making it hard for his supporters to find his posts. They have denied doing any such thing, although some companies - especially Twitter - have started placing warning or fact-checking notices on some of his statements.- John HendelTikTok CEO Kevin Mayer slammed Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday ahead of Wednesday's high-stakes congressional hearing, where the tech mogul is expected to picture Chinese tech corporations as a threat."Let's focus our energies on fair and open competition in service of our consumers, rather than maligning attacks by our competitor - namely Facebook - disguised as patriotism and designed to put an end to our very presence in the U.S.," Mayer said in a statement.Zuckerberg depicted Facebook in his prepared statement for the hearing as a "proudly American company."U.S. officials have recently floated a ban on TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance. If the company were to leave the U.S. market, American advertisers would be left with less choice, Mayer argued.The newly appointed CEO, who comes from Disney, also said tech companies should disclose their algorithms, moderation policies and data flows to regulators. "We will not wait for regulation to come, but instead TikTok has taken the first step by launching a Transparency and Accountability Center for moderation and data practices," he explained."TikTok has become the latest target, but we are not the enemy," Mayer said.- Laura KayaliLoad-Date: July 30, 2020End of Document

Microsoft negotiates TikTok purchase, NYT saysCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 31, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 396 wordsBodyMicrosoft is negotiating the purchase of the popular Chinese video app TikTok, which has become a mass phenomenon, but which Donald Trump's government was considering banning in the United States because it was a national security and privacy issue for Americans, the New York Times reported.The sources consulted by the newspaper did not specify where the talks are, which could lead to the entry of the giant Microsoft into the shareholding of the app, owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, valued at about $100 billion.The Trump Administration was considering, among other measures, forcing ByteDance to dispose of assets in the United States, especially TikTok, which it acquired in 2017.According to The Wall Street Journal, the decision to force ByteDance to carry out such divestment would already be made, although the president himself, in statements to the media, hinted this Friday that for now there is nothing definitive."We're looking at TikTok. We could ban TikTok," said the president, who said there were different options on the table.Another measure against the Chinese company, creator of Tuotiao, China's largest news portal, shuffled by the US government was to include ByteDance on the list of foreign entities that cannot purchase products and services in the United States without prior authorization.U.S. lawmakers began to look at TikTok with the astronomical rise in its popularity in the United States and to worry about the possibility that the Chinese government could influence the company and the Chinese government may in turn cede data from Americans or promote certain content to influence U.S. policy or other areas.These suspicions against TikTok also coincide with increased tensions between China and the United States over industrial espionage and commercial disagreements.Sources consulted by NYT also ensured that TikTok has also considered the acquisition of U.S. investment funds such as Sequoia Capital or General Atlantic.TikTok, founded in 2014, has grown with the purchase by ByteDance to have 800 million users worldwide and be a reference in viral videos of teens and celebrities.TikTok has an army of 35 "lobbyists" or lobbying experts trying to dissuade the U.S. government from disassociating it from its Chinese parent company, while hired high-profile figures such as former Disney Senior Executive Kevin Mayer as CEO.Load-Date: August 1, 2020End of Document

We will have to pay a price" for this decision, he stressed.The White House, which accuses Huawei of spying on Beijing's behalf, welcomed the London decision yesterday."It reflects a growing international consensus that Huawei and other actors pose a threat to national security, because they remain indebted to the Chinese Communist Party," Robert O'Brien, U.S. President Donald Trump's National Security Adviser, wrote on his Twitter account.Related Note: UK excludes Huawei from using its 5G networksAnd the Chinese spokeswoman accused London of acting "in coordination with the United States to discriminate, repress and eliminate Huawei."(With AFP information)Load-Date: July 17, 2020End of Document

In that spirit, I thought today we could      look at the particularly newsy week the ByteDance-owned video app has had, and then contribute some additional speculation that I will later have to disown or apologize for.Yesterday we talked about the audio-only social network Clubhouse, which found itself at the center of controversy after failing to take action or even make a public comment after users began      to experience harassment within the app. Clubhouse took the same approach to trust and safety issues as most embryonic American social networks: do the bare minimum, and address any issues only      after some portion of your user base identifies a crisis.TikTok, on the other hand, took the opposite approach: censor almost everything, and allow new types of content only after angry public pressure campaigns. This dynamic was captured beautifully      on Wednesday in a story in the Wall Street Journal that charts the company s ever-evolving content policies, which have grudgingly adjusted over the past several months to welcome such      previously verboten content as political protests, MAGA hats,  more than two inches of cleavage,  and   tattoos? Here are Georgia Wells, Shan Li , Liza Lin and Erich Schwartzel:As TikTok has slowly rolled back certain restrictions, former moderators said they have been able to allow some curse words and, depending on the country, shirtless men, tattoos and alcohol.They said that although tattoos remained taboo in China, moderators in the U.S. could allow small ones, such as little butterflies. In November, Dwayne Johnson, the actor and former wrestler      known as The Rock, posted his first video to the app. In January, Tommy Lee, the drummer for the band Motley Crue, joined TikTok. Both have large tattoos.Finally, people with larger butterfly tattoos on TikTok can participate in the Dogecoin challenge.Of course, it s easy to laugh at some of the puritanical content guidelines TikTok has established. And others that have since been walked back enforced oppressive beauty standards, reflected      class bias, restricted political speech, or otherwise made the app hostile to various groups.And yet when critics complain that tech executives  don t care  about all the terrible content posted on their networks   well, this is what caring looks like! Because it was required to by the      authoritarian Chinese government, TikTok took content moderation deadly seriously. The result was a stack of policies that are largely offensive to mainstream American sensibilities.One question here is whether you can take moderation seriously from the start, the way TikTok has, while still allowing a range of expression that doesn t penalize people for having tattoos. I      think you can   I ve been hearing more lately about some new social products that are trying   but I m not sure a single company has gotten the balance right so far.To its credit, TikTok has owned up to its overly draconian approach to the problem.  In its early days, TikTok took very blunt strategies, all in the sake of trying to keep the platform as      positive as possible,  Eric Han, the app s US head of safety, told the Journal.  That was unequivocally the wrong approach. For future startups, though, I d argue it was a useful effort. American startups have had very few role models for businesses that made trust and safety a foundational pillar of their      companies, because Section 230 means they don t have to. But the protections afforded by Section 230 appear to be eroding, and questions of content moderation could be on the verge of becoming      existential. For future startups that want to take a more measured approach, TikTok s frantic tattoo takedowns will make for a useful case study.II.TikTok has other problems, though.For example, the Secretary of State says the United States might ban it:When asked in a Fox News interview if the U.S. should be looking at banning TikTok and other Chinese social media apps, Pompeo said:  We are taking this very seriously. We are certainly looking      at it.  We have worked on this very issue for a long time,  he said.The Trump administration is  looking at  a lot of things, and many previous insane-sounding proposals have come and gone without ever being enacted. Others, such as President Trump s Muslim      ban, took a few tries   but eventually became law.The trade war with China is very much real, though, and has already led to the Trump administration banning government use of Huawei and ZTE telecommunications equipment, for fear of espionage.      Banning a social network owned by a Chinese company would be an unprecedented step for the United States, but not an unimaginable one. And, given that China bans American social networks from      operating there, the move would have a certain turnabout-is-fair-play element to it.TikTok has made several moves designed to promote the idea that the app is firewalled off from ByteDance proper and will not share user data with the Chinese government. (The company says it      never has and never will, though security experts remain skeptical ByteDance could resist a serious challenge from the Chinese Communist Party.) TikTok is registered in the Cayman Islands, for      example. And after Hong Kong passed a new national security law giving vast new surveillance powers to the Chinese Communist Party, TikTok led all social networks in pulling the app from Hong      Kong.But the regulatory pressure is piling up anyway. The Federal Trade Commission is reportedly investigating whether the company violated a 2019 consent decreemeant to protect children s privacy.      And threats of a US ban, along with a Facebook-centered advertiser boycott in July that led some companies to pause advertising on all social platforms, has contributed to a rocky launch of the      company s new self-serve ad platform.Meanwhile, India actually did ban the app, along with 58 others, on charges that they  engaged in activities   prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India.  (It came amid a border      skirmish with China in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed.) In April, 30 percent of TikTok downloads came from India, according to Sensor Tower, and so the blow to ByteDance landed      particularly hard. Facebook, never one to waste a crisis, released its TikTok clone Reels in the company this week.On one hand, TikTok s cultural dominance is still ascendant. Kids are spending 80 minutes a day using the app, and entire neighborhoods in Los Angeles are seemingly being taken over by  collab      houses.  And ByteDance has proven to be surprisingly nimble in navigating the regulatory challenges it has faced so far.But it s now clear that the company s success has also made it a target. On one side there is an erratic, xenophobic American administration that relishes punitive bans; on the other is a      brutal authoritarian regime. TikTok has been adept at navigating between those two superpowers to date   but I can t be alone in wondering whether that can last forever.See Campaign:https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/7/9/21317350/tiktok-ban-india-united-states-china-hong-kong-ftc-regulation-content-policyContact Information:Casey NewtonTags:, Artificial Intelligence Newswire, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: August 15, 2020End of Document

Mike Pompeo Says Britons Died from COVID-19 Because WHO 'Bought' by ChinaNewsweek.comJuly 22, 2020 Wednesday 5:24 AM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 430 wordsByline: Basit MahmoodHighlight: Mike Pompeo is said to have told MPs that the WHO was a "political, not a science-based organisation".BodyThe U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has told Members of Parliament that the reason British COVID-19 victims died was because the director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO) was "bought by China".Pompeo was on a two-day visit to the U.K. to discuss what he described as "shared security challenges" and has already met with U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and Prime Minister Boris Johnson to discuss rising tensions with China as well as 5G telecommunications and a potential U.S.-U.K. trade deal.At a private meeting with members of parliament (MPs), organized by the Henry Jackson Society, Pompeo is reported to have told them: "This is a political, not a science-based organization."When push came to shove, when it really mattered most, when there was a pandemic in China, Dr. Tedros, who was... bought by the Chinese government, I can't say more, but I'm saying this on a firm intelligence foundation, a deal was made... and when push came to shove, you get dead Britons."The extraordinary attack on Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus comes after rising tensions between the U.S. and the WHO during the COVID-19 pandemic, with President Trump withdrawing from the body over its handling of the pandemic and for being too close to China.The U.S. decision to withdraw from the WHO comes at a time when it has more than 3.8 million COVID-19 cases and more than 140,000 deaths.Responding to the claims, the WHO said in a statement: "WHO is not aware of any such statement but we strongly reject any ad hominem attacks and unfounded allegations."WHO urges countries to remain focused on tackling the pandemic that is causing tragic loss of life and suffering."Meanwhile, Raab has denied claims that the U.K. has been "strong-armed" by the U.S. into adopting a tougher approach towards China after deciding to ban Huawei from the country's 5G network.Raab told a press conference: "I don't think there is any question of strong-arming. Mike and I always have constructive discussions."The U.K.'s decision over Huawei was welcomed by Pompeo who said the country had taken a sovereign decision over the technology company.Pompeo said: "I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the British government for its principled response to these challenges."I think the United Kingdom made a good decision, but I think that decision was made not because the United States said it was a good decision, but because leadership here in the United Kingdom concluded the right thing to do was to make that decision for the people of the United Kingdom."Link to ImageGraphic Mike Pompeo LondonGettyU.S. Secretary of State Pompeo is said to have launched an extraordinary attack on the WHOLoad-Date: July 22, 2020End of Document

China Says New Law Will Be Limited to Acts Jeopardizing Nation's SecurityNewsweek.comJune 11, 2020 Thursday 3:06 PM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 704 wordsByline: Tom O'ConnorHighlight: Chinese officials promise the upcoming national security legislation will improve life in restive Hong Kong, which has been rocked by sometimes violent protests as residents worry about Beijing's growing influence there.BodyChina has been attempting to portray its new security law as a way to improve life in Hong Kong, where residents worry about increasing Chinese Communist Party influence opposed by the West.Days after video chat company Zoom temporarily restricted the account of a U.S.-based activist group discussing the 1989 Tiananmen Square uprising in China to comply with Chinese law, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying was asked Thursday about potential internet and social media restrictions that could come to Hong Kong with the passage last month of new national legislation designed to crack down on separatist political movements there. She declined to offer specifics, but said that "one thing is clear.""The national security law for Hong Kong targets only a narrow category of acts that gravely jeopardize national security," Hua said during a press conference in Beijing.Still, little is known about the upcoming legislation that proved the final straw for the United States' eroding patience with the Chinese central government's growing hand in Hong Kong. Back in the semi-autonomous territory itself, Hong Kong Security Secretary John Lee told reporters Thursday that "we will have to wait for the law to be written and then promulgated and then we will know what exactly the law will say."Lee has confirmed, however, that a new police unit tasked with intelligence-gathering and other national security issues was set to be formed with help from the mainland. The blurring of the line between the law enforcement systems of the "one country, two systems" framework has prompted some major concerns.A poll conducted online with more than 1,000 Hong Kong adults from June 4-7 by London-based polling firm Redfield & Wilton Strategies for Newsweek showed that 60 percent of respondents believed "the level of freedom they have in Hong Kong is under threat." Another 29 percent said they disagreed and 12 percent said they did not know.While the 30 percent that supported full independence from China was outnumbered by the 50 percent that did not and those who said they would join protests (43 percent), stop paying taxes (36 percent), stop paying rent (27 percent) and withdraw money from the bank (43 percent) should the Chinese Communist Party exert further control were also in the minority, 57 percent said they would leave Hong Kong under these circumstances, according to the survey.Beijing has sought to assuage these fears. China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office Deputy Director Zhang Xiaoming told residents via webinar Monday that the national security law will enhance the "one country, two systems" approach in place since the former colony was handed over by the United Kingdom in 1997."For the general public, this legislation means more powerful protection for them," Zhao said. He said that residents would now be free to avoid violence, to commute, shop and express themselves freely as authorities targeted individuals and groups accused of inciting the months-long, sometimes violent protests that have rocked the special administrative region in support of more distance from Beijing's rule."In particular, we won't have to worry anymore about young people being 'brainwashed' into impulsively breaking the law, leaving behind criminal records that ruin their lives," he added. "There is still hope for the future of Hong Kong!"Australia, Canada, the U.K. and the U.S. have warned otherwise. The Trump administration has especially lashed out in response to Beijing's new legislation, moving to repeal Hong Kong's special status regarding trade, travel and other privileges as they are enshrined within Washington's laws.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused China of employing "coercive bullying tactics" and exhibiting "aggressive behavior" in trying to get world corporations and countries on board with its new law, which Hong Kong Coalition deputy secretary-general Kennedy Wong told official Communist Party publication Global Times on Monday could take hold within a month.Hua hit back at Pompeo on Wednesday, telling the daily Chinese Foreign Ministry press conference then that "Hong Kong affairs are China's internal affairs which allow no foreign interference."Link to ImageGraphic china, xi, jinping, hong, kong, security, lawANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/Getty ImagesChinese President Xi Jinping (top C) is shown on a large video screen in Hong Kong on May 28, during a live broadcast of the National People's Congress in Beijing.

Officially China passes the controversial national security law for Hong KongCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 30, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 575 wordsBodyChina passed a controversial national security law that will allow the authorities to pursue subversive and secessionist activity in Hong Kong. Many saw the measure as Beijing's most aggressive initiative yet to erase legal separations between semi-autonomous territory and the Communist Party's authoritarian system in mainland China.Tam Yiu-Chung, Hong Kong's only representative to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, confirmed to the press that the law had been passed. The text did not include the death penalty among its sanctions, he noted, although it did not go into detail as if the law could be applied retroactively."Wetrust that the law will serve as a deterrent to prevent people from causing problems,"Tam said in the interview. "Don't let Hong Kong be used asa tool to fragment the country."The law was passed amid criticism and warnings in both Hong Kong and the international community that it would be used to quell dissenting voices in the Asian financial core. The United States has already begun the formalities to end the special terms of trade and other waivers granted to Hong Kong after former British colonies were returned to the Chinese government in 1997.The government has said that the text aims to curb subversive, secessionist and terrorist activities, as well as foreign intervention in local affairs. It remains months of anti-government protests in Hong Kong last year, which sometimes led to violence.For its part, critical voices have described it as the largest erosion to date of the British-style rule of law that governs Hong Kong and the high degree of autonomy promised to Hong Kong at least until 2047, within the"one country, two systems"model.Once the law was passed, prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy activists Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow and Nathan Law posted releases on Facebook indicating that they would withdraw from the Demosisto pro-democracy organization. Wong noted that"concern for life and security"had become a real problem and no one could predict the repercussions of the law, whether extradition to China or long prison sentences.Demosisto later announced on Facebook that it would be disbanded, indicating that the loss of important members made it difficult to move forward.More than a hundred protesters gathered in a luxury shopping mall in Hong Kong'sfinancial district, chanting slogans like"Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution Now". Several held a flag representing an independent Hong Kong, as well as anti-law posters.The law has encountered strong opposition within Hong Kong and has been condemned for its former colonial metropolis, Britain, as well as the United States, the European Union and other governments.Human rights groups warned that the law could prosecute opposition politicians deemed insufficiently loyal to Beijing to detain or prevent them from running for the Legislative Council to run for election in September. At Vanguardia we are committed to providing you every dayInformation with Valor and for the same reason we will love that you followed us on our social networks and interact with us and our community on Facebook,as well as receive the news instantly on our Twitteraccount, as well as sign up for our award-winning information newsletter to awaken your mind Orange Juice and our local NEWSLETTER of VANGUARDIAMX,subscribe to our Youtubechannel and do not miss our proposal of beautiful photos and stories on our Instagram channel. .Load-Date: July 1, 2020End of Document

HONG KONG: FREEDOM HOUSE CONDEMNS CHINA'S IMPOSITION OF NATIONAL SECURITY LAWStates News ServiceJune 30, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 640 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Freedom House:The repressive legislation was drafted in secret and published just an hour before taking effect.In response to the Chinese central government's imposition of a repressive National Security Law on Hong Kong, Freedom House issued the following statement:"Freedom House is appalled at China's passage and promulgation today of a National Security Law for Hong Kong," said Michael J. Abramowitz, president of Freedom House. "The speed and secrecy with which this law was drafted, adopted, and put into effect is reprehensible. The action amounts to new low even for the Chinese Communist Party, which routinely flouts international standards on the rule of law.""Beijing has unilaterally and brazenly superseded Hong Kong's Basic Law, stripping millions of Hong Kongers of fundamental rights that are guaranteed to them under local and international law," Abramowitz continued. "The National Security Law represents a potent threat not just to individual Hong Kongers, but also to the status of Hong Kong as a city committed to the rule of law. We commend the US government's announcement of sanctions against Chinese officials responsible for rights violations in Hong Kong, as well as the US Senate's recent passage of the Hong Kong Autonomy Act. We urge other democratic governments around the world to take similar measures."Background:On June 30, China's National People's Congress Standing Committee announced that it had drafted and passed a new National Security Law for Hong Kong that would take effect by midnight local time. The full text of the law, however, was not made public until an hour before midnight. Within China, legislation is typically open to public comment prior to adoption, and there is a substantial gap of time between promulgation and the effective date.The full National Security Law includes six sections and 66 articles. It outlines various activities that would be considered to fall under the four main offenses of separatism, subversion, terrorism, and colluding with foreign forces, which could result in sentences as long as life in prison.The legislation also sets up several institutional structures in Hong Kong that would be under Beijing's close supervision and control, including a secretive national security committee, a special prosecutorial office, and a national security agency. The national security committee, tasked with overseeing the law's implementation, will not be subject to judicial review.The announcement has had an almost immediate chilling effect. For the first time, Hong Kong police denied permits to organizers of an annual July 1 protest marking Hong Kong's 1997 transition from British to Chinese rule. Prominent rights advocate Joshua Wong announced his withdrawal from DemosistÅ, a prodemocracy organization he helped found, and the group subsequently announced that it was disbanding. Large numbers of Hong Kong Twitter users have also announced their departure from the social media platformwhich is banned in mainland Chinafor fear of legal reprisals for their posts.The new law has been widely condemned by foreign governments. Anticipating adoption of the legislation, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo announced on June 26 that the United States would impose visa restrictions on Chinese Communist Party officials found to have undermined Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and curtailed human rights. In addition, the US Senate unanimously approved the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which imposes sanctions on individuals and entities that materially contribute to China's failure to preserve Hong Kong's autonomy, as well as foreign financial institutions that conduct significant transactions with such individuals or entities. The legislation must pass the US House of Representatives before being signed into law.Load-Date: July 1, 2020End of Document

Bolton: Trump said Xi was right to detain ethnic minoritiesAssociated Press InternationalJune 18, 2020 Thursday 1:15 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICAL NEWSLength: 833 wordsByline: BEN FOX and DEB RIECHMANN, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump told China's Xi Jinping that he was right to build detention camps to house hundreds of thousands of ethnic minorities, former U.S. national security adviser John Bolton alleged in a new book that could make the president’s tough-on-China mantra a hard sell.At a summit in Japan in 2019, with only interpreters present, Xi gave Trump an explanation for the Chinese camps for Uighurs, who are ethnically and culturally distinct from the country’s majority Han population and are suspected of harboring separatist tendencies, Bolton wrote.“According to our interpreter, Trump said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which he thought was exactly the right thing to do,” the book said.That would be a stunning statement coming from the president of the United States, where the First Amendment protects the right to religious beliefs and practices and prevents the government from creating or favoring a religion. It could drive a wedge between Trump and his Republican China hawks on Capitol Hill.It also could take some punch out of the Trump campaign’s efforts to portray former Vice President Joe Biden as soft on China. The Trump campaign released an online video last month that included clips of Biden previously describing that country as “not bad folks” and saying economic growth there was in the U.S. interest.The Associated Press obtained an advance copy of Bolton's book on Wednesday. It was the same day that Trump signed legislation that increases pressure on China over its crackdown in Xinjiang, where authorities have detained more than a million people — from ethnic groups that include Uighurs, Kazakhs and Kyrgyz — in a vast network of detention centers. Many have been subjected to torture and forced labor and deprived of adequate food and medical treatment.The law imposes sanctions on specific Chinese officials, such as the Communist Party official who oversees government policy in Xinjiang. In his signing statement, Trump took issue with one sanctions provision, saying it intruded on executive authority and he would regard it as non-binding.Trump’s alleged comment to Xi was at odds with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s statement last week condemning China’s treatment of the Uighurs.“In China, state-sponsored repression against all religions continues to intensify,” Pompeo said in releasing the department’s latest annual International Religious Freedom report. "The Chinese Communist Party is now ordering religious organizations to obey CCP leadership and infuse communist dogma into their teachings and practice of their faith. The mass detentions of Uighurs in Xinjiang continues."It also contradicts the position of lawmakers who have taken hard-line positions against Beijing.Republican Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said “the internment of at least a million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities is reprehensible and inexcusable, and the Chinese Communist Party and government must be held to account.”Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said the legislation was evidence that the U.S. supports the Uighurs and “will not sit idly by as the Chinese government and communist party commit egregious human rights abuses and crimes against humanity.”Nihad Awad, director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Washington-based Muslim civil rights and advocacy group, said he thought it was ironic that Trump signed the legislation on the same day that details of Bolton’s book became public.“We condemn President’s Trump’s reported approval of China’s concentration camps -- places of untold suffering, torture, abuse, rape, and death — for Uyghur Muslims,” Awad said. “Congress must immediately investigate whether Trump gave his blessing to round up, imprison and oppress an ethnic religious community in concentration camps.”The bill was expected to further inflame already tense relations between the U.S. and China amid the Trump administration’s criticism of Beijing’s response to the outbreak of the coronavirus.Trump issued a statement upon signing the legislation that the new law would hold “perpetrators of human rights violations” accountable.The law requires the U.S. government to report to Congress on violations of human rights in Xinjiang as well as China’s acquisition of technology used for mass detention and surveillance. It also requires American authorities to look into the pervasive reports of harassment and threats of Uighurs and other Chinese nationals in the United States.Sen. Jeff Merkley, a co-sponsor of the legislation, said the act requires the secretary of state to determine whether individuals responsible for “appalling human rights violations” meet the criteria for sanctions. “The United States cannot remain silent in the face of these atrocious and horrifying abuses,” the Oregon Democrat said. “As millions of Americans fight for racial justice here at home, we must also stand strong as a champion of human rights abroad.”Load-Date: June 17, 2020End of Document

India's veto on TikTok could cost its creator $6 billion: it lost 120 million usersCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 2, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 827 wordsBodyChinese technology technology technology, ByteDance, developer of the popular TikTok video application, could no longer perceive more than $6 billion after being banned by the Indian government as part of the crisis between New Delhi and Beijing.The private digital portal Caixin cited company sources that give that figure, higher than the combined losses faced by the other 58 Chinese applications banned by India, including WeChat and Weibo, China equivalents of WhatsApp and Twitter.India was the main international market for TikTok, the successful Chinese app popular with young people that allows users to upload and share short videos, with more than 120 million users in the Southeast Asian giant. In the country, the app was downloaded 611 million times in the first quarter of 2020, almost double that of all of 2019. These statistics are only surpassed by China, although there the app is called Douyin.On Monday, the Indian Executive announced the blocking of 59 Chinese mobile applications by de considering them "harmful to the sovereignty and integrity" of the country, as it claims that they are used to "surreptitiously steal and transmit user data without authorization to servers located outside India."A young woman wears a TikTok logo mask in a Mumbai slum (Reuters) (FRANCIS MASCARENHAS/)In its statement, New Delhi argued that this data collection serves as the country's "profiling by elements hostile to national security and defense" and therefore poses a "deep concern that requires immediate emergency action".ByteDance - which has about 2,000 employees in India - had announced in April last year a $1 billion investment in the Indian market for the next three years, and three months later opened a data center to store information for its Indian users locally.With a population of 1.3 billion people and internet penetration driven by low mobile data prices, India is a key market for digital businesses. Many international giants in the sector, such as Facebook, see it as a very promising growth engine.Celebrate the competitionAs a result of the government's decision, some digital platforms in India increased their number of users at full speed, as they search for local applications to replace prohibited ones.Sharechat received 15 million downloads within 48 hours of the blocking order, and now has at least 150 million registered users, announced the Indian social network in a statement.Geetha Sridha, 54, who used to post several videos a day on TikTok, records while cooking with her daughter. He says he'll start publishing in another app (Reuters) (HEMANSHI KAMANI/)The Roposo video app gained 10 million new users in recent days, raising its user base to 75 million, Naveen Tewari, president of parent company Inmobi, told AFP.Political reactionsTikTok's head in India, Nikhil Gandhi, announced in acommuniqué that he will meet with the authorities to discuss the issue, while advocating that the company complies with all the requirements of Indian law and that it does not share information with the Chinese government: "Further, if asked in the future, we would not."Meanwhile, the Chinese Embassy in India issued a statement condemning the decision and calling it "selective and discriminatory": "It goes against the requirements that the proceedings be fair and transparent, abuses national security exceptions, and could be suspected of violating World Trade Organization rules."It should be remembered that China is one of the main proponents of the concept of 'cyber-siberia' and that, under that pretext, it keeps foreign internet services such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, YouTube or Instagram blocked in the country.For his part, the head of U.S. diplomacy, Mike Pompeo, applauded the New Delhi decision on Wednesday. "We welcome India's ban on certain mobile applications that can serve as appendices to the Surveillance State of the PCCh," Pompeo said, referring to the ruling Chinese Communist Party.The veto at 59 applications was announced as China and India try to dilute the tension unleashed between the two Asian powers following the severe border encounter that they took on June 15 in the western Himalayas, which left at least 20 Indian soldiers dead and more than 70 wounded.Indian and Chinese border forces clashed on the galwan valley dividing line in India's Ladakh region, and after cross-accusations of responsibility for the incident were hurdling, senior military and diplomatic commanders have since held talks to soften the crash. The two countries had been holding a military escalation on that border since May, following another confrontation at another point in the 4,000-kilometre border they share, with no casualties at the time.(With information from AFP and EFE)MORE ON THIS TOPIC:Amid tensions with China, India banned TikTok and WeChat over security concernsThe US Communications Commission called Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE as threats to national securityLoad-Date: July 3, 2020End of Document

The Clock Is Ticking on TikTokNewsweek.comJuly 16, 2020 Thursday 7:30 AM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 651 wordsByline: Ken BuckHighlight: Congress needs to smarten up on the national security threat post by Chinese-controlled company.BodyWhat do the Indian government, Wells Fargo and the U.S. military all have in common?They understand the immense security threat TikTok, the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) parasitic spyware app, poses to its 800 million users worldwide. This popular, seemingly innocent app is nothing more than the CCP's version of a Trojan Horse.TikTok's data collection and censorship practices are not only wildly invasive and antithetical to the very idea of freedom, but the massive trove of data the app collects could be used to launch the first strike in a cyberwar on American democracy.We wouldn't willfully allow foreign aggressors to invade our country on foot, so why are we allowing the CCP to do so through our smartphones?White House trade advisor Peter Navarro said it best: "What the American people have to understand is all of the data that goes into those mobile apps that kids have so much fun with and seem so convenient, it goes right to servers in China, right to the Chinese military, the Chinese Communist Party and the agencies which want to steal our intellectual property," Navarro said.As evidence, TikTok's privacy policy for U.S. residents is upfront about the vast quantity of user data it collects and shares with the CCP. "We automatically collect certain information from you when you use the Platform, including internet or other network activity information such as your IP address, geolocation-related data..., unique device identifiers, browser and search history (including content you have viewed in the Platform) and Cookies," the policy reads.In other words, as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently stated, Americans should only use this app "if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party."The app's parent company, ByteDance, is required by Chinese law to turn over the heaps of user data that TikTok collects to CCP authorities at any time. ByteDance is also required to provide seats on the company's board of directors to CCP officials, further cementing the authoritarian government's role in setting these policies.TikTok's censorship of user content to advance the CCP's foreign policy aims is as deeply concerning as its data collection practices.Leaked documents detail instructions to ban videos on the app that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence or banned religious groups. Moreover, an Australian Strategic Policy Institute report recently found that ByteDance works closely with the Chinese government to enable human rights abuses against Uighur Muslims by disseminating the CCP's state propaganda.Thankfully, global leaders are finally taking notice. In June, India took the extraordinary step of banning TikTok and 58 other CCP-affiliated apps due to national security and data privacy concerns.Now is the time for the U.S. to take similar steps to protect our national security.We should start by preventing Chinese authorities from accessing our government's secure servers and mining data on our intelligence and defense sectors. That's why I have offered my bill, the No TikTok on Government Devices Act, as an amendment to the annual National Defense Authorization Act. This legislation takes decisive action to stop CCP efforts to infiltrate our government servers by banning employees from downloading TikTok on government-issued phones. This issue is just common sense—it's supported by both Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate.It's time for Congress to get serious about the national security threat TikTok and the Chinese Communist Party pose to the United States. Let's stop this Trojan Horse at the gates before it does lasting damage to our nation.Rep. Ken Buck, a Republican, represents Colorado's fourth congressional district.

Rep. Murphy Introduces Legislation to Crack Down on Foreign Espionage in Colleges and UniversitiesTargeted News ServiceJuly 30, 2020 Thursday 8:51 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 704 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Gregory Murphy, R-North Carolina, issued the following news release:Congressman Greg Murphy, M.D. (NC-03) introduced the Intelligence on Nefarious Foreign Leaders Using Education Networks for Corrupt Enrichment (INFLUENCE) Act. The legislation aims to limit the theft of intellectual property by foreign nationals at colleges and universities.The Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property estimates foreign actors steal $300 billion in American intellectual property (IP) annually, which is equal to all U.S. exports to Asia. The Intellectual Property Commission estimates China is responsible for 70 percent of that theft - or $210 billion annually.The Center for Strategic and International Studies compiled a list of 137 publicly reported cases of Chinese espionage seeking to acquire information from military, government, civilian and academic institutions. Some examples of these instance are listed below:* In January 2020, the Chairman of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University was charged with aiding the People's Republic of China.* In August 2019, a Chinese academic who was a visiting professor at the University of Texas was arrested and charged with fraud for allegedly stealing technology from a California-based company and passing it to China.* In June 2019, a Chinese scholar at the University of California, Los Angeles was convicted of shipping banned missile technology to his homeland.* In January 2019, a Chinese student at Chicago's Illinois Institute of Technology was charged with helping to recruit spies for his country's version of the CIA.Existing law requires any gift or contract from a foreign source given to institutions of higher learning valued at $250,000 or more to be reported to the Department of Education. If passed, the INFLUENCE Act would lower that threshold to $50,000. The bill would also require schools to report to the Department of Education on the nature of any contracts with foreign nationals on sensitive projects. In addition, the measure would establish interagency coordination on the enforcement of any violations exposing U.S. national security projects, and the Secretary of Education would report on best practices moving forward regarding these types of breaches and how best to protect sensitive information. Enforcement mechanisms of the bill include civil action, revoking Title IV funding, and fines.Murphy released the following statement:"A quick google search will yield several examples of Chinese academics and students stealing IP from the U.S. Especially in light of recent Chinese efforts to steal a potential COVID-19 vaccine from the United States and the escalation of Chinese spying, the $250,000 figure has become too high a threshold for reporting gifts and contracts. Americans should have a better idea of how foreign countries are exercising influence and establishing a presence on American campuses," said Murphy."Higher-education institutions have become a breeding ground for the Chinese spying campaign. Many of these so-called Chinese 'students' and 'academics' are more like operatives of espionage rather than peers and educators who contribute to our academic culture. Some have been clearly documented as members of the People's Liberation Army."The Chinese government often pays much higher tuition rates than U.S. students making them an attractive source of income for colleges and universities. Their guaranteed income now is even more attractive given the challenges of the COVID crisis to academic budgets. That said we need our institutions of Higher Education to understand that Chinese Communist Party presence on their campuses is a clear risk to intellectual property theft. We need them to be part of the solution."I'm proud to introduce this legislation to hold not only Chinese spies accountable, but also colleges and universities who sometimes enable their activities. I hope my colleagues will support this important measure to protect American IP and sensitive information," concluded Murphy.The text of the INFLUENCE Act can be found here https://gregmurphy.house.gov/sites/gregmurphy.house.gov/files/MURPNC_022_xml.pdf.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7192995 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 30, 2020End of Document

BofA raised its Snap stock price target to 28.50 from 24, citing the potential TikTok ban.Snap stock leapt 5.9% to 24.81, nearing its March 2017 all-time high.National security hawks have raised concerns about whether TikTok, owned by Chinese internet giant Bytedance, is too closely tied to the Chinese government. TikTok stresses that it has a U.S. boss, with all its servers out of China. Late Monday, TikTok said it was halting operations in Hong Kong, citing "recent events." Facebook, Google and Twitter stopped sharing user data with Hong Kong law enforcement, following China's new security law for the once-autonomous enclave.Facebook Ad Boycott MeetingCEO Mark Zuckerberg and other top Facebook executives met with several groups organizing an ad boycott over the social network's content policies. The groups, including the NAACP and Anti-Defamation League, made several demands. But after Tuesday's stock market close they said Facebook gave no firm specifics or timetables. Many major advertisers have suspended advertising on Facebook, often halting ads on other social sites as well.Early Wednesday, an independent civil rights audit commissioned by Facebook in 2018 was released. It sharply criticized the social network.FB stock plunged 8.3% on June 26 as the Facebook ad boycott took hold, followed by a sharp intraday drop in the next session. But Facebook stock rebounded that day and kept rising, hitting a record 247.65 intraday Tuesday, before settling for a 0.2% gain at 240.86. Arguably, 245.29 would be a new buy point for Facebook stock, after repairing much of the chart damage from its brief-but-violent late June sell-off.In overnight trade, FB stock fell slightly.Vertex StockVRTX stock jumped to a record 306.08 intraday, paring gains to settle up 2.7% at 299.06, an all-time closing high. Vertex stock moved back above a 295.65 flat-base entry but closed just below an alternate entry of 299.31, just above the June 23 peak.VRTX stock was one of the early breakouts in the coronavirus market rally, clearing a buy point in early April. But the biotech company tested its buy point in late April before rebounding again, followed by several weeks of consolidation and support at the 10-week line.In short, Vertex stock has been doing its own thing while the broader market rolls on. The relative strength line, trending higher since late September, rose strongly during the market crash and into the new rally. The RS line, the blue line in the charts provided, tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. VRTX stock's RS line is rising again, but is not yet at its mid-May peak.Vertex earnings and sales growth are booming, and expected to be strong through 2021.MarketAxess StockMarketAxess stock rose 2.4% to 533.16, clearing a 527.08 buy point after trying and failing to do so on Monday. MKTX stock broke out of a long double-bottom base on April 15, then advanced for several weeks. The digital bond platform's RS line is not at a new high, but had a solid prior uptrend.Tesla Stock And Nio StockTesla stock climbed 1.3% to 1,389.86, hitting yet-another all-time high. TSLA stock is up 15% already this week after soaring 26% last week. But that's modest compared to Nio stock. The Chinese luxury electric SUV maker shot up nearly 15% on Tuesday. The money-losing EV maker is up 41% this week after spiking 36% last week. Nio stock is just below its September 2018 peak of 13.80, set just after its U.S. IPO.Chinese new energy vehicles, which include plug-in hybrids as well as fully electric vehicles, came in at 85,600 in June, the China Passenger Car Association said. That's down 35% vs. a year earlier but up 20% vs. May. EVs themselves sank 40% year-on-year to 67,000. Tesla sales in China accounted for 23% of the EV total. Made in China Tesla Model 3 sales 14,954 in June, helped by demand for the new Model 3 LR variant and soon-to-decline subsidies.Tesla and Nio already have released overall Q2 deliveries data. For Tesla, the China data confirm what was clear: The new Shanghai factory fueled strong growth locally while the rest of the world dealt with coronavirus shutdowns. Nio deliveries are only in China for now — though the company is moving toward a Europe launch — so Wednesday's data didn't offer a whole lot new.Overall Chinese auto sales fell 6.5% vs. a year earlier to 1.68 million, after climbing 1.9% in May.Both Nio and Tesla stock are well extended from any conceivable buy point for now. Tesla climbed a fraction before Wednesday's open. Nio popped 8%, signaling an all-time high.Meanwhile, more-speculative EV plays took a breather Tuesday. Workhorse Group slid 4.3% after also tumbling Monday. Blink Charging sank 15.5%. Electrameccanica Vehicles skidded 19%. Nikola, which had surged following its reverse merger, plunged 18% to close below its 50-day line. Nikola stock has fallen for five straight sessions and eight of the last nine.BLNK, SOLO and NKLA all pointed to rebounds Wednesday.Please follow Ed Carson on Twitter at @IBD_ECarson for stock market updates and more.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:These 9 Stocks Just Cleared Buy Points; Futures RiseWhy This IBD Tool Simplifies The Search For Top StocksCoronavirus Stock Market Survival GuideBest Growth Stocks To Buy And WatchIBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis TodayLoad-Date: July 10, 2020End of Document

Here are all the battlefronts TikTok is currently fighting onCNN WireJuly 20, 2020 Monday 7:23 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1246 wordsDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  In just three years since its launch outside of China, TikTok's popularity has skyrocketed. The video-sharing social media platform is the No. 1 app on the Google Play Store and number two on Apple App Store, and has been downloaded more than 165 million times by US consumers. The app is now a source for everything from viral dance routines to pranks on the President, and has propped up the plush lifestyles of teen influencers living in Los Angeles "collab houses." But TikTok's success --- and its status as the first Chinese-owned social media platform to garner widespread adoption outside its home market --- is looking increasingly tenuous.US officials say they're considering banning the app over security concerns related to TikTok and its parent company, Beijing-based internet company ByteDance, following a similar decision by India. In the meantime, at least one US corporation is already taking action to restrict use of the app on company phones. The situation has TikTok scrambling to try to prove its reliability.At the same time, the company pulled out of Hong Kong after China imposed a controversial national security law, becoming one of several tech companies to express concerns about the legislation. And TikTok's competitors have proven eager to pounce on its challenges and try to win over its audience with similar offerings. "One of the things that troubles me about it is, it's something that is counter to the spirit of the internet," said Mark Lemley, a law professor at Stanford who teaches internet law. "I think something significant is lost there if the only apps we get are US apps or apps from approved countries. We lose out as consumers on technology that people like ... but in the long run the US also loses out economically, because we have been the great driver of the Internet."Possible trouble ahead TikTok has already lost access to one of the world's largest digital markets.India banned TikTok and 58 other Chinese apps last month following a border clash between India and China, citing a "threat to sovereignty and integrity." The app had been downloaded in India more than 660 million times since 2017, and some of its top stars live in the country. Now, Trump administration officials are considering a similar measure. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News' Laura Ingraham earlier this month that the White House is "looking at" banning Chinese apps, including TikTok, and said US officials are "taking this very seriously." Pompeo added that people should only download TikTok "if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party."On Wednesday, Pompeo said, "we hope to have a set of decisions shortly" with regards to the app. "We're working through a process where all the relevant agencies and the private sector are getting to say their piece," Pompeo said in a live interview with The Hill. "Whether it's TikTok or any of the other Chinese communications platforms, apps, infrastructure, this administration has taken seriously the requirement to protect the American people from having their information end up in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party."US politicians have repeatedly criticized TikTok, accusing it of being a threat to national security because its parent company is based in China and could be compelled to share data with the Chinese government. TikTok has called the concerns "unfounded" and security experts say it's not clear that the app presents a true national security concern. Talk of the potential ban also comes amid larger tensions between the United States and China over technology. It's not just the Trump administration --- lawmakers, including Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, have also introduced legislation that would ban TikTok from US government devices. Both Democratic and Republican national committees have warned their staffs about using the app. Wells Fargo on Monday banned its employees from using the app on company devices because of security concerns. "Due to concerns about TikTok's privacy and security controls and practices, and because corporate-owned devices should be used for company business only, we have directed those employees to remove the app from their devices," a statement from a Wells Fargo spokesperson said. The Wells Fargo decision came after Amazon told employees to delete TikTok from work phones --- but Amazon quickly backtracked on the request, saying it had been sent "in error." Forced to address security concernsFor its part, TikTok says it operates separately from ByteDance. TikTok's head of US public policy Michael Beckerman said in a statement to CNN there is a lot of "misinformation about TikTok right now." The company says it stores US user data in Virginia, with backup in Singapore, and "we work to minimize access across regions," Beckerman said. TikTok also hired an American CEO earlier this year, Disney veteran Kevin Mayer, a move widely seen at least in part as an effort to win over US lawmakers. But it appears even those steps may not be enough to alleviate the security concerns that threaten to undermine its growth, so the company is now considering a corporate restructuring aimed further distancing itself from China.The changes could include establishing a headquarters for the video app outside of China or a new management board to distance the service from the country, according to The Wall Street Journal. The company is also quickly expanding its presence in Washington DC. Beckerman said the company is creating so-called "Transparency Centers" in the nation's capital and in Los Angeles "so that lawmakers and invited experts can see for themselves how we moderate content and keep our users' data secure.""We remain fully committed to protecting our users' privacy and security as we build a platform that inspires creativity and brings joy for hundreds of millions of people around the world," a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement to CNN last week. Stanford's Lemley said the app's dedicated teen fanbase could also end up proving helpful. "Is there a revolt among the teenagers of the world?" Lemley said. "I say that jokingly, but only half jokingly. If a bunch of congressmen go to their teenagers and say they've banned their favorite app, there might be a lot of pushback and that could matter."Competition ready to pounce Facebook's efforts to overtake TikTok with a copycat app have so far been unsuccessful, but new bans could change that. Days after India banned TikTok, Facebook-owned Instagram began testing its own app, Reels, in the country. On Friday, Instagram said it's preparing to launch reels in the United States and 50 other countries, just one week after it began testing the platform in India.Indian companies are also looking to benefit. One homegrown video-sharing app, Roposo, said that before the TikTok ban was announced, it had recorded 50 million downloads since its 2014 launch. After the announcement, the company said it received another 22 million downloads in just two days.And while TikTok is still fully functional in the United States, some creators on the app are already trying to transition their audiences to other platforms, including Instagram and YouTube, in anticipation of a ban.YouTube plans to launch a competitor to TikTok, called Shorts, by the end of the year, according to The Information.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

U.S. Navy: China Becoming Concern for U.S. Commanders in EuropeTargeted News ServiceJuly 1, 2020 Wednesday 8:43 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1326 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Navy issued the following story:It seems counter-intuitive, but China is increasingly a concern for the commander of U.S. Naval Forces in Europe and Africa and NATO's Allied Joint Force Command.Navy Adm. James G. Foggo told the participants of a webinar sponsored by the International Institute of Strategic Studies that China is actively working in Europe and Africa to subvert the international rules-based infrastructure that has maintained peace since the end of World War II.China's whole-of-government approach has expanded out of the Indo-Pacific into the Arctic, Europe and Africa. In this region China is conducting unsafe intercepts of aircraft and ships, he said. It is threatening nations. China has established an overseas military base in the Horn of Africa, and is looking to control other ports.China is "purchasing news outlets and entertainment companies to push its propaganda and erase any criticism against its government," he said. Chinese leaders are meddling in elections across the world, "restricting information about the coronavirus and donating equipment and personnel, even in Europe as a way to show that it is a world leader."The Chinese One Belt, One Road initiative combines economic, diplomatic, military and political arms to change the international rules-based architecture. They are offering financial relief and opportunities to nations, especially in Africa, and then using that to influence the governments. "This type of influence is a security concern, and it could be used to restrict access to key seaports and airport facilities while providing access to sensitive government and military information through the technology of state-owned and state-controlled enterprises," he said.In the past decade a lot has changed. Ten years ago, it was possible for U.S. officials to envision working with China and Russia.But that was before Russia illegally annexed Crimea from Ukraine. That was before China started building and fortifying islands in the South China Sea and East China Sea. That was before both nations began a huge military build-up, and before both nations conducted cyber operations against other nations. Finally, that was before Russia and China meddled in domestic politics."China has even labeled itself as a 'near Arctic country,'" he said, complicating an already complicated situation as new sea lanes of communication open in the North. "NATO can no longer ignore China's activities in Europe," he said. "Things like 5G -- the Trojan horse. Buying port infrastructure, and the One Belt, One Road initiative."Foggo's responsibility spans from the North Pole to South Africa, from the middle of the Atlantic to the Mediterranean, Black, Barents, Caspian and Baltic seas. There are 93 countries in this region with 23 percent of the world's population.The admiral gave a virtual tour of the area of operations beginning with the North. The United States has long been an Arctic nation -- it was Navy Rear Adm. Robert Peary who led the first expedition to reach the North Pole. "The diminishing ice coverage is causing competition to emerge in this new area," he said. "The High North is attracting global interest with abundant natural resources and opening maritime routes that have not been navigable before."Russia, with its long Arctic coast, is aggressively pursuing its interests in the region. They are building new ice breakers and arming them with offensive weaponry. They are re-occupying old Soviet era bases. "We're seeing a new era of maritime competition in the Arctic, and strong navies are needed to protect common interests and ensure the timely flow of trade," he said.The North Atlantic is an integral part of the name of the most successful military alliance in history. Foggo believes NATO is involved in the Fourth Battle of the Atlantic. The first battle was World War I, the second during World War II and the third being the Cold War.Last year, unclassified sources indicated there were 10 Russian submarines underway in the North Atlantic. This is a lot even when compared to Cold War sailings, he said. Russia has also already earmarked five new attack submarines for the Northern Fleet. "We still have the competitive advantage in the undersea domain, ... but they're pretty good at their tradecraft," he said.The U.S. Second Fleet is meant to counter this development. "The North Atlantic is critical to NATO's collective security, and whoever can exert control over this region could either protect or threaten NATO's northern flank," Foggo said. "The North Atlantic is therefore synonymous with our security and our sovereignty."The Trident Juncture Exercise in the North Atlantic and the High North was in part a demonstration to the Russians of the capabilities the alliance has and can deploy to the area. U.S. and British ships also cruised in the Barents Sea last month to reinforce the point, Foggo said.The admiral next discussed the Black Sea and upholding international law and norms in that strategic body of water. American and NATO warships routinely conduct patrols in the Black Sea. Last year, there were around 240 days of presence in the Black Sea. "I think that's a wonderful demonstration of our commitment to our Black Sea allies and partners," he said.The Eastern Mediterranean "is becoming one of the most kinetic places in the world," Foggo said. Russian forces are propping up the Syrian regime. They have submarines in the region capable of hitting European capitals with little warning, he said. "Routine violations of sovereign airspace and dangerously ... unsafe intercepts have become standard operating procedure for Russia," the admiral said.Russia occupied Crimea and its strategic bases. It has forces in Syria. They have moved forces into Libya, and Foggo sees this as dangerous. "This highlights the need to maintain a vigilant, highly capable naval presence throughout European waters," he said.The world ignores Africa at its own peril, Foggo said. "Africa is a complex continent of great importance," he said. "By 2050 one in four people in the world will live in Africa -- that's 2.5 billion people. The potential African workforce will exceed China's by 2030 [and] exceed India's by 2035."There is tremendous poverty on the continent and vast amounts of natural resources. Thirty of the top 50 most fragile states in the world are in Africa.Working with partner nations and organizations like the African Union, U.S. and NATO security experts work to build security capabilities in nations of the continent. They work to promote connectivity among the nations of the continent and intelligence sharing."I think we're making a difference in Africa," Foggo said. "We saw that with the development of the 2013 Yaounde (Cameroon) Code of Conduct signed by 25 Western and Central African nations as they collectively sought to address matters such as piracy, illegal fishing and illicit maritime activity. The Code of Conduct framework established objectives and improved inter-regional coastal relationships and joint capabilities. The resulting joint efforts have already reduced illegal activities in the Gulf of Guinea."Moving forward in the entire region, the United States needs to maintain and build the relationships from the High North to the Cape of Good Hope, the admiral said. "You can't surge trust, it has to be developed over time," he said. "We also need to reevaluate our force structure, and we need to champion what we have here in the theater."There also has to be a re-evaluation of NATO's maritime strategy. The last look came in 2011, before a resurgent Russia and a newly active China."Our collective strength, that ability to project power with the help of our capable NATO allies and partners is what enables us to confidently state that there truly is no competition in this era of great power competition that we cannot overcome," he said.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7161209 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 1, 2020End of Document

Following controversial national security law, TikTok is leaving Hong KongCNN WireJuly 7, 2020 Tuesday 10:09 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 764 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  TikTok says it will exit Hong Kong, joining other big tech firms in expressing concern about operating in the Asian financial hub after China imposed a controversial national security law there. "In light of recent events, we've decided to stop operations of the TikTok app in Hong Kong," a TikTok spokesperson confirmed to CNN Business. The news was first reported by Reuters. It is unclear when TikTok --- which is owned by Beijing-based startup ByteDance --- will exit Hong Kong, and what that will mean for the app's users in the city. TikTok did not provide further details. TikTok's decision to leave Hong Kong comes as the app tries to distance itself from China and its parent company, and as the US administration openly discusses banning it. ByteDance did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether it planned to make its Chinese version of the app --- Douyin --- available to Hong Kong users.TikTok's hiring of Disney veteran Kevin Mayer in May was widely seen as a move --- at least in part --- to win over Washington. But on Monday night, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the United States is "looking at" banning TikTok and other Chinese social media apps. People should only download TikTok "if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," Pompeo said in an interview on Fox News. "TikTok is led by an American CEO, with hundreds of employees and key leaders ... here in the US," TikTok said in a statement, adding that the app promotes "a safe and secure app experience for our users. We have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked."TikTok has previously said that its data centers are located entirely outside of China, and that none of that data is subject to Chinese law.The announcement about Hong Kong also comes after US tech companies Facebook, Twitter and Google said they would stop processing Hong Kong government requests for user data while they carry out an assessment of the new law.Imposed last week by Beijing, the law criminalizes secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign powers. It marks a sweeping change that critics say is an attack on freedoms of speech and the press that have long existed in Hong Kong, but are prohibited in mainland China.The vaguely defined rules broaden the power of officials to investigate, prosecute and punish both foreign nationals and citizens for a range of offenses, such as "inciting hatred" among Hong Kong residents towards mainland China.New investigative powers also allow police to demand that publishing platforms and internet service providers remove information that undermines national security, according to a government statement published on Monday. If the publisher fails to cooperate immediately, police could "seize the relevant electronic device and take any action for removing that information as soon as practicable," the statement said. The law is a major shift for Hong Kong, which has been run under the "one country, two systems" principle since Britain formally handed authority of the territory back to China in 1997. The internet is not censored in Hong Kong and residents are able to access social media platforms such as Facebook, Whatsapp and Google, which have been long banned on the mainland.Hong Kong has been a relatively small market for TikTok, according to a company spokesperson, who added that the does not share specific numbers about its user base.In the United States and other western countries, though, the app has exploded in popularity since it launched in 2016, becoming the first Chinese social media platform to gain traction with users outside of its home country. It was downloaded 315 million times in the first three months of this year, more quarterly downloads than any other app in history, according to analytics company Sensor Tower.The app has also recently hit a roadblock in one of its most important markets. India last week banned TikTok and other Chinese apps, saying they pose a "threat to sovereignty and integrity." The ban follows broader, escalating tensions between the two countries following a border clash between the two countries last month that left at least 20 Indian soldiers dead. India has been the biggest driver of new TikTok downloads, generating close to 660 million installs since its launch in 2017, according Sensor Tower.--- Eric Cheung, Brian Rokus and Hadas Gold contributed to this report. TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Hong Kong censorship: Tiktok suspends application, US giants resistCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 7, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 553 wordsBodyThe growing powers to censor the internet in Hong Kong, under the new Chinese government law, generate rejection among American social media giants, and led to the suspension of the Chinese Tiktok platform in former British coloniality."In light of recent developments, we have decided to stop the Tiktok app in Hong Kong," a spokesman for the Chinese group ByteDance told the AFP.This group always denied that it shared user data with the Chinese authorities, and said it did not intend to do so.Hours earlier, Facebook, Google and Twitter announced that they were no later responding to requests from the government and Hong Kong authorities for information from their users emanating from the Hong Kong government and authorities."We think freedom of expression is a fundamental human right and we support people's right to express themselves without fear for their safety and without fear of other repercussions," said a Facebook spokesman.Twitter and Google informed the AFP that they would also not respond to requests from the Hong Kong authorities in the immediate future.At the same time a 116-page document was published by the Hong Kong government, expanding police powers in security and surveillance, under the new national security law passed at the end of June.This text focuses on crimes in four categories: subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces- "Orwellian" measures -These provisions fear a radical change for Hong Kong on freedoms and rights.The head of U.S. diplomacy, Mike Pompeo, lashed out Monday against China's "Orwellians" steps toward censoring Hong Kong activists, schools, and libraries based on that new security law.According to several Western countries, Chinese security law is a violation of Hong Kong's autonomy, which returned in 1997 under Chinese sovereignty after an agreement providing for this territory judicial and legislative autonomy for 50 yearsThis regime, called "One Country, Two Systems", must therefore be in place until 2047.But over the years, part of china's population saw a steady erosion of its freedoms and China's growing power and political influence in the territory.A pro-democracy movement then became large until last year in a political crisis, after seven months of mass and sometimes violent mobilizations.China now enacts this law to end the movement.On Tuesday, Hong Kong's head of executive, Carrie Lam, said the government will "rigorously" implement the law, and issued a warning to "radical" opponents."The Hong Kong government will rigorously implement this law. And I warn radicals not to try to violate this law, or cross red lines, because the consequences are very serious," said Lam, a pro-Beijing leader.In addition, the Hong Kong authorities ordered schools to remove books for review under the new law, which criminalizes opinions such as calls for independence or autonomy.Some bookstores in Hong Kong announced that they were withdrawing titles from pro-democracy activists.The police will also be able to monitor and delete on the internet any information if there are "reasonable grounds" for thinking that it violates national security lawSince the law came into force a week ago, several Hong Kongers have rushed to erase the computer "fingerprints" of their pro-democracy militancy.kma-jta/hg/juf/pz/me/mbLoad-Date: July 8, 2020End of Document

COTTON, COLLEAGUES, URGE TIKTOK SCRUTINY OVER ELECTION SECURITYStates News ServiceJuly 28, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1013 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton:-Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) today led Senators Kevin Cramer (R-North Dakota), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Marco Rubio (R-Florida), Rick Scott (R-Florida) and Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina) in sending a letter to Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Christopher Wray, and Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf expressing concern over the Chinese social-media service TikTok. Specifically, the Senators write that TikTok could enable the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to engage in influence operations against the United States, including operations designed to interfere with our elections. The Senators request answers to the following questions regarding TikTok:Do you believe ByteDance's ownership of TikTok gives the CCP an opportunity to conduct influence operations within the United States, including campaigns directed at changing the outcome of elections?Given the CCP's control over ByteDance, is it possible Chinese officials could direct TikTok's employees to amplify or suppress certain political content for U.S. users?Could the CCP direct networks of bots to create or boost its preferred political content on TikTok and other social-media platforms?If evidence emerges of CCP electoral interference via TikTok, would ByteDance be eligible for sanctions under President Trump's September 12, 2018, executive order on foreign electoral influence?What other Chinese social-media applications and technology corporations present vectors for election interference in the United States?The full text of the letter can be found below or by clicking here.July 28, 2020The Honorable John RatcliffeDirector of National IntelligenceOffice of the Director of National IntelligenceWashington, DC 20511The Honorable Christopher WrayDirectorFederal Bureau of Investigation935 Pennsylvania Avenue, NWWashington, D.C. 20535The Honorable Chad F. WolfActing SecretaryDepartment of Homeland SecurityWashington, DC 20528Dear Director Ratcliffe, Director Wray, and Acting Secretary Wolf,We write to raise concerns about TikTok, the Chinese social-media service, which could enable the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to engage in influence operations against the United States, including operations designed to interfere with our elections.The Trump Administration has rightly taken steps to maintain the security and integrity of our elections. As President Trump stated in Executive Order 13848 in September, 2018, "the proliferation of digital devices and internet-based communications has created significant vulnerabilities and magnified the scope and intensity of the threat of foreign interference." The administration has acted decisively on this threat by forcing media outlets controlled by hostile state actors like Russia and China to register as foreign agents, imposing sanctions on foreign officials who attempted to meddle in American elections, and issuing repeated warnings about efforts by hostile foreign powers to interfere in upcoming elections.TikTok has become a popular forum for Americans-particularly younger Americans-to engage in political conversations. I'm greatly concerned that the CCP could use its control over TikTok to distort or manipulate these conversations to sow discord among Americans and to achieve its preferred political outcomes.TikTok is owned by the Chinese firm ByteDance, and the majority of the company's engineering and development resources are based in China. ByteDance regularly modifies TikTok content to satisfy CCP censorship rules. In 2019, the Washington Post reported that ByteDance employees based in China set TikTok's content standards and issued commands to remove TikTok content they deemed "subversive or controversial." In November 2019, TikTok locked the account of an American teenager who posted a video critical of the CCP's horrific crimes against the Uighur people in China. TikTok only reversed this act of censorship and unlocked the young woman's account after a public outcry.The CCP devotes significant resources to conduct information operations overseas. Beijing exploits the openness of Western democracies and social-media platforms to propagate the Party's preferred narratives. The CCP conducts these influence operations by coopting traditional media outlets, spending tens of millions of dollars to purchase space in major U.S. newspapers for propaganda by state-owned outlets like China Daily, and working to ensure Chinese state television channels like CGTN dominate Chinese-language media overseas.

RUBIO JOINS COTTON, COLLEAGUES IN URGING TIKTOK SCRUTINY OVER ELECTION SECURITYStates News ServiceJuly 28, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 943 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by Florida Senator Marco Rubio:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) joined Senators Tom Cotton (R-AR), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Thom Tillis (R-NC), and Rick Scott (R-FL) in sending a letter to Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Christopher Wray, and Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf expressing concern over the Chinese social-media service, TikTok. Specifically, the Senators wrote that TikTok could enable the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to engage in influence operations against the United States, including operations designed to interfere with our elections. The Senators requested answers to the following questions regarding TikTok:Do you believe ByteDance's ownership ofTikTok gives the CCP an opportunity to conduct influence operations within the United States, including campaigns directed at changing the outcome of elections?Given the CCP's control over ByteDance, is it possible Chinese officials could direct TikTok's employees to amplify or suppress certain political content for U.S. users?Could the CCP direct networks of bots to create or boost its preferred political content on TikTok and other social-media platforms?If evidence emerges of CCP electoral interference via TikTok, would ByteDance be eligible for sanctions under President Trump's September 12, 2018, executive order on foreign electoral influence?What other Chinese social-media applications and technology corporations present vectors for election interference in the United States?The full text of the letter is below.Dear Director Ratcliffe, Director Wray, and Acting Secretary Wolf,We write to raise concerns about TikTok, the Chinese social-media service, which could enable the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to engage in influence operations against the United States, including operations designed to interfere with our elections.The Trump Administration has rightly taken steps to maintain the security and integrity of our elections. As President Trump stated in Executive Order 13848 in September, 2018, "the proliferation of digital devices and internet-based communications has created significant vulnerabilities and magnified the scope and intensity of the threat of foreign interference." The administration has acted decisively on this threat by forcing media outlets controlled by hostile state actors like Russia and China to register as foreign agents, imposing sanctions on foreign officials who attempted to meddle in American elections, and issuing repeated warnings about efforts by hostile foreign powers to interfere in upcoming elections.TikTok has become a popular forum for Americans-particularly younger Americans-to engage in political conversations. We are greatly concerned that the CCP could use its control over TikTok to distort or manipulate these conversations to sow discord among Americans and to achieve its preferred political outcomes.TikTok is owned by the Chinese firm ByteDance, and the majority of the company's engineering and development resources are based in China. ByteDance regularly modifies TikTok content to satisfy CCP censorship rules. In 2019, the Washington Post reported that ByteDance employees based in China set TikTok's content standards and issued commands to remove TikTok content they deemed '-subversive or controversial." In November 2019, TikTok locked the account of an American teenager who posted a video critical of the CCP's horrific crimes against the Uighur people in China. TikTok only reversed this act of censorship and unlocked the young woman's account after a public outcry.The CCP devotes significant resources to conduct information operations overseas. Beijing exploits the openness of Western democracies and social-media platforms to propagate the Party's preferred narratives. The CCP conducts these influence operations by coopting traditional media outlets, spending tens of millions of dollars to purchase space in major U.S. newspapers for propaganda by state-owned outlets like China Daily, and working to ensure Chinese state television channels like CGTN dominate Chinese-language media overseas.

TikTok To Exit Hong Kong; U.S. Mulls Ban: ReportsRTT News (United States)July 7, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 RTT News All Rights ReservedLength: 345 wordsByline: editorial@rttnews.com,  (RTT Staff Writer)Body       The United States is looking at banning TikTok, the China-based short form video app, which has been banned recently by India citing threat to national security. Meanwhile, Reuters reported that TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, has decided to exit Hong Kong market after China established a new national security law for the semi-autonomous city. According to TikTok, the decision was because it was not clear if Hong Kong would now fall entirely under China. As part of its strategy to appeal to wider global audience, the app's design doesn't allow access by mainland China. For China, ByteDance operates a short short video sharing app called Douyin. The U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, during an interview with Fox News, said the country is very seriously looking at banning TikTok and other Chinese social media apps. Pompeo added that people should only download the app if they want their private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party. Responding to Pompeo's comments, a TikTok spokesperson reportedly said, "TikTok is led by an American CEO, with hundreds of employees and key leaders across safety, security, product, and public policy here in the US. We have no higher priority than promoting a safe and secure app experience for our users. We have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked." Former Walt Disney Co. executive Kevin Mayer is the Chief Operating Officer of ByteDance and Chief Executive Officer of TikTok. ByteDance's mobile video app has said earlier that it would not comply with any of Chinese government's requests to censor its content or access user data. TikTok recently entered the Top 100 ranking in the world's most valuable brand for the first time and was ranked seventy ninth, according to an annual survey by consultancy firm Kantar. Concerned about national security, the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week banned 59 Chinese mobile applications like TikTok, SHAREiT, UC Browser and WeChat, after a border stand-off with the neighboring country.        Load-Date: July 8, 2020End of Document

CHINA BECOMING CONCERN FOR U.S. COMMANDERS IN EUROPEStates News ServiceJune 26, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1323 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the United States Army:BY JIM GARAMONE , DOD NewsIt seems counter-intuitive, but China is increasingly a concern for the commander of U.S. Naval Forces in Europe and Africa and NATO's Allied Joint Force Command.Navy Adm. James G. Foggo told the participants of a webinar sponsored by the International Institute of Strategic Studies that China is actively working in Europe and Africa to subvert the international rules-based infrastructure that has maintained peace since the end of World War II.China's whole-of-government approach has expanded out of the Indo-Pacific into the Arctic, Europe and Africa. In this region China is conducting unsafe intercepts of aircraft and ships, he said. It is threatening nations. China has established an overseas military base in the Horn of Africa, and is looking to control other ports.China is "purchasing news outlets and entertainment companies to push its propaganda and erase any criticism against its government," he said. Chinese leaders are meddling in elections across the world, "restricting information about the coronavirus and donating equipment and personnel, even in Europe as a way to show that it is a world leader."The Chinese One Belt, One Road initiative combines economic, diplomatic, military and political arms to change the international rules-based architecture. They are offering financial relief and opportunities to nations, especially in Africa, and then using that to influence the governments. "This type of influence is a security concern, and it could be used to restrict access to key seaports and airport facilities while providing access to sensitive government and military information through the technology of state-owned and state-controlled enterprises," he said.In the past decade a lot has changed. Ten years ago, it was possible for U.S. officials to envision working with China and Russia.But that was before Russia illegally annexed Crimea from Ukraine. That was before China started building and fortifying islands in the South China Sea and East China Sea. That was before both nations began a huge military build-up, and before both nations conducted cyber operations against other nations. Finally, that was before Russia and China meddled in domestic politics."China has even labeled itself as a 'near Arctic country,'" he said, complicating an already complicated situation as new sea lanes of communication open in the North. "NATO can no longer ignore China's activities in Europe," he said. "Things like 5G the Trojan horse. Buying port infrastructure, and the One Belt, One Road initiative."Foggo's responsibility spans from the North Pole to South Africa, from the middle of the Atlantic to the Mediterranean, Black, Barents, Caspian and Baltic seas. There are 93 countries in this region with 23 percent of the world's population.The admiral gave a virtual tour of the area of operations beginning with the North. The United States has long been an Arctic nation it was Navy Rear Adm. Robert Peary who led the first expedition to reach the North Pole. "The diminishing ice coverage is causing competition to emerge in this new area," he said. "The High North is attracting global interest with abundant natural resources and opening maritime routes that have not been navigable before."Russia, with its long Arctic coast, is aggressively pursuing its interests in the region. They are building new ice breakers and arming them with offensive weaponry. They are re-occupying old Soviet era bases. "We're seeing a new era of maritime competition in the Arctic, and strong navies are needed to protect common interests and ensure the timely flow of trade," he said.The North Atlantic is an integral part of the name of the most successful military alliance in history. Foggo believes NATO is involved in the Fourth Battle of the Atlantic. The first battle was World War I, the second during World War II and the third being the Cold War.Last year, unclassified sources indicated there were 10 Russian submarines underway in the North Atlantic. This is a lot even when compared to Cold War sailings, he said. Russia has also already earmarked five new attack submarines for the Northern Fleet. "We still have the competitive advantage in the undersea domain, but they're pretty good at their tradecraft," he said.The U.S. Second Fleet is meant to counter this development. "The North Atlantic is critical to NATO's collective security, and whoever can exert control over this region could either protect or threaten NATO's northern flank," Foggo said. "The North Atlantic is therefore synonymous with our security and our sovereignty."The Trident Juncture Exercise in the North Atlantic and the High North was in part a demonstration to the Russians of the capabilities the alliance has and can deploy to the area. U.S. and British ships also cruised in the Barents Sea last month to reinforce the point, Foggo said.The admiral next discussed the Black Sea and upholding international law and norms in that strategic body of water. American and NATO warships routinely conduct patrols in the Black Sea. Last year, there were around 240 days of presence in the Black Sea. "I think that's a wonderful demonstration of our commitment to our Black Sea allies and partners," he said.The Eastern Mediterranean "is becoming one of the most kinetic places in the world," Foggo said. Russian forces are propping up the Syrian regime. They have submarines in the region capable of hitting European capitals with little warning, he said. "Routine violations of sovereign airspace and dangerously unsafe intercepts have become standard operating procedure for Russia," the admiral said.Russia occupied Crimea and its strategic bases. It has forces in Syria. They have moved forces into Libya, and Foggo sees this as dangerous. "This highlights the need to maintain a vigilant, highly capable naval presence throughout European waters," he said.The world ignores Africa at its own peril, Foggo said. "Africa is a complex continent of great importance," he said. "By 2050 one in four people in the world will live in Africa that's 2.5 billion people. The potential African workforce will exceed China's by 2030 [and] exceed India's by 2035."There is tremendous poverty on the continent and vast amounts of natural resources. Thirty of the top 50 most fragile states in the world are in Africa.Working with partner nations and organizations like the African Union, U.S. and NATO security experts work to build security capabilities in nations of the continent. They work to promote connectivity among the nations of the continent and intelligence sharing."I think we're making a difference in Africa," Foggo said. "We saw that with the development of the 2013 Yaounde (Cameroon) Code of Conduct signed by 25 Western and Central African nations as they collectively sought to address matters such as piracy, illegal fishing and illicit maritime activity. The Code of Conduct framework established objectives and improved inter-regional coastal relationships and joint capabilities. The resulting joint efforts have already reduced illegal activities in the Gulf of Guinea."Moving forward in the entire region, the United States needs to maintain and build the relationships from the High North to the Cape of Good Hope, the admiral said. "You can't surge trust, it has to be developed over time," he said. "We also need to reevaluate our force structure, and we need to champion what we have here in the theater."There also has to be a re-evaluation of NATO's maritime strategy. The last look came in 2011, before a resurgent Russia and a newly active China."Our collective strength, that ability to project power with the help of our capable NATO allies and partners is what enables us to confidently state that there truly is no competition in this era of great power competition that we cannot overcome," he said.Load-Date: June 27, 2020End of Document

Assistant A.G. Demers Issues Remarks at News Conference on U.S. Vs. LiTargeted News ServiceJuly 22, 2020 Wednesday 11:47 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1460 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Department of Justice issued the following remarks on July 21 by Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers at a news conference on U.S. vs. Li, et. al.:Today, the Justice Department unsealed charges in a significant national security cyber matter. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Washington (EDWA) and the National Security Division (NSD) have charged two Chinese hackers working with the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS), including the Guangdong State Security Department (GSSD) of the MSS, with a sweeping global computer intrusion campaign. In making this announcement, I'm joined here by Dave Bowdich, Deputy Director of the FBI, Bill Hyslop, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Washington, and Raymond Duda, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Seattle Field Division.The campaign targeted intellectual property and confidential business information held by the private sector, including COVID-19-related treatment, testing, and vaccines. The hackers also targeted the online accounts of non-governmental organizations and individual dissidents, clergy, and democratic and human rights activists in the United States, China, Hong Kong, and abroad. Targeted industries included high tech manufacturing; medical device, civil, and industrial engineering; business, educational, and gaming software; solar energy; pharmaceuticals; and defense. According to the indictment, these malicious cyber activities began more than ten years ago and were ongoing as of the date of the indictment. During that time, the hackers stole terabytes of data from hundreds of targets, establishing themselves as a prolific threat to U.S. and foreign networks.The activities outlined in the indictment are concrete examples of two concerning trends: first, and one we've seen for some time, China is using cyber-enabled theft as part of a global campaign to "rob, replicate, and replace" non-Chinese companies in the global marketplace, and second, and one that is perhaps less appreciated by the public and international partners, China is providing a safe haven for criminals who, as in this case, are hacking in part for their own personal profit but willing to help the state.As the indictment shows, the hackers targeted technology companies in countries with high technology industries, including in Australia, Belgium, Germany, Japan, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Spain, South Korea, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These intrusions are yet another example of China's brazen willingness to engage in theft through computer intrusions contrary to their international commitments - such as their 2015 understanding with the United States, and similar understandings with other countries, not to "conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information,"[/1] with the intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or commercial sectors.Unsurprisingly, the intrusions targeted industries outlined in "Made in China 2025" - China's ten-year plan for targeting strategic advanced technology manufacturing industries for development. While the plan calls for an innovation-driven approach, cases like this one[/2] show it is as much a roadmap to theft as it is guidance to innovate. The intrusions in this case targeted 8 of the 10 technology sectors identified in the plan: next generation information technology, robotics and automated machine tools, aircraft and aircraft components, maritime vessels and marine engineering equipment, clean energy vehicles, new materials, biotechnology, and advanced rail.The indictment specifically outlines how stealing intellectual property from companies in these high-tech industries could help Chinese companies replicate the targeted technology and eventually edge out their non-Chinese competitors.For example, from one target, a Maryland technology and manufacturing firm, the defendants obtained competitive business intelligence, in the form of testing mechanisms and results, product composition, manufacturing processes, and supply chain data that would have revealed to competitors what products the firm was intending to bring to the market. The same stolen information would have allowed competitors to save on research and development costs and time, thereby providing them a competitive edge in the global marketplace. Similar concrete examples of stolen research and development data include a Massachusetts pharmaceutical company, which suffered the theft of the chemical structure of, and engineering processes for, anti-infective agents, and a California pharmaceutical company, which suffered the theft of the chemical structure of, and testing data for, the treatment for a common chronic disease.The business context for some of these intrusions is also noteworthy. For example, one target, a Massachusetts medical device engineering company saw the defendants steal source code and algorithms at or about the time it had sought to protect such data from a Chinese firm with which it had partnered to produce device components.China's anti-competitive behavior and flagrant disregard for their promises not to engage in cyber-enabled intellectual property theft is not just a domestic issue; it is a global issue. The indictment alleges activity against companies in at least 10 countries around the world. The indictment shows very clearly that no country is immune. Any country with a successful company or industry must be on guard and prepared to protect itself.The indictment also highlights how the Chinese government is willing to turn a blind eye to prolific criminal hackers operating within China's borders. Although the indictment alleges that the defendants conducted activity on behalf of the MSS, some of the defendants' alleged criminal activities were conducted for personal profit. For example, in one instance, Defendant LI is alleged to have e-mailed a target and threatened to expose the target's stolen source code on the internet unless he was paid $15,000 in cryptocurrency.In this manner, China has now taken its place, alongside Russia, Iran, and North Korea, in that shameful club of nations that provide a safe haven for cyber criminals in exchange for those criminals being "on call" to work for the benefit of the state, here to feed the Chinese Communist Party's insatiable hunger for American and other non-Chinese companies' hard-earned intellectual property, including COVID-19 research. With the top cover provided by state officials, these criminals are given free rein to victimize law abiding citizens around the world. All of these activities - state-sponsored theft of intellectual property and knowingly providing a safe havens for cyber criminals - run afoul of norms of acceptable state behavior in cyberspace, which the international community must address.These charges reflect the Department's continued determination and ability to hold individuals and nations accountable for cyber-enabled crimes. In addition to disrupting the activities of a group that was not being tracked as an organized threat by the private sector, we hope the indictment will raise broader awareness of China's malicious cyber activities.We are grateful for the willingness of our international law enforcement partners to cooperate with us in the investigation and disruption of cyber threats. This is yet another example of how like-minded countries can stand together to counter malicious state-sponsored cyber activities.Before I turn this over to Dave Bowdich, I'd like to thank all the tremendous work done by the agents at the FBI's Spokane resident agency and San Antonio field office that led the investigation; the many FBI agents and professionals at FBI's Cyber Division, in Norfolk, and in Portland who provided essential assistance; the FBI Legal Attaches and Cyber Assistant Legal Attaches stationed around the world who led the coordination with our foreign partners; and the prosecutors both in Spokane and here in the National Security Division.* * *[1/] White House, "FACT SHEET: President Xi Jinping's State Visit to the United States," September 25, 2015, https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/25/fact-sheet-president-xi-jinpings-state-visit-united-states.[2/] See, e.g., Department of Justice, "Two Chinese Hackers Associated with the Ministry of State Security Charged with Global Computer Intrusion Campaigns Targeting Intellectual Property and Confidential Business Information," December 20, 2018, https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-associated-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion.Copyright Targeted News Servicesnull-7183473 T40-MgEditorLoad-Date: July 22, 2020End of Document

CHINA'S PROPOSED INFRASTRUCTURE REITS LIKELY TO ATTRACT GLOBAL INTERESTStates News ServiceJuly 28, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 301 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT):China's pilot scheme for establishing REITs in the infrastructure sector, announced in April, is likely to attract interest from around the world, Nareit President and CEO Steve Wechsler told a July 28 webinar hosted by the Asia Pacific Real Estate Association (APREA).Sigrid Zialcita, CEO of APREA, described the announcement as a "milestone" and said the Chinese government is using the introduction of REITs as a mechanism to rejuvenate the economy. APREA estimates that initially, China's REIT market could be worth up to $800 billion, making it the region's largest in terms of market capitalization.Wechsler said that as REITs are introduced in China, given the prevalence of e-commerce, "we can imagine that we'll see great interest in the e-commerce economy tied to warehouse distribution and industrial parks." He added that "what will pique interest around the world is the infrastructure element in the China REITs."Wechsler added that he expects China's infrastructure REITs will be an "attractive" investment option that can build on the U.S. experience. He explained that in the U.S., REITs have been permitted to invest in certain types of infrastructure real estate for the last 60 years, but it's only in the last 10 or 15 years that the infrastructure real estate sector has blossomed, particularly with respect to communications-related infrastructure."We see this as a big step forward on what's been a long journey so far...we're at an important bridging point between what's been accomplished in the past with quasi-REIT regimes and looking ahead as China may more fully develop a REIT regime," Wechsler said.Get Nareit Developments blog posts delivered straight to your inbox.Load-Date: July 29, 2020End of Document

TikTok could be sold to American investors to avert US ban, reports sayCNN WireJuly 23, 2020 Thursday 10:59 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 776 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Could an American takeover of TikTok save it from being locked out of the United States?US investors are reportedly considering buying the video sharing app from Chinese parent company ByteDance in an effort to save TikTok's sizeable foothold in America. A group of investors, including venture capital firms Sequoia and General Atlantic, are mulling buying a majority stake, according to The Information and the Financial Times. The investors are talking with the US Treasury Department and other regulators about whether a spinoff of TikTok would quell US concerns about the company, according to the FT, which cited anonymous sources.The reports come as TikTok faces heightened scrutiny in Washington. Tensions between the United States and China have been climbing as the two powers battle over trade, technology, national security and human rights. ByteDance offers a very similar app called Douyin, with the same logo and branding as TikTok, in China. According to the FT, it would retain a minority stake in TikTok under the deal being discussed. TikTok declined to comment on Thursday on a possible sale to US investors, and referred to an announcement earlier this month that ByteDance is weighing changes to its corporate structure. The Wall Street Journal reported at the time that such changes could include establishing a headquarters for the video app outside of China, or a new management board."We are very confident in the long-term success of TikTok and will make our plans public when we have something to announce," a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement on Thursday. General Atlantic and Sequoia declined to comment.TikTok has been trying to distance itself from its Beijing-based owner for months. TikTok hired Disney veteran Kevin Mayer as CEO in May. Its main office is in Los Angeles County, and it has offices in London, Paris, Berlin, Dubai, Mumbai, Singapore, Jakarta, Seoul and Tokyo.But for ByteDance to sell TikTok --- the only major social media app created by a Chinese company to gain significant traction globally --- would be a big move. And it still might not be enough to alleviate concerns in Washington, where lawmakers and US officials allege TikTok poses a national security threat because it could be used as a spying tool by Beijing. TikTok has denied those allegations. US officials also worry the platform can be used to collect personal data on US citizens or censor speech deemed sensitive by the Chinese government. TikTok says its data centers are located entirely outside of China, and that none of that data is subject to Chinese law. US user data is stored in the United States, with a backup in Singapore, according to TikTok. In its first transparency report released earlier this month, TikTok noted that it received no requests to remove content from China.Meanwhile, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is currently investigating Bytedance's 2016 acquisition of US-based app Musical.ly --- a deal that helped add millions of users to TikTok. Such an investigation could be a blow to TikTok, because CFIUS has the authority to retroactively review foreign acquisitions of US businesses and reverse those transactions. "It does not seem likely that US investors alone buying a majority ownership stake would satisfy CFIUS or broader US government concerns about the Chinese ownership piece and the potential for US personal data to find its way back to Beijing," said Paul Triolo, head of global tech policy at Eurasia Group. And the US campaign against the app appears to be gathering momentum. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other US officials say they are considering banning TikTok. The US House of Representatives voted to bar federal employees from downloading TikTok on government-issued devices. And President Donald Trump's re-election campaign is currently running Facebook advertisements bashing the app.The ads declare that "TikTok is spying on you" and link to a survey and a sign-up for a Trump campaign mailing list asking if TikTok should be banned in the United States.Wells Fargo has instructed its employees to remove the app from company devices. And TikTok is also under pressure in other countries.The company pulled out of Hong Kong earlier this month, after China imposed a controversial national security law on the city. Last month, India banned TikTok along with several other popular Chinese apps, amid rising tensions with China. The app is also facing more scrutiny in Australia, according to CNN affiliate 9 News Australia. TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

TIBETAN APPLICANTS FOR POLICE WORK TURNED AWAY OVER POLITICAL CONCERNS: REPORTStates News ServiceJune 11, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 645 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:By Richard FinneyTibetans seeking work as auxiliary police officers in Tibetan areas of China are being barred from employment over a wide range of concerns, with recruiters told to disqualify anyone engaging in "separatist activities" or having family members who have left Tibet to go into exile abroad, a Tibetan advocacy group said on Thursday.To be considered now for employment, applicants must never have participated in protests against Chinese policies in Tibetan areas or spread "rumors and false information that undermine social stability," the Washington-based International Campaign for Tibet said in a June 11 report.Other disqualifying conditions include having concealed or associated with "illegal persons" and having supported or funded "ethnic separatist activities," according to guidelines issued on May 25 by eight government departments in Kardze (in Chinese, Ganzi) prefecture's Lithang county, a part of eastern Tibet's historical area of Kham."The Chinese government often claims that any expression by Tibetans of their unique culture and religion is a 'separatist activity,'" ICT said, noting that the heavily Tibetan-populated county in western China's Sichuan province has in recent years seen "vibrant expressions of Tibetan identity, religion and culture."Lithang is also important to Tibetans as the birthplace of the 7th and 11th Dalai Lamas, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, and has seen repeated protests by Tibetans calling for the Dalai Lama's return from India and opposing Beijing's rule over Tibetan areas.Regarded by Chinese leaders as a dangerous separatist, the Dalai Lama fled Tibet into exile in India in the midst of a failed 1959 national uprising against rule by China, which marched into the formerly independent Himalayan region in 1950.Displays by Tibetans of the Dalai Lama's photo, public celebrations of his birthday, or the sharing of his teachings on mobile phones or other social media are often harshly punished.Earlier job announcements in Kardze's Dabpa (Daocheng) county on May 2 and in Lhoka (Shannan) city in the Tibet Autonomous Region in December 2019 also exclude persons who have received funding from "illegal overseas organizations" or whose family members have "illegally entered or exited the country."Meanwhile, applicants for work as police officers in the TAR are generally called on by authorities to have a "clear-cut understanding of the political principles against separatism," ICT said.'Perfectly legitimate activities'"In all of the above-mentioned cases, the Chinese authorities characterize perfectly legitimate activities as punishable, including, for example, considering Tibet historically independent, revering the Dalai Lama and criticizing the current political system in Tibet," ICT said in its June 11 report.All of this is protected by international law, and especially by the rights to freedom of expression, religion, or belief, the rights group said.Tibetan college and university graduates meanwhile struggle to find work in Tibetan regions of China despite reports in state media of high rates of employment, Tibetan sources told RFA in earlier reports.Employment for Tibetans in the coveted government sector has been placed largely out of reach, with more Chinese university graduates coming in to Tibetan areas of China to compete for jobs.And requirements for proficiency in Mandarin Chinese in testing and consideration for employment have further disadvantaged Tibetan students, as China seeks to promote the dominance of Chinese culture and language in Tibetan areas, sources say.Language rights have become a focus for Tibetan efforts to assert national identity in recent years, with informally organized language courses typically deemed "illegal associations," and teachers subject to detention and arrest.Load-Date: June 12, 2020End of Document

COVID-19 AND CHANGING ATTITUDESStates News ServiceJuly 2, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1285 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: LONDON BodyThe following information was released by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change:By Multiple AuthorsMax Beverton-PalmerHead of Tech and SocietyAndrew BennettPolicy Analyst, Technology and Public PolicyRosie BeaconPolicy AnalystLizzie InsallPolicy Lead, Renewing the CentreNew Research on Geopolitics, Technology and Social AttitudesThe coronavirus pandemic has had, and continues to have, far-reaching and deep impact on the world. At one point at the beginning of April, it was estimated that more than 3.9 billion people half the world's population were in some form of lockdown. This has been a global crisis, with the actions of China, the United States, the European Union and global institutions such as the World Health Organisation closely scrutinised.As the world adjusts to the impact of the pandemic, the next phase of our tech work will focus on the geopolitics of technology, building on previous reports looking at the governance and regulation of multinational tech companies, their impact on the global stage and the global architecture surrounding technology policy. We are also continuing our work on 21st-century government, seeking to understand the model of a technology-driven government that delivers for citizens in light of the upheaval of the pandemic.To build the evidence base for our policymaking, we commissioned four major polls carried out by YouGov in early June in Great Britain, France, Germany and the US. We sought to understand what people in the West thought about the geopolitics surrounding the pandemic, their opinion on global cooperation and how they perceive the role Big Tech should play in tackling the challenges facing the world, and situate that in the context of how they saw the pandemic's effect in their own communities.The role of technology has also been fundamental to coping with the pandemic, allowing some businesses to continue and people to communicate with their colleagues, friends and families while socially isolated. Much of the technology people have used has been provided by consumer-facing tech companies like Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook. Their products and services have brought significant benefits for people around the world, but they have also amplified pre-existing harms such as public-health misinformation that has been linked to real-world harm and the spread of hate speech. This has recently led some advertisers to pull spend from social media platforms.This points towards the coronavirus pandemic having far-reaching impact on geopolitics, on perceptions of technology, and on the development of new views on the nature of community, inequality and social togetherness.Read the full reports here:Covid-19 and Changing Attitudes: Technology and Big TechCovid-19 and Changing Attitudes: The US, China and Global CooperationCovid-19 and Changing Attitudes: Concerns for the Future and TrustKEY FINDINGSOn perceptions of technology and "Big Tech" companies:Across Britain, the US, Germany and France, views on whether Big Tech companies are a force for good or bad in the world are mixed, though in all countries surveyed the most popular answer people gave was that they are neither a force for good nor for bad in the world.Google is consistently viewed more as a force for good than the other companies, and social media companies Twitter and Facebook are consistently viewed more negatively than the other companies.In Britain, the US and Germany more people see Google, Amazon and Apple as a force for good than see them as a force for bad, whereas more people see Facebook and Twitter as a force for bad than see them as a force for good. In France, only Google is seen as more of a force for good than it is seen as a force for bad (not withstanding that a plurality of people for each company in each country surveyed see the companies as neither a force for good or bad).Across all four countries, people's perceptions and expectations of the role that Big Tech companies have played or should play, respectively, are closely aligned: People do not see them playing a significant role in tackling the pandemic, nor do they believe that they should. This is in particular contrast to the significant role people expect the World Health Organisation and global pharmaceutical companies to play.In general, people in all four countries do not expect to work from home more often after the pandemic is over, though roughly a third do in all the countries we surveyed.All four countries report an increase in shopping online for household goods and clothes, and in particular an increase in online video calls to keep in touch with friends and family. This is especially pronounced in Britain and the US, but less so in France and, in particular, Germany.Read the detailed findingsOn geopolitics and attitudes to the US, China and global cooperation:Both the Chinese and the US governments are seen as forces for bad in the world by a majority of people in Britain and France, with people in Germany having a worse view of the US government than they do of the Chinese government.In Britain, the US, Germany and France, more than 40% of people in each country surveyed hold the Chinese government most responsible for the severity of the pandemic, more people than those who hold their own governments responsible.There is no consistent view on the importance of coordination with other countries on the pandemic, though it is notable that less than a quarter of people surveyed in each country want more integration with the global economy, and in France only 6% wanted more economic integration.In all the countries we surveyed, people have a much higher expectation of the role the World Health Organisation should be playing in finding solutions to the pandemic compared to the role they think it has played in tackling it.There are high expectations of global pharmaceutical companies to find solutions to the problems created by the pandemic, but few people have a lot of confidence in those companies (and in France a quarter of people have no confidence at all).In Britain 60% of people view the UN as a force for good in the world, but the pandemic has changed few opinions of the UN in the countries we surveyed. It's also clear the pandemic has changed few views on the perceptions of the EU in the countries we surveyed.Read the detailed findingsOn the impact of the pandemic on social attitudes and political trust:Britain has seen a greater surge in community spirit in response to the pandemic than the other countries surveyed.People in Britain are much more worried about the economy in general than they are about their health. But they are generally as worried about their health as about their own individual economic circumstances.Across all four countries, more people are more concerned about others than are concerned about their own situation, with worries about families' health and the broader economy more widespread than for individual circumstances.There is political polarisation as to who bears responsibility for the severity of the pandemic, and who is trusted to address it.Read the detailed findingsBackground to the ResearchThe source of this data is polling conducted by You Gov of a sample of 8,494 adults in Great Britain, the US, Germany and France. The sample was made up of 2,033 adults in GB between 4 and 15 June 2020; 2,418 adults in the US between 8 and 11 June 2020; 2,020 adults in Germany between 9 and 12 June 2020 and 2,023 adults in France between 9 and 11 June 2020.

Global stocks rise as investors shrug off US-China tensionsCNN WireJune 1, 2020 Monday 7:54 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 702 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Hong Kong stocks are on pace for their best day since March as investors shrug off the Trump administration's intention to end a special economic and trading relationship with the Asian financial hub. There are also signs in the region that China's economy is continuing to recover from the worst of the coronavirus pandemic --- though activity elsewhere in Asia remains grim. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose more than 3%. It was the first opportunity investors there had to react to US President Donald Trump's announcement last week that Washington would "begin the process of eliminating policy exemptions that give Hong Kong different and special treatment" from mainland China. Trump's response marked an escalation in tensions between the United States and China --- the President blasted Beijing for approving a national security law that fundamentally undermines Hong Kong's autonomy.Experts have pointed out, though, that Trump stopped short of taking immediate action. Even if he does follow through, analysts say ending Hong Kong's special status will have little immediate impact because the territory does not export a lot of goods to the United States. Trump's comments were "long on criticism of China but short on action," wrote Stephen Innes, chief global markets strategist at AxiCorp, in a research note Monday.Hong Kong's financial secretary, Paul Chan, also said that the US announcement will have limited impact on the city, and reassured investors that there are no plans to change the local currency's peg to the US dollar. Since 2005, the Hong Kong dollar has been allowed to trade between 7.75 and 7.85 to the US dollar."Hong Kong's foreign exchange reserves are quite ample, with assets exceeding $440 billion ... providing the strongest support for the Hong Kong dollar," Chan wrote in a blog post on Sunday. Other major indexes in Asia were also higher Monday. South Korea's Kospi rose nearly 1.8%, Japan's Nikkei 225 climbed 0.8% and China's Shanghai Composite Index was up 2.2%. Stocks in Europe opened higher, with London's FTSE 100 and Paris' CAC 40 both gaining roughly 1.5%.US stock futures were muted despite continued protests in cities across the country over police brutality. Dow futures were up 0.5%, while Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures posted smaller gains. "Re-opening optimism reigns supreme," Innes wrote. China's recoveryFresh data out of China indicates factories there are starting to recover from the pandemic.Manufacturing activity in the country unexpectedly rose last month, according to a closely watched private survey. The media group Caixin said on Monday that China's manufacturing purchasing managers index increased to 50.7 in May, up from April's 49.4. It also beat the 49.6 that analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected. A number above the 50-point level indicates growth. "Manufacturing production recovered faster than demand as the domestic economy recovered from the epidemic," wrote Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, in a statement that accompanied the Caixin data. Wang added, however, that exports remain sluggish as the rest of the world continues to grapple with the virus. Over the weekend, the Chinese government also reported that its official manufacturing PMI grew in May. The official non-manufacturing PMI survey, which measures the services sector, also indicated expansion --- another suggestion that domestic economic activity is recovering, according to Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at Oanda. South Korea and Taiwan, though, saw manufacturing production shrink in May. And while output in the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand improved as lockdowns eased, PMIs for those Southeast Asian countries still indicated contraction instead of growth, according to Alex Holmes, Asia economist for Capital Economics."The bigger picture remains the same --- the region's manufacturing sector is in a deep recession," Holmes wrote in a note on Monday. "Output is still likely to be well below normal levels for many months to come as domestic and global demand remain very depressed."TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Heritage Foundation Report: 'Cybersecurity - Understanding Hacks and Reducing Vulnerabilities'Targeted News ServiceJuly 24, 2020 Friday 8:47 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4970 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Heritage Foundation issued the following report entitled "Cybersecurity - Understanding Hacks and Reducing Vulnerabilities" by Klon Kitchen, director of the Center for Technology Policy of the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy, and James Di Pane, research associate in the Center for National Defense of the Davis Institute:SUMMARYCybersecurity is all about ensuring that data and networks remain secure from malicious cyber activity by unauthorized users who seek to either steal data or cause harm to systems. This activity is known as hacking. Hacks usually begin with some type of vulnerability that can be exploited. There are a number of vulnerabilities that go beyond the technical capabilities of systems that leave systems vulnerable to hacking. Poor cyber hygiene and bad practices can compromise an otherwise secure system. Understanding these vulnerabilities and the nature of the cyber threat can help policymakers, organizations, and individuals alike achieve better cybersecurity.KEY TAKEAWAYS1. Cybersecurity threats are real and tangible, with significant costs for governments, businesses and individuals, and they show no sign of receding.2. Policymakers and other leaders do not need exhaustive cyber expertise, but they must know enough to make strategic risk and response decisions.3. Cybersecurity is a posture that must be established and maintained, and both policymakers and individual citizens can take clear steps to adopt it.One cannot mitigate a threat one does not understand. This is especially true in cybersecurity. Policymakers and other leaders do not need exhaustive cyber expertise; but they must know enough to make strategic risk-and-response decisions.It is common for many information-security incidents to be called a "hack." But not all data losses are a result of someone engaging in "hacking" or of a system being "hacked." Instead, there are a host of cybersecurity threats that do not stem from hacks and are the result of other data-security vulnerabilities. Hacking is a real threat, however, that demands serious policymaker attention.Hacking also does not simply happen. A hack starts with some kind of vulnerability, either technical or from bad cyber hygiene, which is then exploited by a bad actor. Reducing these vulnerabilities would have a tangible effect on the frequency and severity of hacks. Improving supply-chain security, blocking attempts to create backdoors in software, and reducing vulnerabilities through use of good social media hygiene, password managers, and cybersecurity software can all help to reduce the number and severity of hacking attacks.View textbox at https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/2020-07/BG3512.pdfContext: Why This MattersThe effects of cyberattacks are real and tangible across a broad spectrum. They have significant costs for governments, businesses, and individuals. And, there is no sign of the threat of attacks receding. Cybercrime could cost the global economy $6 trillion in 2021 according to Cybersecurity Ventures.1Herjavec Group, "2019 Official Annual Cybercrime Report: Cybercriminal Activity Is One of the Biggest Challenges that Humanity Will Face in the Next Two Decades," 2019, https://www.herjavecgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/CV-HG-2019-Official-Annual-Cybercrime-Report.pdf (accessed May 12, 2019).The five most attacked industries have remained consistent over the years: (1) health care, (2) manufacturing, (3) financial services, (4) government, and (5) transportation, not necessarily in that order. Ransomware attacks alone were predicted to cost the global economy $11.5 billion in 2019 and are currently projected to cost the global economy $20 billion in 2021, with an estimated ransomware attack every 11 seconds.2The global COVID-19 crisis has increased the cyber threat further as more people telework and cyber criminals use click-bait to entice people to open corrupted files by couching them as information about the coronavirus. In fact, the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is warning that state-backed and criminal cyber actors are using the COVID-19 crisis as cover for a broad range of phishing and other attacks, resulting in as much as a 37 percent increase in attempted cyberattacks in April alone.3Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, "Alert (AA20-099A): COVID-19 Exploited by Malicious Cyber Actors," April 8, 2020, https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-099a (accessed July 8, 2020), and Phil Muncaster, "Cyber-Attacks Up 37% Over Past Month as #COVID19 Bites," Info Security Group, https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/cyberattacks-up-37-over-past-month/ (accessed May 12, 2020).What Is Cybersecurity?Cybersecurity is about protecting computers, networks, and the data stored on them from malicious activity by unauthorized users. While the challenges of securing the intellectual property of a major defense contractor are different in degree from protecting the data on a personal smartphone, the premise is the same. It is about ensuring that only the right people have access, the data stays the way it was entered, and the legitimate users can access their system when they want to. Put another way, the three primary aspects of computer and network security are confidentiality, integrity, and availability.4Ira Winkler and Araceli Treu Gomes, Advanced Persistent Security: A Cyberwarfare Approach to Implementing Adaptive Enterprise Detection, Protection and Reaction Strategies (Cambridge, MA: Syngress Publishing, 2017), p. 16.Confidentiality is about limiting network access to specific users in order to keep the data private. The network and the data stored on it should be limited to those who need to access it.5This is especially true when it comes to intellectual property, personal information, and other important information that people want to protect from outsiders. Medical records are a great example, as they are important to both the hospitals and the patients and contain a great deal of personal information. Maintaining confidentiality means that only health care providers and the individual patients see those records.Integrity means protecting the data from being manipulated or tampered with by an unauthorized person. (This does not prevent data from being entered inaccurately or mishandled by an authorized user.)6A nurse or doctor mistakenly mislabeling a chart is sloppy data management. Someone changing medical records to create chaos for a hospital or to harm a patient is a security threat.Availability means that authorized users have no trouble accessing the data they need. (While technical problems can and do occur, sometimes preventing legitimate data access, such problems require technical fixes to the network and computers themselves.) If an unauthorized person manipulates the network to prevent legitimate users from accessing their system or the data stored on it, that is a cyberattack. A hospital suffering from a ransomware attack that is unable to access its records without paying a large sum to a cyber-criminal would be an example of an attack on the availability of a system or data.A compromise of any of these three aspects would result in damage to the network or the legitimate users of the network. Thus, cybersecurity is all about ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of a computer network and its data.What Is a "Hack"?A hack is "gaining unauthorized access to a system or the data stored on the system."7There are many ways this can be done, but at its core, it begins with a vulnerability in the system that allows a hacker access to information that should be secure. What is done with that access depends on the hacker and his or her motivation and technical competence. The two primary actions of hackers are computer network attacks and computer network exploitations.There are many things that get mistaken for hacks or treated like the same thing. A data leak, for example, occurs when confidential data is exposed through poor network management. In that case, data that should be confidential can leak onto public networks or can be accessed by unauthorized people.Issues with data can also be caused by user error or poor data hygiene practices during entry or management. These can create problems with real consequences, but they are not hacks or cybercrime. They are caused by the management of the data or network itself.Attack or Exploitation? Important DifferencesThe main difference between a computer network attack and a computer network exploitation is that the first affects the functionality of the network, while the latter compromises the confidentiality. One causes disruption and the other steals information.Computer network attacks--cyberattacks--are "deliberate actions to alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade or destroy computer systems or networks or the information and/or programs resident in or transiting these systems or network."8These cause damage or confusion and disrupt the regular functioning of an individual computer or entire network to achieve a desired end.A computer network exploitation (CNE) is "the attack on the confidentiality of the targeted computer system. CNE is the theft of the data, with no other functions affected."9The goal of an exploitation is usually to steal data or gain intelligence on the compromised system for a future attack.Four Types of Vulnerabilities Enable HackingHacks begin when a bad actor finds a vulnerability in a network. The hacker exploits that vulnerability to gain access to the network and its data. While perfect defense is impossible and vulnerabilities are inevitable, many of them are easily avoidable with proper cyber hygiene and awareness.Non-cyber practices can also create cyber vulnerabilities, as people are often the weakest link in the cyber defense chain. There are four primary types of vulnerabilities that hackers can leverage to compromise a network: (1) operational, (2) personnel, (3) physical, and (4) technical.1. Operational Vulnerabilities. Operational vulnerabilities basically arise from how data is stored, accessed, and used. They come from the practices used for handling data and access to data, and are one of the most common types of vulnerabilities that hackers exploit. In some cases, these can stem from poor governance, or lack of procedures for ensuring that technical security controls are well organized and maintained.10 Poor security awareness among personnel, falling for phishing e-mails, for example, is another aspect of this type of vulnerability, and this lack of knowledge about threats or proper security procedures can create a weakness in the human factor of the system.11 Re-using the same password for all bank, e-mail, and social media accounts is also an example of this.Sensitive information posted on a company's website, or too much personal information posted to social media, can also create vulnerabilities by providing potential hackers with intelligence about an organization or individual they are looking to target. That security question about which middle school a person attended is most likely available on his social media account. This concept also flows into broader personnel vulnerabilities.2. Personnel Vulnerabilities. Personnel vulnerabilities are linked to how organizations manage their employees--from hiring and training to maintaining them. Ensuring that job candidates are trustworthy, either through a background check or other process is only the first step in ensuring that the candidates do not become a security risk. Ensuring that they receive the proper security training is also a component. The broader piece to personnel security has to do with keeping employees motivated to not become security threats themselves. This gets at the heart of the insider threat. A disgruntled employee may seek to damage his or her organization, either through stealing from the company directly or enabling others to steal. The threat could also come in the form of them turning a blind eye to others' poor practices, stealing, or compromising networks. Organizations should be aware that disgruntled employees could be a cybersecurity risk, and should make the effort to reduce their number.123. Physical Vulnerabilities. Security guards who are not trained in what to look for, or who do not focus on potential security risks, can lead to a physical security issue, but often it is even simpler. Poor access controls and inadequate locking mechanisms can allow unauthorized access to sensitive areas of buildings, such as server rooms.4. Technical Vulnerabilities. Technical vulnerabilities stem from weaknesses in the design, configuration, or maintenance of technology that allow unauthorized activity.13 This is the type of vulnerability that can allow for a "zero-day" incident, a previously unknown vulnerability in software being immediately exploited. In some cases, hackers can continue to find vulnerabilities even after the software is updated and patched.14 Zero Day hacks represent a relatively small percentage of hacks, but they are dangerous because they can compromise an otherwise secure network.How a Hack Takes Place--the Cyber Kill ChainDeveloped by Lockheed Martin, the Cyber Kill Chain provides a framework for thinking about the various stages of a hack.15 The stages themselves are reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control, and actions on objectives. Depending on the sophistication of the hacker or hacking organization, and the relative strength of the defender, some of these phases may be longer than others. For example, an advanced hacking group may spend months in the reconnaissance phase looking for a vulnerability, while a criminal may happen upon a vulnerability through a phishing e-mail that someone clicks.Reconnaissance. Reconnaissance encompasses everything from selecting a target to identifying vulnerabilities. It involves target research, identification, and selection.16 This is where the hacker identifies which computer, network, or data set is of interest, and begins collecting information to identify vulnerabilities. Since many organizations and individuals are not careful about what they post online, much information is often readily available. Social media, company websites, and other available information can be scoured to glean useful information. Advanced hackers often do extensive research on their targets, and are looking for something very specific.Weaponization. The hacker then needs a payload (a piece of code) that will provide the desired access to the system.17 Depending on the sophistication of the hacker, he will acquire this code by purchasing existing code online or writing his own.Delivery. Once acquired or developed, the weaponized payload must be delivered to the target. The delivery stage is the actual transmission or infection of the weaponized payload to the targeted environment.18 Phishing e-mails are common delivery mechanisms, as are payloads imported to networks using USB ports. Insider threats are also especially dangerous as delivery points due to employees' knowledge of, and access to, the system. Any network connected to the Internet is vulnerable to a hacker via the Web.Exploitation. Exploitation is the "activation of the exploit payload."19 The delivered malware activates within the targeted system. This is the beginning of the actual compromise.Installation. Once the hacker has delivered and activated the payload, the malware is installed on the target. Installation of malware enables the hacker to access the victim's system remotely, and opens the door for continued access and control of the malware within the system.20Command and Control (C2). Once the malware has been installed on the target, the hacker establishes the ability to communicate with and control the compromise. C2 is the "establishment of outbound communications from a victim system for secure communications between victim and adversary systems."21 This is important in order for the hacker to be able to work within the system.Actions on Objectives. The hacker now either conducts a computer network attack or computer network exploitation. This final phase is when the actual effects of the compromise occur; it is when the "adversaries accomplish target objectives,"22 such as stealing data or disrupting the system and engaging in a ransomware attack.Hackers: Spies, Criminals, and TerroristsThe main categories of hackers are insider threats, criminals, hacktivists, terrorists, advanced persistent threats (APTs), and state actors. However, the lines between them are often blurred, and hackers themselves will shift between them. This is part of the challenge of identifying these groups and their motivations. This spectrum represents everything from the individual amateur to the organized team of professionals, and all can compromise computer networks and the data stored on them.Insider Threats. Insider threats stem from employees of an organization that abuse the credentials and access to a network, either by accessing data for which they are not authorized or by providing access to unauthorized users. The unique danger of an insider threat is that employees are well positioned to cause damage because they already have some permission for accessing the network, and may even have administrator access and intimate knowledge of the security measures, the data stored on the network, and possible vulnerabilities.Criminals. A criminal hacker is an "unauthorized person attempting to compromise the security of a computer network for criminal purposes."23 The sophistication of criminal hackers varies widely, but most are opportunistic and look for whatever vulnerabilities and information that present themselves. The more sophisticated the criminal, the more focused his search may be; he may share the modus operandi of advanced persistent threats, some of which are criminal enterprises linked to nation-states.These organized crime threats have vast resources, and the scope of their hacking is hundreds of millions of dollars.Hacktivists. So-called hacktivists hack computers for political purposes.24 A good example of a hacktivist organization is Anonymous, a decentralized group that has launched attacks on several governments, religious institutions, and corporations.25 Like with criminal hackers, there is a wide variety of skill and resource levels among hacktivists, but the big difference is the goal and outcome. Whereas criminal hackers tend to seek quick monetary gain, hacktivists often seek the maximum damage for the targeted individual or organization.Terrorists. Terrorist hackers use "fear, uncertainty and doubt to achieve a political goal."26 Although they have not posed a significant threat to date, cyberattacks can create a great deal of fear and uncertainty, and thus the potential for terrorist activity is ever present.Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). APTs are essentially organized crime groups that sometimes work directly for state governments. For the U.S., APTs are often associated with hostile countries, such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.27 They are very well organized and have advanced hacking capabilities. As the term implies, they also tend to be persistent against the targets they choose. They often specialize in a target set and work diligently to collect intelligence and find vulnerabilities. If the cybersecurity team can block an attempted compromise, they fight to maintain their access to the network. A good example is APT41, a China-affiliated hacking organization that conducts financially motivated cybercrime against a range of industries, while also acting in tandem with Chinese government objectives.28 These two mission sets are often closely related, adding to the murkiness of discerning APT activity from the states with which they are affiliated.State Actors. States are the most sophisticated cyber hackers given the resources at their disposal, including intelligence and military services. The four state actors that are the most active hackers are China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. China has highly sophisticated cyber forces that target military and commercial intellectual property as a part of the regime's strategy to steal Western technology to bolster its economy. Russia also has advanced cyber capabilities that it uses to enact influence campaigns against the U.S. and other Western countries. Russia also carries out cyberattacks on critical infrastructure of countries in its region, such as the three Baltic states and Ukraine. Iran has sophisticated cyber tools that outweigh its geopolitical weight and are a part of its arsenal of asymmetric tools that include proxy terrorist organizations and cruise missiles.Recommendations for U.S. PolicymakersCybersecurity is not a one-time investment or act. It is a posture and a capacity that must be established and maintained. In order to move the United States closer to this posture, policymakers should:* Use all tools of national power to enhance cyber deterrence.Cyber deterrence goes beyond cyberspace. Strengthening cyber defenses and retaliating in cyberspace are important aspects of deterrence, but there are many other ways the U.S. can exert pressure and impose costs on cyber adversaries. Some of these are: diplomatic action, cooperation reduction, visa restriction, financial sanctions, legal action, and military action. A consistent pattern of imposing meaningful costs for malicious cyber behavior will strengthen our cyber deterrence if applied consistently, and in some cases, publicly.* Make threat intelligence sharing a two-way street between the government and industry. The U.S. government should be more proactive in sharing threat intelligence with industry, allowing better and more informed decisions to be made in the private sector.Over-classification of threat intelligence hinders industry's ability to prevent national security threats with its technology. Prudence should be used in deciding which information to share with industry, but threat intelligence should not be a one-way street of only industry sharing with the government. This type of intelligence can be shared without the risk of compromising sources and methods, as the threat and warning intelligence would just highlight practices and methods of adversaries. This would not compromise how that intelligence was collected, nor would it affect U.S. capabilities.* Minimize vulnerabilities by not allowing "backdoors" and enhancing supply-chain security. Any foreign technology that creates vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure ("backdoors") to U.S. data should be blocked. Such a move will put significant pressure on China and others for their poor security practices, as well as incrementally improving the safety of hardware and software supply chains into the U.S. by increasing domestic security research. The U.S. should also encourage its Five Eyes partners--Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom--to adopt a similar approach and practices.* Block investment from untrusted companies in key sectors of the American economy. Foreign companies with a history of producing hardware or software with known vulnerabilities should be blocked from U.S. investments by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Such an effort would assist in managing the problem of Chinese investment in, or purchase of, American start-ups that are eager to obtain capital and willing to accept poor security practices to do so.* Encourage the private development of cybersecurity supply-chain ratings and accreditation. Such a framework would contain different tiers or ratings for different levels of accreditation, ranging from minimal overview of a company's supply chain to in-depth analysis of specific products' supply-chain features. These different levels of accreditation will provide consumers with more information, with which they can make better, risk-based decisions.Additionally, producers will find such accreditation valuable for selling their products, thus connecting security and a profit incentive. Instead of mandating cybersecurity solutions, the U.S. government should collaborate with the private sector. A specific way to encourage the adoption of this system would be to require government agencies that deal with large amounts of sensitive data, or have security-related duties, to purchase technology only from organizations that are accredited by this cyber-supply-chain ratings system. The Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) established by theDepartment of Defense is a good example of such a program on the government side, and would require contractors to obtain certification on cybersecurity practices as part of acquiring contracts with the Defense Department.Recommendations for U.S. CitizensIndividual citizens should adopt basic cyber hygiene practices to protect themselves and their fellow citizens from hacking and other cybersecurity threats. Americans should:* Move their information to the cloud and automate software updates. Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and other cloud storage providers spend hundreds of millions of dollars every year to protect their users from cybercriminals. Americans should take advantage of their efforts by moving their most important information to cloud storage (and never forgetting to back up the information in the cloud). Microsoft, Apple, and others also have settings that will allow users to automatically apply software updates as they are released. Those who use devices provided by their employer should check with their IT departments about getting updates installed as soon as possible.* Use two-factor authentication (2FA). 2FA is an additional layer of security that requires a user to provide not just username and password, but also another verification of identity before access is granted. This second verification can be the answer to a "secret question," a hardware token that verifies user identity, a smartphone, credit card number, or a fingerprint, face scan, or "voice print." Americans should enable 2FA on every device they have. 2FA can be cumbersome to set up, but not nearly as painful as recovering from identity theft or other cyberattack consequences.* Use a password manager. Apps, such as 1Password, LastPass, and Zoho Vault, encrypt and store passwords, generate strong passwords, and allow the user access to all passwords across all devices. It is best to stay away from apps and password managers that do not use strong encryption, or that are developed by foreign companies--especially Russian and Chinese.* Clean up their online life. Everyone should adjust their browser's security and privacy settings for increased protection. People must also remember to never open suspicious e-mails, download attachments from suspicious e-mails, or click links in suspicious e-mails. E-mails from unknown senders should not be opened. Banks and other service providers will not request sensitive information, such as birth dates and Social Security numbers, via e-mail--a clear tip-off.* Rely on professional antivirus products. Computer owners should purchase an antivirus product that offers automatic updates. Bitdefender, F-Secure, and ESET all offer reliable products, as do many others. Like with password managers, it is best to buy American when purchasing virus protection.* * *Endnotes1.

U.S. Banning TikTok Would Affect Tens of Millions of AmericansNewsweek.comJuly 7, 2020 Tuesday 5:27 AM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 598 wordsByline: Jason MurdockHighlight: In the first quarter of this year, TikTok enjoyed 165 million installs by U.S. users via the App Store and Google Play Store.BodyA U.S. ban of social media app TikTok could impact millions of American users, with the platform having surged in popularity in recent months.Political pressure mounted on the Chinese-owned app this week after secretary of state Mike Pompeo suggested it could be outlawed in the U.S. over national data security concerns, similar to action previously against tech firms Huawei and ZTE.TikTok, which is focused on short form video content, is owned by a company based in Beijing called ByteDance, although the version in China is known as Douyin. Since May, TikTok has been led by former Disney streaming executive Kevin Mayer.It denies sharing U.S. user data with the Chinese government, a fear repeatedly voiced by politicians in recent years, especially as the app's downloads spiked.In the first quarter of this year, TikTok enjoyed 165 million installs by U.S. users via the App Store and Google Play Store, according to analysis from Sensor Tower.In that period, TikTok reportedly had the "the most downloads for any app ever" in a quarter, attracting more than 315 million installs globally, analytics suggested."While TikTok was on the ascent before 2020, the app has hit new levels of popularity so far this year. Its record-breaking Q1 came during a global pandemic, leading in part to an increase in downloads, engagement, and revenue," the firm said in April.How many daily active users TikTok has remains unclear, and downloads or installs are not an indicator of how many U.S. users log on or upload daily. AdAge reported in 2019, citing a leaked pitch desk, the app had 30 million daily active users in the States.The company has not released statistics about such metrics. A TikTok spokesperson told Newsweek: "We don't provide any data on user numbers at all."In comments during "The Ingraham Angle" on Monday, Pompeo confirmed the U.S. was "looking at" TikTok, saying the administration was concerned about security."We have worked on this very issue for a long time, whether it's the problem of having Huawei technology in your infrastructure... we had declared ZTE a danger to American national security. We have done all of these things," he told the Fox host. "I don't want to get out in front of the president but it's something we are looking at."When asked if U.S. citizens should download and use TikTok, Pompeo said: "Only if you want your private information in the the hands of the Chinese Communist Party." His comments came after India banned TikTok and other apps over security concerns.In response to the secretary of state's comments, a TikTok spokesperson told CNN in a statement: "TikTok is led by an American CEO, with hundreds of employees and key leaders across safety, security, product, and public policy here in the U.S. We have no higher priority than promoting a safe and secure app experience for our users. We have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked." Similar assurances were released after criticism in November 2019.At the time, senators Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) and Chuck Schumer (D-New York) had requested an assessment of the national security risks of the application."We store all TikTok U.S. user data in the United States, with backup redundancy in Singapore. Our data centers are located entirely outside of China, and none of our data is subject to Chinese law," TikTok said in a blog post published online.TikTok, like U.S. firms including Google, Facebook and Twitter, said this week it would halt app operations in Hong Hong in response to a controversial new security law.Link to ImageGraphic TikTokMANJUNATH KIRAN/AFP/GettyAn Indian mobile user browses through the Chinese owned video-sharing 'Tik Tok' app on a smartphone in Bangalore on June 30, 2020.Load-Date: July 7, 2020End of Document

Other countries, according to information, are considering similar measures.Fox News presenter Laura Ingraham asked the Secretary of State if her cabinet contemplates blocking apps, "especially TikTok." The administration of the country's president, Donald Trump, "is taking this very seriously; we're actually considering it.'Pompeo said that, for "a long time," the United States has worked on the "problems" of Chinese technology and was "making real progress."A few hours earlier, the head of American diplomacy lashed out at China's "Orwellians" steps toward censorship of Hong Kong activists, schools, and libraries based on a new security law.Authorities in that financial center ordered schools to remove books for review under the new law, which criminalizes opinions such as calls for independence or autonomy.Some bookstores in Hong Kong announced that they were withdrawing titles from pro-democracy activists."The Chinese Communist Party (PCC) continues the destruction of free Hong Kong," Pompeo said.Under "the repressive national security law, local authorities - in an Orwellian step - now established a national central government office, began removing CCP-critical books from shelves, banning political slogans, and requiring schools to apply censorship," he said.The secretary of state who are "assaults on the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong"."Until now Hong Kong prospered because freedom of expression and thought was allowed under independent rules of law," he said.Beijing faces a barraes of criticism, especially from Western nations, for imposing a security law that punishes acts of subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign countries in Hong Kong.«Treason»US Vice President Mike Pence told CNBC last week that the act was a "betrayal" and is "unacceptable to freedom lovers around the world."Last week, Congress passed tough new sanctions on banks in that financial center.The resolution includes punishments on banks conducting "significant transactions" with those violated of Hong Kong's autonomy.The validity of that Congressional resolution will begin when President Donald Trump signs it.The post U.S. considers banning Chinese applications like TikTok appeared first on The Fourth.Load-Date: July 8, 2020End of Document
